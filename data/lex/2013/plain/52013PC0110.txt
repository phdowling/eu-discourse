The request was lodged on 15 May 2012 by Euroalliages (Liaison Committee of the Ferro-Alloy Industry) ('the applicant') on behalf of producers representing 100% of the Union production of silicon. On 5 July 2012, the Commission, by Regulation (EU) No 596/2012, initiated an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 467/2010 on imports of silicon originating in the People's Republic of China by imports consigned from Tawain, whether declared as originating in Taiwan or not. The Commission had at its disposal sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of silicon were being circumvented by means of transhipment via Taiwan. The attached proposal for a Council Implementing Regulation is based on the findings of the investigation, which has confirmed that transhipment of Chinese-origin silicon was taking place via Taiwan and that all other criteria for the establishment of circumvention as set out in Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation are met. It is therefore proposed to extend the anti-dumping measures in force on silicon originating in the PRC to imports of the same product consigned from Taiwan. The duty corresponds to the country-wide duty on imports of silicon from the PRC (19%). The duty shall be levied from the date of initiation of the investigation. Three Taiwanese companies came forward following the initiation, with a request for exemption from the possible extension of the measures as genuine producers in the Taiwan. It is proposed not to grant exemption to any of them. The exemption request of the three companies was rejected as during the investigation it was found that they were not producers of the product concerned. The relevant Council Regulation should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union no later than 5 April 2013. \n Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community and in particular Article 13 thereof. \n Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n Indication of how the financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimised and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n Choice of instruments \n Proposed instruments: Regulation. \n Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The above-mentioned basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the\nUnion budget.\n2013/0066 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nextending the definitive anti-dumping duty\nimposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 467/2010 on imports of\nsilicon originating in the People's Republic of China to imports of silicon\nconsigned from Taiwan, whether declared as originating in Taiwan or not\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[1]\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Article 13 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission ('the Commission') after having consulted the Advisory\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing measures\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\nRegulation (EU) No 467/2010[2] ('the original Regulation') the Council imposed a definitive\nanti-dumping duty of 19% on imports of silicon originating in the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (\u2018the PRC\u2019) for all other companies than the one mentioned in\nArticle 1(2) of that Regulation, following the expiry review and a partial\ninterim review of the measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 398/2004[3]. The original Regulation also maintained the duty which was\nextended by virtue of Council Regulation (EC) No 42/2007[4] to\nimports of silicon consigned from the Republic of Korea whether declared as\noriginating in the Republic of Korea or not. The measures imposed by the\noriginal Regulation will hereinafter be referred to as 'the measures in force'\nor 'original measures' and the investigation that led to the measures imposed by\nthe original Regulation will be hereinafter referred to as 'the original\ninvestigation'\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Request\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 May 2012, the\nCommission has received a request pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(3) of the\nbasic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the anti-dumping\nmeasures imposed on imports of silicon originating in the People's Republic of\nChina and to make imports of silicon consigned from Taiwan, whether declared as\noriginating in Taiwan or not, subject to registration.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request was lodged by\nEuroalliages (Liaison Committee of the Ferro-Alloy Industry) ('the applicant')\non behalf of producers representing 100% of the Union production of silicon.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\napplicant argued that there is no genuine production of silicon in Taiwan and the\nrequest contained sufficient prima facie evidence that following the\nimposition of the measures in force, a significant change in the pattern of\ntrade involving exports from the PRC and Taiwan to the Union occurred, for\nwhich there was no sufficient due cause or justification other than the\nimposition of the measures in force. This change stemmed allegedly from the\ntranshipment of silicon originating in the PRC via Taiwan to the Union.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the evidence\npointed to the fact that the remedial effects of the measures in force were\nbeing undermined both in terms of quantity and price. The evidence showed that\nthese increased imports from Taiwan were made at prices below the non-injurious\nprice established in the original investigation. Finally, there was evidence\nthat the prices of silicon consigned from Taiwan were dumped in relation to the\nnormal value previously established for the product concerned during the\noriginal investigation.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined, after\nconsulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient prima facie evidence\nexisted for the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Articles 13(3) and\n14(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission initiated an investigation by\nCommission Regulation (EU) No 596/2012[5] (\u2018the\ninitiating Regulation\u2019) of the possible circumvention of the anti-dumping\nmeasures imposed on imports of silicon originating in the PRC and also directed\nthe custom authorities to register imports of silicon consigned from Taiwan,\nwhether declared as originating in Taiwan, or not.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the authorities of the PRC and Taiwan, the exporting producers in these\ncountries, the importers in the Union known to be concerned and the Union\nindustry of the initiation of the investigation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exemption forms were sent\nto the producers/exporters in Taiwan known to the Commission and through the Mission of the country concerned to the European Union. Questionnaires were sent to the\nproducers/exporters in the PRC known to the Commission and through the Mission of the PRC to the European Union. Questionnaires were also sent to the known\nimporters in the Union.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties were\ngiven the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a\nhearing within the time limit set in the initiating Regulation. All parties were informed that non-cooperation\nmight lead to the application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation and to\nfindings being based on the facts available.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three Taiwanese\nproducers/exporters, belonging to one group, and three unrelated importers in\nthe Union made themselves known and submitted replies to the exemption forms\nand to the questionnaires, respectively.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission carried out\nverification visits at the premises of the three following related companies\npart of the Group refferred to above in recital (10):\n- Asia Metallurgical Co. Ltd. (Taiwan)\n- Latitude Co. Ltd. (Taiwan)\n- YLB Co. Ltd. (Taiwan) \n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reporting period and\ninvestigation period\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation period\ncovered the period from 1 January 2008 to 30 June 2012 (\u2018the IP\u2019). Data were\ncollected for the IP to investigate, inter alia, the alleged change in the\npattern of trade. More detailed data were collected for the reporting period\nfrom 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 (\u2018the RP\u2019) in order to examine the possible\nundermining of the remedial effect of the measures in force and existence of\ndumping.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF THE\nINVESTIGATION\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General considerations\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n13(1) of the basic Regulation, the assessment of the existence of circumvention\nwas made by analysing successively whether there was a change in the pattern of\ntrade between the PRC, Taiwan and the Union; if this change stemmed from a\npractice, process or work for which there was insufficient due cause or\neconomic justification other than the imposition of the duty; if there was\nevidence of injury or that the remedial effects of the duty were being\nundermined in terms of the prices and/or quantities of the product under\ninvestigation; and whether there was evidence of dumping in relation to the\nnormal values previously established for the product concerned in the original\ninvestigation, if necessary in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of\nthe basic Regulation.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product concerned and\nproduct under investigation\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned by\nthe possible circumvention is silicon metal, originating in the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China, currently falling within CN code 2804 69 00 (silicon content\nless than 99, 99% by weight) (\u2018the product concerned\u2019). Purely by reason of the\ncurrent classification set out in the Combined Nomenclature, it should be read\n\"silicon\". Silicon with a higher purity, that is containing by weight\nnot less than 99, 99% of silicon, used mostly in the electronic\nsemi-conductor industry, falls under a different CN code and is not covered by\nthis proceeding.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product under\ninvestigation is the same as that defined above, but consigned from Taiwan,\nwhether declared as originating in Taiwan or not, currently falling within the\nsame CN code as the product concerned ('the product under investigation\u2019).\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat silicon, as defined above, exported from the PRC to the Union and silicon\nconsigned from Taiwan to the Union has the same basic physical and technical\ncharacteristics and has the same use, and is therefore to be considered as like\nproducts within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Findings\n2.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Level of cooperation\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in recital (10)\nabove, only three Taiwanese companies belonging to the same group of companies\nsubmitted an exemption form reply. A comparison of their exports into the Union\nto the Eurostat import data, showed that the cooperating companies were\nrepresenting 65% of the Taiwanse exports of the product under investigation to\nthe Union in the RP.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was no cooperation\nfrom the exporting producers of silicon in the PRC. Therefore, findings in\nrespect of imports of silicon from the PRC into the Union and exports from the\nPRC into Taiwan had to be made on the basis of data from Eurostat import data,\nTaiwanese import statistics and data gathered from the cooperating Taiwanese\ncompanies.\n2.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change in the pattern of\ntrade \nImports of silicon into the Union\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table 1 shows imports of\nsilicon from the PRC and Taiwan into the Union between 2004 and the end of the\nRP.\n   || 2004 || 2005 || 2006 || 2007 || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RP \n PRC || 1 268 || 27 635 || 1 435 || 9 671 || 5 353 || 6 669 || 11 448 || 13 312 || 5 488 \n Taiwan || 0 || 2.7 || 0.2 || 340 || 3 381 || 5 199 || 11 042 || 5 367 || 2 707 \nSource : Eurostat\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The data from Eurostat\nclearly show that there were no imports from Taiwan into the Union at all in\n2004. They went up with more than 300% in 2008 and remained very high. The\nimports doubled again in 2010, following the imposition of new measures against\nthe PRC.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2011, the imports into\nthe Union from Taiwan decreased. This development may be attributable to an\nanti-fraud investigation which was launched by OLAF around that time. The\nCommission was informed that the Taiwanese issuing authority, the Bureau of\nForeign Trade of Taiwan (BOFT) withdrew the certificates of origin of silicon from\nall Taiwanese producers in 2011. This decision to withdraw the certificates was\nappealed by the three Taiwanese exporters referred to in recitals (10) and (11)\nabove (Group of exporters). The board of appeal quashed the decision of the\nBOFT, and the certificates in question were re-issued to these three Taiwanese\nproducers/exporters, but not to the other Taiwanese producers. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this context, the\nCommission also observes that the presentation of a non-preferential\ncertificate of origin is not required for the customs formalities at\nimportation into the EU and that in the event of serious doubt, such a\ncertificate cannot serve as proof of the non-preferential origin of the\ndeclared product (Article 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992\nestablishing the Community Customs Code[6]). \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The imports of silicon from\nthe PRC into the Union have been increasing since 2008. In particular, it is\nobserved that these imports are still increasing after the imposition of the\nmeasures in 2010. This development can be explained by the fact that the\nanti-dumping duty went down significantly in 2010, namely from 49% to 19%.\nExports of silicon from the PRC to Taiwan\n 2003 || 2004 || 2005 || 2006 || 2007 || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RP \n 16 530 || 16 600 || 7 101 || 10 514 || 3 675 || 15 893 || 16 007 || 17 912 || 9 177 || 10 507 \nSource : Chinese export statistics\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table 2 shows imports from\nthe PRC into Taiwan. The data from the Chinese exports database show that\nimports were at their highest in 2010 following the imposition of the original\nmeasures. The decrease in 2011 can be explained by the anti-fraud investigation\nas explained in recital (21).\nConclusion on the change in the pattern of\ntrade \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is considered that there\nis a change in the pattern of trade since there were no imports of silicon from\n Taiwan into the Union at all in 2004. They really started as from 2007 and\nbecame very important in 2008. They remain at a very high level up to the RP,\nwith a reduction in 2011 because of the possible reason which is explained\nabove in recital (21). \n2.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nature of the circumvention\npractice and insufficient due cause or economic justification\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 13(1) of the basic\nRegulation requires that the change in the pattern of trade stems from a\npractice, process or work for which there is insufficient due cause or economic\njustification other than the imposition of the duty. The practice, process or\nwork includes, inter alia, the consignment of the product subject to\nmeasures via third countries. The Commission takes the view that in the present\ncase, the change in the pattern of trade stems from the consignment of the\nproduct subject to measures via a third country.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission first of all notes that there is no production of silicon in Taiwan. None of the producers/exporters have\ndenied the fact that they import the silicon they export from the PRC.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, with the\nexception of the group of exporters referred to in recitals (10) and (11), the\nproducers/exporters have not provided any economic justification other than the\nimposition of the duty for their activity.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Group of exporters referred\nto in recitals (10) and (11) above alleged that they import silicon lumps of very\nlow quality in bags from the PRC. They pretend that the silicon lumps are then\ntumbled, crushed, sieved and packed in bags again before being exported to the\nUnion market. After that operation, they alleged that the product is of a\nhigher quality. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They\nclaim that this operation constitutes a unique purification method, developed\nin cooperation with the University of Taipei, which allegedly eliminates 80%\nof the impurities in the silicon metal lumps imported from the PRC.. During the\nonsite verification, it was \u00a0however observed that their process was a simple \u00a0tumbling,\nsieving and crushing operation which removes some surface impurities such as\noxidation and dust, but which did not remove in particular the main impurities\ninside the silicon lumps. The processed product thus kept the same physical and\ntechnical basic characteristics as the product concerned.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nevidence collected and verified during the investigation, in particular the\npurchase invoices, the sales invoices and the accompanying documents such as\nthe bill of lading, and other customs documents, showed that the products\npurchased and sold for export by the Group of exporters were in most cases of\nthe same specifications. The records relating to the stocks in the warehouses of\nthe Group, located close to harbours, also showed that there was not always\ntime to process all batches of silicon purchased in China with the method that they claimed to apply.\nFurthermore, the information available, in particular from producers in the\nUnion, show that in order to remove the inner impurities of the silicon lump,\neither a crushing followed by a chemical treatment or a melting process is\nnecessary. Neither of these processes has been used by the Group of exporters.\u00a0 \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also noteworthy that\nin 2010, acting upon a reference for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC\nfrom Finanzgericht D\u00fcsseldorf (Hoesch Metals and Alloys GmbH v. Hauptzollamt\nAachen), in a matter relating to the AD measures against silicon from China,\nthe European Court of Justice ruled: \"The separation, crushing and\npurification of silicon metal blocks and the subsequent sieving, sorting and\npackaging of the silicon grains resulting from the crushing, as carried out in\nthe main proceedings, do not constitute origin-conferring processing or working\nfor the purposes of Article 24 of the Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12\nOctober 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code.\" The\npurification process as carried out by the Group of exporters is considered to\nbe similar to the one as described in this ruling.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation also\nrevealed that the purification process amounts to less than 5% of the total\ncost of the Group. It was furthermore confirmed that the price of the silicon\nsold into the EU by the Group of exporters and the price of the silicon\npurchased in the PRC by the Group during the IP, never showed a difference of\nmore than 11%. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe light of these considerations, it is concluded that also for the Group of\nexporters the import from the PRC and the subsequent export to the EU of the\nSilicon is to be considered as a transshipment and thus circumvention in the\nsense of Article 13 of the Basic Regulation.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore concluded\nthat the investigation did not bring to light any other due cause or economic\njustification for the transhipment than the avoidance of the measures in force\non the product concerned, namely the 19% anti-dumping duty on the PRC. No\nelements were found, other than the duty, which could be considered as a compensation\nfor the costs of transhipment, in particular regarding transport and reloading,\nof silicon originating in the PRC via Taiwan.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n2.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evidence of dumping\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n13(1) of the basic Regulation it was examined whether there was evidence of\ndumping in relation to the normal value established in the original\ninvestigation.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the original Regulation,\nthe normal value was established on the basis of prices in Brasil, which in\nthat investigation was found to be an appropriate market economy analogue\ncountry for the PRC. In line with Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation it was\nconsidered appropriate to use the normal value as previously established in the\noriginal investigation. Two PCNs from the previous investigation matched with\nthe two PCNs of the exporting companies. Export prices were established in\naccordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, namely the prices\nactually paid or payable for export of the product under investigation into the\n Union.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of a fair\ncomparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance, in the\nform of adjustments, was made for differences which affect prices and price\ncomparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.\nAccordingly, adjustments were made to the export price for transport and\ninsurance in order to bring prices at the same level of trade. In accordance\nwith Articles 2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation, dumping was calculated\nby comparing the adjusted weighted average normal value as established in the\noriginal Regulation and the corresponding weighted average export prices of the\nTaiwanese import during this investigation\u2019s RP, expressed as a percentage of\nthe CIF price at the Union frontier duty unpaid.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the\nweighted average normal value and the weighted average export price as\nestablished in the investigation showed the existence of dumping.\n2.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Undermining the remedial\neffects of the anti-dumping duty in terms of prices and quantities\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the\ninjury elimination level as established in the original Regulation and the\nweighted average export price showed the existence of undercutting and\nunderselling. It was therefore concluded that the remedial effects of the\nmeasures in force are being undermined in terms of prices and quantities.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MEASURES\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the above, it was\nconcluded that the original mesure, namely the definitive anti-dumping duty\nimposed on imports of silicon originating in the PRC, was circumvented by transhipment\nvia Taiwan within the mening of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nfirst sentence of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation the measures in force\non imports of the product concerned are to be extended to imports of the\nproduct under investigation, i.e. the same product as the product concerned but\nconsigned from Taiwan, whether declared as originating in the Taiwan or not. \n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures established in\nArticle 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 467/2010 for \"all other companies\"\nfrom the PRC, should therefore be extended to imports from Taiwan. The level of duty should be set at 19% applicable to the net, free-at-Union-frontier price,\nbefore duty.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, which provide that any extended\nmeasure should apply to imports which entered the Union under registration\nimposed by the initiating Regulation, duties should be collected on those\nregistered imports of silicon consigned from Taiwan.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As explained in the recital\n(10), three companies located in Taiwan, belonging to one group, submitted\nexemption form responses requesting an exemption from the possible extended\nmeasures in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the findings\nwith regard to the change in the pattern of trade, the lack of real production\nin Taiwan and the export under the same customs code as set out in recitals\n(19) to (29), the exemptions as requested by these three companies could, in accordance\nwith Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, not be granted.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without prejudice to\nArticle 11(3) of the basic Regulation, the potential exporters/ producers in\nTaiwan which did not come forward in this proceeding and did not export the\nproduct under investigation during the IP, which intend to lodge a request for\nan exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty pursuant to Articles 11(4) and\n13(4) of the basic Regulation will be required to complete an exemption form in\norder to enable the Commission to assess such a request. Such exemption may be\ngranted after the assessment of the market situation, production capacity and\ncapacity utilisation, procurement and sales and the likelihood of continuation\nof practices for which there is insufficient due cause or economic\njustification and the evidence of dumping. The Commission would normally also\ncarry out an on-spot verification visit. Provided that the conditions set in\nArticles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic Regulation are met, an exemption may be\nwarranted.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where an exemption is\nwarranted, the Commission may, after consultation of the Advisory Committee,\nauthorise by decision, the exemption of imports from companies which do not\ncircumvent the anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EU) No 467/2010,\nfrom the duty extended by this regulation.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request should be\naddressed to the Commission, with all relevant information, in particular any\nmodification in the company's activities linked to the production and sales.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DISCLOSURE\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All interested\nparties were informed of the essential facts and considerations leading to the\nabove conclusions and were invited to comment. They were also granted a period\nto submit comments subsequent to that disclosure. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COMMENTS\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure,\ncomments were received from the Group of exporters and from two importers. \n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main argument concerned\nthe claim that the purification carried out by the Group of exporters referred\nto in recitals (10) and (11) was origin-conferring in the sense of Article 24\nof Regulation (EEC) Nr. No 2913/92. The importers presented a report concerning\nsample tests performed by the University of Taipei and an analysis report of an\nindependent expert. The report concerning sample test shows a percentage of slag\nreduction of 90.8% after the purification process. The analysis of the\nindependent expert claims that only after purification, the silicon can be used\nfor certain melting purposes.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is noted these two\nstudies are contradicted by the findings of the Commission during the on-site\nverification, as described above in recital (31). In particular, it is recalled\nthat according to the invoices, the products purchased and sold for export by\nthe Group of exporters were in most cases of the same specifications. \n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the claims made by the\nimporters were true, this should also result in a much higher difference\nbetween the price at which the silicon is imported from PRC and the price at\nwhich the silicon is exported to the EU.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the on-site inspection\nof the tools used for the alleged purification of the silicon, the Commission\nalso concludes that the tools are not such as to allow for any of the two\nmethods of purification described above in recital (31) at the end.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, the analysis\nreport of the independent expert also ignores the fact known to the Commission that\nthe users process their silicon before use.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For these reasons, the\ncomments submitted by the parties have not been able to alter the conclusions\nprovisionally reached by the Commission before disclosure. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1. The definitive anti-dumping duty\napplicable to \"all other companies\" imposed by Article 1(2) of\nRegulation (EU) No 467/2010 on imports of silicon currently falling within CN\ncode 2804 69 00 and originating in the People's Republic of China, is hereby\nextended to imports of silicon consigned from Taiwan, whether declared as\noriginating in Taiwan or not, currently falling within CN code ex 2804 69 00\n(TARIC code 2804 69 00 20).\n2. The duty extended by paragraph 1 of this\nArticle shall be collected on imports consigned from Taiwan, whether declared\nas originating in Taiwan or not, registered in accordance with Article 2 of\nRegulation (EU) No 596/2012 and Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009.\n3. Unless otherwise specified, the\nprovisions in force concerning customs duties shall apply.\nArticle 2\n1. Requests for exemption from the duty\nextended by Article 1 shall be made in writing in one of the official languages\nof the European Union and must be signed by a person authorised to represent\nthe entity requesting the exemption. The request must be sent to the following\naddress:\nEuropean Commission\nDirectorate-General for Trade\nDirectorate H\nOffice: N-105 08/20\n1049 Brussels\nBelgium\nFax (32 2) 295 65 05\n2. In accordance with Article 13(4) of\nRegulation (EC) No 1225/2009 the Commission, after consulting the Advisory\nCommittee, may authorise, by decision, the exemption of imports from companies\nwhich do not circumvent the anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EU) No\n467/2010, from the duty extended by Article 1.\nArticle 3\nCustoms authorities are hereby directed to\ndiscontinue the registration of imports, established in accordance with Article\n2 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2012.\nArticle 4\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\nthe day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union.\nThis\nRegulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all\nMember States.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 131, 29.5.2010, p. 1.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 66, 4.3.2004, p. 15.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 13, 19.1.2007, p. 1.\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 176, 6.7.2012, p. 50.\n[6] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L\n302, 19.10.1992, p. 1.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
