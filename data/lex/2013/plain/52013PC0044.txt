This\nreview has comprised an external study published by the Commission on the\napplication of the Funds Transfers Regulation, extensive contacts and\nconsultations with private stakeholders and civil society organisations, as\nwell as with representatives of EU Member State regulatory and supervisory\nauthorities.\nThe implications of this work are that the\nEU framework, including the Funds Transfers Regulation, will need to evolve and\nadjust to changes which should see an increased focus placed on (a) the effectiveness\nof regimes to counter money laundering and terrorist financing, (b) greater\nclarity and consistency of the rules across Member States, and (c) a broadened\nscope designed to address new threats and vulnerabilities.\nExisting provisions in this area\nDirective 2005/60/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the use\nof the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing[3]\n(hereinafter referred to as the\n\"Third AML Directive\") sets out the framework designed to protect the soundness, integrity\nand stability of credit and financial institutions and confidence in the\nfinancial system as a whole, against the risks of money laundering and\nterrorist financing.\nDirective 2006/70/EC[4] (the \"implementing Directive\") lays down implementing measures for\nthe Third AML Directive as regards the definition of politically exposed\npersons and the technical criteria for simplified customer due diligence\nprocedures and for exemption on grounds of a financial activity conducted on an\noccasional or very limited basis.\nThe Funds Transfers Regulation complements\nthose measures by ensuring that basic information on the payer of transfers of\nfunds is immediately available to appropriate law enforcement and/or\nprosecutorial authorities to assist them in detecting, investigating,\nprosecuting terrorists or other criminals and tracing\nthe assets of terrorists. \nConsistency with other policies and objectives of the Union\nThe proposal is\nconsistent with and complements the Proposal for a Directive of the European\nParliament and the Council on the prevention of the use of the financial system\nfor the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing. These two\nlegislative instruments pursue the common objective of revising the existing\nanti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing EU framework in order to\nimprove its effectiveness while ensuring its compliance with international\nstandards.\nThe proposal is also consistent with the\nobjectives of the EU's Internal Security Strategy[5], which identifies the most\nurgent challenges to EU security in the years to come and proposes five\nstrategic objectives and specific actions for 2011-2014 to help make the EU\nmore secure. This includes tackling money laundering and preventing terrorism,\nin particular, by updating the EU framework with a view to enhancing the\ntransparency of information on beneficial ownership of legal persons.\nWith regard to data protection, the\nproposed clarifications on the processing of personal data are in line with the\napproach set out in the Commission's recent data protection proposals[6].\nWith regard to sanctions, the proposal to\nintroduce a set of minimum principle-based rules to strengthen administrative sanctions and measures is consistent with the Commission's policy\nas outlined in its Communication \"Reinforcing sanctioning regimes in the\nfinancial services sector\"[7].\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nIn April 2012, the Commission\nadopted a report on the application of Directive 2005/60/EC and solicited\ncomments from all stakeholders[8].\nThe annex to this report, in particular, focused on cross-border wire transfers\nand, namely, on the two new requirements of including beneficiary information\nin wire transfers, and taking freezing action with respect to UN Resolutions.\nThe Commission received only 4\ncontributions referring expressly to the annex to the report. Respondents were\nasking for a consultation of interested parties from all countries and\nterritories affected by the Funds Transfers Regulation, highlighting the need\nthat any additional requirement or obligation imposed on payment service\nproviders would be proportionate and straightforward to meet.\nExtensive consultations with interested\nparties have been undertaken in the context of the external consultants' study[9] carried out on behalf of the\nEuropean Commission, which approached 108 stakeholders and involved phone\ninterviews and the completion of a structured questionnaire.\nUse of expertise\nOver the course of 2012, a study by\nexternal consultants was carried out on behalf of the Commission to gather evidence about how the Funds Transfers Regulation is working in Member States and the problems which have arisen[10].\nThe study, in particular, provides a number of recommendations, including:\n\u2013                        \nintroduce the obligation for Payment Service\nProviders to ensure that all originator and beneficiary information is retained\nwith wire transfers; \n\u2013                        \ndefine what beneficiary information needs to be\nverified, and by whom;\n\u2013                        \nconsider introducing a \u201csimplified\u201d regime for\ncross-border wire transfers amounting to EUR 1 000 or less, unless there is\nsuspicion of money-laundering or terrorist financing;\n\u2013                        \nfurther clarify the reporting obligations for\nPayment Service Providers; \n\u2013                        \nexplicitly prohibit the execution of wire\ntransfers if it does not comply with the necessary requirements (completeness\nand accuracy of the information); \n\u2013                        \nbeneficiary Payment Service Providers to\nimplement effective risk-based policies and procedures to determine appropriate\nfollow-up actions;\n\u2013                        \nconsider data protection implications.\nImpact assessment\nThis proposal is accompanied by an impact\nassessment which identifies the main problems in the current EU anti-money\nlaundering/combating terrorist financing legislative framework[11]: (i) inconsistency with the recently revised international standards; (ii) different\ninterpretation of rules across Member States; and (iii) inadequacies and\nloopholes with respect to the new money laundering and terrorist financing\nrisks. As a consequence, the effectiveness of counter money laundering and\nterrorist financing regimes is reduced with a negative reputational, economic\nand financial impact.\nThe impact assessment analyses the following three scenarios: \n(1)                   \na base-line scenario that the Commission takes\nno action; \n(2)                   \nan adjustment scenario that entails limited\nchanges to the Funds Transfers Regulation necessary to either (i) align the\nlegislative text to the revised international standards, or (ii) to ensure a\nsufficient level of consistency between national rules, or (iii) to address the\nmost important shortcomings concerning the new emerging threats; and \n(3)                   \na full harmonisation scenario that entails major\npolicy changes and additional elements of harmonisation, in recognition of any\nEU specificities. \nThe analysis carried out in the impact\nassessment has demonstrated that the second scenario is the most balanced in aligning the Funds Transfers Regulation with\nthe revised international standards while ensuring sufficient level of\nconsistency between national rules and flexibility in their implementation.\nIn addition, the impact assessment analysed\nthe impact of the legislative proposals on the Fundamental Rights. In line with\nthe Charter of Fundamental rights, the proposals seek in particular to ensure\nprotection of personal data (Article 8 of the Charter) as regards the storage\nand transfer of personal data. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nLegal basis\nArticle 114 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union. \nSubsidiarity and proportionality\nThere is a general consensus, emanating\nfrom all stakeholders (in particular Member States and the payment industry),\nthat the objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the\nMember States and would be better attained by EU action. \nNon-coordinated action by Member States\nalone in the field of cross-border transfers of funds could significantly\nimpact on the smooth functioning of payment systems at EU level, and therefore\ndamage the internal market in the field of financial services (see Recital 2 of\nthe Funds Transfers Regulation).\nBy the scale of its action, the Union shall\nguarantee a uniform transposition of new FATF Recommendation 16 through the EU,\nand, in particular, that there is no discrimination between national payments\nwithin a Member State and cross-border payments between Member States.\nThe proposal therefore complies with the\nsubsidiarity principle.\nWith regard to the proportionality\nprinciple, in conformity with the analysis carried out in the impact assessment\nthe proposal transposes the revised FATF Recommendation on \"wire\ntransfers\" by introducing the minimum requirements essential to ensure the\ntraceability of transfers of funds without going beyond what is necessary to\nachieve its objectives.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis proposal has no impact on the Union\nbudget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nDetailed explanation of the proposal \nIn line with new FATF Recommendation 16 on\n\"wire transfers\" and the accompanying Interpretative note, the\nproposed changes are aimed at addressing areas where gaps in transparency still\nremain.\nThe intention is to enhance traceability by\nimposing the following main requirements:\n\u2013                        \ninclude information on the payee;\n\u2013                        \nwith regard to the scope of the Regulation,\nclarify that credit or debit cards, or mobile telephone or any other digital or\nIT device become subject to the provisions of the regulation if they are used\nto transfer funds person to person. In addition, clarify that below EUR 1 000,\nin the case of fund transfers outside the EU, a lighter regime of non-verified\ninformation on the payer and the payee applies (as opposed to possible\nexemptions from scope as in Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006);\n\u2013                        \nwith regard to obligations of the Payment\nService Provider (PSP) of the payee, imposing a requirement to verify the\nidentity of the beneficiary (where not previously identified) for payments\noriginating outside the EU and where the amount is more than EUR 1 000. With\nregard to the PSP of the payee and the intermediary PSP, an obligation to\nestablish risk-based procedures for determining when to execute, reject or\nsuspend a transfer of funds which lacks the required information and to\ndetermine appropriate follow-up action;\n\u2013                        \nwith regard to data protection, align the\nrequirements of record keeping of the information with the FATF standards, in\naccordance with the new regime foreseen by the Directive [xxxx/yyyy]; \n\u2013                        \nwith regard to sanctions, reinforcement of\nsanctioning powers for competent authorities and a requirement to coordinate\nactions when dealing with cross-border cases; a requirement for sanctions\nimposed for breaches to be published; and a requirement to establish effective\nmechanisms to encourage reporting of breaches of the provisions of the\nRegulation.\nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposed act concerns an EEA matter and\nshould therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n2013/0024 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non information accompanying transfers of\nfunds \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[12],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Central Bank[13],\nAfter consulting the European Data Protection\nSupervisor[14],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Flows of dirty money\nthrough transfers of funds can damage the stability and reputation of the\nfinancial sector and threaten the internal market. Terrorism shakes the very\nfoundations of our society. The soundness, integrity and stability of the\nsystem of transfers of funds and confidence in the financial system as a whole\ncould be seriously jeopardised by the efforts of criminals and their associates\neither to disguise the origin of criminal proceeds or to transfer funds for\nterrorist purposes.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate\ntheir criminal activities, money launderers and terrorist financers could try\nto take advantage of the freedom of capital movements entailed by the integrated\nfinancial area, unless certain coordinating measures are adopted at Union\nlevel. By its scale, Union action should ensure that Recommendation 16 on wire\ntransfers of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), adopted in February 2012\nis transposed uniformly throughout the Union, and, in particular, that there is\nno discrimination between national payments within a Member State and cross\nborder payments between Member States. Uncoordinated action by Member States\nalone in the field of cross border transfers of funds could have a significant\nimpact on the smooth functioning of payment systems at Union level and\ntherefore damage the internal market in the field of financial services.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It has been pointed out in\nthe Union\u2019s revised Strategy on Terrorist Financing of 17 July 2008[15] that efforts have to be\nmaintained to prevent terrorist financing and the use by suspected terrorists\nof their own financial resources. It is recognised that the FATF is constantly\nseeking to improve its Recommendations and working towards a common\nunderstanding of how these should be implemented. It is noted in the Union's revised Strategy that implementation of those Recommendations by all FATF members\nand members of FATF-style regional bodies is assessed on a regular basis and that\nfrom this point of view a common approach to implementation by Member States is\nimportant.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to prevent\nterrorist funding, measures aimed at the freezing of funds and economic\nresources of certain persons, groups and entities have been taken, including\nRegulation (EC) No 2580/2001 of 27 December 2001 on specific restrictive\nmeasures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating\nterrorism[16],\nand Council Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 of 27 May 2002 imposing certain specific\nrestrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated\nwith the Al-Qaida network[17].\nTo that same end, measures aimed at protecting the financial system against the\nchannelling of funds and economic resources for terrorist purposes have been\ntaken. Directive [xxxx/yyyy] of the European Parliament and of the Council of\non the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money\nlaundering and terrorist financing[18]\ncontains a number of such measures. Those measures do not, however, fully\nprevent terrorists and other criminals from having access to payment systems\nfor moving their funds.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to foster a\ncoherent approach in the international context in the field of combating money\nlaundering and terrorist financing, further Union action should take account of\ndevelopments at that level, namely the International Standards on combating money-laundering\nand the financing of terrorism and proliferation adopted in 2012 by the FATF,\nand in particular Recommendation 16 and the revised interpretative note for its\nimplementation.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The full traceability of\ntransfers of funds can be a particularly important and valuable tool in the\nprevention, investigation and detection of money laundering or terrorist\nfinancing. It is therefore appropriate, in order to ensure the transmission of\ninformation throughout the payment chain, to provide for a system imposing the\nobligation on payment service providers to have transfers of funds accompanied\nby information on the payer and the payee.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of this\nRegulation apply without prejudice to national legislation implementing Directive\n95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on\nthe protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data\nand on the free movement of such data[19].\nFor example, personal data collected for the purpose of complying with this\nRegulation should not be further processed in a way inconsistent e with Directive\n95/46/EC. In particular, further processing for commercial purposes should be\nstrictly prohibited. The fight against money laundering and terrorist financing\nis recognised as an important public interest ground by all Member States.\nHence, in the application of this Regulation, the transfer of personal data to\na third country which does not ensure an adequate level of protection in the\nmeaning of Article 25 of Directive 95/46/EC should be permitted according to\nArticle 26 (d) of the same Directive.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Persons who merely convert\npaper documents into electronic data and are acting under a contract with a\npayment service provider do not fall within the scope of this Regulation; the\nsame applies to any natural or legal person who provides payment service\nproviders solely with messaging or other support systems for transmitting funds\nor with clearing and settlement systems.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\nexclude from the scope of this Regulation transfers of funds that represent a\nlow risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. Such exclusions should\ncover credit or debit cards, mobile telephones or other digital or information\ntechnology (IT) devices, Automated Teller Machine (ATM) withdrawals, payments\nof taxes, fines or other levies, and transfers of funds where both the payer\nand the payee are payment service providers acting on their own behalf. In\naddition, in order to reflect the special characteristics of national payment\nsystems, Member States may exempt electronic giro payments, provided that it is\nalways possible to trace the transfer of funds back to the payer. However,\nthere must be no exemption when a debit or credit card, a mobile telephone or\nother digital or IT prepaid or postpaid device is used in order to effect a\nperson-to-person transfer. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order not to impair the\nefficiency of payment systems, the verification requirements for transfers of\nfunds made from an account should be separate from those for transfers of funds\nnot made from an account. In order to balance the risk of driving transactions\nunderground by imposing overly strict identification requirements against the\npotential terrorist threat posed by small transfers of funds, the obligation to\ncheck whether the information on the payer is accurate should, in the case of\ntransfers of funds not made from an account, be imposed only in respect of\nindividual transfers of funds that exceed EUR 1 000,. For transfers of funds\nmade from an account, payment service providers should not be required to\nverify information on the payer accompanying each transfer of funds, where the\nobligations under Directive [xxxx/yyyy] have been met.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Against the background of\nthe Union payment legislation - Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on cross-border\npayments in the Community[20],\nRegulation (EU) No 260/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14\nMarch 2012 establishing technical and business requirements for credit\ntransfers and direct debits in euro[21] and\nDirective 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13\nNovember 2007 on payment services in the internal market[22] - it is\nsufficient to provide for simplified information on the payer to accompany\ntransfers of funds within the Union.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow the\nauthorities responsible for combating money laundering or terrorist financing\nin third countries to trace the source of funds used for those purposes,\ntransfers of funds from the Union to outside the Union should carry complete\ninformation on the payer and the payee. Those authorities should be granted\naccess to complete information on the payer only for the purposes of\npreventing, investigating and detecting money laundering or terrorist\nfinancing.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For transfers of funds from\na single payer to several payees to be sent in an inexpensive way in batch\nfiles containing individual transfers from the Union to outside the Union,\nprovision should be made for such individual transfers to carry only the\naccount number of the payer or his unique transaction identifier provided that complete\ninformation on the payer and the payee is contained in the batch file.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to check whether\nthe required information on the payer and the payee accompanies transfers of\nfunds, and to help to identify suspicious transactions, the payment service\nprovider of the payee and the intermediary payment service provider should have\neffective procedures in place in order to detect whether information on the\npayer and the payee is missing.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Owing to the potential\nterrorist financing threat posed by anonymous transfers, it is appropriate to\nrequire payment service providers to request information on the payer and the\npayee. In line with the risk based approach developed by FATF, it is\nappropriate to identify areas of higher and lower risk with a view to better\ntargeting money laundering and terrorist financing risks. Accordingly, the\npayment service provider of the payee and the intermediary service provider should\nestablish effective risk-based procedures for cases where a transfer of funds\nlacks the required payer and payee information, in order to decide whether to execute,\nreject or suspend that transfer and what appropriate follow-up action to take.\nWhere the payment service provider of the payer is established outside the\nterritory of the Union, enhanced customer due diligence should be applied, in\naccordance with Directive [xxxx/yyyy], in respect of cross-border correspondent\nbanking relationships with that payment service provider.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The payment service\nprovider of the payee and the intermediary payment service provider should\nexercise special vigilance, assessing the risks, when it becomes aware that\ninformation on the payer and the payee is missing or incomplete and should\nreport suspicious transactions to the competent authorities, in accordance with\nthe reporting obligations set out in Directive [xxxx/yyyy] and national\nimplementing measures.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions on transfers\nof funds where information on the payer or the payee is missing or incomplete\napply without prejudice to any obligations on payment service providers and the\nintermediary payment service providers to suspend and/or reject transfers of\nfunds which violate provisions of civil, administrative or criminal law.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Until technical limitations\nthat may prevent intermediary payment service providers from satisfying the\nobligation to transmit all the information they receive on the payer are\nremoved, those intermediary payment service providers should keep records of\nthat information. Such technical limitations should be removed as soon as\npayment systems are upgraded.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since in criminal\ninvestigations it may not be possible to identify the data required or the\nindividuals involved until many months, or even years, after the original\ntransfer of funds and in order to be able to have access to essential evidence\nin the context of investigations, it is appropriate to require payment service\nproviders to keep records of information on the payer and the payee for the\npurposes of preventing, investigating and detecting money laundering or\nterrorist financing. This period should be limited. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To\nenable prompt action to be taken in the fight against terrorism, payment\nservice providers should respond promptly\nto requests for information on the payer from the authorities responsible for combating money laundering or terrorist\nfinancing in the Member State where they are established.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nnumber of working days in the Member State of the payment service provider of the payer determines the number of\ndays to respond to requests for information on the payer.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to improve compliance with the requirements of this Regulation and\nfollowing the Commission Communication of 9 December 2010 entitled 'Reinforcing\nsanctioning regimes in the financial services sector'[23], the power to adopt\nsupervisory measures and the sanctioning powers of competent authorities should\nbe enhanced. Administrative sanctions should be foreseen and, given the importance of the\nfight against money laundering and terrorist financing, Member States should\nlay down sanctions that are effective, proportionate and\ndissuasive. Member States should notify the Commission thereof, as\nwell as the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority)\n(hereinafter \u2018EBA\u2019), established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a\nEuropean Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), amending Decision\nNo 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/78/EC; the European\nSupervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority)\n(hereinafter \u2018EIOPA\u2019), established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a\nEuropean Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions\nAuthority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision\n2009/79/EC; and the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and\nMarkets Authority) (hereinafter \u2018ESMA\u2019), established by Regulation (EU) No\n1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010\nestablishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets\nAuthority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision\n2009/77/EC.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of Articles XXX of this Regulation,\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should\nbe exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and\ngeneral principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the\nCommission's exercise of implementing powers[24].\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A number of countries and\nterritories which do not form part of the territory of the Union share a\nmonetary union with a Member State, form part of the currency area of a Member\nState or have signed a monetary convention with the Union represented by a\nMember State, and have payment service providers that participate directly or\nindirectly in the payment and settlement systems of that Member State. In order\nto avoid the application of this Regulation to transfers of funds between the\nMember States concerned and those countries or territories having a significant\nnegative effect on the economies of those countries or territories, it is\nappropriate to provide for the possibility for such transfers of funds to be\ntreated as transfers of funds within the Member States concerned.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the amendments\nthat would need to be made to Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006 of 15 November 2006\non information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds, it should be\nrepealed for reasons of clarity.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of\nthis Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can\ntherefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved\nat Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle\nof subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the\nprinciple of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does\nnot go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those
