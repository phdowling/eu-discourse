This long-term goal requires global\r\ngreenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by at least 50% below 1990 levels by\r\n2050[2]. \nDeveloped countries should reduce their\r\nemissions by 80 to 95% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels[3]. In the medium term, the EU has\r\ncommitted to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% below 1990 levels by\r\n2020, and by 30% if conditions are right. This commitment forms part of one of\r\nthe EU's five headline targets in the Europe 2020 Strategy.[4] Additionally, both the European\r\nCouncil and the European Parliament have agreed that all sectors of the economy\r\nshould contribute to reducing emissions[5].\r\nIn the view of contributing to the EU 2020 Strategy, the 2011 Commission White Paper on Transport[6] states\r\nthat EU CO2 emissions from maritime\r\ntransport should be reduced by 40% (if feasible 50%) from 2005 levels by 2050.\nIn 2010 the total CO2 emissions\r\nrelated to European maritime transport activities (including intra EU routes,\r\nincoming voyages to the EU and outgoing voyages from the EU) were estimated to\r\nbe of the order of 180 Mt CO2. Despite of the introduction of\r\nminimum energy efficiency standards for certain categories of new ships\r\n(\"Energy Efficiency Design Index\", EEDI) by the International\r\nMaritime Organisation (IMO) in 2011[7],\r\nthe emissions are expected to increase. Main driver is the still expected increased\r\ndemand for maritime transport triggered by growth of world trade.\nThis projected growth is expected to happen\r\ndespite the availibility of operational measures and existing technologies to\r\nreduce the specific energy consumption and CO2 emissions of ships by\r\nup to 75% (according to IMO figures). A significant part of these measures can\r\nbe regarded as cost-effective as the reduced fuel costs ensure the pay-back of\r\nany operational or investment costs. This contradiction can be explained by the\r\nexistence of market barriers for the uptake of such technologies and\r\noperational measures such as the lack of reliable information on fuel\r\nefficiency of ships or of technologies for retrofitting ships, lack of access\r\nto finance for investments into ship efficiency and split incentives as ship\r\nowners would not benefit from their investments into ship efficiency as fuel\r\nbills are paid by operators. \nMandate for action at EU level\nThe projected increase of CO2\r\nemissions from shipping is not in line with the EU objectives, leading to\r\nnegative impacts on climate change. Furthermore, at the EU level, international\r\nmaritime transport remains the only transport mode not included in the EU's\r\ngreenhouse gas emissions reduction commitment which requires additional efforts\r\nfrom all other sectors. \nThe Council and the Parliament recalled an\r\nearlier commitment to take action in the Climate and Energy Package adopted on\r\n23 April 2009: \"in the event that no international agreement which\r\nincludes international maritime emissions in its reduction targets through the\r\nInternational Maritime Organisation has been approved by Member States or no\r\nsuch agreement through the UNFCCC has been approved by the Community by 31\r\nDecember 2011, the Commission should make a proposal to include international\r\nmaritime emissions in the Community reduction commitment, with the aim of the\r\nproposed act entering into force by 2013. Such a proposal should minimise any\r\nnegative impact on the Community\u2019s competitiveness while taking into account\r\nthe potential environmental benefits.\"[8]\r\n\nThis deadline has passed without sufficient\r\ninternational action as the EEDI, despite its utility is not expected alone to\r\ndeliver absolute emission reductions compared to base years if forecasted\r\ngrowth in traffic will be realised. Therefore, the Commission launched\r\npreparatory activities in view of addressing greenhouse gas emissions from international\r\nmaritime transport. \nNeed for a staged approach to reduce greenhouse\r\ngas emisisons from maritime transport\nToday, the precise amount of CO2\r\nand other greenhouse gas emissions of EU-related maritime transport is not\r\nknown due to the lack of monitoring and reporting of such emissions. The impact\r\nassessment and stakeholder consultation (see section 2) identified that a\r\nrobust system for monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of greenhouse\r\ngas emissions from maritime transport is a prerequisite for any market-based\r\nmeasure or efficiency standard, whether applied at EU level or globally.\nFurthermore, a robust MRV system should\r\ncontribute to the removal of market barriers, in particular related to the lack\r\nof information on ship efficiency. Based on the results of the impact\r\nassessment, it is expected that by introducing MRV, greenhouse gas emisisons\r\nreductions of up to 2% compared to business-as-usual and aggregated net costs\r\nreduction of up to \u20ac 1.2 billion by 2030 could be achieved.\nBy introducing MRV as a first step, more\r\ntime can be dedicated to the discussion and decision making on emission\r\nreduction targets, market-based measures and efficiency standards to achieve\r\nthese reductions at minimum cost. This is particularly relevant for discussions\r\nat global level in the IMO. \nGiven the Commission's clear preference for\r\nmeasures taken at global level, the EU MRV should serve as example for the\r\nimplementation of a global MRV with the aim to speed up the international\r\ndiscussions. In this context, relevant submissions to the IMO will be made when\r\nappropriate. Once a global system is decided, the proposed Regulation should be\r\namended to align the EU MRV with the global system.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\r\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nStakeholder consultation\nIn order to review the policy options\r\nmentioned in the second IMO greenhouse gas study 2009[9] and in the 2009 CE Delft study[10], a working group (WG6) was\r\nestablished under the European Climate Change Program II (ECCP). This group has\r\nalso allowed formal technical stakeholder consultations and provided input for\r\nthe external support, e.g. by narrowing down the policy options. Three two-day\r\nmeetings with more than 100 participants from national administrations, from EU\r\nand international shipping associations and from other associations and NGOs\r\nwere organized in 2011. The minutes, the background paper and the presentation\r\nof these meetings are available on the Commission\u2019s website for public\r\ninformation[11].\nFurthermore, the Commission established a\r\nHigh Level Platform, bringing together high level experts in the maritime\r\ntransport sector, to enable a strategic discussion directly with Vice President\r\nKallas and Commissioner Hedegaard. These meetings took place on the 3 February\r\n2011, 28 June 2011 and 7 November 2011. \nAn online public consultation was held from\r\n19 January to 12 April 2012, i.e. 12 weeks. A press release announced the\r\nlaunch of this public consultation. The public consultation was carried out\r\nusing the \u201cGeneral principles and minimum standards for consultation of\r\ninterested parties by the Commission\u201d.\nThe consultation confirms that a global\r\nagreement in the IMO is perceived as the best long term option to achieve greenhouse\r\ngas emission reductions of the shipping sector. In the event of a European\r\nmeasure, there is general agreement that there should be a level playing field\r\nfor all ships using European ports. It is also a largely shared view that any\r\nmarket-based measure or efficiency standard needs to be accompanied by\r\ntransparent and robust monitoring of emissions. This monitoring should be\r\nestablished with the view of avoiding undue administrative burdens and ensure\r\naccurate reporting results. More results are published on the Commission's\r\nwebsite[12].\nFinally, another stakeholder meeting with\r\n120 participants from industry, NGOs, Member States and third countries took\r\nplace on 5 December 2012 focussing on the design of a MRV system in the EU.\r\nThis meeting confirmed the need for MRV as no robust data on CO2\r\nemission are available today. Several initiatives for monitoring and reporting\r\nof fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and energy efficiency already\r\nexist in the shipping sector. The participants widely agreed that MRV should be\r\nbased on information required by international Conventions and already\r\navailable on board of ships to reduce the administrative burden. The\r\npresentations and conclusions are published on the Commission's website[13].\nImpact assessment\nThe Impact Assessment analyses and compares\r\nseveral policy options for market-based measures and a MRV-only option. The\r\nmain findings are the following:\n\u2013                        \r\nThe key market barriers to the implementation of\r\ncost-effective abatement measures are:\n(i) lack of reliable information on fuel\r\nefficiency of ships or of technologies available for retrofitting ships, \n(ii) lack of access to finance for investments\r\ninto ship efficiency\n(iii) split incentives as ship owners would not\r\nbenefit from their investments into ship efficiency as fuel bills, due to the\r\nstructure of ship operations, are often paid by operators. \nThe removal of these market barriers will be\r\nkey for the success of any particular measure. \n\u2013                        \r\nSignificant emission reduction potentials exist for\r\nshipping through a range of technical and operational measures, which mainly\r\naim to improve the energy efficiency of ships. The fuel cost savings associated\r\nwith most of these technical or operational measures outweigh the expected\r\ncosts.\n\u2013                        \r\nAll policy options analysed offer net benefits\r\nin terms of environmental (reduction of CO2 and other emissions),\r\neconomic (net cost savings for the maritime transport sector) and social\r\nimpacts (less health problems due to lower SOX and particle\r\nemissions, creation of jobs).\n\u2013                        \r\nTwo types of compensation funds \u2013 a\r\ncontribution-based fund with given carbon price and a target-based fund with\r\ndefined reduction target and indirect price setting \u2013 and a maritime emission\r\ntrading system (ETS) could offer the highest benefits in terms of emission\r\nreductions and cost savings.\nThey are expected to best address the market\r\nbarriers and result in emission reductions of around 10% by 2030 compared to\r\n2005. Net cost savings for the shipping sector could be substantial in case\r\nmarket barriers could be completely removed (and may be up to \u20ac 12 billion in\r\n2030 and in average up to \u20ac 5 billion per year). In particular there are\r\nsubstantial saving potentials by implementing existing fuel efficiency\r\ntechnologies at negative costs in this sector, and coupled with operational\r\nmeasures will further reduce CO2 emissions.\n\u2013                        \r\nThe MRV only option would lead to more limited\r\nemission reductions estimated at up to 2% in 2030 (compared to the baseline)\r\nleading to cost reductions up to around \u20ac 1.2 billion in 2030 (in average\r\nabout \u20ac 900 million per year). This will target the removal of market barriers\r\nrelated to the lack of information thanks to the generation of information on\r\nfuel consumption and raising awareness at management level for potential fuel\r\ncost savings. Costs of implementation are estimated at around \u20ac 26 million per\r\nyear (when excluding ship below 5000 GT from the scope). Overall, the relative\r\nbenefit/cost ratio of this option is very high.\nThe full results are presented in the\r\nimpact assessment accompanying the proposal.\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe main objective of this Regulation is to\r\nestablish a European MRV system for CO2 emissions from ships as\r\nfirst step of a staged approach to reduce these emissions. In order to reduce\r\nthe related administrative costs while ensuring robust results, simple and lean\r\nMRV requirements are proposed. The approach is therefore designed to make use\r\nof already existing data on board of ships to the fullest extent. \nAccordingly the operational features of the\r\nproposed MRV system would be as follows:\n\u2013                        \r\nFocus on CO2 as predominant GHG\r\nemitted by ships and on other climate relevant information such as efficiency\r\ninformation to address market barriers for the uptake of cost-efficient\r\nmitigation measures and to align MRV with IMO discussion on efficiency standards\r\nfor existing ships\n\u2013                        \r\nCalculate annual CO2 emissions based\r\non fuel consumption and fuel type and energy efficiency using available data\r\nfrom log books, noon reports and bunker delivery notes\n\u2013                        \r\nUse existing structures and bodies of the\r\nmaritime sector, in particular recognised organisations to verify emission\r\nreports and to issue documents for compliance\n\u2013                        \r\nExclude small emitters (ships below 5000 GT)\r\nwhich represent about 40% of the fleet, but only 10% of the total emissions\nIn principle, the\r\nMRV system could also cover emissions of other greenhouse gases, climate\r\nforcers and air pollutants such as SOX and NOX. Such an\r\nintegrated approach could deliver a broad range of relevant environmental\r\ninformation while making use of synergy effects to the benefits of the shipping\r\nsector and public authorities. However, the proposed lean MRV approach based on\r\nexisting documents and equipment on board of ships could not be used to measure\r\nother emissions than CO2. Furthermore, the measurement equipment required\r\nfor other emissions than CO2 cannot be considered as sufficiently\r\nreliable and commercially available for use at sea. Therefore, at this stage,\r\nthe proposed MRV system should be implemented for CO2 emissions\r\nonly. It would be appropriate to review this scope at later stage. \nAs regards the\r\ngeographical scope for monitoring, the following routes will in\r\nprinciple be covered in a non-discriminatory manner for all ships regardless\r\ntheir flag:\n\u2013                        \r\nintra-EU voyages\n\u2013                        \r\nvoyages from the last non-EU port to the first\r\nEU port of call (incoming voyages)\n\u2013                        \r\nvoyages from an EU port to the next non-EU port\r\nof call (outgoing voyages) \nThe compliance cycle will be based on a\r\nstandard approach. It is proposed to use a lean approach and to assign a\r\nlimited number of tasks to the Commission which shall be assisted by the European\r\nMaritime Safety Agency (EMSA). Tasks related to the check of monitoring plans,\r\nemission reports, communication with ship owners and operators and the issuance\r\nof documents of compliance would be ensured by accredited third party\r\nverifiers. Such bodies which may include recognised bodies already have\r\nextensive experience and play an important role for maritime safety.\r\nEnforcement of the MRV obligations would be ensured by Member States, more\r\nconcretely by Port State Authorities making use of the existing flag State and\r\nport State control mechanisms and of data published by the Commission. \nThe proposed MRV system could be converted\r\ninto a global system with only limited adjustments as it uses internationally required\r\ndocuments and existing structures such as flag State and port State authorities\r\nand classification societies. \nIn order to facilitate the implementation\r\nof the proposed MRV system, more specific rules for verification and the\r\naccreditation of verifiers are needed. In addition, the description of the four\r\nmonitoring methods and the determination of other climate relevant information\r\nsuch as efficiency indicators provided in Annex I and II of the proposed\r\nRegulation should be revised based on the scientific evidence and the\r\ndevelopment of international standards. For these purposes, the Commission\r\nshould be empowered to adopt respective delegated acts.\nTo simplify the preparation of monitoring\r\nplans, reporting and verification of emissions and other climate relevant\r\ninformation, electronic templates shall be used. These templates shall be\r\nprovided and adopted by the Commission based on implementing acts.\nThe steps of the MRV process are\r\nillustrated by the following figure.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis for the legislative\r\nproposal is Article 192(1) of the TFEU. The proposal pursues a legitimate\r\nobjective within the scope of Article 191(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union, namely, combating climate change. The purpose of the\r\nlegislative proposal is to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from ships are\r\nmonitored and reported, and therefore to improve the availability of\r\ninformation for policy and decision making in the context of the Union\u2019s climate change commitments and provide incentives for mitigation efforts. This\r\nobjective cannot be achieved by less restrictive means than the legislative\r\nproposal.\nSubsidiarity principle\nFor Union action to be justified, the\r\nsubsidiarity principle must be respected.\n(a)                   \r\nTransnational nature of the problem (necessity\r\ntest)\nThe transnational nature of climate change\r\nand of maritime transport are important elements in determining whether Union\r\naction is necessary. National action alone would not suffice to meet the\r\nobjectives set by the White Paper on Transport. It is therefore necessary for\r\nthe Union to create an enabling framework to meet international and Union\r\nrequirements, ensuring harmonised monitoring, reporting and verification of greenhouse\r\ngas emisisons from maritime transport.\n(b)                   \r\nEffectiveness test (added value)\nBy reason of its effectiveness, taking\r\naction at Union level would produce clear benefits compared to action at Member State level. As the overarching climate change commitments are made at the Union\r\nlevel including the emissions reduction target for the maritime transport\r\nsector for 2050 as established by the White Paper on Transport, it is effective\r\nto also develop the required rules for MRV at this level. Moreover, this legal\r\nframework will ensure effectiveness by employing harmonised MRV for ship voyages between ports of different Member States which\r\naccount for about 90% of port calls in EU Member\r\nStates. Furthermore, acting at the EU level could avoid competitive distortion\r\nin the internal market by ensuring equal environmental constraints on ships\r\ncalling into EU ports.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nIt does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective to collect reliable data of greenhouse gas\r\nemissions from ships. Furthermore, the methodology for MRV of the proposed\r\nRegulation is based on information already today available on board of ships.\r\nNo additional equipment will be required. \nThe proportionality of the proposed measure\r\nis also ensured by focussing on CO2 emissions representing about 98%\r\nof the greenhouse gas emissions of the shipping sector and on large ships above\r\n5000 Gross Tons (GT). This excludes almost half of the about 19000 ships above\r\n300 GT have called in EU ports in 2010[14]\r\nwhile still covering around 90% of the total emissions from ships.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\r\nIMPLICATION \nAs specified in\r\nthe financial statement accompanying this Regulation, the Regulation will be\r\nimplemented using the existing budget and will not have an impact on the\r\nmulti-annual financial framework. Limited IT development costs for the\r\nnecessary adjustment of an existing tool hosted and operated by EMSA of around\r\n0.5 M\u20ac are expected. EMSA's involvement depends on the\r\nrespective ancillary task of the agency to be activated and approved by the\r\nEMSA Board.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL\r\nELEMENTS \nReview/revision clause\nThe proposal\r\nincludes a provision allowing the Commission to review this Regulation in the\r\ncontext of future international developments, in particular in case of the\r\nintroduction of a global MRV system through the IMO. In such an event the\r\nproposed Regulation should be reviewed and if appropriate amended to align the\r\nprovisions on MRV with the international system.\n2013/0224 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the monitoring, reporting and\r\nverification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport and amending\r\nRegulation (EU) No 525/2013\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[15],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[16],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Climate and Energy\r\nPackage[17] calling for contributions of all sectors of\r\nthe economy to achieving these emission reductions, including international\r\nmaritime shipping, provides a clear mandate: \"\u2026in the event that no\r\ninternational agreement which includes international maritime emissions in its\r\nreduction targets through the International Maritime Organisation has been\r\napproved by Member States or no such agreement through the UNFCCC has been\r\napproved by the Community by 31 December 2011, the Commission should make a\r\nproposal to include international maritime emissions in the Community reduction\r\ncommitment, with the aim of the proposed act entering into force by 2013. Such\r\na proposal should minimise any negative impact on the Community\u2019s\r\ncompetitiveness while taking into account the potential environmental\r\nbenefits.\"\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nJuly 2011, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted technical and\r\noperational measures, in particular the Energy\r\nEfficiency Design Index (EEDI) for new ships and the Ship Energy Efficiency\r\nManagement Plan (SEEMP), which will\r\nbring improvement in terms of reducing the expected increase in greenhouse gas\r\nemissions, but alone cannot lead to the necessary absolute emission reductions\r\nof greenhouse gases from international shipping to keep efforts in line with\r\nthe global objective of limiting increases in global temperatures to 2\u00b0C.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to data provided\r\nby the IMO, the specific energy consumption and CO2 emissions of ships\r\ncould be reduced by up to 75% by applying operational measures and implementing\r\nexisting technologies; a significant part of those measures can be regarded as\r\ncost-effective as the reduced fuel costs ensure the pay-back of any operational\r\nor investment costs.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reduce carbon\r\ndioxide emissions from shipping at Union level the best possible option remains\r\nsetting up a system for monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of CO2\r\nemissions based on the fuel consumption of ships as a first step of a staged\r\napproach for the inclusion of maritime transport emissions in the Union's greenhouse gas reduction commitment.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The adoption of measures\r\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption is hampered by the\r\nexistence of market barriers such as lack of reliable information on fuel\r\nefficiency of ships or of technologies available for retrofitting ships, lack\r\nof access to finance for investments into ship efficiency and split incentives\r\nas ship owners would not benefit from their investments into ship efficiency\r\nwhen fuel bills are paid by operators.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The results of the\r\nstakeholder consultation and discussions with international partners indicate\r\nthat a staged approach for the inclusion of maritime transport emissions in the\r\nUnion's greenhouse gas reduction commitment should be applied with the\r\nimplementation of a robust MRV system for CO2 emissions from\r\nmaritime transport as a first step and the pricing of these emissions at a\r\nlater stage. This approach facilitates making significant progress at\r\ninternational level on the agreement of greenhouse gas emission reduction\r\ntargets and further measures to achieve these reductions at minimum cost.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The introduction of a Union\r\nMRV system is expected to lead to emission reductions of up to 2% compared to\r\nbusiness-as-usual and aggregated net costs reductions of up to 1.2 billion EUR by\r\n2030 as it could contribute to the removal of market barriers, in particular those\r\nrelated to the lack of information about ship efficiency. This reduction of\r\ntransport costs should facilitate international trade. Furthermore, a robust\r\nMRV system is a prerequisite for any market-based measure or efficiency\r\nstandard, whether applied at Union level or globally. It also provides reliable\r\ndata to set precise emission reduction targets and to assess the progress of\r\nmaritime transport's contribution towards achieving a low carbon economy.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All intra-Union voyages,\r\nall incoming voyages from the last non-Union port to the first Union port of\r\ncall and all outgoing voyages from a Union port to the next non-Union port of\r\ncall should be considered relevant for purposes of monitoring. CO2\r\nemissions in Union ports including when ships are at berth or move within a\r\nport, should be covered as well, in particular as specific measures for their\r\nreduction or avoidance are available. These rules should be applied in a\r\nnon-discriminatory manner to all ships regardless of their flag.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proposed MRV system\r\nshould take the form of a Regulation on account of the complex and highly\r\ntechnical nature of provisions introduced, the need for uniform rules\r\napplicable throughout the Union to reflect the international nature of maritime\r\ntransport with numerous ships being expected to call at ports in different\r\nMember States, and to facilitate implementation throughout the Union.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A robust ship-specific Union\r\nMRV system should be based on the calculation of emissions from fuel consumed on\r\nvoyages from and to Union ports as fuel sales data could not provide appropriately\r\naccurate estimates for the fuel consumption within this specific scope due to\r\nthe large tank capacities of ships.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union MRV system should\r\nalso cover other climate relevant information allowing for the determination of\r\nships' efficiency or further analyse the drivers for the development of\r\nemissions. This scope also aligns the Union MRV system with international\r\ninitiatives to introduce efficiency standards for existing ships, also covering\r\noperational measures, and contributes to the removal of market barriers related\r\nto the lack of information.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to minimise the\r\nadministrative burden for ship owners and operators, in particular for small and\r\nmedium sized enterprises, and to optimise the benefits-costs-ratio of the MRV\r\nsystem without jeopardising the objective to cover a widely predominant share\r\nof greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport, the rules for MRV should\r\nonly apply to large emitters. A threshold of 5000 gross tonnage (GT) has been\r\nselected after detailed objective analysis of sizes and emissions of ships going\r\nto and coming from Union ports. Ships above 5000 GT account for around 55% of\r\nthe number of ships calling into Union ports and represent around 90% of the related\r\nemissions. This non-discriminatory threshold would ensure that that the most\r\nrelevant emitters are covered. A lower threshold would result in higher\r\nadministrative burden while a higher threshold would limit the coverage of\r\nemissions and thus the environmental effectiveness of the system.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To further reduce the\r\nadministrative effort for ship owners and operators, the monitoring rules\r\nshould focus on CO2 as the by far most relevant greenhouse gas emitted\r\nby maritime transport which contributes to up to 98% of the total greenhouse\r\ngas emissions of this sector. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rules should take into\r\naccount existing requirements and data already available on board of ships;\r\ntherefore, ship owners should be given the opportunity to select one out of the\r\nfollowing four monitoring methods: the use of Bunker Fuel Delivery Notes,\r\nbunker fuel tank monitoring, flow meters for applicable combustion processes or\r\ndirect emission measurements. A ship specific monitoring plan should document\r\nthe choice made and provide further details on the application of the selected\r\nmethod.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any company with\r\nresponsibility for an entire reporting period over a ship performing shipping\r\nactivities should be considered responsible for all monitoring and reporting\r\nrequirements arising in relation to this reporting period, including the\r\nsubmission of a satisfactorily verified emissions report. In case of change of\r\nownership, the new owner will only be responsible\r\nfor the monitoring and reporting obligations related to the reporting period\r\nwhere the change of ownership has taken place. To facilitate the fulfilment of\r\nthese obligations the new owner should receive a copy of the latest monitoring\r\nplan, and document of compliance if applicable. Change of ownership should also\r\nlead to the modification of the monitoring plan in order to allow new ship\r\nowner to make their own choices in relation to the monitoring methodology.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other greenhouse gases,\r\nclimate forcers or air pollutants should not be covered by the Union MRV system\r\nat this stage to avoid requirements to install not sufficiently reliable and\r\ncommercially available measurement equipment, which could impede the\r\nimplementation of the Union MRV system.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To minimise the\r\nadministrative burden for ship owners and operators, reporting and publication\r\nof reported information should be organised on an annual basis. By restricting\r\nthe publication of emissions, fuel consumption and efficiency-related\r\ninformation to annual averages and aggregated figures, confidentiality issues\r\nshould be addressed. The data reported to the Commission should be integrated\r\nwith statistics to the extent that these data are relevant for the development,\r\nproduction and dissemination of European statistics in accordance with\r\nCommission Decision 2012/504/EU of 17 September 2012 on Eurostat[18].\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Verification by accredited verifiers\r\nshould ensure that monitoring plans and emission reports are correct and in\r\ncompliance with the requirements defined by this Regulation. As an important\r\nelement to simplify verification, verifiers should check data credibility by comparing\r\nreported data with estimated data based on ship tracking data and\r\ncharacteristics. Such estimates could be provided by the Commission. Verifiers\r\nshould be independent and competent persons or legal entities and should be\r\naccredited by national accreditation bodies established pursuant to Regulation\r\n(EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008\r\nsetting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating\r\nto the marketing of products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93[19].\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A document of compliance\r\nissued by a verifier should be kept on board of ships to demonstrate compliance\r\nwith the obligations for monitoring, reporting and verification. Verifiers\r\nshould inform the Commission on the issuance of such documents.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on experience from\r\nsimilar tasks related to maritime safety, the European Maritime Safety Agency\r\n(EMSA) should support the Commission by carrying out certain tasks.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non compliance with the\r\nprovisions of this Regulation should result in the application of sanctions. Enforcement\r\nof the obligations related to the MRV system should be based on existing\r\ninstruments, namely those instituted in application of Directive 2009/21/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council on compliance with flag State\r\nrequirements[20]\r\nand Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April\r\n2009 on port State control[21],\r\nand on information on the issuance of documents of compliance. The document\r\nconfirming compliance of the ship with the monitoring and reporting obligations\r\nshould be added by the Commission to the list of certificates and documents referred\r\nto in Article 13(1) of Directive 2009/16/EC.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2009/16/EC\r\nprovides for the detention of ships in the absence of certificates which have\r\nto be carried on board. In the case of ships having failed to comply with\r\nmonitoring and reporting obligations for more than one reporting period, it is\r\nnonetheless appropriate to provide for the possibility of expelling. This\r\nshould be applied in such a way as to allow the situation to be rectified\r\nwithin a reasonable period of time.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 525/2013\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on a mechanism for\r\nmonitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and for reporting other\r\ninformation at national and Union level relevant to climate change[22] should be amended to establish\r\nrequirements for the monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from\r\nmaritime transport by Member States pursuant to this Regulation.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union MRV system should\r\nserve as a model for the implementation of a global MRV system. A global MRV\r\nsystem is preferable as it could be regarded as more effective due to the\r\nbroader scope. In this context, the Commission should share relevant\r\ninformation on the implementation of this Regulation with the IMO and other relevant international bodies on a\r\nregular basis and relevant submissions should be made to the IMO. Where an\r\nagreement on a global MRV system is reached, the Commission should review the\r\nUnion MRV system in view of aligning it to the global system.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to make use of the\r\nbest available practices and scientific evidence, the power to adopt acts in\r\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission\r\nin respect of reviewing certain technical aspects of monitoring and reporting\r\nof CO2 emissions from ships and of further specifying rules for the\r\nverification of emission reports and the accreditation of verifiers. It is of\r\nparticular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations\r\nduring its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when\r\npreparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely\r\nand appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament\r\nand Council.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the use of automated systems and standard electronic templates for\r\ncoherent reporting of emissions and other climate-relevant information to the\r\nCommission and involved States implementing powers should be conferred on the\r\nCommission. Those necessary implementing powers should be exercised in accordance with\r\nRegulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16\r\nFebruary 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning\r\nmechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission's exercise of\r\nimplementing powers[23].\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of the\r\nproposed action, namely to monitor, report and verify CO2 emissions\r\nfrom ships as first step of a staged approach to reduce these emissions cannot\r\nbe sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting individually, due to the\r\ninternational nature of maritime transport and can therefore, by reason of\r\nscale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level. The Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in\r\nArticle 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality,\r\nas set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is\r\nnecessary in order to achieve those objectives. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rules establishing the\r\nMRV system should comply with the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of\r\nindividuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free\r\nmovement of such data[24]\r\nand with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the\r\nprocessing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and of the\r\nfree movement of such data[25].\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should\r\nenter into force on 1 July 2015 to ensure that the Member States and relevant\r\nstakeholders have sufficient time to take the necessary measures for the\r\neffective application of this Regulation before the first reporting period\r\nstarts on 1 January 2018.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL\r\nPROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject\r\nmatter\nThis Regulation lays down rules for the\r\naccurate monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide (CO2)\r\nemissions and other climate relevant information from ships arriving at, within\r\nor departing from ports under the jurisdiction of a Member State in order to\r\npromote the reduction of CO2 emissions from maritime transport in a\r\ncost effective manner.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation applies to\r\nships above 5000 gross tons in respect of emissions released during their voyages\r\nfrom the last port of call to a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State\r\nand from a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State to their next port of\r\ncall, as well as within ports under the jurisdiction of a Member State.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation does not apply\r\nto warships, naval auxiliaries, fish catching or processing ships, wooden ships\r\nof a primitive build, ships not propelled by mechanical means and government\r\nships used for non-commercial purposes.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the\r\nfollowing definitions apply:\n(a)                   \r\n'emissions' means the release of CO2 into\r\nthe atmosphere by ships as provided for in Article 2;\n(b)                   \r\n'port of call' means the port where a ship stops\r\nto load or unload cargo or to embark or disembark passengers, excluding stops\r\nfor the sole purpose of refuelling, obtaining fresh supplies and/or relieving\r\nthe crew;\n(c)                   \r\n'company' means the owner of a ship as provided\r\nfor in Article 2 or any other person, such as the manager or the bareboat\r\ncharterer, who has assumed the responsibility from the ship-owner for its\r\noperations;\n(d)                   \r\n'gross tonnage' (GT) means the metric gross\r\ntonnage calculated in accordance with the tonnage measurement regulations\r\ncontained in Annex 1 to the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of\r\nShips, 1969;\n(e)                   \r\n'verifier' means a legal entity carrying out\r\nverification activities that is accredited by a national accreditation body\r\npursuant to Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[26] and this Regulation;\n(f)                     \r\n\u2018verification\u2019 means the activities carried out by\r\na verifier to assess the conformity of the documents transmitted by the company\r\nwith the requirements under this Regulation;\n(g)                   \r\n'other climate-relevant information' means\r\ninformation related to the consumption of fuels, transport work and energy\r\nefficiency of ships which allow for analysing emission trends and assessing\r\nships' performances;\n(h)                   \r\n\u2018emission factor\u2019 means the average emission\r\nrate of a greenhouse gas relative to the activity data of a source stream\r\nassuming complete oxidation for combustion and complete conversion for all\r\nother chemical reactions;\n(i)                     \r\n\u2018uncertainty\u2019 means a parameter, associated with\r\nthe result of the determination of a quantity, that characterises the\r\ndispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the particular\r\nquantity, including the effects of systematic as well as of random factors,\r\nexpressed in per cent, and describes a confidence interval around the mean\r\nvalue comprising 95 % of inferred values taking into account any asymmetry of\r\nthe distribution of values;

They can be derived from Annex VI to Commission\r\nRegulation (EU) No\u00b0601/2012 on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas\r\nemissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council[29].\nAppropriate emission factors shall be\r\napplied in respect of biofuels and alternative non-fossil fuel fuels.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 METHODS FOR DETERMINING\r\nEMISSIONS \nThe company shall define in the monitoring\r\nplan which monitoring methodology is used to calculate fuel consumption for\r\neach ship type under its responsibility and ensure that once it has been\r\nchosen, is consistently applied.\nIn selecting a monitoring methodology, the\r\nimprovements from greater accuracy shall be balanced against the additional\r\ncosts. \nActual fuel consumption for each voyage\r\nshall be used and be calculated using one of the following methods:\n(a)                   \r\nBunker Fuel Delivery Note (BDN) and periodic\r\nstocktakes of fuel tanks;\n(b)                   \r\nBunker fuel tank monitoring on board;\n(c)                   \r\nFlow meters for applicable combustion processes;\n(d)                   \r\nDirect emissions measurements.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Method A:BDN (Bunker\r\nDelivery Notes) and periodic stock-takes of fuel tanks \nThis method is based on the quantity and type\r\nof fuel as defined on the BDN combined with periodic stock-takes of fuel tanks\r\nbased on tank readings. The fuel at the beginning of the period, plus\r\ndeliveries, minus fuel available at the end of the period and de-bunkered fuel\r\nbetween the beginning of the period and the end of the period together\r\nconstitute the fuel consumed over the period.\nThe period includes time between two port calls\r\nor time within a port. For the fuel used during a period, the fuel type and the\r\nsulphur content need to be specified.\nThis approach shall not be used when BDN are\r\nnot available on board of ships, especially when cargo is used as a fuel, for\r\nexample, liquefied natural gas (LNG) boil-off.\nThe BDN is mandated under existing MARPOL Annex\r\nVI Regulations and relevant records are retained on board for 3 years after the\r\ndelivery of the bunker fuel and be readily available. The periodic stock-take\r\nof fuel tanks on-board is based on fuel tank readings. It uses tank tables\r\nrelevant to each fuel tank to determine the volume at the time of the fuel tank\r\nreading. The uncertainty associated with the BDN shall be specified in the\r\nmonitoring plan referred to in Article 6. Fuel tank readings shall be carried\r\nout by appropriate methods such as automated systems, soundings and dip tapes.\r\nThe method for tank sounding and uncertainty associated shall be specified in\r\nthe monitoring plan referred to in Article 6.\nWhere the amount of fuel uplift or the amount\r\nof fuel remaining in the tanks is determined in units of volume, expressed in\r\nlitres, the company shall convert that amount from volume to mass by using\r\nactual density values. The company shall determine the actual density by using\r\none of the following: \n(a)         \r\non-board measurement systems; \n(a)         \r\nthe density measured by the fuel supplier at\r\nfuel uplift and recorded on the fuel invoice or delivery note. \nThe actual density shall be expressed in\r\nkg/litre and determined for the applicable temperature for a specific\r\nmeasurement. In cases for which actual density values are not available, a\r\nstandard density factor for the relevant fuel type shall be applied upon\r\napproval by the verifier.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Method B: Bunker fuel tank\r\nmonitoring on-board\nThis method is based on fuel tank readings for\r\nall fuel tanks on-board. The tank readings shall occur daily when the ship is\r\nat sea and each time the ship is bunkering or de-bunkering.\nThe cumulative variations of the fuel tank\r\nlevel between two readings constitute the fuel consumed over the period.\nThe period means time between two port calls or\r\ntime within a port. For the fuel used during a period, the fuel type and the\r\nsulphur content need to be specified.\nFuel tank readings shall be carried out by\r\nappropriate methods such as automated systems, soundings and dip tapes. The\r\nmethod for tank sounding and uncertainty associated shall be specified in the\r\nmonitoring plan referred to in Article 6.\nWhere the amount of fuel uplift or the amount\r\nof fuel remaining in the tanks is determined in units of volume, expressed in\r\nlitres, the company shall convert that amount from volume to mass by using\r\nactual density values. The company shall determine the actual density by using\r\none of the following:\n(a)         \r\non-board measurement systems; \n(b)         \r\nthe density measured by the fuel supplier at\r\nfuel uplift and recorded on the fuel invoice or delivery note. \nThe actual density shall be expressed in\r\nkg/litre and determined for the applicable temperature for a specific\r\nmeasurement.

The data from all flow meters linked to relevant emission sources\r\nshall be combined to determine all fuel consumption for a specific period.\nThe period means time between two port calls or\r\ntime within a port. For the fuel used during a period, the fuel type and the\r\nsulphur content need to be monitored.\nThe calibration methods applied and the\r\nuncertainty associated with flow meters used shall be specified in the\r\nmonitoring plan referred to in Article 6.\nWhere the amount of fuel consumed is determined\r\nin units of volume, expressed in litres, the company shall convert that amount\r\nfrom volume to mass by using actual density values. The company shall determine\r\nthe actual density by using one of the following:\n(a)         \r\non-board measurement systems;\n(b)         \r\nthe density measured by the fuel supplier at\r\nfuel uplift and recorded on the fuel invoice or delivery note. \nThe actual density shall be expressed in\r\nkg/litre and determined for the applicable temperature for a specific\r\nmeasurement.

CO2 emitted shall\r\ninclude CO2 emitted by main engines, auxiliary engines, boilers and\r\ninert gas generators. For ships on which reporting is based on this method, the\r\nfuel consumption shall be calculated using the measured CO2\r\nemissions and the applicable emission factor of the relevant fuels.\nThis method is based on the determination of CO2\r\nemission flows in exhaust gas stacks (funnels) by multiplying the CO2\r\nconcentration of the exhaust gas with the exhaust gas flow.\nThe calibration methods applied and the\r\nuncertainty associated with the devices used shall be specified in the\r\nmonitoring plan referred to in Article 6.\nANNEX II\nMonitoring of other\r\nclimate-relevant information\nA.- Monitoring on a per voyage basis\r\n(Article 9)\nFor the purposes of monitoring other\r\nclimate-relevant information on a per-voyage basis (Article 9), companies shall\r\nrespect the following rules:\nThe date and hour of departure and arrival\r\nshall be considered using Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The time spent at sea\r\nshall be calculated based on port departure and arrival information and shall\r\nexlude ankering.\nThe distance travelled can be the distance\r\nof the most direct route between the port of departure and the port of arrival\r\nor the real distance travelled. In the event of the use of the distance of the\r\nmost direct route between the port of departure and the port of arrival, conservative\r\ncorrection factor should be taken into account to ensure that the distance\r\ntravelled is not significantly underestimated. The monitoring plan referred to\r\nin Article 6 shall specify which distance calculation is used and, if\r\nnecessary, the correction factor used. The distance travelled shall be\r\nexpressed in nautical-miles.\nFor passenger ships, the number of\r\npassengers shall be used to express cargo carried. For all other categories of ships,\r\nthe amount of cargo carried shall be expressed as metric tonnes and cubic\r\nmeters of cargo.\nTransport work shall be determined by\r\nmultiplying the distance travelled with the amount of cargo carried.\nB. Monitoring on a yearly basis\r\n(Article10)\nFor the purposes of monitoring other\r\nclimate-relevant information on a yearly basis, companies shall respect the\r\nfollowing rules:\nThe values to be\r\nmonitored according to Article 10 should be determined by aggregation of the\r\nrespective per voyage data.\nAverage energy efficiency shall be\r\nmonitored by using at least four indicators, fuel consumption per distance, the\r\nfuel consumption per transport work, the CO2 emissions per distance\r\nand the CO2 emissions per transport work, which shall be calculated\r\nas follows:\nFuel consumption per distance = total annual\r\nfuel consumption / total distance travelled\nFuel consumption per transport work = total\r\nannual fuel consumption / total transport work\nCO2 emissions per distance = total\r\nannual CO2 emissions / total distance travelled\nCO2 emissions per transport work\r\n= total annual CO2 emissions / total transport work\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Title of the proposal/initiative \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Policy\r\narea(s) concerned in the ABM/ABB structure\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nature\r\nof the proposal/initiative \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objectives\r\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds\r\nfor the proposal/initiative \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration\r\nand financial impact \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management\r\nmode(s) envisaged \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring\r\nand reporting rules \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management\r\nand control system \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures\r\nto prevent fraud and irregularities \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s)\r\nof the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimated\r\nimpact on expenditure \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.2.1.

This\r\ntranslates into net costs savings of up to \u20ac 1.2 billion annual net savings for\r\nthe sector in 2030 due to reduced fuel bills.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\r\nimpact \nSpecify the\r\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nNumber and percentage of ships that are monitoring and reporting\r\ntheir emissions in line with the regulation compared to the number of ships calling\r\ninto EU ports\nAnnual CO2 emissions from maritime transport within the\r\nEU scope, measured on board and based on fuel consumption\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nToday, the precise amount of CO2 and other GHG emissions\r\nof EU-related maritime transport is not known due to the lack of monitoring and\r\nreporting of such emissions. The impact assessment and stakeholder consultation\r\nidentified that a robust system for monitoring, reporting and verification\r\n(MRV) of greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport is a prerequisite for\r\nany market-based measure, whether applied at EU level or globally.\nBy introducing MRV as a first step, more time can be dedicated to\r\nthe discussion and decision making on emission reduction targets and\r\nmarket-based measures to achieve these reductions at minimum cost. This is\r\nparticularly relevant for discussions at global level in the IMO. Furthermore,\r\na robust MRV system should contribute to the removal of market barriers, in\r\nparticular related to the lack of information on ship efficiency. \nFor further explanations please consult the explanatory memorandum\r\nof the proposal\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nAs the overarching climate change commitments are made at the Union\r\nlevel including the emissions reduction target for the maritime transport\r\nsector for 2050 as established by the White Paper on Transport, it is effective\r\nto also develop the required rules for MRV at this level. Moreover, this legal\r\nframework will ensure effectiveness by employing harmonised MRV for ship voyages between ports of different Member States which\r\naccount for about 90% of port calls in EU Member\r\nStates. Furthermore, acting at the EU level could avoid competitive distortion\r\nin the internal market by ensuring equal environmental constraints on ships\r\ncalling into EU ports.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nMeasures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors,\r\nnotably the EU-ETS as world's largest cap and trade system, demonstrate the\r\nneed for robust rules for monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions.\r\nThe aim is to ensure a common understanding on the definition of one tonne of\r\nCO2 emitted by an installation or by an operator.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nAlthough the proposal MRV rules for the maritime transport sector\r\ntake full account of the specific aspects of this transport mode, the basic\r\nmonitoring and reporting approach is comparable to the MRV used within the\r\nscope of the EU-ETS.\nThis should allow the comparison of efforts for emission reductions\r\nby different sectors and transport modes.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \nX Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from 2016\r\nto 2017,\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation by 2018.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\r\nenvisaged[32]\nX Centralised direct management by the\r\nCommission \n\u00a8 Centralised indirect management with\r\nthe delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[33]\r\n\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\r\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\r\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\r\n\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\r\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\r\n\"Comments\" section.\nComments \nThe\r\nmeasures required for implementation of the proposed MRV system with budgetary\r\nimplications are exclusively related to the development of IT tools, more\r\nprecisely the extension of existing tools operated by the European Maritime\r\nSafety Agency, including administrative expenses.
