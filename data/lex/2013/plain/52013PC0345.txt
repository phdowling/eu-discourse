Denmark and the United Kingdom made use of their opt-out clauses\nand were not, therefore, assessed by the Council. Greece and Sweden were considered by the Council as Member States with a derogation. On 19 June 2000, the\nCouncil decided that Greece fulfilled the necessary conditions to adopt the\neuro on 1 January 2001. The countries which joined the European Union on 1 May\n2004 (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia) became Member States with a derogation in accordance\nwith Article 4 of the respective Act of Accession. On 11 July 2006, the Council\ndecided that Slovenia fulfilled the necessary conditions to adopt the euro on 1\nJanuary 2007. Bulgaria and Romania, who joined the European Union on 1 January\n2007, became Member States with a derogation in accordance with Article 5 of\nthe respective Act of Accession. On 10 July 2007, the Council decided that Cyprus and Malta fulfilled the necessary conditions to adopt the euro on 1 January 2008. On 8 July\n2008, the Council decided that Slovakia fulfilled the necessary conditions for\nadopting the euro as of 1 January 2009. On 13 July 2010, the Council decided\nthat Estonia fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the euro as of 1\nJanuary 2011. Croatia will join the European Union on 1 July 2013 and will become\na Member State with a derogation in accordance with Article 5 of the Act of\nAccession.\nArticles 140(1) of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union ('the Treaty') provides that at least once\nevery two years or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the\nCommission and the European Central Bank have to report to the Council on the\nprogress made in the fulfilment by Member States with a derogation of their\nobligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union. Based on\nits own report and that of the ECB, the Commission can submit to the Council a\nproposal for a Council decision, in accordance to the procedure laid down in\nArticle 140(2) of the Treaty, to abrogate the derogation of the Member States\nfulfilling the necessary conditions.\nThe previous Commission and ECB regular\nConvergence Reports were adopted in May 2012. On 5 March 2013, Latvia submitted a request for a new convergence assessment with a view to introduce the\neuro on 1 January 2014 in case the derogation were to be abrogated.\nAs a response to this request, the Commission and the ECB prepared Convergence\nReports for Latvia. \nThe Commission Convergence Report 2013 on Latvia was adopted by the College on 5 June 2013. The ECB adopted its report on 3 June. The\nreports include an examination of the compatibility between Latvia's national legislation, including the statutes of its national central bank, with Articles\n130 and 131 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB. The\nreports also examine the achievement of a high degree of sustainable\nconvergence by reference to the fulfilment of the convergence criteria and take\naccount of several other factors required under the final sub-paragraph of\nArticle 140(1) of the Treaty.\nIn its Convergence Report, the Commission\nconcludes that Latvia fulfils the conditions for the adoption of the euro.\nOn the basis of its report and that of the\nECB, the Commission has adopted the attached proposal for a Council decision to\nabrogate the derogation of Latvia with effect from 1 January 2014.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nDiscussions with Member States on economic\npolicy challenges in Member States are held under various headings on a regular\nbasis in the Economic and Financial Committee and ECOFIN/Eurogroup. These\ninclude informal discussions on issues specifically relevant to the preparation\nof eventual euro area entry (incl. exchange rate policies). Dialogue with\nacademics and other interested groups takes place in the context of\nconferences/seminars and on an ad-hoc basis.\nEconomic developments in the euro area and\nthe Member States are assessed in the framework of the various procedures of\neconomic policy co-ordination and surveillance (notably under Art. 121 of the\nTreaty), as well as in the context of the Commission\u2019s regular monitoring and\nanalysis of country-specific and area-wide developments (incl. forecasts,\nregular publication series, input to EFC and ECOFIN/Eurogroup). In accordance\nwith the proportionality principle and in line with past practice, the\nCommission proposes not to develop a formal impact assessment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe legal basis for the present proposal is\nArticle 140(2) of the Treaty, which lays down the procedure for a Council\ndecision on euro adoption and for abrogation of the derogation in the concerned\nMember States. \nThe Council shall act on a proposal from\nthe Commission, after consulting the European Parliament, after discussion in\nthe European Council and after having received a recommendation of a qualified\nmajority of those among its members representing Member States whose currency\nis the euro. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and proportionality\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\nThe present initiative does not go beyond\nwhat is necessary to achieve its objective and, therefore, complies with the\nproportionality principle.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of the legal\ninstrument\nThe Decision instrument is the only\nappropriate legal instrument according to Article 140(2) of the Treaty. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implications for the\nbudget of the Union.\n2013/0190 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the adoption by Latvia of the euro on 1 January 2014\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 140(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\nCommission,\nHaving regard to the report from the European\nCommission[1],\nHaving regard to the report from the\nEuropean Central Bank[2],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Parliament,\nHaving regard to the discussion in the\nEuropean Council, \nHaving regard to the recommendation of the\nmembers of the Council representing Member States whose currency is the euro,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The third stage of\neconomic and monetary union ('EMU') started on 1 January 1999. The Council,\nmeeting in Brussels on 3 May 1998 in the composition of Heads of State or\nGovernment, decided that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland fulfilled the necessary\nconditions for adopting the euro on 1 January 1999[3].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Decision 2000/427/EC[4] the Council decided that Greece fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the euro on 1 January 2001. By\nDecision 2006/495/EC[5]\nthe Council decided that Slovenia fulfilled the necessary conditions for\nadopting the euro on 1 January 2007. By Decisions 2007/503/EC[6] and 2007/504/EC[7] the Council decided that Cyprus and Malta fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the euro on 1 January 2008. By\ndecision 2008/608/EC[8]\nthe Council decided that Slovakia fulfilled the necessary conditions for\nadopting the euro. By decision 2010/416/EU[9]\nthe Council decided that Estonia fulfilled the necessary conditions for\nadopting the euro.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naccordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland annexed to the Treaty\nestablishing the European Community ('EC Treaty'), the United Kingdom notified the Council that it did not intend to move to the third stage of EMU on 1\nJanuary 1999. This notification\nhas not been changed. In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain\nprovisions relating to Denmark annexed to the EC Treaty and the Decision taken\nby the Heads of State or Government in Edinburgh in December 1992, Denmark has notified the Council that it will not participate in the third stage of EMU. Denmark has not requested that the procedure referred to in Article 140(2) of the Treaty on\nthe Functioning of the European Union ('the Treaty') be initiated.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\nvirtue of Decision 98/317/EC Sweden has a derogation as defined in Article 139(1)\nof the Treaty. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2003\nAct of Accession[10],\nthe Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and Poland have a derogation as\ndefined in Article 139(1) of the Treaty. In accordance with Article 5 of\nthe 2005 Act of Accession[11],\n Bulgaria and Romania have a derogation as defined in Article 139(1) of\nthe Treaty. In accordance with Article 5 of the Act of Accession[12], Croatia has a derogation as\ndefined in Article 139(1) of the Treaty.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nEuropean Central Bank ('ECB') was\nestablished on 1 July 1998. The European Monetary System has been replaced by an exchange rate mechanism, the setting-up of\nwhich was agreed by a resolution\nof the European Council on the establishment of an exchange-rate mechanism in\nthe third stage of economic and monetary union of 16 June 1997[13]. The procedures for an\nexchange-rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union (ERM II)\nwere laid down in the Agreement of 16 March 2006 between the European Central\nBank and the national central banks of the Member States outside the euro area\nlaying down the operating procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in stage\nthree of economic and monetary union[14].\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article\n140(2) of the Treaty lays down the\nprocedures for abrogation of the derogation of the Member States concerned. At least once every two\nyears, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the Commission\nand the ECB shall report to the Council in accordance with the procedure laid\ndown in Article 140(1) of the Treaty. On 5 March 2013, Latvia submitted a formal request for a convergence assessment. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 National\nlegislation in the Member States including the statutes of national central\nbanks, is to be adapted as necessary with a view to ensuring compatibility with\nArticles 130 and 131 of the Treaty\nand the Statute of the European System of Central Banks\nand of the European Central Bank ('Statute of the ESCB and\nof the ECB'). The reports of the Commission and the ECB provide a detailed\nassessment of the compatibility of the legislation of Latvia with Articles 130 and 131 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According\nto Article 1 of the Protocol No 13 on the convergence criteria referred to in\nArticle 140 of the Treaty, the criterion on price stability referred to in the\nfirst indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has a\nprice performance that is sustainable and an average rate of inflation,\nobserved over a period of one year\nbefore the examination, that does not exceed by more than one and a half\npercentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in\nterms of price stability. For the purpose of the criterion on price stability,\ninflation will be measured by the harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICPs)\ndefined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 of 23\nOctober 1995 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices[15]. In order to assess the price stability criterion a Member State's inflation is measured by the percentage change in the arithmetic average of 12\nmonthly indices relative to the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices of the\nprevious period. A reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average\nof the inflation rates of the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability plus 1.5 percentage points was considered in the\nreports of the Commission and the ECB. In the one-year period ending in April\n2013, the inflation reference value was calculated to\nbe 2.7 percent, with Sweden, Latvia and Ireland as the three best-performing\nMember States in terms of price stability, with inflation\nrates of, respectively 0.8 percent, 1.3 percent and 1.6 percent. It is warranted to exclude from the best performers countries whose inflation\nrates could not be seen as a meaningful benchmark for other Member States. Such\noutliers were in the past identified in the 2004 and 2010 Convergence Reports.\nAt the current juncture, it is warranted to exclude Greece from the best\nperformers, as its inflation rate and profile deviate by a wide margin from the\neuro area average, mainly reflecting the severe adjustment needs and\nexceptional situation of the Greek economy, and including it would unduly\naffect the reference value and thus the fairness of the criterion[16].\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article 2 of\nthe Protocol No 13, the criterion on the government budgetary position referred\nto in the second indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty shall mean that at the\ntime of the examination the Member State is not the subject of a Council\ndecision under Article 126(6) of the Treaty that an excessive deficit exists.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According\nto Article 3 of the Protocol No 13, the criterion on participation in the\nexchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System referred to in the\nthird indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has\nrespected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the\nexchange-rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System without severe\ntensions for at least the last two years before the examination. In particular,\nthe Member State must not have devalued its currency's bilateral central rate\nagainst the euro on its own initiative for the same period. Since 1 January\n1999 the ERM II provides the framework for assessing the fulfillment of the\nexchange rate criterion. In assessing the fulfillment of this criterion in\ntheir reports, the Commission and the ECB have examined the two-year period\nending on 16 May 2013.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According\nto Article 4 of the Protocol No 13, the criterion on the convergence of\ninterest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty\nmeans that, observed over a period\nof one year before the examination, a Member State has had an average nominal\nlong-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than two percentage points\nthat of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price\nstability. For the purpose of the\ncriteria on the convergence of interest rates, comparable interest rates on\n10-year benchmark government bonds were used. In order to assess the\nfulfillment of the interest-rate criterion a reference value calculated as the\nsimple arithmetic average of the nominal long-term interest rates of the three\nbest performing Member States in terms of price stability plus two percentage\npoints was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this\nbasis, the reference value in the one year period ending in April 2013 was 5.5 percent.\n\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naccordance with Article 5 of the Protocol No 13, the data used in the current\nassessment of the fulfillment of the convergence criteria will be provided by\nthe Commission. For the preparation of this proposal the Commission provided\ndata. Budgetary data were provided\nby the Commission after reporting by the Member States by 1 April 2013 in\naccordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the\napplication of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the\nTreaty establishing the European Community[17].\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the\nbasis of reports presented by the Commission and the ECB on the progress made\nin the fulfillment by Latvia of its obligations regarding the achievement of\neconomic and monetary union, it is concluded that:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in Latvia, national legislation,\nincluding the Statute of the national central bank, is compatible with Articles\n130 and 131 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 regarding the fulfillment by Latvia of the convergence criteria mentioned in the four indents\nof Article 140(1) of the Treaty:\n\u2013              \nthe average inflation rate in Latvia in the year ending in April 2013 stood at 1.3 percent, which is well below the reference\nvalue, and it is likely to remain below the reference value in the months\nahead,\n\u2013              \nthe budget deficit in Latvia has seen a credible\nand sustainable reduction to below 3 percent of GDP by the end of 2012; By\nDecision 2013/\u2026/EU[18]\nthe Council, acting on a recommendation from the Commission, abrogated Decision\n2009/591/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in Latvia,\n\u2013              \nLatvia has been a member\nof ERM II since 2 May 2005; upon ERM II entry, the authorities unilaterally\ncommitted to keep the lats within the \u00b11% fluctuation margin around the central\nrate. During the two years preceding this assessment, the lats exchange rate\ndid not deviate from its central rate by more than \u00b11% and it did not\nexperience tensions,\n\u2013              \nin the year ending April 2013, the long-term\ninterest rate in Latvia was, on average, 3.8 percent which is below the\nreference value.\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the assessment on\nlegal compatibility and on the fulfilment of the convergence criteria as well\nas the additional factors, Latvia fulfils the necessary conditions for the\nadoption of the euro,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nLatvia fulfils the\nnecessary conditions for the adoption of the euro.
