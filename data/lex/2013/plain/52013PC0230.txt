Negotiations with Indonesia started in 2005 and were concluded in June 2007.\nThe Commission initialled the PCA in July 2007 and Indonesia initialled in July\n2009. The Agreement was co-signed on 9 November 2009 in Jakarta. \nThis comprehensive EU-Indonesia Partnership\nand Co-operation Agreement (PCA) was the first of its kind between the EU and\nASEAN countries. It is a testimony to the rapidly growing importance of\nEU-Indonesian ties and opens a new era in bilateral relations, based on shared\nprinciples such as equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit, democracy, rule of\nlaw and human rights. \nThe Agreement strengthens political,\neconomic and sectoral cooperation across a wide range of policy fields,\nincluding trade, environment, energy, science and technology, and good governance,\nas well as tourism and culture, migration, counter terrorism and the fight\nagainst corruption and organised crime. It will further enhance cooperation on\nresponding to global challenges, where both Indonesia and the EU are playing an\nincreasingly important role, such as in the G20.\nThe PCA will allow the EU to assume greater\nresponsibility and influence in the region. By virtue of the PCA, the EU will\npromote European values and enhance concrete cooperation in a wide range of\nareas of mutual interest. The PCA will be regarded as a positive example for an\ninter-cultural/religious dialogue, given that Indonesia is the third most\npopulous country in Asia and the largest Muslim country in the world.\nThe conclusion of the PCA is in line with\nthe EU's objective of creating a comprehensive and coherent economic and\npolitical framework for relations between the EU and ASEAN countries.\nIn accordance with standing case-law of the\nCourt, the Commission takes the view that, since the entry into force of the\nTreaty of Lisbon and the integration of CFSP into Union policies, framework\nagreements such as the PCA with Indonesia are entirely covered by competences\nconferred upon the EU by the Treaties. Therefore, it is the view of the\nCommission that such agreements are EU only bilateral agreements.\nThe fact that the Commission has submitted\nits proposal as an agreement of the Union and its Member States with Indonesia is exclusively linked to the genesis of this specific agreement under the rules of the\nTreaty before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the\ninternational obligations that result therefrom for the Union.\nThe Commission notes that the Final Act\ncontains the following Unilateral Declaration by the European Community:\n\"The\nprovisions of the Agreement that fall within the scope of Part III, Title IV of\nthe Treaty establishing the European Community bind the United Kingdom and\nIreland as separate Contracting Parties, and not as part of the European\nCommunity, until the United Kingdom or Ireland (as the case may be) notifies\nthe Republic of Indonesia that it has become bound as part of the European\nCommunity in accordance with the Protocol on the position of the\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the\nTreaty establishing the European Community. The same applies to Denmark, in accordance with the Protocol annexed to those Treaties on the position of Denmark.\"\nAs the\nProposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the PCA Indonesia is not\nbased on any legal basis of Title V of Part III of the TFEU, the Commission\nconsiders that the Unilateral Declaration above has become without object. The\nCommission therefore considers that, at the occasion of the adoption of the\nCouncil Decision on the conclusion, the Council and the Commission should make\nthe following joint declaration: \n\"The Council\nand the Commission note that the decision to conclude the PCA with Indonesia is adopted on the basis of Article 207 and 209 TFEU and not \"pursuant to\nTitle V of the Part Three of the TFEU\". Therefore, the Unilateral\nDeclaration made by the European Community at the occasion of the signature of\nthe Final Act has become without object.\"\n2013/0120 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion of the Framework\nAgreement on Comprehensive Partnership and cooperation between the European\nCommunity and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of\nIndonesia, of the other part\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 207 and 209, in\nconjunction with Article 218(6)(a) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\nEuropean Parliament,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\ndecision of the Council of 5 November 2009[1],\nthe Framework Agreement on\nComprehensive Partnership and cooperation between the European Community and\nits Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Indonesia, of the other\npart was signed on 9 November 2009, subject to its conclusion at a later date.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement should be\napproved on behalf of the European Union.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle\n1\nThe Framework Agreement on Comprehensive\nPartnership and cooperation between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Indonesia, of the other part is hereby approved on behalf of the Union. \nThe text of the Agreement is attached to\nthis Decision.\nArticle\n2\nThe High Representative of the Union/Vice\nPresident of the Commission or a representative of the High Representative of\nthe Union/Vice President of the Commission shall chair the Joint Committee\nprovided for in Article 41 of the Agreement.\nArticle\n3\nThe President of the Council shall\ndesignate the person empowered to give, on behalf of the European Union, the\nnotification provided for in Article 48(1) of the Agreement.\nArticle\n4\nThis\nDecision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.
