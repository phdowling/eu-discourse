On\nconclusion of these negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 26 July 2012\nand has been provisionally applied since 16 December 2012, the date of its\nsignature. The new Protocol covers a period of two years from the date of its\nsignature.\nThe allocation\nof fishing opportunities granted to the European Union under the new Protocol\nwas carried out through Council Regulation (EU) No 1259/2012 of 3 December 2012\non the allocation of the fishing opportunities under the Protocol setting out\nthe fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the\nFisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Islamic\nRepublic of Mauritania for a period of two years, and amending Regulation (EC)\nNo 1801/2006[1].\nThe Joint\nCommittee between the European Union and Mauritania, provided for by Article 10\nof the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, met in Paris on 19 and 20 February\n2013. The Joint Committee confirmed in the minutes of 20 February 2013 the\nEuropean Union\u2019s request to transfer three licences for category 6 to category\n5 in accordance with France\u2019s fishing plans and the trade strategy of its fleet\nand in agreement with all the Member States concerned.\nFollowing that\nmeeting, the Protocol now provides for the following annual tuna fishing\nopportunities:\n\u2013                        \n25 tuna seiners (compared to 22 tuna seiners\npreviously);\n\u2013                        \n19 pole-and-line tuna vessels or surface\nlongliners (compared to 22 pole-and-line tuna vessels or surface longliners\npreviously). \nIt is\ntherefore necessary to redefine the fixing and allocation of fishing\nopportunities in categories 5 and 6. Consequently Council Regulation (EU) No\n1259/2012 must be amended as regards the allocation of these fishing\nopportunities.\nHaving regard\nto the fact that this redefinition concerns only the allocation of fishing\nopportunities granted to France and has no effect on the interests of other\nMember States; that fishing opportunities overall are not affected; that the\nEuropean Union\u2019s financial contribution remains the same; and that, considering\nthe present risk of under-utilisation of the Protocol, it is important to\ntransfer these licences without delay. For this reason this provision must have\nretroactive effect as from 20 February 2013, the date of signature of the Joint\nCommittee\u2019s minutes. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe interested parties were consulted ahead\nof the meeting of the Joint Committee. Experts from the Member States were also\nconsulted in technical meetings. It was concluded during the consultations that\nit would be useful to make these amendments in agreement with Mauritania. This\nwill not result in changes in tuna fishing opportunities overall and therefore\ndoes not affect the resource. Furthermore, it has no financial impact on the\nEuropean Union\u2019s financial contribution. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONCLUSIONS\nThe Commission\nproposes therefore that the Council adopt this Regulation amending Regulation\n(EU) No 1259/2012.\n2013/0194 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU) No 1259/2012 on\nthe allocation of the fishing opportunities provided for in the Fisheries\nPartnership Agreement between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of\nMauritania \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 30 November 2006, the\nCouncil adopted Regulation (EC) No 1801/2006 on the conclusion of the\nFisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic\nRepublic of Mauritania[2]\n(\u2018the Partnership Agreement\u2019). \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A new Protocol setting out\nthe fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the\npartnership agreement provisionally applied since 16 December 2012, the date of\nits signature, in compliance with Council Decision 827/2012/EU[3]. The new Protocol grants\nvessels of the European Union fishing opportunities in waters in which\nMauritania exercises its jurisdiction as regards fishing. The allocation of\nfishing opportunities granted to the European Union under the new Protocol was\ncarried out through Council Regulation (EU) No 1259/2012 of 3 December 2012 on\nthe allocation of the fishing opportunities under the Protocol setting out the\nfishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries\nPartnership Agreement between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of\nMauritania for a period of two years, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1801/2006[4].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Joint Committee\nbetween the European Union and Mauritania provided for in Article 10 of the\nPartnership Agreement met on 19 and 20 February 2013. In compliance with the\nminutes of that meeting, both parties agreed to redefine the allocation of\nfishing opportunities between categories 5 (tuna seiners) and 6 (pole-and-line\ntuna vessels and surface longliners) provided for in the new Protocol. \nThis redefinition concerns only the\nallocation of fishing opportunities granted to France and has no effect on the\ninterests of other Member States. Fishing opportunities overall are not\naffected. The European Union\u2019s financial contribution remains the same. In\naddition, considering the present under-utilisation of the Protocol, it is\nimportant to transfer these licences without delay. Consequently this\nRegulation should enter into force immediately following its publication and be\napplicable from 20 February 2013, the date of signature of the Joint\nCommittee's minutes and of the redefinition of fishing opportunities, \nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nIn Article 1, paragraph 1, of Regulation\n(EU) No 1259/2012, points (e) and (f) are replaced by the following text:\n\u2018(e) Category 5 - Tuna seiners \nSpain 17 licences \nFrance\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8 licences\n(f) Category 6 - Pole-and-line tuna vessels\nand surface longliners \nSpain 18 licences\nFrance\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 licence\u2019\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\nthe day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union.\nIt shall apply from 20 February 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 361, 31.12.2012, p. 87.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 343, 8.12.2006, p. 1.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 361, 31.12.2012, p. 10.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 361, 31.12.2012, p. 87.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
