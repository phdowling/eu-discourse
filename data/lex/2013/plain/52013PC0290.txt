At the 13th EU-Ukraine\nSummit in Paris in 2008, the leaders of the EU and Ukraine agreed that the\nPartnership and Co-operation Agreement should be succeeded by an Association\nAgreement.\nThe EU-Ukraine\nAssociation Agreement is the first of a new generation of Association\nAgreements with Eastern Partnership countries. Negotiations of this comprehensive and ambitious Agreement\nbetween the EU and Ukraine were launched in March 2007. In February 2008,\nfollowing the decision of accession of Ukraine to the WTO, the EU and Ukraine launched negotiations on a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) as a core\nelement of the Association Agreement.\nThe Association\nAgreement aims to accelerate the deepening of political and economic relations\nbetween Ukraine and the EU, as well as Ukraine's gradual access to parts of the\nEU Internal Market including by setting up a DCFTA. It is a concrete way to\nexploit the dynamics in EU-Ukraine relations, focusing on support to core\nreforms, on economic recovery and growth, governance and sector co-operation.\nThe Agreement also constitutes a reform agenda for Ukraine, based on a\ncomprehensive programme of approximation of Ukraine\u2019s legislation to EU norms,\naround which all partners of Ukraine can align themselves and focus their\nassistance. EU assistance to Ukraine is linked with the reform agenda as it\nemerges from the Agreement. The Comprehensive Institutional Building Programme\nis particularly important in this regard.\nAt the 15th Ukraine-EU\nSummit of 19 December 2011, the EU and the President of Ukraine noted that a\ncommon understanding on the text of the Association Agreement was reached. On\n30 March 2012, the chief negotiators of the European Union and Ukraine initialled the text of the Association Agreement. The trade negotiators from both\nsides initialled the DCFTA part of the Agreement on 19 July 2012. \nOn 10 December 2012,\nthe Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions on Ukraine, expressing the EU's\ncommitment to the signing of the Association Agreement, including a DCFTA, as\nsoon as the Ukrainian authorities demonstrate determined action and tangible\nprogress in the three areas (Elections, selective justice, and overall reforms\nas set out in the Association Agenda), possibly by the time of the Eastern\nPartnership Summit in Vilnius in November 2013. The Council also indicated that\nthe signature of the Agreement could be accompanied by opening for provisional\napplication of parts of the Agreement. The provisional application is foreseen\nin view of keeping mutual economic\ninterests and shared values in equilibrium, and the common will of the EU and Ukraine to start implementing\nand enforcing various parts of the Agreement in order to advance an early\nreform impact on sector specific issues before the conclusion of the Agreement.\nAs requested by the 10\nDecember Council Conclusions, the\nHigh Representative and the Commission are monitoring and keeping the Council\ninformed about progress achieved by Ukraine in meeting the requirements set out\nby the Council conclusions, including in the context of the preparations of the\nJune 2013 EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council and November 2013 Eastern Partnership\nSummit in Vilnius.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\nOF THE NEGOTIATIONS\nMember States have been\nregularly informed and consulted in the relevant Council Working Groups,\nnotably in COEST and Trade Policy Committee (TPC), at all stages of the\nnegotiations. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council\nin its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft Association\nAgreement is acceptable to the Union.\nThe final content of\nthe Association Agreement can be summarised as follows:\nThe Agreement establishes\nan association between the Union and its Member States of the one part and Ukraine of the other part. This constitutes a new stage in the development of EU-Ukraine\ncontractual relations, aiming at political association and economic integration\nand leaving open the way for further progressive developments. \nThe overall aims of the\nassociation focus on promoting a gradual rapprochement between the parties on\nthe basis of common values; providing enhanced political dialogue; promoting,\npreserving and strengthening peace and stability in both the regional and\ninternational dimensions; establishing conditions for enhanced economic and\ntrade relations leading towards Ukraine's gradual access to parts of the EU\nInternal Market; enhancing Justice, Freedom and Security (JFS) cooperation with\nthe aim of reinforcing the rule of law and respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, and establishing conditions for increasingly close\nco-operation in other areas of mutual interest. \nGeneral Principles of\nthe Agreement include a specific set of \"essential elements\", the\nviolation of which by one of the Parties could give rise to specific measures\nunder the Agreement, including the suspension of rights and obligations. These\nelements are respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms as defined in relevant international instruments; respect for the rule\nof law; promotion of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,\ninviolability and independence; and countering the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction, related materials and means of delivery. \nOther General\nPrinciples of the Agreement relate to the principles of a free market economy,\ngood governance, the fight against corruption, the fight against trans-national\norganized crime and terrorism, the promotion of sustainable development and\neffective multilateralism.\nThe Agreement sets out\nthe aims of an enhanced and strengthened political dialogue promoting gradual\nconvergence on foreign and security matters with the aim of Ukraine's ever\ndeeper involvement in the European security area. The Agreement establishes a\nnumber of fora for the conduct of political dialogue, and provides for dialogue\nand co-operation on domestic reform based on the common principles set out by\nthe Parties. There are also provisions for intensified dialogue on foreign and\nsecurity policy, including CSDP, for the promotion of peace and international\njustice by ratifying and implementing the Rome Statute of the International\nCriminal Court, and for joint efforts on regional stability, conflict\nprevention, crisis management, military/technological co-operation,\nanti-terrorism, anti-proliferation and disarmament and arms control. \nIn the field of JFS,\nthe Agreement pays particular attention to the rule of law and to the\nreinforcement of judicial institutions and practices. The Agreement sets out\nthe framework for co-operation on migration, asylum and border management, on\npersonal data protection, money laundering and terrorism financing and on\nanti-drugs policy. This Title contains provisions on movement of persons,\nincluding on readmission, on visa facilitation and on the gradual steps towards\na visa-free regime in due course (provided that relevant conditions for\nwell-managed and secure mobility are in place). Treatment and mobility of\nworkers are also covered, as is a commitment to further development of judicial\nco-operation in civil and criminal matters - making full use of relevant\ninternational and bilateral instruments. \nThe Association\nAgreement foresees a wide range of sector cooperation, focusing on support to\ncore reforms, economic recovery and growth, governance and sector co-operation\nin more than 30 areas, such as: energy, transport, environment protection,\nindustrial and small and medium enterprise cooperation, social development and\nprotection, equal rights, consumer protection, education, training and youth as\nwell as cultural cooperation. In all of these areas, enhanced co-operation\nstarts from the basis of current frameworks, both bilateral and multilateral,\nwith the aim of more systematic dialogue and exchange of information and good\npractice. Key to the sectoral co-operation chapters is a comprehensive menu of\nregulatory approximation set out in annexes to the Agreement. Specific\nschedules for transposition and implementation by Ukraine of selected parts of\nthe EU acquis will provide a focus for on-going co-operation, and will form the\ncore of Ukraine's domestic reform and modernization agenda. \nThe Agreement includes\nan updated institutional framework encompassing co-operation and dialogue fora\nfrom the Summit level down the level of technical subcommittees. Specific\ndecision-making roles are foreseen for an Association Council, and by\ndelegation for an Association Committee, which may also meet in a specific\nconfiguration to address trade issues. Fora for civil society, notably the\nrepresentative organisations for social partners, trade-unions and employers,\nand parliamentary co-operation are also foreseen. The Agreement also includes\nprovisions on monitoring, fulfilment of obligations and dispute settlement\n(including separate provisions for trade-related issues). \nCloser economic integration through the DCFTA\nwill be a powerful stimulant to the country's economic growth. Approximation of\n  Ukraine to EU legislation, norms and standards, will be the method. As a core\nelement of the Association Agreement, the DCFTA will create business\nopportunities in both the EU and Ukraine and will promote real economic\nmodernization and integration with the EU. Higher standards of products, better\nservices to citizens, and above all Ukraine\u2019s readiness to compete effectively\nin international markets should be the result of this process.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nOn the part of the Union, the legal basis for the\nconclusion of this Agreement is Article 217, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and the second\nsubparagraph of Article 218(8), as well as Article 218(7) of TFEU.\nThe attached proposal constitutes the legal instrument for\nthe conclusion of the Association Agreement.\nIn light of the above-mentioned results - and provided that\nthe Ukrainian authorities\ndemonstrate determined action and tangible progress in the three areas\nidentified by the 10 December 2012 Council Conclusions on Ukraine \u2013 the\nCommission proposes that the Council conclude the Agreement on behalf of the\nEuropean Union after having received the consent of the European Parliament.\nThe fact that the\nCommission has submitted its proposal as an agreement of the Union and its Member States and Ukraine is related to the genesis of this agreement under the rules of the\nTreaty before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.\u00a0 \n2013/0151 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion of the Association\nAgreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part,\nand Ukraine, of the other part\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article(s)\n217, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and the second subparagraph of\nArticle 218(8) thereof, as well as Article 218(7) thereof,\nHaving regard to the\nproposal from the European Commission[1],\nHaving regard to the\nconsent of the European Parliament[2],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n22 January 2007 the Council authorised the Commission\nto open negotiations with Ukraine for\nthe conclusion of a new Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine to replace the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These negotiations were\nsuccessfully finalised and the Association Agreement between the European Union\nand its Member States and Ukraine (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cAgreement\u201d)\nwas initialled in 2012.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Council\nDecision [number of Decision] of [date][3], the\nAssociation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the\none part, and Ukraine, of the other part was signed at [place] on [date],\nsubject to its conclusion at a later date.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 218(7)\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it is appropriate for\nthe Council to authorise the Commission to approve modifications to be adopted\nby the Association Committee in its Trade configuration pursuant to Article 465(4)\nof the Agreement, as proposed by the Sub-Committee on Geographical Indications\npursuant to Article 211 of the Agreement.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to set\nout the relevant procedures for the protection of geographical indications\nwhich are given protection pursuant to the Agreement.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement shall not be\nconstrued as conferring rights or imposing obligations which can be directly\ninvoked before Union or Member State courts and tribunals.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Association Agreement\nshould be approved on behalf of the European Union.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe Association Agreement between the European Union\nand its Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part,\ntogether with the Annexes and Protocols attached thereto, is hereby approved.\nArticle 2\nThe President of the\nCouncil shall designate the person empowered to proceed, on behalf of the\nEuropean Union, to notify the Depository of the Agreement provided in Article\n486(2) of the Agreement, in order to express the consent of the European Union\nto be bound by the Agreement. \nArticle 3\nFor the purposes of\nArticle 211of the Agreement, modifications of the Agreement through decisions of\nthe Sub-Committee on Geographical Indications shall be approved by the\nCommission on behalf of the European Union.
