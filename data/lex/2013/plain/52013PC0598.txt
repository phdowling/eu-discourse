One important tool\r\nin this respect is the annual fixing of fishing opportunities in the form of\r\ntotal allowable catches (TACs), quotas and fishing effort limits.\nThe objective of this proposal is to fix,\r\nfor the commercially most important fish stocks in the Baltic Sea, the fishing\r\nopportunities for Member States for 2014. With a view to simplifying and\r\nclarifying the annual TAC and quota decisions, fishing opportunities in the\r\nBaltic Sea have been fixed by a separate Regulation since 2006.\n\u00b7      General context\nThe Communication from the Commission concerning\r\na consultation on Fishing Opportunities for 2014 (COM(2013) 319 final) outlines\r\nthe background to the proposal.\nThe scientific advice on stocks in the\r\nBaltic Sea for 2014 was delivered by the International Council for the\r\nExploration of the Sea (ICES) in May 2013 and by the Scientific, Technical and\r\nEconomic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) in June 2013.\nThe proposal contains two sections that are\r\nimportant for management of the Baltic fisheries in 2014 through fishing\r\nopportunities: one section fixing the TACs and quotas and a second limiting the\r\nfishing effort, by imposing limits on fishing vessels\u2019 activity (number of days\r\nat sea).\n\u00b7      Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\nFishing opportunities and the way they are\r\nallocated to Member States are regulated annually. The most recent instrument is\r\nCouncil Regulation (EU) No 1088/2012 of 20 November 2012 fixing for 2013 the\r\nfishing opportunities fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the\r\nBaltic Sea.\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21\r\nDecember 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical\r\nmeasures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound, amending Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1434/98 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 88/98, is also of relevance to\r\nfisheries management in the Baltic Sea.\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 of 18\r\nSeptember 2007 establishing a multiannual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic\r\nSea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks, amending Regulation (EEC) No\r\n2847/93 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 779/97, outlines the control and\r\nmonitoring measures necessary for rebuilding the cod stocks in question. It\r\nalso lays down the rules for setting the TACs for the Western and Eastern cod\r\nstocks and the associated fishing effort limitations.\n\u00b7      Consistency with other EU policies and objectives\nThe proposed measures are in accordance\r\nwith the objectives and rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and are consistent\r\nwith the Union\u2019s policy on sustainable development.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u00b7      Collection and use of expertise\nMain organisations/experts consulted\nThe scientific organisations consulted were\r\nthe International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the\r\nScientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).\nThe Union asks ICES and STECF each year for\r\nscientific advice on the state of important fish stocks. The advice received\r\ncovers all Baltic stocks for which TACs are proposed.\n\u00b7      Consultation of interested parties\nThe Baltic Sea Regional Advisory Council (BSRAC)\r\nwas consulted at its Joint Demersal/Pelagic Working Group meeting in June 2013\r\non the basis of the Communication from the Commission concerning Fishing\r\nOpportunities. The scientific basis for the proposal\r\nwas provided by ICES and STECF. At this meeting the rules for setting TACs and\r\nquotas for 2014 on the basis of the Communication were presented. The preliminary views expressed on all the fish stocks concerned\r\nwere considered and taken into account as far as possible in the proposal\r\nwithout contradicting existing policies or causing any deterioration in the\r\nstate of vulnerable resources.\nIn certain cases, the BSRAC supports the Commission\u2019s\r\nattempts to set TACs that are more consistent with scientific advice, as well\r\nas the application of the multiannual plan for cod with regard to the setting\r\nof the TACs. However, it is against the reduction of the number of days-at-sea\r\nspent fishing for cod.\n\u00b7      Impact assessment\nThe TACs for Western cod has been reduced\r\nby 15% and for Eastern cod increased by 7%. Under the proposal, three of the\r\nfive pelagic TACs would increase, and the remaining two TACs would decrease. In\r\ngeneral, the proposed measures would result in an overall increase by 10 %\r\nup to 644 thousand tones in fishing opportunities for Union vessels in the\r\nBaltic Sea for all species except salmon stocks. For salmon stocks the fishing\r\nopportunities will decrease by about 7% and amount to 116 thousand pieces of\r\nsalmon.\nBased on average landed fish prices\r\nobserved in 2011 among eight Baltic Sea countries, the value of fishing opportunities\r\nfor 2014 will increase by 12 million euros to a total value of 412 million\r\neuros.\nThe proposal reflects not only short-term\r\nconcerns but is also part of a longer-term approach whereby the level of\r\nfishing is gradually reduced to long-term sustainable levels. The approach\r\ntaken in line with the proposal will therefore, in the medium to long term,\r\nresult in a stable fishing effort and higher quotas. The long term effects of\r\nthe approach are expected to be more sustainable fishing activities and increased\r\nlandings\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7      Summary of the proposed action\nThe proposal seeks to establish the catch\r\nand effort limitations applicable to EU fisheries, in order to achieve the\r\nobjective of the Common Fisheries Policy of ensuring fisheries at levels that\r\nare biologically, economically and socially sustainable.\n\u00b7      Legal basis\nArticle 43(3) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the Union\u2019s\r\nexclusive competence as referred to in Article 3(1)(d) TFEU. The subsidiarity\r\nprinciple therefore does not apply.\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons.\nThe Common Fisheries Policy is a common\r\npolicy. According to Article 43(3) TFEU it is incumbent upon the Council to\r\nadopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\nThe Council Regulation in question\r\nallocates fishing opportunities to Member States. Having regard to Article\r\n20(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, Member States are free to allocate such\r\nopportunities among regions or operators as they see fit. Therefore, Member\r\nStates have ample room for manoeuvre on decisions related to the\r\nsocial/economic model of their choice to exploit their allocated fishing\r\nopportunities.\nThe proposal has no new financial\r\nimplications for Member States. This particular Regulation is adopted by the\r\nCouncil every year, and the public and private means to implement it are\r\nalready in place.\n\u00b7      Choice of instrument\nProposed instrument: Regulation.\nThis is a proposal for fisheries management\r\non the basis of Article 43(3) TFEU and in accordance with Article 20 of Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 2371/2002.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe proposal has no implications for the EU\r\nbudget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\u00b7      Simplification\nThe proposal continues to provide for\r\nsimplification of administrative procedures for public authorities (EU or\r\nnational), as it contains provisions similar to those of the 2013 Regulation on\r\nthe fishing opportunities in the Baltic Sea.\n\u00b7      Review/revision/sunset clause\nThe proposal concerns an annual Regulation\r\nfor the year 2014 and therefore does not include a revision clause.\n\u00b7      Detailed explanation\nThe proposal fixes for 2014 the fishing opportunities\r\nstocks or groups of stocks for Member States fishing in the Baltic Sea.\nThe proposed figures reflect current scientific\r\nadvice, consultation with the BSRAC and the framework for setting the TACs and\r\nquotas outlined in the Communication from the Commission concerning a consultation\r\non Fishing Opportunities. Where relevant, in order to set the EU quotas for\r\nstocks shared with the Russian Federation, the respective quantities of these\r\nstocks were deducted from the TACs advised by ICES.\nGiven the Commission\u2019s intention of ensuring\r\nthe sustainable use of fishery resources in line with the Union\u2019s policy and\r\ninternational commitments while maintaining stable fishing opportunities,\r\nannual variations in TACs are limited as far as practicable taking account of\r\nthe status of a given stock.\nThe TACs and quotas allocated to Member\r\nStates are shown in Annex I and the fishing effort limits are laid down in\r\nAnnex II to the Regulation.\nFor cod stocks, the proposed TACs and\r\neffort limitations are in line with the requirements of the multiannual plan\r\nfor cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks. The\r\ncentral element of the plan is a gradual reduction in fishing mortality to\r\nlong-term sustainable levels in order to ensure recovery of the stocks and\r\nprovide high and stable yields. After the revision of data and methods used for\r\ncod stocks assessment, the actual and MSY fishing mortalities have been reviewed\r\nand changed accordingly. Taking into account this new information, there is a\r\nneed to reduce fishing effort exerted on both cod stocks by 10% for Western and\r\nby 8.5% for Eastern stock. \nAll pelagic stocks in the Baltic Sea, except\r\nWestern herring, could be fished at MSY level in 2014, therefore the TACs\r\nproposed correspond to the MSY fishing mortality.\n2013/0286 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nfixing for 2014 the fishing opportunities\r\nfor certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n2371/2002 [1] requires that measures\r\ngoverning access to waters and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing\r\nactivities be established taking into account available scientific, technical\r\nand economic advice and, in particular, the report drawn up by the Scientific,\r\nTechnical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) as well as in the light\r\nof any advice received from Regional Advisory Councils.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is incumbent upon the\r\nCouncil to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities\r\nby fishery or group of fisheries, including certain conditions functionally\r\nlinked thereto, as appropriate. Fishing opportunities should be distributed\r\namong Member States in such a way as to assure each Member State relative\r\nstability of fishing activities for each stock or fishery with due regard to\r\nthe objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy established in Regulation (EC) No\r\n2371/2002.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The total allowable\r\ncatches (TACs) should be established on the basis of the available scientific\r\nadvice, taking into account biological and socioeconomic aspects whilst\r\nensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of\r\nopinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders, in particular at\r\nmeetings with the Regional Advisory Councils concerned.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For stocks subject to\r\nspecific multiannual plans, the fishing opportunities should be established in\r\naccordance with the rules laid down in those plans. Consequently, catch limits\r\nand fishing effort limits for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea should be\r\nestablished in accordance with the rules laid down in Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1098/2007 (\u2018the Baltic Sea Cod Plan\u2019) for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea\r\nand the fisheries exploiting those stocks [2].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the\r\nscientific advice, flexibility in the management of the fishing effort for cod\r\nstocks in the Baltic Sea can be introduced without jeopardising the objectives\r\nof the Baltic Sea Cod Plan and without causing an increase in fishing\r\nmortality. Such flexibility would allow for more efficient management of the\r\nfishing effort where quotas are not allocated equally among the fleet of a\r\nMember State and would facilitate swift reactions to quota exchanges. A Member\r\nState should, therefore, be allowed to allocate to vessels flying its flag\r\nadditional days absent from port where an equal amount of days absent from port\r\nis withdrawn from other vessels flying its flag.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of fishing\r\nopportunities as set out in this Regulation should be subject to Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1224/2009 [3], and in particular\r\nArticles 33 and 34 thereof, concerning the recording of catches and fishing effort\r\nand the information on data on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities. It is\r\ntherefore necessary to specify the codes relating to landings of stocks subject\r\nto this Regulation which are to be used by the Member States when sending data\r\nto the Commission.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 [4], the stocks that are\r\nsubject to the various measures referred to therein must be identified.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid\r\ninterruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihoods of Union\r\nfishermen, it is important to open the fisheries covered by this Regulation as\r\nfrom 1 January 2014. For reasons of urgency, this Regulation should enter into\r\nforce immediately after its publication,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nChapter I\r\nGeneral Provisions\nArticle 1\r\nSubject matter\nThis
