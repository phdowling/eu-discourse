On 25\r\nApril 2013 the Council decided (Council Decision 2013/236/EU) that Cyprus shall rigorously implement a macroeconomic adjustment programme, which shall address the\r\nspecific risks emanating from Cyprus for the financial stability of the euro\r\narea and shall aim to rapidly re-establish a sound and sustainable economic and\r\nfinancial situation in Cyprus. \nOn 24 April 2013 the ESM Board of Governors\r\ndecided to grant, in principle, stability support to Cyprus and approved the\r\nMemorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality\r\n(hereinafter referred to as the \"MoU\") and its signing by the\r\nCommission on behalf of the ESM. On 8 May 2013 the ESM Board of Directors\r\napproved the financial assistance facility agreement.\nThe macroeconomic adjustment programme aims\r\nat restoring financial market confidence, re-establishing sound macroeconomic\r\nbalances and enabling the economy to return to sustainable growth. To achieve\r\nthese goals, the programme builds on three pillars. The first pillar is a financial sector strategy based on restructuring and downsizing of\r\nits financial institutions and strengthening its supervision, with efforts to\r\naddress capital and liquidity shortfalls. The second\r\npillar is an ambitious fiscal consolidation strategy, building on the\r\nconsolidation efforts initiated in 2012, in particular through measures to\r\nreduce current primary expenditure, enhance government revenues, improve the\r\nfunctioning of the public sector and maintain fiscal consolidation in the\r\nmedium-term. The aim is to correct the excessive general government deficit and\r\nput the gross public debt-to-GDP ratio on a firm downward path in the medium\r\nterm. The authorities are committed to reducing the\r\ndeficit to below 3% of GDP by 2016. The good implementation of Structural and\r\nother EU Funds, as well as EU policy initiatives aimed at enhancing jobs and\r\ngrowth should be preserved. This will contribute to the long-term growth path\r\nfor Cyprus. The third pillar consists of an ambitious\r\nstructural reform agenda, with a view to supporting competitiveness and\r\nsustainable and balanced growth, in line with country-specific recommendations\r\naddressed to Cyprus in 2012, and allowing for the unwinding of macroeconomic\r\nimbalances. Recalling the Council Recommendation of 22\r\nApril 2013 on establishing a Youth Guarantee[1],\r\nopportunities for young people and their employability prospects should be enhanced.\r\n\nThe 3-year programme covers the period from\r\nmid-2013 to mid-2016.\nIn line with\r\nArticle 1(2) of Decision 2013/236/EU, the Commission, in liaison with the ECB,\r\nand, where appropriate, with the IMF, has conducted the first review to assess\r\nthe progress on the implementation of the agreed measures as well as their\r\neffectiveness and economic and social impact. As a result the MoU has been\r\nupdated in the areas of financial sector reform, fiscal policy and structural\r\nreforms. For the financial sector, the revised MoU includes agreement on\r\npublishing a roadmap for the gradual relaxation of capital controls, based on\r\nmilestones and consistent with the banks' liquidity situation. Moreover, the\r\nrevised MoU requires establishing the legal framework for a new governance structure\r\nto manage the stake of the State in the cooperative credit sector. Finally, an action\r\nplan on customer due diligence and entity transparency has been agreed as part\r\nof Cyprus' anti-money laundering efforts. With regard to fiscal policy, the revised\r\nMoU contains a commitment to adopt a compensation scheme for provident fund and\r\nretirement funds in the Cyprus Popular Bank, which should ensure comparable\r\ntreatment with such funds in the Bank of Cyprus. Also, it is established that in\r\norder to ensure the effective implementation of EU funds, the Cypriot\r\nauthorities should ensure that the necessary national funds remain available to\r\ncover national contributions. Finally, in line with Regulation (EU) No 472/2013,\r\nthe revised MoU requires Cyprus to submit a request for technical assistance for\r\nthe programme period and undertake a comprehensive audit of its public\r\nfinances. In the area of structural reforms, the revised MoU details the planned\r\nreform of public assistance, which should ensure that social assistance serves\r\nas a safety net to ensure a minimum income for those unable to support the\r\nbasic standard of living, while safeguarding incentives to take up work.\r\nMoreover, it is required that Cyprus prepares detailed policy proposals with\r\nregard to addressing shortcomings in its activation policies and that Cyprus takes\r\nswift action to create opportunities for young people and improve their\r\nemployability prospects, in line with the objectives of the Council\r\nRecommendation on Establishing a Youth Guarantee. \nFollowing the entry into force of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 472/2013, the macroeconomic adjustment programme is now to\r\nbe adopted in the form of a Council implementing decision. For reasons of legal\r\nclarity and certainty, the Commission therefore proposes to readopt the\r\nprogramme on the basis of Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013. The\r\nsubstance of the programme is in essence identical to the one approved by\r\nCouncil Decision 2013/236/EU, but also incorporates the results of the review\r\ncarried out in accordance with Article 1(2) of Decision 2013/236/EU. At the\r\nsame time, it is proposed to repeal Council Decision 2013/236/EU.\nThe proposed decision will ensure full\r\nconsistency between the Union multilateral surveillance framework established\r\nby the TFEU and the policy conditionality underpinning the economic adjustment programme.\r\nNotably, Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 provides for consistency in reporting\r\nand monitoring obligations. \n2013/0290 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\non approving the macroeconomic adjustment\r\nprogramme for Cyprus and repealing Council Decision 2013/236/EU\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Regulation (EU) No\r\n472/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on the\r\nstrengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the\r\neuro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to\r\ntheir financial stability, and in particular Article 7(2) and (5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n472/2013 applies to Member States already in receipt of financial assistance,\r\nincluding those from the ESM, at the time of its entry into force.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n472/2013 sets the rules for the approval of macroeconomic adjustment programme\r\nfor Member States in receipt of financial assistance, which need to be consistent\r\nwith the provisions of the Treaty of Establishing the European Stability Mechanism\r\n(ESM). \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon a request of 25 June\r\n2012 by Cyprus for financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism\r\n(ESM), the Council decided on 25 April 2013 (Council Decision 2013/236/EU) that\r\nCyprus shall rigorously implement a macroeconomic adjustment programme.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 24 April 2013 the ESM\r\nBoard of Governors decided to grant, in principle, stability support to Cyprus and approved the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy\r\nConditionality (hereinafter referred to as the \"MoU\") and its signing\r\nby the Commission on behalf of the ESM.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with Article 1(2)\r\nof Council Decision 2013/236/EU, the Commission, in liaison with the ECB, and,\r\nwhere appropriate, with the IMF, has conducted the first review to assess the\r\nprogress with the implementation of the agreed measures as well as their effectiveness\r\nand economic and social impact. As a consequence of this review, an update was\r\nmade to the existing macro-economic adjustment programme, reflecting the steps taken\r\nby the Cypriot authorities by the second quarter of 2013. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the entry into\r\nforce of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, the macroeconomic adjustment programme is\r\nnow to be adopted in the form of a Council implementing decision. For reasons\r\nof legal clarity and certainty, the programme should be readopted on the basis\r\nof Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013. The substance of the programme\r\nshould remain identical to the one approved by Council Decision 2013/236/EU,\r\nbut also incorporate the results of the review carried out in accordance with\r\nArticle 1(2) of Decision 2013/236/EU. At the same time, Council Decision\r\n2013/236/EU should be repealed.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, in liaison\r\nwith the ECB and the IMF, has conducted the first review to assess the progress\r\non the implementation of the agreed measures as well as their effectiveness and\r\neconomic and social impact. As a result, the MoU has been updated in the areas\r\nof financial sector reform, fiscal policy and structural reforms, notably with\r\nregard to (i) a roadmap for the gradual relaxation of capital controls, (ii)\r\nestablishing the legal framework for a new governance structure to manage the\r\nstake of the State in the cooperative credit sector, (iii) an anti-money\r\nlaundering action plan, (iv) a compensation scheme for provident fund and\r\nretirement funds in the Cyprus Popular Bank, (v) ensuring that the necessary\r\nnational funds remain available to cover national contributions for projects\r\nfunded by the Structural and other EU funds, (vi) providing details of the\r\nplanned reform of public assistance, and (vii) preparing detailed policy\r\nproposals for activation policies and taking swift action to create\r\nopportunities for young people and improve their employability prospects. The\r\nimplementation of comprehensive and ambitious reforms in financial, fiscal and\r\nstructural areas should safeguard the medium-term sustainability of the Cypriot\r\npublic debt.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout the\r\nimplementation of Cyprus' comprehensive policy package, the Commission should\r\nprovide additional policy advice and technical assistance in specific areas. A Member State subject to a macroeconomic adjustment programme experiencing insufficient\r\nadministrative capacity shall seek technical assistance from the Commission,\r\nwhich may constitute, for that purpose, groups of experts.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Cypriot authorities shall\r\nseek the view, in accordance with current national rules and practises, of social\r\npartners and civil society organisations in the preparation, implementation,\r\nmonitoring and evaluation of the macroeconomic adjustment programme,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\r\nreturn of the Cypriot economy to a path of sustainable growth and to fiscal and\r\nfinancial stability, Cyprus shall rigorously implement a macroeconomic\r\nadjustment programme (the \"programme\"), the main elements of which\r\nare laid down in Article 2 of this Decision. The programme shall address the\r\nspecific risks emanating from Cyprus for the financial stability of the euro\r\narea and shall aim to rapidly re\u2011establish a sound and sustainable\r\neconomic and financial situation in Cyprus and restore its capacity to finance\r\nitself fully on the international financial markets. The programme shall take\r\ndue account of the Council recommendations addressed to Cyprus under Articles 121,\r\n126, 136 and 148 TFEU as well as Cyprus' actions to comply with them, while\r\naiming to broaden, strengthen and deepen the policy measures required.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, in liaison\r\nwith the ECB and, where appropriate, with the IMF, shall monitor Cyprus' progress in implementing its programme. Cyprus shall give the Commission and the\r\nECB its full cooperation. It shall, in particular, provide them with all the\r\ninformation that they deem necessary for the monitoring of the programme. The\r\nCypriot authorities shall consult ex-ante with the Commission, the ECB and the\r\nIMF on the adoption of policies that are not included in this Implementing\r\nDecision but that could have a material impact on the achievement of programme\r\nobjectives.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, in liaison\r\nwith the ECB and, where appropriate, with the IMF, shall examine with the\r\nCypriot authorities any changes and updates to the programme that may be needed\r\nin order to take proper account of, inter alia, any significant gap between\r\nmacroeconomic and fiscal forecasts and realised figures (including employment),\r\nnegative spill\u2011over effects, as well as macroeconomic and financial\r\nshocks. \nIn order to ensure the smooth implementation of\r\nthe programme and to help the correction of imbalances in a sustainable way,\r\nthe Commission shall ensure the provision of continued advice and guidance on\r\nfiscal, financial market and structural reforms. \nThe Commission shall at regular intervals\r\nassess the economic impact of the programme and shall recommend necessary\r\ncorrections with a view to enhancing growth and job creation, securing the\r\nnecessary fiscal consolidation, and minimising harmful social impacts. In this\r\ncontext, the macroeconomic adjustment programme, including its objectives and\r\nthe expected distribution of the adjustment effort, shall be made public.\nArticle 2\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The key objectives of the\r\nprogramme shall be: to restore the soundness of the Cypriot banking sector; to\r\ncontinue the on\u2011going process of fiscal consolidation; and to implement\r\nstructural reforms to support competitiveness and sustainable and balanced\r\ngrowth.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cyprus shall pursue fiscal\r\nconsolidation consistent with its obligations under the excessive deficit\r\nprocedure by means of high\u2011quality permanent measures while minimising\r\nthe impact on vulnerable groups.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to bring its\r\ndeficit below 3% of GDP by 2016, Cyprus shall stand ready to take additional\r\nconsolidation measures. Specifically, in the event of underperformance of\r\nrevenue or higher social spending needs due to adverse macroeconomic effects,\r\nthe Cypriot Government shall stand ready to take additional measures to\r\npreserve the programme's objectives, including by reducing discretionary\r\nspending, while minimising the impact on vulnerable groups. Over the programme\r\nperiod, cash revenue above the programme projections, including any windfall\r\ngains, shall be saved or used to reduce debt. Conversely, over\u2011performance,\r\nto the extent that it is deemed permanent, can reduce the need for additional\r\nmeasures in the outer years. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cyprus shall preserve the\r\ngood implementation of Structural and other EU Funds, in respect of the\r\nprogramme's budgetary targets.

The goal is that controls shall remain in\r\nplace only for as long as is strictly necessary to mitigate serious risks for\r\nthe stability of the financial system. A roadmap for the controls' gradual\r\nrelaxation has been published, based on milestones and progress with the\r\nprogramme implementation and consistent with the banks' liquidity situation. The medium\u2011term funding and capital plans of domestic banks relying on central bank funding or receiving state aid should\r\nrealistically reflect the anticipated deleveraging in the banking sector, and\r\nreduce dependency on borrowing from the central banks, while avoiding asset\r\nfire sales and a credit crunch.

Given the social welfare nature of such funds, the\r\n2013 general government deficit target may be revised to incorporate the budgetary\r\nimpact of this scheme;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 full implementation of the\r\nconsolidation measures adopted since December 2012.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The following measures\r\nshall be applied by Cyprus as of 1 January 2014:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on the expenditure side, the budget\r\nshall include: a reduction in total outlays for social transfers through better\r\ntargeting; a further reduction in the public and broader public sector wages\r\nand overtime compensation; the introduction of a fee on public transport cards\r\nfor students and pensioners; and structural reform measures in the educational\r\nsector to improve the use of resources; and\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on the revenue side, the budget for 2014\r\nshall include: an extension of the temporary contribution on gross earnings of\r\npublic and private sector employees up to 31 December 2016; increases in VAT;\r\nincreases in excise duties; and an increase in the contributions to the General\r\nSocial Insurance Scheme.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\r\nlong\u2011term sustainability of public finances, Cyprus shall implement\r\nfiscal\u2011structural reforms, comprising, inter alia, the following measures\r\nand outcomes:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if necessary, further reforms of the\r\ngeneral and public sector pension system to ensure the long-run viability of the\r\npension system, while addressing the adequacy of pensions.
