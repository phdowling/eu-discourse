Real GDP is expected to contract by 1.8 percent this year and to\r\ngrow by 0.8 percent and 1.5 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Tensions in\r\nthe labour market are expected to ease somewhat. Still, the unemployment rate\r\nis expected to peak at 17.7 percent next year before starting to decrease\r\nprogressively. Uncertainties with regard to the macroeconomic outlook are high as\r\nthe sustainability of the projected recovery in 2014 and 2015 is contingent on\r\npositive trade and financial market developments, which remain fragile. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Up to August 2013 the\r\ngovernment cash deficit recorded an improvement of 0.6 percentage points of GDP\r\n(net of extraordinary factors) compared with the same period of last year.\r\nSolid tax revenue performance and tight execution of most expenditure items are\r\nsupporting the budgetary execution. However, some deviations have been\r\nidentified with respect to the fiscal outlook of the 7th review.\r\nThese include shortfalls related to the reprogramming of EU funds and the\r\npostponement of the sale of a port concession (one-offs) and other factors,\r\nsuch as the higher than expected contribution to the EU budget, the underperformance\r\nof some non-tax revenues, the transfer to Greece of dividends from Greek bonds\r\nholdings in Banco de Portugal's investment portfolio, the lower than expected social\r\ncontributions to the public employees' pension scheme and overruns in the wage\r\nbill and intermediate consumption. After the use of the provisional budget\r\nallocations (0.3 percent of GDP), the net effect of the deviations is estimated\r\nto increase the 2013 deficit by 0.5 percent of GDP. In addition, a capital\r\ninjection into BANIF amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP also increased the budget\r\ngap although this operation shall not be considered for programme purposes. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The government is taking\r\ncorrective measures to ensure attainment of the 5.5 percent of GDP programme\r\ndeficit target, notably through the reduction of available funds for investment\r\nand tighter control on the intermediate consumption of line ministries (0.1\r\npercent of GDP). In addition, the government announced a one-off\r\ntax-and-social-security-contributions debt recovery scheme, which is expected\r\nto recover revenues of about 0.4 percent of GDP and is accompanied by increased\r\nsanctions for criminal tax offenders.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The updated fiscal\r\nprojections show for 2013 a fiscal effort, measured by the improvement in the\r\nstructural balance, of 0.5 percent of GDP, slightly below the 0.6 percent of\r\nGDP envisaged at the 7th Review. The projected underperformance is mainly\r\nexplained by delays in the implementation of the initially planned\r\nconsolidation package and its partial replacement by one-offs while unexpected\r\npressures have weighed on the budget reserves. The implementation delays are due\r\nto several constraints, such as the political crisis in July and the subsequent\r\ngovernment reshuffle; the challenge of responding to the Constitutional Court\r\nopinion of 29 August deeming some provisions of the draft law for a new\r\nrequalification system unconstitutional and the technical difficulties in\r\nimplementing certain measures, notably the redesigned social security contributions\r\nfrom unemployment and sickness benefits above a minimum level, following the\r\nruling of the Constitutional Court of 5 April.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The government has\r\nreaffirmed its commitment to the deficit target of 4 percent of GDP in 2014. In\r\nthis respect, the government has adopted consolidation measures amounting to\r\nabout 2.3 percent of GDP, which also cover for part of the slippages in 2013\r\nthat will carry over into 2014. The consolidation measures are to a large\r\nextent included in the draft Budget Law, whilst some measures are implemented\r\nthrough specific legislation. The measures are primarily of a permanent nature\r\nand rest predominantly on expenditure savings. Overall, the cumulative value of\r\nthe consolidation package necessary to achieve the envisaged fiscal adjustment\r\nhas not changed with respect to the 7th review \u2013 approximately EUR\r\n4.7 billion of permanent saving measures over 2013-2014, or 2.8 percent of GDP.\r\nHowever, part of the consolidation effort is now back loaded to 2014 as a\r\nresult of the aforementioned implementation delays in 2013. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the consolidation\r\nin 2014, about 1.8 percent of GDP, should be drawn from the public expenditure\r\nreview (PER), which was carried out over the past year with the objective of\r\nincreasing equity and efficiency in the provision of social transfers and\r\npublic services. The main impact of the PER measures will be along three main\r\naxes: (1) limiting outlays in the public sector wage bill, by reducing the\r\npublic-sector work force while shifting its composition towards higher-skilled\r\nemployees, aligning the public sector work rules with those of the private\r\nsector and making the remuneration policy more transparent and merit-based; (2)\r\npension reform and (3) sectoral expenditure cuts across line ministries and\r\nprogrammes.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To compensate for the\r\nnegative carryover from the 2013 budgetary execution and achieve the 4 percent\r\nof GDP deficit target, the PER package is to be complemented by other permanent\r\nmeasures aiming at further improving the efficiency and equity of the current\r\ntax and benefit structure (worth 0.4 percent of GDP). Moreover, a number of\r\none-off measures worth 0.2 percent of GDP will be implemented, more than offsetting\r\nthe costs arising from the one-off upfront payments related to the introduction\r\nof a mutual agreement redundancy scheme in the public sector.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The debt-to-GDP ratio is\r\nexpected to peak at 127.8 percent in 2013 and to decline thereafter. The upward\r\nrevision with respect to the 7th review is explained by the\r\ncorrection of the 2012 debt data, which is now slightly higher, and the\r\nnon-realisation of some short-term debt-reducing operations. In particular, the\r\nSocial Security Stabilisation Fund is now expected to increase its holdings of\r\nPortuguese Government Bonds more gradually and privatisation receipts will\r\nmostly remain in Parpublica until the new ESA 2010 enters into force and the\r\nstatus of the company is defined. Moreover, the Treasury cash balance at the\r\nend of the year is estimated to be higher than previously assumed (by about EUR\r\n2 billion). \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The budgetary adjustment\r\nprocess is flanked by a range of fiscal structural measures to enhance control\r\nover government expenditure and improve revenue collection. In particular, a\r\ncomprehensive reform is bringing the budgetary framework, including at central,\r\nregional and local government levels, in line with best practices in public\r\nfinance management. The new commitment control system is showing results but\r\nimplementation needs to be monitored closely to ensure that commitments are covered\r\nby available funding. Reforms in the public administration continue with a view\r\nto modernising and rationalising public sector employment and entities.\r\nProgress in the reform agenda of the revenue administration is enhancing\r\nmonitoring and strengthening revenue compliance. The renegotiation of\r\nPublic-Private-Partnerships has made good progress and significant savings are\r\nprojected for 2013 and beyond. State-owned enterprises reached operational\r\nbalance on average by the end of 2012 and additional reforms are foreseen to avoid\r\na renewed deterioration of their results. Reforms in the health care sector are\r\nproducing significant savings and implementation is continuing broadly in line\r\nwith targets.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The banks' capital ratios\r\nincreased substantially in the past year allowing them to\r\nmeet the EBA regulatory capital buffers as well as the 10 percent Core Tier 1 programme target. This capital buffer remains adequate across\r\nthe board when using the new Capital Requirements\r\nDirective (CRD) IV rules for evaluating the banks' own\r\nfunds. These new capital rules will apply from January 2014 onwards. Banco de\r\nPortugal is currently developing a transition approach to introduce CRD IV. The\r\nindicative loan-to-deposit target of 120 percent by 2014 is likely to be met,\r\nwith some banks already below this threshold. Efforts to diversify the sources\r\nof funding for the corporate sector are being strengthened. Building on the\r\nrecent external audit of the existing government-sponsored credit lines and on\r\na set of policy recommendations, the authorities submitted a plan with measures\r\naimed at improving the performance and governance of these instruments. The crisis\r\nmanagement toolkit including a bank resolution fund, early intervention powers\r\nand a recapitalisation law is being finalised.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further progress has been\r\nmade in implementing growth and competitiveness-enhancing structural reforms. A\r\nnew reduction of severance payments entered into force on 1st\r\nOctober and two compensation funds have been established with the purpose of a\r\npartial financing of severance payments. Additional steps have been taken to\r\nstrengthen Active Labour Market Policies. Additional measures have been adopted\r\nin the area of education, in which progress is overall satisfactory.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The implementation of the\r\nServices Directive aiming at reducing barriers to entry and boost competition\r\nand economic activity by facilitating access for new entrants to the market in\r\nthe different economic regimes is proceeding at a good pace and its\r\ntransposition is now close to completion. The framework law for improving the\r\nfunctioning of the regulated professions involving a professional body was adopted\r\nand the revision of the statutes of the eighteen professions concerned is the\r\nnext step to complete this reform. The Framework Law to set the main principles\r\nof the functioning of the most important National Regulator Authorities (NRA),\r\nincluding their endowment with strong independence and autonomy entered already\r\ninto force and the bylaws of the various sectoral regulators are to be adopted\r\nsoon. Implementation of the measures to reduce the electricity tariff debt has\r\nbeen delayed, though the government has recently presented a new tax to\r\npartially deal with this matter. Some legal provisions aimed at easing\r\nlicensing procedures and other administrative burdens have been adopted such as\r\nthe proposal of the New Base Law for Soil, Spatial Planning and Urbanism.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further progress is still\r\nnecessary to make the transport sector more sustainable and open to\r\ncompetition. There has been some improvement in the financial position of the\r\nrail infrastructure manager, but significant additional effort is needed to\r\nbring it to operational balance by 2015.The reforms in ports need to be stepped\r\nup.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some additional measures\r\nhave been adopted to improve the liquidity conditions of the business sector,\r\nin particular Small and Medium Enterprises (SME).\u00a0 \r\nReforms of the judicial system are close to completion. Progress has been\r\nachieved in reducing backlog cases and landmark reforms such as the\r\ngeographical reorganisation of the court districts and the reform of the Code\r\nof Civil Procedure have been or are on the way of being completed. Continued improvement of the functioning of the judicial system,\r\nwhich is essential for the proper and fair functioning of the economy, through:\r\n(i) ensuring effective and timely enforcement of contracts and competition\r\nrules; (ii) increasing efficiency by restructuring the court system, and\r\nadopting new court management models; (iii) further reducing slowness of the\r\nsystem of courts cases (including tax court cases) is nevertheless necessary,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nIn Article 3 of Implementing Decision\r\n2011/344/EU, paragraphs 7 to 9 are replaced by the following:\n\u20187. Portugal shall adopt the following\r\nmeasures during 2013, in line with specifications in the Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding:\n(a)         \r\nThe general government deficit shall not exceed\r\n5.5 percent of GDP in 2013. For the calculation of\r\nthis deficit, the possible budgetary costs of bank support measures in the\r\ncontext of the Government's financial sector strategy shall not be taken into\r\naccount. The consolidation measures included in the 2013 budget and\r\nsupplementary budget shall be implemented rigorously throughout the rest of the\r\nyear. In addition, should further slippages arise in budgetary execution, the\r\ngovernment shall implement additional corrective measures;\n(b)         \r\nPortugal shall continue\r\nimplementing its privatisation programme;\n(c)         \r\nPortugal shall complete the implementation\r\nof the strategy of shared services in public administration;\n(d)         \r\nPortugal shall continue\r\nthe reorganisation and rationalisation of the hospital network through\r\nspecialisation, concentration and downsizing of hospital services, joint\r\nmanagement and joint operation of hospitals. Portugal shall ensure the\r\nimplementation of the multiyear action plan for hospital reorganisation;\n(e)         \r\nFollowing the adoption of the amendments to the\r\nNew Urban Lease Act Law 6/2006 and the Decree Law which simplifies the\r\nadministrative procedure for renovation, Portugal shall undertake a\r\ncomprehensive review of the functioning of the housing market;\n(f)           \r\nPortugal shall develop a\r\nnationwide land registration system to allow a more equal distribution of\r\nbenefits and costs in the execution of urban planning;\n(g)         \r\nPortugal shall devise\r\nand implement alternative reform options of the labour market with similar\r\neffect to those that were declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court\r\nruling of 26 September 2013;\n(h)         \r\nPortugal shall promote\r\nwage developments consistent with the objectives of fostering job creation and\r\nimproving firms\u2019 competitiveness with a view to correcting macroeconomic\r\nimbalances. Over the Programme period, any increase in minimum wages shall take\r\nplace only if justified by economic and labour market developments;\n(i)           \r\nPortugal shall continue\r\nto improve the effectiveness of its active labour market policies in line with\r\nthe results of the assessment report and the action plan to improve the\r\nfunctioning of the public employment services;\n(j)           \r\nPortugal shall continue to implement the\r\nmeasures set out in its action plans to improve the quality of secondary and\r\nvocational education and training, in particular the government shall present\r\nplans to make the funding framework of schools more effective and the\r\nprofessional schools of reference shall be established;\n(k)         \r\nPortugal shall complete\r\nthe adoption of the outstanding sectorial amendments necessary to fully\r\nimplement the Services Directive;\n(l)           \r\nPortugal shall submit to\r\nParliament the professional bodies' amended statutes;\n(m)       \r\nPortugal shall approve the corresponding amendments to the\r\nbylaws of the National Regulatory Authorities;\n(n)         \r\nPortugal shall publish quarterly reports on recovery rates; duration and costs of\r\ncorporate insolvency cases; duration and cost of tax cases and on the clearance\r\nrate of enforcement court cases;\n(o)         \r\nPortugal shall improve the business environment\r\nby completing pending reforms on the reduction of administrative burden [fully\r\noperational Point of Single Contact (PSC) and 'Zero Authorisation' projects]\r\nand by carrying out further simplification of existing licensing procedures,\r\nregulations and other administrative burdens in the economy which are a major\r\nobstacle for the development of economic activities; \n(p)         \r\nPortugal shall complete\r\nthe reform of the ports' governance system, including the overhaul of port\r\noperation concessions;\n(q)         \r\nPortugal shall implement\r\nthe measures enhancing the functioning of the postal and telecommunications\r\nsectors;\n(r)          \r\nPortugal shall implement\r\nthe measures enhancing the functioning of the transport system;\n(s)          \r\nPortugal shall implement\r\nthe measures eliminating the energy tariff debt;\n(t)           \r\nPortugal shall ensure that the new legal and\r\ninstitutional PPP framework is applied and the PPP road contracts continue to\r\nbe renegotiated in line with the strategic plan presented by the government and with the regulatory\r\nframework revision, in order to obtain substantial fiscal gains, particularly\r\nin 2013;\n(u)         \r\nPortugal shall continue\r\nto focus on measures to combat tax fraud and evasion and strengthen taxpayers'\r\ncompliance.\u2019\n\u20188. Portugal shall adopt the following\r\nmeasures during 2014, in line with specifications in the Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding:\n(a)         \r\nThe general government deficit shall not exceed\r\n4 percent of GDP in 2014. For the calculation of this\r\ndeficit, the possible budgetary costs of bank support measures in the context\r\nof the Government's financial sector strategy shall not be taken into account.\r\nTo achieve this objective Portugal shall deliver consolidation measures worth\r\n2.3 percent of GDP, primarily through the 2014 Budget Law. Measures shall be\r\nmainly of permanent nature and titlted towards the expenditure savings side;\n(b)         \r\nThe consolidation package shall build on the expenditure-reducing\r\nmeasures that were prepared in the framework of the public expenditure review\r\n(PER). Overall, the amount of these measures shall add up to 1.8 percent of GDP\r\nin 2014 and shall include (1) limiting outlays on the public wage bill by\r\nreducing the size of the public-sector work force while changing its\r\ncomposition towards higher-skilled employees, notably through a requalification\r\nprogramme and a voluntary redundancy scheme; further convergence of public and\r\nprivate sector work rules (including the increase in working hours and\r\nreduction in holiday entitlements) and the introduction of a single wage scale\r\nas well as the streamlining of wage supplements. Beneficiaries' contributions\r\nto the special health insurance schemes shall be increased and thereby\r\ncontribute to enhance the equity and efficiency of public spending; (2) reforms\r\nof the pension system by an increase in the statutory retirement age via\r\nchanges to the sustainability factor; an alignment of the rules for pension\r\nbenefit calculations between the civil servants' pension regime (CGA) and the\r\ngeneral pension system, while protecting benefits below minimum thresholds; and\r\nstreamlining survivors' pensions of both CGA and the general pension regime, in\r\nparticular in cases where these accumulate with other pensions; (3) savings in\r\nintermediate consumption and expenditure programmes across line ministries. In\r\nview of political and legal risks, some of the measures may be partly or fully\r\nreplaced by others of equivalent size and quality;\n(c)         \r\nThe PER package shall be completed with other\r\npermanent revenue measures aiming at further improving the efficiency and\r\nequity of the current tax and benefit structure (worth 0.4 percent of GDP). In\r\nparticular, the corporate tax rate on expenses related to company cars shall be\r\nincreased and environmental and health- related taxation shall be improved by\r\nchanging the taxation of passenger diesel cars and by increasing excises on\r\ntobacco and on alcoholic beverages. Fiscal exemptions in property taxation for\r\npension funds and real estate funds shall be eliminated. The caps to the social\r\nsecurity contributions of members of statutory bodies shall be removed. A special\r\nlevy on the energy sector shall be imposed curbing excessive rents from the\r\nenergy sector. Part of the income generated by this levy shall be used to\r\nreduce the tariff debt. Online gambling licences shall be sold with a view to\r\nthe regularisation of this market and this activity shall also be taxed. A\r\nspecial fee on media spectrum shall be introduced and the levy on financial\r\ninstitutions shall be increased. Moreover, a number of one-off measures shall\r\nbe implemented, more than offsetting the costs arising from the one-off upfront\r\npayments related to the introduction of the mutual agreement redundancy scheme\r\nin the public sector. These include the transfer of the CTT health fund to the\r\ngovernment sector, the sale of a port and silos concessions as well as special\r\ndividends from the sale of excessive oil reserves from a public company;\n(d)         \r\nPortugal shall present a report with the\r\nobjectives (i) to identify overlaps of services and jurisdictions and other\r\nsources of inefficiencies between the central and the local levels of\r\ngovernment; and (ii) to reorganise the network of decentralised services of ministries\r\nmainly through the citizens' shops network and other approaches, encompassing\r\nmore efficient geographical areas and intensifying the use of shared services\r\nand digital government;\n(e)         \r\nPortugal shall continue\r\nthe reorganisation and rationalisation of the hospital network through\r\nspecialisation, concentration and downsizing of hospital services, joint\r\nmanagement and joint operation of hospitals. Portugal shall ensure the\r\nimplementation of the multiyear action plan for hospital reorganisation;\n(f)           \r\nPortugal shall implement\r\nthe plan to create an independent gas and electricity logistics operator\r\ncompany;\n(g)         \r\nPortugal shall implement\r\nthe measures enhancing the functioning of the transport system;\n(h)         \r\nPortugal shall assess\r\nthe impact of the optional VAT cash accounting regime;\n(i)           \r\nPortugal shall carry out\r\nan inventory and an analysis of the costs of regulations that are likely to\r\nhave a higher impact on economic activity.\u2019\n\u20189. With a view to restoring confidence in\r\nthe financial sector, Portugal shall aim to maintain an adequate level of\r\ncapital in its banking sector and ensure an orderly deleveraging process in\r\ncompliance with the deadlines set in the Memorandum of Understanding. In that\r\nregard, Portugal shall implement the strategy for the Portuguese banking sector\r\nagreed with the Commission, the ECB and the IMF so that financial stability is\r\npreserved. In particular, Portugal shall:\n(a)         \r\nmonitor the banks' transition to the new capital\r\nrules as laid down in the Capital Requirements Directive IV package (CRD IV)\r\nand ensure that capital buffers remain commensurate with the challenging\r\noperating environment;\n(b)         \r\nadvise banks to strengthen their collateral\r\nbuffers on a sustainable basis;\n(c)         \r\nensure a balanced and orderly deleveraging of\r\nthe banking sector, which remains critical in permanently eliminating funding\r\nimbalances and reducing the reliance on Eurosystem funding in the medium-term.\r\nBanks funding and capital plans shall be reviewed quarterly;\n(d)         \r\nencourage the diversification of financing\r\nalternatives for the corporate sector and in particular the SMEs through an\r\narray of measures aiming at improving their access to the capital markets;\n(e)         \r\ncontinue to streamline the state-owned CGD\r\ngroup;\n(f)           \r\noutsource the management of the BPN credits\r\ncurrently held by Parvalorem to the firms selected through the bidding process\r\nwith a mandate to gradually recover the assets.
