It covers three\nmodules: air emissions accounts, environmental taxes and material flow\naccounts. \nArticle 10 of the Regulation contains a\nlist of possible new modules to be introduced later based on Commission\nproposals. The first three of the new modules listed in Article 10 are covered\nby this draft amending Regulation: environmental protection expenditure,\nenvironmental goods and services sector and energy accounts. \nUsers put much emphasis on analysis and\napplications of environmental accounts in modelling and outlooks, both for\npreparing policy proposals and reporting on policy implementation and impacts.\nThe new modules will allow expanding the integrated datasets available for such\napplications and analysis. \nArticle 4 of the Regulation foresees pilot\nstudies to be carried out by Member States on a voluntary basis to test the\nfeasibility of introducing new modules. Several such pilot studies have been\ncompleted clearly demonstrating the feasibility of the three new modules.\nEnvironmental accounting uses existing data\nfor compiling the accounts. No new data collection is necessary for\nimplementing the new modules. Better use of information from existing data\ncollection instruments will be made.\nThe United Nations\nStatistical Commission has adopted the System of Environmental-Economic\nAccounting (SEEA) as an international statistical standard at its 43rd session in February\n2012. The new modules proposed are fully in line with the SEEA.\nThe proposed amending Regulation is in line\nwith the revised European Strategy for Environmental Accounting (ESEA 2008). It\nwill ensure that NSIs (National Statistical Institutes) can expand their work\non environmental accounting, with the main objective of providing harmonised\nand timely data of good quality.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe proposal has been discussed, in the\nframework of the European Statistical System, with data producers and users on\na technical level through written consultations, in task forces, in the\nrelevant working groups on Environmental Accounts and on Environmental\nExpenditure Statistics in March 2012, and with the directors for environmental\nstatistics and accounts in April and November 2012.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe objective of this proposed amending act\nis to ensure international comparability of environmental economic accounts by extending\nthe coverage of Regulation 691/2011 to further modules as listed in Article 10\nof that Regulation.\nThe proposed act concerns\nan EEA matter and should therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no new implication for the\nUnion budget.\n2013/0130 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) No 691/2011 on\nEuropean environmental economic accounts\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision No xxx of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of xxx 2013 laying down the Seventh\nCommunity Environment Action Programme[1]\nprovides that sound information on the key trends, pressures and drivers for\nenvironmental change is essential for the development of effective policy, its\nimplementation, and the empowerment of citizens more generally. Instruments\nshould be developed with a view to enhancing public awareness of the\nenvironmental effects of economic activity. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 10 of Regulation (EU)\nNo 691/2011 invites the Commission to report on the implementation of this\nRegulation to the European Parliament and the Council and, if appropriate, to\npropose the introduction of new environmental economic accounts modules, such\nas Environmental Protection Expenditure and Revenues (EPER)/Environmental\nProtection Expenditure Accounts (EPEA), Environmental Goods and Services Sector\n(EGSS) and Energy Accounts. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These three new modules\ncontribute directly to the Union's policy priorities of green growth and\nresource efficiency by providing important information on indicators such as\nmarket output and employment in the EGSS, national envirionmental protection\nexpenditure and the use of energy in a detailed NACE breakdown.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The United\nNations Statistical Commission adopted the System of\nEnvironmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) central framework as an international\nstatistical standard at its 43rd session in February 2012.
