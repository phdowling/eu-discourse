In July 2010 the\r\nCouncil capped the European contribution to that phase to EUR 6.6 billion (in\r\n2008 value). In February 2013, the European Council set up the maximum level of\r\nthe Euratom commitments for ITER in the Multiannual Financial Framework\r\nRegulation for the period 2014-2020 at EUR 2.707 million (in 2011 value).\nUnder the Seventh Framework Programme the\r\nEuratom contribution was made available through the Community research and\r\ntraining programme adopted pursuant to Article 7 of the Euratom Treaty. This\r\nfinancing modality required to comply with a series of requirements in terms of\r\nparticipation, rules, planning, monitoring and evaluation which are specific to\r\nresearch programmes. These requirements are now redundant given the\r\ncompetencies and role assigned to Fusion for Energy in its Statutes.\nDifferently from what was done under the Seventh\r\nFramework Programme, this proposal is not designed as a research programme\r\nunder Article 7 of the Euratom Treaty. It is instead based on Article 47 and\r\nrefers to the participation of Euratom in the financing of the Joint\r\nUndertaking.\nThis amendment would serve the purpose of\r\nensuring the transfer of funds from the Commission to Fusion for Energy for the\r\nEuropean contribution to ITER without the aforementioned requirements specific to\r\nresearch programmes. This,\r\nhowever, does not prevent, in particular in case of additional costs, voluntary\r\ncontributions from Members of the Joint Undertaking other than Euratom as\r\nprovided for in Article 12(1)(c) of the Statutes of that Undertaking.\nThis amendment allows securing the financing of\r\nthe project for the next Multiannual Financial Framework. The transfer of funds\r\nwill have the advantage not to be limited anymore to the five years foreseen by\r\nArticle 7 of the Euratom Treaty for research and training programmes. It will\r\nbe aligned with the period covered by the Multiannual Financial Framework and\r\nrun for seven years. According to the ITER Agreement, the ITER project will\r\nhave an initial duration of 35 years (i.e. until 2041); thus, subsequent\r\nCouncil decisions will be needed to continue to fund the Euratom contribution\r\nto this project.\nActivities to be funded by this Decision are\r\nsupporting the implementation of the roadmap towards the production of\r\nelectricity from fusion by 2050, adopted by members of the European Fusion\r\nDevelopment Agreement (EFDA) in November 2012. As such, this Decision will\r\nallow synergies and complementarities with fusion research activities funded\r\nunder Council Regulation XXX [the Euratom Research and Training Programme].\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThis proposal takes\r\nfull account of the responses to an extensive public consultation based on\r\nthe Green Paper 'From Challenges to Opportunities: Towards a Common Strategic\r\nFramework for EU research and innovation funding'[1], within the preparation of the\r\nEuratom Research and Training Programme (2014-2018) contributing to the\r\n\"Horizon 2020\" Framework programme for Research and Innovation. \nITER was included in this consultation and in the internal and\r\nexternal evaluations for the drafting of the impact assessment. This impact assessment concluded that the benefits of ITER,\r\nwhich balance scientific, technical and financial risks, are, in the long term,\r\nthe commercial exploitation of fusion energy and, in the near term, the\r\ncompetitiveness benefits to industry. \nOn the basis of the decision adopted by the\r\nEuropean Council on 8 February 2013, this proposal\r\nwill provide continuity for the project, in particular vis-\u00e0-vis our\r\ninternational partners and secure the ITER funding for the whole duration of\r\nthe next MFF.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for this\r\nCouncil Decision is provided for by Article 47 of the Euratom Treaty. This\r\nDecision shall constitute the basic act for the period covered by the next Multiannual\r\nFinancial Framework and will be the basis for the adoption of the yearly\r\nfinancing decisions by the Commission. The Commission decisions will allow the\r\ntransfer of funds to Fusion for Energy during the period 2014-2020. This proposal\r\nwill replace the proposal for a Council Decision on the adoption of a\r\nSupplementary Research Programme for the ITER project (2014-2018)[2] adopted by the\r\nCommission on 21 December 2011.\nThere is an ongoing\r\nprocess to amend the Statutes of Fusion for Energy, in particular to grant Croatia voting rights after its accession to Euratom on 1st July 2013. An amendment to\r\nArticle 12.1 (a)[3]\r\nwill also be introduced to extend the possibilities of financing through the\r\ngeneral budget of the European Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe 'legislative\r\nfinancial statement' attached to this proposal for a Council Decision sets out\r\nthe budgetary implications and the human and administrative resources needed\r\nfor its implementation.\n2013/0295 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\namending Decision 2007/198/Euratom\r\nestablishing the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of\r\nFusion Energy and conferring advantages upon it\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing\r\nthe European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular the third and fourth\r\nparagraph of Article 47 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2007/198/Euratom[4] established the European Joint\r\nUndertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy (hereinafter \"Joint\r\nUndertaking\") to provide the contribution of the European Atomic Energy\r\nCommunity (hereinafter \"Euratom\") to the ITER International Fusion\r\nEnergy Organisation and the Broader Approach Activities with Japan as well as\r\nto prepare and coordinate a programme of activities in preparation for the\r\nconstruction of a demonstration fusion reactor and related facilities.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2007/198/Euratom\r\nprovided a financial reference amount deemed necessary for the Joint\r\nUndertaking together with the indicative total contribution of Euratom towards\r\nsuch amount, which should be made available through the Community research and\r\ntraining programmes adopted pursuant to Article 7 of the Treaty.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The resources deemed\r\nnecessary for the Joint Undertaking during the ITER construction phase, covering\r\nthe period 2007-2020, amounted in March 2010 to EUR 7 200 000 000 (in 2008\r\nvalue). In July 2010 the Council of the European Union capped this amount to\r\nEUR 6 600 000 000 (in 2008 value).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Parliament\r\nand the Council set the maximum level of the Euratom commitments for ITER in\r\nthe Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020 at EUR 2 707 000\r\n000 (in 2011 value).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to amend\r\nDecision 2007/198/Euratom to allow the financing of the activities of the Joint\r\nUndertaking for the period 2014-2020 from the general budget of the European\r\nUnion and not through the Euratom research and training programmes.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Third countries which have\r\nconcluded a cooperation agreement with Euratom in the field of nuclear energy\r\nresearch, including the controlled nuclear fusion, that associate their\r\nrespective research programmes with the Euratom programmes are to contribute to\r\nthe financing of the activities of the Joint Undertaking.

system in a safe, efficient and secure\r\nway. This Council Decision will contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy and to\r\nits flagship initiatives \"Innovation Union\", \"An industrial\r\npolicy for the globalisation era\" and \"An agenda for new skills and\r\njobs\", since it will support the mobilisation of European high-tech\r\nindustries which will gain new skills and manufacturing capabilities through\r\nparticipation in Fusion for Energy (F4E) procurement contracts. In addition,\r\nsince the decarbonisation of the energy system is one of its major objectives,\r\nit will also contribute to the \"Resource efficient Europe\" flagship\r\ninitiative.\nSpecific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \nTo provide the Euratom contribution to the ITER\r\nOrganization, for the construction of the ITER facilities, as well as for ITER\r\nrelated activities.\nExpected result(s) and impact\nSpecify\r\nthe effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the\r\nbeneficiaries/groups targeted.\nThis\r\nDecision will result in Europe making its contributions to the construction of\r\nITER. Europe is making the largest contribution to the project (45% of the\r\nconstruction costs) and the impacts of this Decision will be greatest in Europe, both at near term (benefits to European industry) and at long term (a leading role\r\nin the commercial exploitation of fusion energy).\nThe project\r\nis already having a positive impact on industrial competitiveness and job\r\ncreation as the project requires procurement of high tech components.. More\r\nthan three quarters of the Community contribution to ITER will result in\r\ncontracts with private companies. The creation of new jobs in Europe directly\r\ndue to ITER activities will be significant. In the long term, ITER presents a\r\nunique opportunity for European high tech industry and construction companies\r\nto gain a competitive advantage and become leading actors in the design of the\r\nfirst generation of fusion power plants and the subsequent international\r\ncommercialisation.\nIndicators of results and impact \nSpecify\r\nthe indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nThe\r\nindicators which will measure progress in the European contributions to ITER\r\nconstruction will be the achievement of milestones by F4E in providing the\r\neuropean components as \"in kind\" contributions to ITER. The overall\r\nplanning and annual Work Programme of F4E specify the timetable for the\r\nachievement the milestones which covers all the procurement activities during\r\nITER construction. F4E regularly reports to its governance body (the Governing\r\nBoard) and to the EU Council on the project's progress.\nGrounds for the proposal/initiative\nRequirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \nThe\r\nEuropean Council decided on 8 February 2013 to fund the ITER project within the\r\nMulti-annual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2014-2020. This Council\r\nDecision will allow the transfer of funds to Fusion for Energy to carry out the\r\ntasks assigned to it.\nAdded value of Euratom involvement\nThe\r\ninvolvment of Euratom stands from the signature of the ITER Agreement. This\r\nDecision allows for sound budgetary multi annual planning of F4E. \nLessons learned from similar experiences in the past\nThe Joint\r\nEuropean Torus (JET) project has demonstrated that building and operating a\r\nlarge fusion research infrastructure under the Euratom coordination is\r\nefficient and maximises the scientific and industrial benefits. However, the\r\nscale required for the ITER construction is unprecedented and requires a\r\ncollaboration at global level for which there is no example to be found in the\r\npast.\nCoherence and possible synergy with other relevant\r\ninstruments\nThis\r\nDecision will allow synergies and complementarities with fusion research\r\nactivities with the Euratom research programme complementing Horizon 2020\r\n(2014-2018). The fusion activities under this framework will provide important\r\nscientific contribution to the construction and operation of ITER. \nDuration and financial impact \n\u00fd Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\u00fd\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from\r\n01/01/2014 to 31/12/2020 \n\u00fd\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial impact from 2014 to 2026\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\nImplementation with a\r\nstart-up period from YYYY to YYYY,\nfollowed by full-scale\r\noperation.\nManagement mode(s) envisaged[7] \n\u00fd Centralised direct management by the Commission \n\u00fd Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u00fd\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[8] \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies\r\nwith public-service mission \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 persons entrusted with the\r\nimplementation of specific actions pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on\r\nEuropean Union and identified in the relevant basic act within the meaning of\r\nArticle 49 of the Financial Regulation \n\u00a8 Shared\r\nmanagement with the Member\r\nStates \n\u00a8 Decentralised\r\nmanagement with third countries\r\n\n\u00a8 Joint\r\nmanagement with international\r\norganisations (to be specified)\nIf\r\nmore than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019\r\nsection.\nComments: \nManagement\r\nwill be through the services of the Commission and through F4E. The Commission\r\nrepresents Euratom in the governing bodies of both the ITER Organization (IO)\r\nand F4E.\nMANAGEMENT MEASURES\nThis Decision will be implemented by the\r\nCommission and F4E, which channels the Euratom contribution to the ITER Project\r\nand to other activities related to ITER, such as the Broader Approach\r\nactivities with Japan.\nThe Commission, on behalf of Euratom,\r\nparticipates in the decision-making bodies the ITER Organization and F4E: 1)\r\nThe Commisison participates in the the ITER Council, in the Scientific and\r\nTechnical Advisory Committee (STAC) and in the Management Advisory Committee of\r\nthe ITER Council (MAC); 2) as member of F4E, the Commission participates in the\r\nGoverning Board, the Executive Committee, the Technical Advisory Panel, the\r\nAdministration and Finance Committee and the \u201cBureau\u201d.\nMonitoring and reporting rules\nMonitoring and reporting are based on the\r\nmanagement and reporting rules that are applied by F4E and the IO, which\r\nrequire the approval of all key documents by the governaning bodies. Through\r\nthese bodies, the Commission monitors and revises the documents defining the\r\nimplementing activities for ITER.\nF4E is setting up a project management and\r\nreporting process, fully integrating various aspects of the reporting system to\r\nthe GB.\nEvery year and in line with the Council\r\nconclusions of 12 July 2010, F4E reports to the Council on the progress\r\nachieved in implementing the cost containment and savings plan as well as on\r\nthe performance and management of F4E and the ITER project, including the\r\nfulfillment of the schedule activities within its annual budget. In response to\r\nthese Council conclusions, F4E has appointed an independent expert who assesses\r\nthe project progress on the basis of existing reports and submits its opinion\r\nto the F4E GB and to the Competitiveness Council once a year.\nF4E and the Commission have signed an\r\nAdministrative Agreement which defines the modalities and conditions applicable\r\nto the transfer of the Community financial contribution to F4E.\nManagement and control system\nThe Commission participates in the\r\ndecision-making bodies of the IO and F4E. The Commission follows and revises\r\nall initiatives needed to implement the ITER project, in particular those of a\r\nfinancial nature.\nThe Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS)\r\nacts as Internal Auditor of F4E since 2012, under the modalities agreed between\r\nthe Directorate General of the IAS and F4E. Also, the European Anti-Fraud\r\nOffice (OLAF) enjoys the same powers with respect to F4E and its staff as it\r\nenjoys in respect of Commission departments.\nAs regards the governance of F4E, at the end of\r\nMay 2011, F4E's GB at the initiative of the Commission adopted a set of\r\nmeasures to improve the governance of F4E. In addition, since the 1st of\r\nJanuary 2011, a new organisational structure to have a more project-oriented\r\norganisation has been put in place.\nF4E's Financial Regulation is similar to the\r\nCommission's Financial Regulation, including public procurement procedures\r\nequivalent to the Commission's standards.\nF4E is accountable to its GB, to the Council and\r\nthe European Parliament, the latter providing the annual discharge for the\r\nbudget, based on a recommendation by the Council. In addition, F4E is audited\r\ntwice a year by the European Court of Auditors that provides a report to the\r\nCommission, the Council and the Parliament as part of the annual discharge.\nInternal control framework \nThe internal control framework is built on:\n1. The Commission's Internal Control Standards\r\napplied by the Directorate General in charge of ITER when adopting any decision\r\nconcerning F4E, in particular those having a financial nature;\n2. The Internal Control Standards that F4E is\r\nimplementing to carry out systematic surveillance exercises and follow-up the\r\nimplementation of any recommendation;\n3. Technical, financial and political\r\nCommission's review of F4E and ITER activities;\n4. Ex-ante checks and ex-post controls on\r\nprocurements. Risks are assessed regularly and progress in the execution of\r\nwork and the consumption of resources is monitored regularly, based on defined\r\nobjectives and indicators.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0 Expected\r\nlevel of risk of non-compliance \nThere is an\r\ninherent financial risk in F4E due to the nature of its activities (large and\r\ncomplex in-kind procurements with high technical risks). Measures to monitor\r\nand better control the functioning of F4E have been put in to alleviate this\r\nsituation. The Commission together with F4E will continue to identify the risks\r\nrelated to the implementation of this project, notably in terms of costs, and\r\nwill take the most appropriate measures to manage and mitigate these risks.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures\r\nto prevent fraud and irregularities\nThe Commission's Directorate General charged with\r\nthe implementation of the ITER project and budget is committed to fight against\r\nfraud in line with the Commission Anti-fraud strategy COM(2011)376 of 24 June\r\n2011.\nThe administrative monitoring of the contracts,\r\ngrants and related payments is under the responsibility of F4E.\nThe Commission and F4E take into account the\r\nfinancial interests of the European Union notably in compliance with Council\r\nRegulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection\r\nof the European Communities\u2019 financial interests and Article 53(a) of the\r\nFinancial Regulation. \nF4E developes ex-post audit strategies to assess\r\nthe legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.\nThe European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) enjoys the\r\nsame powers with respect to F4E and its staff, as it enjoys in respect of\r\nCommission departments. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED\r\nFINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework\r\nand expenditure budget line(s) affected \nNew budget lines\r\nrequested \nIn\r\norder\r\nof multiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n || Diff./non-diff. || from EFTA countries || from candidate countries || from third countries || within the meaning of Article 18(1)(aa) of the Financial Regulation \n Heading 1 || 08 01 05 21 Expenditure related to officials and temporary agents implementing Research and Innovation progarmmes \u2013 ITER progarmme* 08 01 05 22 External personnel implementing Research and Innovation programmes \u2013 ITER programme* 08 01 05 23 Other management expenditure for Research and Innovation programmes \u2013 ITER programme* 08 04 01 Construction, operation and exploitation of the ITER facilities \u2013 European Joint Undertaking for ITER \u2013 Fusion for Energy (F4E) || Diff./non-diff. || NO || NO || YES || YES \n*- The precise numbering of the budget lines will be\r\ndefined at later stage.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimated impact on expenditure \n3.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of estimated impact on expenditure \nIn current prices -
