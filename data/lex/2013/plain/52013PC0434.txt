In this context the next EU-wide\nstress tests of banks, to be conducted under the aegis of the European Banking\nAuthority (EBA), will not take place in 2013 as previously expected. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In preparation for the SSM\nentry stress test and with a view to (i) having meaningful diagnostics before\nthe programme ends and (ii) ensuring as much as possible consistency across\ndifferent assessment exercises, Ireland should therefore carry out a series of\nsupervisory steps, including a preliminary comprehensive balance sheet\nassessment, before the end of 2013. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ireland has reaffirmed its\ncommitment to transfer without delay the responsibility for the water sector\nfrom local authorities to a national public utility and to introduce water\ncharges for households. Ireland has demonstrated good progress in carrying out\nthe reform of its water sector, including with the enactment of legislation,\nthe establishment of Irish Water and the completion of operational steps for\nthe transition process. Technical reasons would justify deferring the\nintroduction of water charges for households to 2014, without compromising the\nreform process as whole.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of these\ndevelopments and considerations, Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU should be\namended,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nArticle 3, paragraph 10, of Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU is amended\nas follows:\n1) point (a) is replaced by the following:\n\"(a) in accordance with the methodology to\nbe agreed by end July 2013, complete a preliminary balance sheet assessment\nbefore the end of the programme, as part of the preparatory work towards a\nstress test to be conducted in accordance with the new EU methodology.\"\n2) the following point is added:\n\"(c) communicate to the Commission the\nfunding model for Irish Water and announce a definitive time-plan for the\nintroduction of domestic water charges in the fourth quarter of 2014.\" \nArticle 2\nThis Decision\nis addressed to Ireland. \nArticle 3\nThis Decision\nshall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. \nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 118, 12.5.2010, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 30, 4.2.2011, p. 34.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
