INTRODUCTION\nMembers of the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) and the Republic of Yemen have reached the concluding stage of an\r\nagreement on the terms for the accession of Yemen to the organization. This\r\ncomes after 13 years of negotiations, which began when Yemen submitted its application to join the WTO in 2000. Yemen\u2019s request for accession has\r\nbeen examined in accordance with the guidelines set out by the WTO General\r\nCouncil on the accession of least-developed countries (LDC) and there must now\r\nbe a Council Decision approving the terms of Yemen\u2019s accession, before the EU\r\ncan formally support that approval in the WTO.\nA summary of the terms of the accession is\r\nset out below.\nII. SUMMARY OF TERMS OF YEMEN\u2019S WTO ACCESSION BY SECTOR\nSchedule of commitments\nGoods\nThe average final bound rate (FBR) in the\r\naccession schedule of Yemen is 22.2 %.\nThe average FBR is slightly higher at 26.2%\r\nfor agriculture products than the 20.1% observed for industrial goods. Tariff\r\npeaks are also higher in agriculture (100% maximum in some agriculture products\r\nversus 40% maximum observed in industrial goods).\nYemen will\r\nimplement the FBRs as from the date of accession.\nThese average\r\nlevels for tariffs are quite reasonable considering the LDC status of Yemen as well as the small size and vulnerability of its economy. Past EU practice in\r\nrelation to LDCs has been to accept these tariff levels as reasonable for\r\neconomies of comparable size.\nIndustrial Goods \n\u2013              \r\nThe average FBR for non-agriculture products is\r\n20.1%.\n\u2013              \r\nThe highest averages of around 27% are observed\r\nin furniture and footwear.\n\u2013              \r\nThe lowest, around 10%, relates to Information\r\nTechnology (IT) products.\n\u2013              \r\nThe highest tariff peaks are 40% (cement and\r\ncertain processed fish) and 43% (most of fisheries and processed fisheries\r\nproducts).\nAgricultural goods \n\u2013              \r\nThe average FBR for agriculture products is\r\n26.2%.\n\u2013              \r\nThe highest tariff peaks in agriculture are in\r\ntobacco and coffee at 100%.\nServices \nYemen's schedule of\r\nspecific commitments in services is satisfactory considering its LDC status.\r\nYemen will undertake market access and national treatment commitments in a\r\nbroad range of services sectors, including professional, computer and other\r\nbusiness services, communication services (courier services and telecommunications),\r\nconstruction, distribution, private educational, environmental, financial\r\n(insurance and banking), private health related services, tourism and transport\r\nservices (maritime and rail transport).\nProtocol commitments\nIn the final, multilateral stage of the\r\naccession process, WTO Members collectively sought to ensure the basic\r\ncompatibility of Yemen\u2019s trade laws and institutions with WTO rules and\r\nagreements, setting these out in the Protocol of accession and Working Party\r\nReport. \nTransitional periods were requested in a\r\nnumber of fields; the following are of particular interest to the EU:\nTrading rights: Yemen confirmed that it would grant any natural or legal person of\r\na WTO Member, regardless of physical presence or investment in Yemen, the right to be the importer of record of any product allowed to be\r\nimported into Yemen no later than 31 December 2014. Yemen's laws and regulations relating to all fees, charges and\r\ntaxes levied in connection with such trade, will conform fully with its WTO\r\nobligations.\nPursuant to the same timelines, Yemen will grant trading rights in a non-discriminatory\r\nand non-discretionary manner in conformity with the WTO Agreements. Any\r\nrequirements for commercial registration or application for trading rights will\r\nbe for customs and fiscal purposes only, and would not require investment in Yemen.\nOther duties and charges: Yemen committed to bind other duties and\r\ncharges within the meaning of Article II:1(b) of the GATT 1994\r\nat a rate of 0.25 per cent At the latest 4 years\r\nafter accession, the bound rate for these other duties\r\nand charges would be 0 as provided for in Yemen\u2019s Goods Schedule. \nFees and charges for services rendered: the requirement that certificates of origin and invoices of\r\nimports into Yemen be endorsed or notarized by Yemeni\r\nConsulates abroad will be terminated no later than 1\r\nJanuary 2017.\nCustoms valuation: Yemen\u2019s\r\nlegislation and implementing regulations will be in conformity with the Customs\r\nValuation Agreement by the date of accession. Yemen will progressively implement\r\nthe Agreement in accordance with an Action Plan set out in the Working Party\r\nreport and will fully apply the WTO provisions\r\nconcerning customs valuation, including the WTO Agreement on the implementation\r\nof Article VII of the GATT 1994 and Annex I (Interpretative notes) on 31 December 2016. Yemen confirmed that during the transition\r\nperiod, Yemen would ensure that its regulations under legislation in place and\r\nadditional regulations implemented during the transition concerning customs\r\nvaluation would be applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all imports. \nSanitary and phytosanitary measures\r\n(SPS): Yemen will benefit from a transition period till\r\n31 December 2016 for full implementation of the SPS Agreement, as set\r\nout in an action plan included in the working party\r\nreport.\nTechnical Barriers to Trade (TBT): Yemen will fully implement the Agreement\r\non Technical Barriers to Trade by 31 December 2016. An action plan is set out\r\nin the working party report.\nTrade-related intellectual property\r\nrights (TRIPS): The full\r\nimplementation of the TRIPS Agreement will be effective by the end of 2016\r\n(except for patent protection of pharmaceuticals covered by the Decision on\r\nTRIPS and Public Health (WT/L/641)).\nIII. RECOMMENDATION\nIn submitting the terms of Accession of the\r\n Republic of Yemen to the WTO for approval by the Council, the Commission\r\nconsiders these terms as representing a balanced and ambitious package of\r\nmarket opening commitments, which will bring substantial benefits to Yemen and its WTO trading partners alike.\n2013/0342 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be taken by\r\nthe European Union within the Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization on the accession of the Republic of Yemen to the WTO\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 91, 100(2) and the\r\nfirst subparagraph of Article 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9)\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\n12 April 2000 the Government of the Republic of Yemen applied for accession to the Marrakesh Agreement\r\nestablishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), pursuant to Article XII of\r\nthat Agreement.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Working Party on the accession of the Republic of Yemen was\r\nestablished on 17 and 19 July 2000 in order to reach agreement on terms of accession acceptable to the Republic of   Yemen and all WTO Members.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, on behalf\r\nof the Union, has negotiated a comprehensive series of market opening\r\ncommitments on the part of the Republic of Yemen which satisfy the Union's requests.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These commitments are now\r\nembodied in the Protocol of Accession of the Republic of Yemen to the WTO.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accession to the WTO is\r\nexpected to make a positive and lasting contribution to the process of economic\r\nreform and sustainable development in the Republic of Yemen.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Protocol of Accession\r\nshould therefore be approved.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article XII of the\r\nAgreement establishing the WTO provides that the terms of accession are to be\r\nagreed between the acceding Member and the WTO, and that the Ministerial\r\nConference of the WTO approves the terms of accession on the WTO side.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, it is\r\nnecessary to establish the position to be taken by the Union within the\r\nMinisterial Conference,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe position to be taken by the European\r\nUnion within the Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization on the\r\naccession of the Republic of Yemen to the WTO is to approve the accession.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\nday of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
