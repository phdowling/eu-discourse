The proposal draws on the\r\nresults of the public consultation in 2009/2010 that preceded the Commission\r\nproposal for the new Financial Regulation which was adopted in 2012.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nAs stated above, the overarching principle\r\nof this proposal is maximum alignment with the Financial Regulation and its\r\nRules of Application. This is achieved by direct references to these\r\nregulations.\nFurthermore, alignment is sought with the\r\nlatest available version of the Common Implementing Rules regulation where it\r\ncontains provisions relevant for financial implementation; these cases, not\r\nnumerous, are treated by including identical text.\nReferences to the Financial Regulation and\r\nits Rules of Application have to be read bearing in mind that:\n\u2013                        \r\nArticle 2(2) of the proposal excludes the\r\napplication of provisions which give the Commission the power to adopt\r\ndelegated acts under Article 290 TFEU.\n\u2013                        \r\nWhere an article of the Financial Regulation is\r\ndeclared applicable to the 11th EDF, all the related and relevant\r\nprovisions of the Rules of Application also apply directly unless their\r\napplication is explicitly excluded. However, where the Financial Regulation or\r\nthe applicable Rules of Application provisions contain only indirect internal\r\nreferences, the provisions referred to only apply if the 11th EDF\r\nFinancial Regulation declares them applicable. In other words, it is solely the\r\n11th EDF Financial Regulation that explicitly declares provisions of\r\nthe Financial Regulation or the Rules of Application applicable to the 11th\r\nEDF or not. \n\u2013                        \r\nCertain provisions of the Financial Regulation\r\nor the Rules of Application apply \u201cmutatis mutandis\u201d; in such a case the\r\napplicable provisions have to be interpreted reasonably pursuant to their\r\npurpose and objective, and bearing in mind the context of their application, in\r\naccordance with the principles of interpretation established by the case-law of\r\nthe Court of Justice, and not literally.\n\u2013                        \r\nIn applying by reference the provisions of the\r\nFinancial Regulation to 11th EDF implementation, due account must be\r\ntaken of the exceptions especially provided for in the Financial Regulation to\r\naddress the specificities of external action, and in particular its\r\nextraterritorial and conventional context. \nThe proposal follows as much as possible\r\nthe structure of the Financial Regulation. It is divided into three Parts: Main\r\nProvisions, Investment Facility, and Transitional and Final Provisions.\nThe recitals of the proposal address the\r\ndegree of alignment with the Financial Regulation and its Rules of Application\r\nin more detail.\nPart One \u201cMain Provisions\u201d is subdivided\r\ninto ten Titles: Subject matter, scope and general provisions; Financial\r\nprinciples; 11th EDF resources and its implementation; Financial\r\nactors; Revenue operations; Expenditure operations; Various implementation\r\nprovisions; Funding instruments; Presentation of the accounts and accounting;\r\nand External audit and discharge.\nThe self-standing text of the proposal\r\nlargely falls into one of three categories. Certain text is aligned on the\r\nsubstance with the Financial Regulation but it was deemed inappropriate to\r\nachieve the alignment by a mere reference because of terminological differences\r\nor the necessity to carry out minor adjustments to the 11th EDF.\r\nExamples of this are in Title VIII \u201cFunding instruments\u201d. Other self-standing\r\ntext is specific to the 11th EDF. Examples of this are in Title VI\r\n\u201cRevenue operations\u201d. As stated above, third type of self-standing text\r\ncontains provisions aligned with the latest version of the Common Implementing\r\nRules regulation.\nPart Two describes the management of 11th\r\nEDF resources under the Investment Facility (IF) managed by the EIB. Some\r\nchanges, in comparison with the 10th EDF, were necessary due to the\r\ndeadline fixed for the availability of funds subscribed by the Member States pursuant\r\nto the Internal Agreement. Where an article of the Financial Regulation or of\r\nthe Rules of application apply to the IF, it should be specifically mentioned.\nIn conclusion, this proposal results in\r\noverall simplification by showing more clearly which provisions of the\r\nFinancial Regulation and its Rules of Application apply and which provisions\r\nare specificities of the 11th EDF. This proposal contains less than\r\nhalf the number of articles compared to the 10th EDF Financial\r\nRegulation.\nThe proposal is accompanied by a Commission\r\nStaff Working Document which allows a comparison of this proposal with the 10th\r\nEDF Financial Regulation and is a synoptic presentation of the provisions of\r\nthe Financial Regulation and its Rules of Application that are applicable to\r\nthe 11th EDF. In this comparative document, the provisions of the\r\nFinancial Regulation and the Rules of Application which do not apply are in\r\nstrikethrough format.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no budgetary implications.\r\nThe 11th EDF is not included in the EU budget and its financial\r\nenvelope is determined in the Internal Agreement. While the funds will be\r\nimplemented according to the 11th EDF Financial Regulation, its\r\nadoption itself has no financial impact.\n2013/0320 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non the financial regulation applicable to\r\nthe 11th European Development Fund\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Internal Agreement\r\nbetween the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European\r\nUnion, meeting within the Council, on the financing of European Union aid under\r\nthe multiannual financial framework for the period 2014 to 2020, in accordance\r\nwith the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement (hereinafter \u201cthe Internal Agreement\u201d),\r\nand on the allocation of financial assistance for the Overseas Countries and\r\nTerritories (\u201cthe OCTs\u201d) to which Part Four of the Treaty on the Functioning of\r\nthe European union (hereinafter \"the Treaty\") applies and in\r\nparticular Article 10(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Court\r\nof Auditors[1],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Investment Bank on the provisions concerning it[2], \nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to\r\ndetermine the detailed rules for the payment of the contributions by the Member\r\nStates to the 11th European Development Fund (\"the 11th\r\nEDF\"), set up by the Internal Agreement.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to lay\r\ndown the conditions in accordance with which the Court of Auditors must exercise\r\nits powers in respect of the 11th EDF.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to\r\ndetermine the detailed rules for the financial implementation of the 11th\r\nEDF concerning notably the applicable principles; the constitution of its resources;\r\nthe financial actors and entities entrusted with budget-implementation tasks;\r\nthe financing decisions, commitments and payments; the funding instruments\r\nincluding procurement, grants, financial instruments and Union trust funds; the\r\npresentation of the accounts and accounting; the external audit by the Court of\r\nAuditors and discharge by the European Parliament; as well as the Investment\r\nFacility managed by the European Investment Bank.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the sake of\r\nsimplification and coherence, this Regulation should be aligned, as much as\r\npossible, with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012[3] and Commission Delegated\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1268/2012[4].\r\nSuch alignment should be achieved by direct references to these regulations and\r\nshould, on the one hand, allow for an easy identification of specificities in\r\nthe financial implementation of the 11th EDF and, on the other hand,\r\nreduce the diversity of Union funding rules in the area of external action that\r\ncreates an unnecessary burden for the recipients, the Commission as well as\r\nother actors involved.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to recall\r\nthat the framework for financial implementation of the 11th EDF is,\r\nbesides this Regulation, constituted by several instruments: the Partnership\r\nAgreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of\r\nStates on the one part, and the European Community and its Member States on the\r\nother part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000, revised in Luxembourg on 25 June\r\n2005 and revised in Ouagadougou on 22 June 2010 (hereinafter \u201cthe Cotonou\r\nAgreement), in particular by its Annex IV; further by the Internal Agreement;\r\nby Council Decision of [date] on the association of the overseas countries and\r\nterritories with the European Union (hereinafter \u201cthe Overseas Association\r\nDecision\u201d); and by Council Regulation No [number] of [date] on the\r\nimplementation of the 11th European Development Fund (hereinafter\r\n\u201cthe Implementation Regulation\u201d).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The financial\r\nimplementation of the 11th EDF should be guided by the principles of\r\nunity and budgetary accuracy, unit of account, universality, specification,\r\nsound financial management and transparency. Having regard to the multiannual\r\nset-up of the 11th EDF, the budgetary principle of annuality should\r\nnot apply to the 11th EDF.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rules concerning the\r\nfinancial actors, i.e. the authorising and accounting officers, the delegation\r\nof their tasks as well as their liability should be aligned with Regulation (EU,\r\nEuratom) No 966/2012 as the Commission exerts the same executive responsibility\r\nwhen it implements the 11th EDF.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to\r\nestablish the detailed rules in accordance with which the authorising officer\r\nby delegation of the Commission establishes the necessary arrangements with the\r\nACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) States and OCTs to ensure the proper\r\nexecution of operations, in close cooperation with the national, regional,\r\nintra-ACP or territorial authorising officer designated by the ACP States or OCTs.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rules on indirect\r\nmanagement, which entail the entrustment of budget-implementation tasks and of\r\nits conditions and limits, should be aligned with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\r\n966/2012. In addition, a provision on sub-delegation of budget-implementation\r\ntasks mirroring that in [the Common Implementing Rules regulation] should be\r\ninserted in order to ensure a coherent implementation of funding of external\r\naction. This Regulation should nonetheless contain specific provisions on\r\ntemporary actors taking the place of the national authorising officer, on\r\nentrustment by the ACP States and OCTs to a service provider, and on\r\nstrengthening the protection of Union financial interests in the case of\r\nindirect management with ACP States and OCTs.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While EDF resources will\r\nnot be implemented under shared management, this Regulation should enable that\r\nin the framework of regional cooperation between ACP States and OCTs, on the\r\none hand, and the Union's outermost regions, on the other hand, EDF resources\r\nand support from the European Regional Development Fund (\u201cthe ERDF\u201d) in favour\r\nof the Union's outermost regions can be implemented by the same entity in\r\naccordance with this Regulation as regards EDF resources and under shared\r\nmanagement as regards the ERDF.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions on financing\r\ndecisions should be aligned with those of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012\r\nwhere the Commission implements the 11th EDF.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rules on commitments\r\nshould be aligned with those of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 with the\r\nexception of provisional commitments which should not be available in the 11th\r\nEDF. In addition, an extension of deadlines should be provided where it is\r\nnecessary for actions carried out in indirect management by ACP States or OCTs.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The time limits for\r\npayments should be aligned with those of the Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\r\n966/2012. Special provisions should be laid down where ACP States and OCTs are not entrusted with carrying out payments under indirect management and\r\nwhere, consequently, the Commission continues to carry out payments to\r\nrecipients.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Various implementation\r\nprovisions concerning the internal auditor, good administration and redress,\r\nthe IT system, electronic transmission, e-Government, the administrative and\r\nfinancial penalties, and the use of the central exclusion database, should be\r\naligned with those of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012. In addition, the\r\nprotection of Union financial interests through the application of\r\nadministrative penalties should be strengthened and clarified where the 11th\r\nEDF is implemented in indirect management with ACP States and OCTs.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rules on procurement,\r\ngrants, prizes, and experts should be aligned with those of Regulation (EU,\r\nEuratom) No 966/2012. The rules on financial instruments and Union trust funds\r\nshould be aligned with adjustments due to the nature of the 11th EDF.\r\nBudget support to OCTs should take the institutional links with the Member\r\nStates concerned into account.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rules on presentation\r\nof the accounts and accounting, and on external audit and discharge, should\r\nmirror those of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 in order to provide a\r\ncoherent framework for implementation and reporting.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to lay down\r\nthe conditions in accordance with which the European Investment Bank (\u201cthe EIB\u201d)\r\nmanages certain 11th EDF resources.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions concerning\r\nscrutiny by the Court of Auditors of the 11th EDF resources managed\r\nby the EIB should comply with the tripartite agreement concluded between the\r\nCourt of Auditors, the EIB, and the Commission provided for in Article 287(3)\r\nof the Treaty.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The transitional provisions\r\nshould lay down the rules on treating balances and revenue from previous European\r\nDevelopment Funds as well as the application of this Regulation to residual\r\noperations under them.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow for\r\ntimely programming and implementation of the 11th EDF programmes, this\r\nRegulation should enter into force on the third day following that of its\r\npublication in the Official Journal of the European Union,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nPART ONE\r\nMAIN
