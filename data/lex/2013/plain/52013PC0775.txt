In\nresponse to requests from several Member States, the Commission, together with\nthe government experts concerned, considered whether to open autonomous tariff\nquotas for certain agricultural and industrial products.\nOn 22 December 2009 the Council\nadopted Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 opening and providing for the management\nof autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural and\nindustrial products so that Union demand for the products in question could be\nmet under the most favourable conditions. In view of the numerous amendments\nmade to this Regulation and the transparency policy of the Commission the\nRegulation should be replaced by this proposal.\nTariff quotas of the Union should be opened\nat zero or reduced rates of the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duty for\nappropriate volumes, without disturbing the markets for such products.\nDiscussions at meetings of the Economic Tariff Questions Group showed that the\nMember States were ready to open quotas for the products covered by the\nproposal for a Regulation, without disturbing the markets for such products\nThe proposal is in line with agricultural,\ntrade, entreprise, development and external relations policies. Especially this\nproposal is not at the expense of countries enjoying a preferential trading\nagreement with the EU (e.g. GSP, ACP regime, candidate countries and potential\ncandidates).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Economic Tariff Questions Group\nrepresenting the industries of each Member State was consulted. All listed\nquotas reflect the agreement reached by the Group.\nThere was no mention of potentially serious\nrisks with irreversible consequences.\nThis proposal will follow an inter service\nconsultation procedure and will be published after its adoption by the Council.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nA Council Regulation opening and providing\nfor the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain\nagricultural and industrial products on the legal basis of Article 31 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion. By virtue of that Article autonomous tariff\nquotas are fixed by the Council acting on a qualified majority on the basis of\na Commission proposal.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiary principle therefore does not apply.\nThis set of measures is in line with the\nprinciples for simplifying the procedures for the operators engaged in foreign\ntrade and with the Commission communication of 2011 concerning autonomous\ntariff suspensions and quotas (C 363, 13.12.2011, p.6).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nUncollected\ncustoms duties with a total amount of \u20ac -64 900 000.\n2013/0383 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nopening and providing for the management\nof autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural and\nindustrial products and repealing Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production\nin the Union of certain agricultural and industrial products is insufficient to\nmeet the specific requirements of the user industries in the Union.\nConsequently Union supplies of those products depend to a considerable extent\non imports from third countries. The most urgent Union requirements for the products\nin question should be met immediately on the most favorable terms. Union tariff\nquotas at preferential duty rates should therefore be opened within the limits\nof appropriate volumes taking account of the need not to disturb the markets\nfor such products or impede the establishment or development of Union\nproduction.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is\nnecessary, to ensure for all Union importers equal and uninterrupted access to\nthose quotas and to ensure the uninterrupted application of the rates laid down\nfor the quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States\nuntil the quotas have been exhausted.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Regulation\n(EEC) No 2454/93[1]\nprovides for a system of tariff quota management which ensures equal and\nuninterrupted access to the quotas and uninterrupted application of the rates\nand follows the chronological order of dates of acceptance of declarations of\nrelease for free circulation. The tariff quotas opened by this Regulation\nshould therefore be managed by the Commission and the Member States in accordance with that system. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The quota volumes are\nmostly expressed in tonnes. For certain products for which an autonomous tariff\nquota is opened the quota volume is set out in another measurement unit. Where\nfor those products no supplementary measurement unit is specified in the\nCombined Nomenclature laid down in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No\n2658/87[2]\nthere can be uncertainty in respect of the measurement unit used. For the sake\nof clarity and in the interest of a better quota management it is therefore\nnecessary to provide that, in order to benefit from those autonomous tariff\nquotas, the exact quantity of the products imported be entered in the\ndeclaration for release for free circulation using the measurement unit of the\nquota volume set out for those products in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EU)\nNo 7/2010[3]\nhas been amended many times. In the interest of transparemcy and in order to\nfacilitate economic operators to follow the goods subject to autonomous tariff quotas,\nit is considered appropriate to replace Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 in its\nentirety. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nprinciple of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the\nachievement of the basic objective of promoting trade between Member States and third countries to lay down rules in order to balance the commercial interest\nof economic operators in the Union without changing the Union\u2019s Word Trade Orgniation\n(WTO) schedule. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in\norder to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with Article 5(4) of the\nTreaty on European Union.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the tariff quotas\nhave to take effect from 1 January 2014, this Regulation should apply from the\nsame date and enter into force immediately,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nFor the products listed in the Annex\nautonomous tariff quotas of the Union shall be opened within which the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties shall\nbe suspended for the periods, at the duty rates, and up to the volumes\nindicated therein.\nArticle 2\nThe tariff quotas referred to in Article 1\nshall be managed by the Commission in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and\n308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.\nArticle 3\nWhere a declaration for release for free\ncirculation is presented for a product mentioned in this Regulation, for which\nthe quota volume is expressed in a measurement unit other than the weight in\ntonnes or kilogram and than the value, for products for which no supplementary\nunit is set out in the Combined Nomenclature laid down in Annex I to Regulation\n(EEC) No 2658/87, the exact quantity of the products imported shall be entered\nin \u201cBox 41: Supplementary units\u201d of that declaration using the measurement unit\nof the quota volume for those products as set out in the Annex to this\nRegulation.\nArticle 4\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\nthe day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT FOR PROPOSALS\nHAVING A BUDGETARY IMPACT EXCLUSIVELY LIMITED TO THE REVENUE SIDE\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:\nCouncil Regulation opening and providing\nfor the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain\nagricultural and industrial products and repealing Regulation (EU) No 7/2010. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGET LINES\nChapter and Article: Chapter 12, Article\n120\nAmount budgeted for the year 2014: 18.086.400.000\n\u20ac (DB 2014)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FINANCIAL IMPACT\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial implications\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial impact\non expenditure but has a financial impact on revenue.
