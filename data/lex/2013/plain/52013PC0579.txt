It assists the Commission in exercising its implementing powers\r\nfor certain statistical domains. These exclude international trade in goods statistics. \nIn this domain, the Committee on statistics\r\nrelating to the trading of goods with non-member countries (Extrastat\r\nCommittee) assists the Commission, in accordance with Article\r\n11 of Regulation (EC) No 471/2009.\nThe Commission is proposing a new ESS structure to improve coordination\r\nand partnership in a clear pyramid structure within the ESS, with the ESSC as the\r\nhighest strategic body. One aspect of this streamlining is to concentrate comitology\r\npowers in the hands of the ESSC. In February 2012[5], the ESSC supported this new approach.\nTherefore it is also proposed to amend Regulation\r\n(EC) No 471/2009 by replacing\r\nthe references to the Extrastat Committee by a reference to the ESSC. \n\u00b7      Legal basis\nArticle 338(1) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union. \n\u00b7      Choice of instrument\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\r\nIMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implications for the EU\r\nbudget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nNone.\nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposed act concerns an EEA matter and\r\nshould therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n2013/0279 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 471/2009 on\r\nCommunity statistics relating to external trade with non-member countries as\r\nregards conferring of delegated and implementing powers upon the Commission for\r\nthe adoption of certain measures\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\r\nentry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('the Treaty'),\r\nthe powers conferred upon the Commission should be aligned with Articles 290\r\nand 291 of the Treaty.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In connection with the\r\nadoption of Regulation (EU) No\r\n182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011\r\nlaying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control\r\nby Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers[6], the Commission has committed itself[7] to reviewing, in the light of\r\nthe criteria laid down in the Treaty, legislative acts which currently contain\r\nreferences to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 471/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May\r\n2009 on Community statistics relating to external trade with non-member\r\ncountries and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/95[8] confers powers upon the\r\nCommission in order to implement some of the provisions of this Regulation.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of the\r\nalignment of Regulation (EC) No 471/2009 with the new rules of the Treaty,\r\nimplementing powers currently conferred upon the Commission should be provided\r\nfor by conferring powers on the Commission to adopt delegated and implementing\r\nacts.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take\r\ninto account changes in the Customs Code or provisions deriving from\r\ninternational conventions, changes necessary for methodological reasons and the\r\nnecessity to set up an efficient system for the collection of data and the\r\ncompilation of statistics, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\r\n290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the\r\nadaptation of the list of customs procedures or customs-approved treatment or\r\nuse, specific goods or movements and different or specific provisions applicable to them, the\r\nexclusion of goods or movements from external trade statistics, the data\r\ncollection according to paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 4, the further\r\nspecification of the statistical data, the requirement for limited sets of data\r\nfor specific goods or movements and data provided in accordance with Article\r\n4(2), the characteristics of the sample, the reporting period and the level of\r\naggregation for partner countries, goods and currencies for statistics on trade\r\nby invoicing currency, the adaptation of the deadline for transmitting\r\nstatistics and of the content, coverage and revision conditions for statistics\r\nalready transmitted, the deadline for transmitting statistics on trade by\r\nbusiness characteristics and statistics on trade broken down by invoicing\r\ncurrency.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is of particular\r\nimportance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its\r\npreparatory work, including at expert level.
