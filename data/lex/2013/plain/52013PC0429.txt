The scheme set out in the\nproposal would allow for the export of rough diamonds from Greenland to the\nUnion as well as to other participants of the certification scheme, provided\nthat all imports and exports of rough diamonds are verified and, for exports,\ncertified by Union authorities pursuant to the rules set out in Regulation (EC)\nNo 2368/2002 implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme for the\ninternational trade in rough diamonds.\nThis association would strengthen economic\nrelations between the European Union and Greenland in the diamond industry, and\nin particular it would enable Greenland to export rough diamonds accompanied by\nthe European Union Certificate issued for the purposes of the certification\nscheme, with a view of promoting the economic development of Greenland.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nGreenland and Denmark have agreed to the\napproach taken by the proposal and will undertake to transpose and implement in\nthe legislation applicable to Greenland the relevant provisions of Regulation\n(EC) No 2368/2002 as regards the conditions and formalities for importing and\nexporting rough diamonds, their transit via the Union and to a participant\nother than the Union, the participation of the Union, including Greenland, in the\nKimberley Process certification scheme, obligations relating to due diligence,\nanti-circumvention, exchange of information, and ensuring compliance with such\nprovisions.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis of the Council Decision is\nArticle 203 TFEU. The proposal for this Council Decision is closely connected\nto an amendment of Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 which extends the territory of the\nUnion to also cover the territory of Greenland for the purposes of the\nKimberley Process certification scheme. Accordingly, Greenland will be\nprohibited to accept imports or exports of rough diamonds without a valid\nKimberley Process certificate. This will allow for the export of rough diamonds\nfrom Greenland to third countries as long as they are accompanied by a European\nUnion Kimberley Process certificate. For imports into Greenland from third\ncountries the rough diamonds and the accompanying certificate will first have\nto be submitted for verification to one of the six authorities of the Union who deal with issuing EU Kimberley Process Certificates.\nThe proposal for the Council Decision sets\nout specific rules for circulation of rough diamonds between the Union and\nGreenland, either with the Union or Greenland as destination, or with the view\nthat rough diamonds would be then exported to a third country from the Union. In\neither case, the main requirements for rough diamonds to enter or leave the\nterritory of Greenland or the Union is to (1) be\naccompanied by (a) either a document (or a copy thereof validated by a Union\nauthority) attesting that they were mined in Greenland, or (b) a copy of a\nKimberley Process certificate as validated by a Union authority, and (2) be in\nsealed tamper-resistant containers. \nRough diamonds mined or extracted in\nGreenland, provided that they have not been exported previously to a third\ncountry, may enter the Union\u2019s customs territory by the use of an attesting\ndocument issued by authorities in Greenland. These shipments upon entry to the\nUnion\u2019s customs territory will be have to be verified by a Union authority, and\nthe copy issued by this authority will have to accompany shipments between the\nUnion customs territory and Greenland for any subsequent circulation.\nAs for export of rough diamonds to and from\nthird countries, Greenland will only be able to import or export if the\ndiamonds are first shipped to one of the authorities of\nthe Union to issue an EU Kimberley Process certificate or to verify the\nKimberley Process certificate of another Kimberley Process participant. \nOnce rough diamonds mined or extracted in\nGreenland had been exported to a third country, upon their return they may\ncirculate between the Union and Greenland according to the same rules that\napply to all other rough diamonds imported into the Union. \n2013/0201 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nlaying down rules and procedures to enable\nthe participation of Greenland in the Kimberley Process certification scheme\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 203 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Parliament[1],\n\nActing in accordance with a special\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union is a participant\nin the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for the international trade in\nrough diamonds. As a participant it has to ensure that a Kimberley Process\nCertificate accompanies each shipment of rough diamonds imported in or exported\nfrom the territory of the Union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n2368/2002 implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme for the\ninternational trade in rough diamonds[2]\nsets up a Union system of certification and import and export controls for\nrough diamonds for the purposes of implementing the Kimberley Process\ncertification scheme.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Greenland is not part of\nthe Union territory but it is included in the list of overseas countries and\nterritories set out in Annex II to the Treaty. In accordance with Article 198\nof the Treaty, the purpose of the association of the overseas countries and\nterritories with the Union is to promote the economic and social development of\nthe overseas countries and territories and to establish close economic\nrelations between them and the Union as a whole.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Denmark and Greenland have\nrequested to enable the participation of Greenland in the Kimberley Process\nCertification Scheme on rough diamonds through its cooperation with the\nEuropean Union. This association would strengthen economic relations between\nthe European Union and Greenland in the diamond industry, and in particular it\nwould enable Greenland to export rough diamonds accompanied by the European\nUnion Certificate issued for the purposes of the certification scheme, with a\nview of promoting the economic development of Greenland. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trade in rough diamonds in\n Greenland should, therefore, be conducted in compliance with Union rules\nimplementing the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for the international\ntrade in rough diamonds. Accordingly, the scope of application of Regulation (EC)\nNo 2368/2002 will be extended to the territory of Greenland for the purpose of\nthe certification scheme. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In particular, Greenland should only export rough diamonds to other participants in the Kimberley Process\nCertification Scheme after they have been certified by a Union authority listed\nin Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002. The imports of rough diamonds\ninto Greenland should also be verified by the Union authorities.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to permit the\ninternational trade in rough diamonds in Greenland, in accordance with the\nrules on trade within the Union, Greenland should undertake to transpose and\nimplement the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 into the\nnational law of Greenland so as to allow the application of this Decision,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nSubject\nmatter and scope\nThis Decision sets out\nthe general rules and conditions for the participation of Greenland in the system of certification and import and export controls for rough\ndiamonds as set out in Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002.
