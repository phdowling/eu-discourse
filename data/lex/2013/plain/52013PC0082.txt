The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n Summary of the proposed action On 18 September 2012, the Commission imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of certain organic coated steel products originating in the People's Republic of China. The investigation found dumping of the product concerned, which caused injury to the Union industry. The investigation also found that it was not against the Union interest to impose anti-dumping measures. Therefore, it is proposed that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Regulation in order to impose definitive anti-dumping measures on imports of certain organic coated steel products originating in the People's Republic of China. \n Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019) \n Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n Indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n Choice of instruments \n Proposed instrument: Regulation. \n Other means would not be adequate because the basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the EU\nbudget.\n2013/0051 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty\nand collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain\norganic coated steel products originating in the People's Republic of China\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on\nprotection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European\nCommunity[1]\n('the basic Regulation'), and in particular\nArticle 9 and 14(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\nthe European Commission ('the Commission') after consulting the Advisory\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROVISIONAL\nMEASURES\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, by\nRegulation (EU) No 845/2012[2]\n(\u2018the provisional Regulation\u2019) imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty ('the\nprovisional measures') on imports of certain organic coated steel products\n('OCS') originating in the People's Republic of China\n('PRC').\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proceeding was\ninitiated following a complaint lodged on 7 November 2011 by Eurofer ('the complainant') on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 70%, of\nthe total Union production of OCS. The complaint contained prima facie evidence of dumping of the\nsaid product and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered\nsufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SUBSEQUENT\nPROCEDURE\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent\nto the disclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of\nwhich it was decided to impose provisional anti-dumping measures ('the\nprovisional disclosure'), several interested parties made written submissions\nmaking known their views on the provisional findings. The parties who so\nrequested were granted the opportunity to be heard. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission continued\nto seek and verify all information it deemed necessary for its definitive\nfindings. Further verification visits were carried out at the premises of the\nfollowing company:\n\u2013              \nMacrometal, Hamburg\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently all parties\nwere informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which\nit was intended to recommend the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty\non imports of certain organic coated steel products originating in the PRC and\nthe definitive collection of the amounts secured by way of provisional duty\n('the final disclosure'). All parties were granted a period within which they\ncould make comments on the final disclosure. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comments submitted by\nthe interested parties were considered and taken into account where\nappropriate. \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation\nperiod\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As set out in recital (12)\nof the provisional Regulation, the investigation of dumping and injury covered\nthe period from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2011 (the \u2018investigation period\u2019\nor \u2018IP\u2019). The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury\ncovered the period from January 2008 to the end of the IP (\u2018the period considered\u2019).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRODUCT\nCONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product\nexclusion requests\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recitals (19) and (20) of\nthe provisional Regulation stated that the Commission had received several\nrequests for product exclusion and that no conclusions had been reached at the\ntime of the provisional Regulation being published.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After disclosure of the\nprovisional findings, more requests were received and have been analysed as\nfollows:\n3.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OCS with metallic coating of\nchromium or tin\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A user of OCS submitted a\nrequest to exclude OCS with a substrate with a metallic coating of chromium or\ntin from the product scope. The investigation established that the metallic\ncoating of chromium or tin renders this product type physically and chemically\ndifferent to the OCS under investigation. OCS with a substrate with a metallic\ncoating of chromium or tin is almost exclusively used in the food packaging and\ncable industries. The Union industry also explained that it had not intended\nthis product to form part of the product scope. For these reasons OCS with a\nsubstrate with a metallic coating of chromium or tin has been excluded from the\nproduct scope of the investigation.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nChina Iron and Steel Association ('CISA'), two importers and one user proposed\nthe exclusion of four other product types. These requests were analysed and\nrejected as below.\n3.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hot-rolled plates with\nprotective primer, whether organic or inorganic\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nrequest was rejected because these products do not fall under the CN codes\nunder investigation. The painting or coating is only for rust protection and\ntherefore fall under CN heading 7208 and not CN heading 7210. Hot-rolled plates\nwith a protective primer, whether organic or inorganic, are not included in the\nproduct scope and as a result cannot be removed from it.\n3.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OCS with substrate thickness\nbetween 0.6 and 2.0 mm\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CISA\nand two importers requested the exclusion of OCS with substrate thickness\nbetween 0.6 and 2.0 mm, representing 5 \u2013 10% of imports from China, stating that there was only direct competition between Chinese exports and Union industry\nproduction for OCS with substrate thickness of between 0.25 and 0.6 mm.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nrequest was rejected given that both Chinese exporters and the Union industry\nmanufacture and sell OCS with a substrate thickness of between 0.6 and 2.0 mm\nand that therefore these products are clearly in competition with each other.\nNo evidence was provided to show that OCS with a substrate thickness of over\n0.6 mm does not compete with OCS with a substrate thickness of less than 0.6 mm\nand that therefore this would constitute a different product type. OCS with\nsubstrate thickness of less than and above 0.6 mm have the same basic physical\nand technical characteristics and same end uses and therefore are the same\nproduct.\n3.1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OCS with aluminium-zinc\nalloy coated substrate\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ntwo importers alleged that only four Union producers have the licence to\nproduce this product type and that only one company was in fact producing it.\nThey also alleged that this product differs from zinc coated OCS in terms of\nproduct characteristics.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nrequest was rejected as the two product types are interchangeable with\noverlapping uses and at least two cooperating Union producers manufactured this\nproduct type during the investigation period. It should be noted that only one\ncooperating Chinese exporting producer exported this product type to the Union during the investigation period.\n3.1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OCS with zinc alloy coated\nsubstrate\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nrequest was rejected because, contrary to the assertion by one user, this\nproduct is produced and sold in significant quantities by several Union\nproducers and has the same essential physical and technical characteristics and\nend uses as other types of OCS.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product\ninclusion request\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\ndisclosure of the provisional findings, one association requested that OCS with\na metallic coating of chromium or tin, classified under TARIC codes 7210 12 20\n10 and 7210 50 00 10 be included in the product scope. This request was\nrejected as these codes were not included in the original complaint and the\nproducts covered by such codes have different physical and technical\ncharacteristics from the products covered by the complaint.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product\nconcerned\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the acceptance of the exclusion of OCS with metallic\ncoating of chromium or tin, the provisional findings with regard to the product\nconcerned, outlined in recitals (13) and (14) of the provisional Regulation,\nare amended by this exclusion.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned is\ntherefore now certain organic coated steel products ('OCS'), i.e. flat-rolled\nproducts of non-alloy and alloy steel (not including stainless steel) which are\npainted, varnished or coated with plastics on at least one side, excluding\nso-called 'sandwich panels' of a kind used for building applications and\nconsisting of two outer metal sheets with a stabilising core of insulation\nmaterial sandwiched between them, excluding those products with a final coating\nof zinc-dust (a zinc-rich paint, containing by weight 70 % or more of zinc), and\nexcluding those products with a substrate with a metallic coating of chromium\nor tin, currently falling within CN codes ex 7210 70 80, ex 7212 40 80, ex 7225\n99 00, ex 7226 99 70, and originating in the People's Republic of China ('the product\nconcerned').\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like\nproduct\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\nno comments were received with regard to the conclusions outlined in recitals\n(15) to (18) of the provisional Regulation, the provisional findings with\nregard to the like product are hereby confirmed.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DUMPING\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several Chinese exporting\nproducers submitted comments on dumping following the imposition of provisional\nmeasures and the disclosure of the Commission's provisional findings to the\nChinese exporting producers. \n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market\neconomy treatment ('MET')\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments concerning MET, recitals (21) to (38) of the provisional Regulation\nare hereby confirmed. None of the two groups of cooperating exporters in the\nPRC that had requested MET could show that they fulfilled the criteria for\nbeing granted MET. \n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individual\ntreatment ('IT')\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two\nexporting producers in the PRC met the criteria for being granted IT (recital\n(40) of the provisional Regulation). Another party reiterated its claims to be\ngranted IT and individual examination. Indeed, this party withdrew its MET\nclaim but maintained its request to be granted IT, as well as individual\nexamination. This claim was considered as a claim for individual examination\nand therefore included in the requests mentioned in recital (41) of the\nprovisional Regulation. In accordance with Article 9(5) and 9(6) of the basic\nRegulation, individual duties shall be applied to imports from any exporter or\nproducer which will be granted individual examination, as provided for in\nArticle 17(3) of the basic Regulation. As explained in more detail in recitals\n(26) to (31) below, the claim for an individual duty for this party was\nrejected. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\ncomments on IT, recitals (39) to (40) of the provisional Regulation are hereby\nconfirmed. \n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individual\nexamination ('IE')\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Claims for individual\nexamination were submitted by eight exporting producers pursuant to Article\n17(3) of the basic Regulation. As explained in recitals (41) and (42) of the\nprovisional Regulation, hereby confirmed, one exporting producer, Union Steel\nChina, which requested MET, was inspected in the framework of the examination\nof its MET claim. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to all other\nclaims for individual examination, it was concluded that individual examinations\nwould be unduly burdensome and would prevent the completion of the\ninvestigation in good time. Accordingly, these claims were not accepted. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One party argued that its\nrequest cannot be considered as administratively burdensome as after the\nprovisional stage the Commission services still have six months before the\ndefinitive determination. Also, in recent proceedings the Commission services\nhave granted individual examination after the provisional stage. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another party, already\nreferred to in recital (24) above, argued that it should be granted individual\nexamination as it has submitted the necessary information within the time\nlimits set and as individual examination was already granted to another\nexporting producer, Union Steel China. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decisions whether or not to\naccept individual examinations are taken on a case by case basis, taking into\naccount the number of claims submitted and the time available to assess these\nclaims. In this case, in view of the number of claims submitted, the limited\ntime available after the examination of the sampled exporting producers and the\nMET claim of the exporting producer which was not included in the sample and\nthe procedural deadlines which need to be respected, it was decided that these\nclaims cannot be accepted, as set out in recital (27) above. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As explained in recital\n(41) of the provisional Regulation, with regard to Union Steel China the\ncircumstances were different as this company was already inspected in the\nframework of the examination of its MET claim. \n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal\nvalue\n4.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analogue country\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No further comments were\nreceived concerning the selection of Canada as the analogue country. Therefore\nrecitals (43) to (49) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n4.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Determination of normal\nvalue\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal value was calculated\non the basis of the data provided by the sole cooperating producer in the\nanalogue country (i.e. Canada). Thus, normal value was established on the basis\nof prices of domestic sales and constructed normal value of one Canadian producer\nof the like product as explained in recitals (50) to (55) of the provisional Regulation. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, two Chinese exporting producers argued that the Commission did not\nprovide necessary information in relation to the normal value in the analogue\ncountry, in particular regarding the different product types, comparability of\nthe products, representativeness and adjustments. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These claims were partially accepted. The Commission\nprovided to the Chinese exporting producers all relevant information concerning\nthe data used in order to calculate normal value that could be released without\ninfringing the provisions of Article 19 of the basic Regulation, i.e. assuring\nat the same time that any confidential data provided by the sole Canadian\nproducer is treated as such and is not disclosed to other parties. The\ninformation provided to the exporting producers allowed to understand the\nmethodology used in line with the provisions of Article 2 of the basic\nRegulation. However, it was found that more\ndetailed data could be provided per product type by using ranges in order to\nrespect the confidentiality of the data. Such data were provided in the final\ndisclosure. In addition, more detailed information was provided as to why some\nproducts types were found not to be representative and the level of the\nadjustments made to the normal value. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, one party acknowledged that more detailed data was indeed provided,\nbut argued that some data were still missing, in particular with regard to the\nlevel of the cost of manufacturing used to construct the normal value for those\nproduct types that were not sold domestically. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For those product types not\nsold domestically, the cost of manufacturing of the closest resembling product\ntypes were used as a basis and adjusted where appropriate. Although they were\nnot identical to those exported by the Chinese exporting producers, they\nnevertheless very closely resembled the types sold by the Chinese exporting\nproducers, as in general only the thickness of the organic coating varied.\nAccordingly the differences in cost of manufacturing were found to be minor. \n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As acknowledged by this\nparty in its submission, in the final disclosure the Commission provided more\ndetailed data presented in ranges, including data relating to the cost of\nmanufacturing, SG&A and profit in the analogue country used to construct\nnormal value, data relating to the overall level of adjustments made to the\nnormal value, data relating to the final normal value per group of product\ntypes, data regarding the representativeness and the nature and effects of the\nadjustments made to the normal value. \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As follows from the above,\nthe final disclosure, made in accordance with the requirements of Article 20 of\nthe basic Regulation, allowed interested parties to understand in detail the\nmethodology used in line with the provisions of Article 2 of the basic\nRegulation and all parties were given the opportunity to comment on the final\ndisclosure. Therefore, it is concluded that the disclosure was complete and\nthat the rights of defence of interested parties were fully respected. \n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One party claimed that the\nsource of the selling, general and administrative costs and profit in cases\nwhere the normal value was constructed was left unexplained. However, in\nrecital (55) of the provisional Regulation it is explained that the selling,\ngeneral and administrative costs of the Canadian producer and the profit margin\nof the Canadian producer for the product types that were found to be profitable\nwere used in cases where the normal value had to be constructed. In accordance\nwith Article 2(3) and 2(6) of the basic Regulation, selling, general and\nadminstrative costs and profit are based on verified costs and verified\ndomestic sales in the ordinary course of trade of the analogue country\nproducer. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above,\nrecitals (50) to (55) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export\nprice\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the\nabsence of any comments, recital (56) of the provisional Regulation is hereby\nconfirmed.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two parties claimed that\nthe Commission did not provide sufficient information with regard to the\ncomparability of the product types and their representativeness at product type\nlevel. \n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As explained in recital (35)\nabove, the Commission provided to the Chinese exporting producers all the\nrelevant data that could be provided, account taken of the provisions on\nconfidentiality in the basic Regulation. More detailed information per product\ntype was indeed provided following this claim made after the provisional\ndisclosure, including the reasons why some product types were found not to be\nrepresentative and, accordingly, the normal value had to be constructed. \n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe verification visit to the Canadian analogue country producer, the normal values for some product types were adjusted downwards for\ndifferences in physical characteristics in accordance with Article 2(10)(a) of\nthe basic Regulation, mainly as it was found that the organic coating used by\nthe Canadian producer with regard to some of the product types was of a\ndifferent quality than the one used by the Chinese exporting producers. These\nadjustments have resulted in a lower normal value for the product types\nconcerned. \n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One party requested the amounts\nof each of the adjustments made to the normal value. In order to respect the\nconfidentiality of the data provided by the Canadian producer, these data could\nnot be provided. However, the overall percentage of the adjustments was given\nin the final disclosure, showing that the impact of the adjustments was minor. \n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As set out in recital (37)\nabove, in case of any difference found the product types that were sold\ndomestically resembled nevertheless very closely the types sold by the Chinese\nexporting producers. These product types were found to be similar in terms of\nsteel quality, substrate width and thickness of the substrate used and the type\nand mass of the metallic coating used. \n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where appropriate the\nadjustment for differences in physical characteristics was made, as set out in\nrecital (45) above, due to a difference in the quality of the organic coating\nused with regard to some of the product types. In order to assess the market value\nof the difference, the average cost difference with the closest resembling\nproduct type was taken into account as well as international market prices. \n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same party enquired\nwhether transport costs and insurance costs were included in the SG&A. It\nshould be stated that as the comparison was done on an ex-works basis, these\ncosts were not included. \n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One party argued that their\nclaim for an adjustment in relation to the value of three invoices should have\nbeen taken into account, as well as one particular sales transaction which had\nbeen disregarded. This claim related to compensation paid to a customer linked\nto sales made prior to the investigation period, but which had been treated as\na discount to the value of these three invoices issued in the investigation\nperiod, resulting in the value of these invoices being artificially lowered.

After a decrease in\n2009 mirroring the strong decline in consumption due to the economic crisis,\nimports recovered at a very fast pace, with market share recovering in one year\nto 2008 i.e. to pre economic crisis levels and then by the end of the IP\nsignificantly exceeding them.\n5.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prices of imports and price\nundercutting\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure one\nexporting producer requested further information on the calculation of the\nprice undercutting where there was no exact match between the product type\nexported from the PRC and the product type sold on the Union market by the\nUnion industry.

They stated that WTO case law has\nmade the point that more recent data are more relevant to the determination of\ninjury than historical data, and that the outcome of an end-point to end-point\ncomparison very much depends on which years are used, as a one-year shift can\nshow a different result. A comparison from 2009 to the end of the IP therefore\nshows a different trend to a comparison from the start of the period considered\nto the end of the IP. \n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This claim was not accepted.\nThe period considered was defined in line with usual practice, and the\nrecommendations of the WTO, as an objective period of three to four years\nending at the end of the investigation period, which is itself a 12 month\nperiod ending as close as possible to the date of initiation. \n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even if the period\nconsidered had started in 2009, the finding of material injury would remain\nvalid. The Union industry had not reached its target profit with increasing\nimports during the period despite increasing production volumes, and sales\nvolumes, and increasing productivity.

No evidence was provided\nfor this allegation and it could not be confirmed. The allegation is therefore\nrejected.\n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure\none importer claimed that the Union industry was importing large quantities of\nthe product concerned from the PRC and used its re-sales data to demonstrate\nthis.\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that the Union\nindustry has imported quantities of the product concerned from the PRC is not\nin dispute. However, even using the importer's own data, the volume claimed is\nless than 1% of total imports from the PRC and therefore negligible. As stated\nin recital (125) of the provisional Regulation, imports from the PRC by the\nUnion industry were 2-3% of total imports during the investigation period.\n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The findings of recital\n(125) of the provisional Regulation are therefore confirmed.\n7.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Captive use and captive\nsales\n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure\nCISA again claimed that the Union industry was making OCS available to its\nrelated downstream businesses at a \"subsidised\" price, thereby\nundercutting their competitors in the downstream segment. However, no evidence\nwas provided to change the Commission's conclusion in recital (127) of the\nprovisional Regulation, i.e. that the price difference between related and\nunrelated sales was small (2%) and that this was not a case of self-inflicted\ninjury.\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CISA also challenged the\ndata on the cost of production of OCS and, in extension, the price of OCS to\nrelated parties. Given the sales price of hot-dipped galvanised coils, a raw\nmaterial in the manufacture of OCS, they allege that the cost of production of\nOCS in the investigation period could not exceed 900 EUR/tonne.\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whereas the Commission does\nnot dispute the data provided by CISA regarding the production cost of\nhot-dipped galvanised coils, the cost of production of OCS was verified in all\nof the sampled Union producers. The Commission is satisfied that the full cost\nof production (raw materials, processing, coating, SG&A, finance costs\netc.) is as set out in recital (74) above.\n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CISA then claimed that the\nsale of OCS to related parties is made at a loss and is therefore a cause of\ninjury to the Union industry. This is based on a comparison of the total cost\nof production (978 EUR/tonne) versus the average price of related sale (965\nEUR/tonne).\n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whereas it is correct that\na simple mathematical comparison would suggest that related sales were made at\na loss, this would assume that the Union industry would incur the same level of\nSG&A and other sales overheads on their captive sales as on their unrelated\nones. As stated in recital (105) of the provisional Regulation, sales to\nrelated parties were made on a 'cost plus' basis and therefore the Union\nIndustry was recovering their costs on these sales.\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other comments\non this point the findings of recitals (126) to (127) of the provisional\nRegulation are hereby confirmed.\n7.2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic crisis\n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the deadline for\ncomments to the final disclosure an interested party noted the announced\nclosure of a plant in Belgium, and that force majeure was causing difficulties\nto normal production and shipment from other facilities in Belgium. The interested party alleged that this shows the lack of security of supply of OCS in the\nEU and was a reason to allow importers and users to freely source their OCS\nfrom the EU and from China.\n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 These arguments are\nrejected. Given that capacity utilisation in the EU is low, the issue is not one\nof a problem of supply as the Union industry has adequate available capacity. In\nany case the facilities being closed in Belgium did not manufacture OCS.\nSecurity of supply is of course important, but the proposed duties in this case\nare not designed to stop supply of OCS from China, merely to prevent that\nsupply being dumped onto the EU market.\n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other comments\non this point the findings of recitals (128) to (129) of the provisional\nRegulation are hereby confirmed.\n7.2.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Structural overcapacity\n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties made further\nallegations that the Union producers had a structural overcapacity, exceeding\nthe total Union consumption. The allegation had been made at an earlier stage\nand was dealt with in recitals (130) to (132) of the provisional Regulation. In\nthe absence of further evidence on this point, the conclusion of these recitals\nis therefore confirmed.\n7.2.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase in cost of\nproduction\n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties made further\nallegations that a source of injury to the Union producers was an increase in\ntheir cost of production during the period considered. Data above shows that\ncost of production on average increased by only 6%. In the absence of dumped\nimports from the PRC the Union industry should be able to pass this increase on\nto its customers, yet prices fell by 3%. The claim that cost of production was\na cause of injury is therefore rejected.\n7.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on causation\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the above, the\nprovisional findings as set out in recitals (133) to (136) of the provisional\nRegulation that the dumped imports from the PRC caused material injury to the\nUnion industry within the meaning of Article 3(6) of the basic Regulation are\nmaintained. The provisional findings about the effect of the other known\nfactors which could have caused injury to the Union industry were also\nconfirmed: these factors are not such as to break the causal link established\nbetween the dumped imports from the PRC and the injury suffered by the Union\nindustry.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UNION INTEREST\n8.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union industry\n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 No new comments or\ninformation were received regarding the interest of the Union producers after\ndisclosure of the provisional findings. Therefore recitals (138) to (143) of\nthe provisional Regulation on the interest of these interested parties are hereby\nconfirmed. \n8.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Importers, traders and\nusers\n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 Comments were received from\nimporters and other interested parties following final disclosure, however no new\ncomments or information were received regarding the interest of importers,\ntraders or users. Therefore the provisional findings in recitals (144) to (152)\nof the provisional Regulation on the interest of these parties are hereby\nconfirmed. \n8.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on Union\ninterest\n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, the\nprovisional findings concerning Union interest are confirmed, i.e. there are no\ncompelling reasons against the imposition of definitive measures on imports of\nOCS originating in the PRC.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING\nMEASURES\n9.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injury elimination level\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 Following provisional\ndisclosure, two interested parties claimed that the data provided did not give\nsufficient information and explanation on the calculation of the undercutting\nand underselling margins. As explained in the provisional disclosure, some\nvalues were not disclosed due to confidentiality as the model concerned was\nonly manufactured by one or two Union producers. At the stage of final\ndisclosure ranges for these models were disclosed.\n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties also\nchallenged the use of 6,7% as the target profit of the Union industry to\ncalculate the injury margin. They claimed that such a profit is overstated and\nunrealistic given the current economic environment and that 2008 was not a\nrepresentative year for profitability, as it was an exceptional year for the\nsteel industry.\n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 This claim is rejected.\nFirstly, profitability for OCS was in fact higher before 2008 than in 2008, which\ncontradicts the claim that 2008 is an exceptional year. Secondly, the target\nprofit is the profit that can be obtained in the absence of dumped imports.\n2008 was the last year where the full effects of the dumped imports had not yet\nbeen felt by the Union industry and therefore is a suitable basis for\nestablishing the target profit.\n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure\ninterested parties again challenged the use of 6,7% as the target profit of the\nUnion industry and the description of 2008 as a representative year for\nprofitability. This argument is rejected as no evidence as to what the profit\nof the Union industry would have been in 2008 in the absence of the financial\ncrisis was provided. In addition, their argument that the profit made by the\nUnion industry in 2008 was affected by the financial crisis, making 2008 an\nexceptional year, would seem to point to an argument that the profit realised\nin 2008 is lower than the industry would expect in a normal year.\n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties also\npointed to the fact that import volumes from the PRC were at their lowest in\n2009 rather than in 2008. However, given that the Union industry was not\nprofitable in 2009, it is impossible to use 2009 data to set a target profit\nfor the Union industry.\n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 CISA have further alleged\nthat the profit to unrelated customers in 2008 cannot be used as the target\nprofit because that year shows the largest price difference between related and\nunrelated sales. This argument was rejected, as this price difference is not\nrelevant to the calculation of the profit of sales to unrelated customers. \n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 CISA then proposed that the\ntarget profit for sales of OCS to unrelated parties in the Union be based on\nthe average overall profit for the multinational corporation ArcelorMittal for\nthe years 2010 and 2011. This was rejected as a reliable source for the profit\non OCS in the Union in the absence of dumped imports, because taking the profit\nof the entire worldwide ArcelorMittal group is clearly not representative of\nprofit on sales of OCS in the Union.\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties also\nchallenged the post-importation costs used to calculate the provisional duties\nas they were based on the data from only one importer. The Commission verified\na second importer at a later stage and their data has been now used to\ncalculate post-importation costs. By using an average of the two companies\nthese costs have now dropped slightly, thereby increasing the injury margins\naccordingly.\n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nchallenged the Commission's methodology for the calculation of the underselling\nmargin. However, this challenge was based on the erroneous assumption that the\nCommission had calculated the underselling margin by removing the average\nprofit of the Union industry in the IP (2.6%) from the market price to get to\nthe 'break-even point' (i.e. a price that would result in zero profit) and then\nadding the target profit onto this 'break-even point'.\n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission calculated\nthe underselling margin by adding the target profit to the cost of production of\neach product type. The methodology suggested by this interested party is\nflawed, because the average profit of 2.6% was not automatically achieved on\neach sale of each model by all companies from which the data was used.\n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party also challenged\nthe Commission's injury calculations. Given that that party did not have full\naccess to the data used by the Commission to calculate the injury margin, it\nattempted to calculate it on its own, based on its understanding of the price\ndifference on the market between aluminium-zinc alloy coated and zinc coated\nsubstrate, which it had calculated at USD 50 per MT. This 'recalculation',\nbased on incomplete data, resulted in a lower injury margin than that which the\nCommission had calculated and disclosed.\n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 Their arguments were\nrejected because following an analysis of the full data from both the exporting\nproducers and the Union industry, the alleged price difference could not be\nfound. Consequently, it should be underlined that the data which the interested\nparty was using was incomplete and thus could not be relied upon to reproduce\nthe Commission's injury calculations.\n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 Recitals (154) to (158) of\nthe provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. \n9.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive measures\n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\nreached with regard to dumping, injury, causation and Union interest, and in\naccordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, a definitive anti-dumping\nduty should be imposed on imports of OCS originating in the PRC at the level of\nthe lower of the dumping and injury margins found, in accordance with the\nlesser duty rule. In this case, the duty rate should accordingly be set at the\nlevel of the injury found.\n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 Seven companies that were\nnot sampled cooperated with the anti-dumping investigation, but not the\nparallel anti-subsidy one. For these companies, the anti-dumping duty rate is\nset at zero. In the anti-subsidy investigation, these companies will be subject\nto the residual duty. \n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure equal\ntreatment between any new exporting producers and the cooperating companies not\nincluded in the sample, provision should be made for the weighted average duty\nimposed on the latter companies to be applied to any new producers which would\notherwise not be entitled to a review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic\nRegulation, as Article 11(4) does not apply where sampling has been used.\n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above, the\nrate at which such duties will be imposed are set as follows: \n Company Name || Subsidy margin || Dumping margin || Injury margin || Countervailing duty || Anti-dumping duty \n Zhangjiagang Panhua Steel Strip Co., Ltd, Chongqing Wanda Steel Strip Co., Ltd, and Zhangjiagang Free Trade Zone Jiaxinda International Trade Co., Ltd || 29.7% || 60.9% || 55.8% || 29.7% || 26.1% \n Zhejiang Huadong Light Steel Building Material Co.

In these circumstances the provisional\nduty at the rates set out in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 845/2012 should\nbe definitively collected. However amounts provisionally secured for products\nwith a substrate with a metallic coating of chromium or tin should be released,\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.
