The cornerstone of the Action Plan is the\nestablishment of FLEGT partnerships between the EU and timber-producing countries,\naimed at putting a stop to illegal logging. In 2005 the Council adopted\nRegulation (EC) No 2173/2005[3]\nestablishing a mechanism to verify the legality of timber imported into the EU\nunder the FLEGT partnerships.\nIn December 2005 the Council authorised the\nCommission to negotiate FLEGT partnership agreements with timber-producing\ncountries[4].\n\nThe Commission entered into negotiations\nwith Indonesia in January 2007. The Commission was assisted by a number of\nMember States, in particular the UK, which provided resources to facilitate the\nprocess in Indonesia. The Commission has kept the Council updated on progress,\nwith reports to the Working Party on Forests as well as to EU Embassies in\nIndonesia. \nThe Agreement addresses all the elements of\nthe negotiating directives adopted by the Council. In particular, it\nestablishes the framework, institutions and systems for the FLEGT licensing\nscheme. It sets out the framework for monitoring legal compliance and for\nindependent auditing of the system. These are set out in annexes to the\nAgreement, which provide a detailed description of the structures that will\nunderpin the assurance of legality afforded by a FLEGT licence. \nThe Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA)\nfocuses on governance and law enforcement and, by means of the licensing\nsystem, provides the assurance that Indonesia's timber is legally produced. It\nrepresents a major commitment by Indonesia to address the persistent problem of\nillegal logging. The FLEGT licence will reassure the EU market that Indonesian\ntimber products are from verified legal sources.\nThe legislation for which compliance must\nbe verified has been identified following an extensive stakeholder consultation\nprocess within Indonesia. Indonesia will work with an independent auditor, which\nwill provide regular, public reports on the effectiveness of the system. The\nAgreement also aims to increase transparency in the sector, including through\nthe application of Freedom of Information legislation in Indonesia. \nThe Agreement goes beyond the limited\nproduct coverage proposed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005\non the FLEGT scheme and covers a wide range of exported timber products. \nThe Agreement makes provision for import\ncontrols at the EU\u2019s borders, as provided for in Regulation (EC)\nNo 2173/2005 on the FLEGT scheme and Regulation (EC) No 1024/2008\nlaying down detailed measures for implementing it. The Agreement includes a\ndescription of Indonesia's FLEGT licence, which uses the format prescribed in\nthe above-mentioned Regulation. \nThe Agreement establishes a mechanism for\ndialogue and cooperation with the EU on the FLEGT scheme, via the Joint\nImplementation Committee. It also establishes principles of stakeholder\nparticipation, social safeguards, accountability and transparency, and\nmonitoring of and reporting on implementation of the Agreement.\nThe FLEGT licensing scheme is expected to\nbe fully operational by late 2013. The licensing scheme will be assessed\nagainst the criteria laid down in the Agreement before the EU begins accepting\nFLEGT licences.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n2013/0205 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion of the Voluntary\nPartnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Indonesia\non forest law enforcement, governance and trade in timber products to the\nEuropean Union \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraphs of\nArticle 207(3) and (4), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) and\n218(7), thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\nEuropean Parliament[5],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In May 2003 the European\nCommission adopted a Communication to the European Parliament and to the\nCouncil entitled \u2018Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT):\nProposal for an EU Action Plan\u2019[6]\nwhich called for measures to address illegal logging by developing voluntary\npartnership Agreements with timber-producing countries.

It is important to establish a credible\nsystem to guarantee the legality of harvesting, transportation, processing and\ntrade of timber processed timber products.\nThe Indonesian Timber Legality Assurance System (TLAS) provides assurance that timber and timber products produced\nand processed in Indonesia come from legal sources\nand are in full compliance with relevant Indonesian laws and regulations, as verified by independent auditing and monitored by civil\nsociety. \n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indonesian laws and\nregulations as foundation of the TLAS\nThe Indonesian regulation on the \u2018Standards and\nGuidelines on the Assessment of Performance of Sustainable Forest Management\nand the Verification of Timber Legality in the State and Privately-owned\nForests\u2019 (Forestry Minister\u2019s Regulation P.38/Menhut-II/2009) establish the\nTLAS as well as the sustainability scheme (SFM), to improve forest governance;\nto suppress illegal logging and the associated timber trade and to ensure the\ncredibility and improve the image of Indonesia\u2019s timber products. \nThe TLAS comprises the following elements: \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legality Standards,\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control of Supply Chain,\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Verification Procedures,\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Licensing Scheme, \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring.\nTLAS is the basic system used to assure the\nlegality of timber and timber products produced in Indonesia for export to the\nUnion and to other markets.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of the TLAS: a\nmulti-stakeholder process \nSince 2003, a wide range of Indonesian forestry\nstakeholders have been actively engaged in developing, implementing and\nevaluating the TLAS, thereby providing better oversight, transparency and\ncredibility in the process. In 2009, the multi-stakeholder process resulted in\nthe issuance of Forestry Minister\u2019s Regulation P.38/Menhut-II/2009, followed by\nDG Forest Utilization Technical Guidelines No.6/VI-SET/2009 and\nNo.02/VI-BPPHH/2010. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scope of the TLAS\nIndonesian forest resources can broadly be\ndivided into two types of ownership: state forests and privately owned\nforests/lands. State forests consist of production forests for long-term\nsustainable timber production under a variety of permit types and forest areas\nthat can be converted for non-forestry purposes such as for settlement or\nplantations. The application of TLAS on state forests and privately owned forests/lands\nis set out in Annex II. \nThe TLAS covers timber and timber products from\nall permit types as well as the operations of all timber traders, downstream\nprocessors and exporters. \nThe TLAS requires that imported timber and\ntimber products are cleared at customs and comply with Indonesia\u2019s import\nregulations. Imported timber and timber products must be accompanied by\ndocuments providing assurance of the legality of the timber in its country of\nharvest. Imported timber and timber products will have to enter into a\ncontrolled supply chain that complies with the Indonesian rules and\nregulations. Indonesia will provide guidance on how to implement the above. \nCertain timber products may contain recycled\nmaterials. Indonesia provides guidance on how the use of recycled materials\nwill be dealt with under the TLAS. \nImpounded timber is not\nincluded in the TLAS and therefore cannot be\ncovered by a FLEGT licence. \nThe TLAS covers timber products destined for\ndomestic and international markets. All Indonesian producers, processors, and\ntraders (operators) will be verified for legality, including those supplying\nthe domestic market. \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 TLAS\nlegality standards\nThe TLAS has five timber legality standards.\nThese standards and their verification guidelines are set out in Annex II.\nThe TLAS also incorporates the \u2018Standard and\nGuidelines on Assessment of Performance in Sustainable Forest Management\n(SFM)\u2019. The assessment of sustainable forest management using the SFM standard\nalso verifies that the auditee complies with the relevant legality criteria.\nSFM-certified organisations operating within production forest zones on\nstate-owned lands (permanent forest domain) adhere to both relevant legality\nand SFM standards. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control of the Timber\nSupply Chain\nThe permit holder (in the case of concessions)\nor landowner (in the case of private land) or company (in the case of traders,\nprocessors and exporters) shall demonstrate that every node of their supply\nchain is controlled and documented as set out in the Minister for Forestry\nRegulations P.55/Menhut-II/2006 and P.30/Menhut-II/2012 (hereinafter referred\nto as the Regulations). These Regulations require provincial and district\nforestry officials to undertake field verification and validate the documents\nwhich are submitted by permit holders, landowners, or processors at each node\nof the supply chain. \nThe operational controls at each point in the\nsupply chain are summarised in Diagram 1; the guidance for imports is\nbeing developed.\nAll consignments in the supply chain must be\naccompanied by relevant transport documents. Companies must apply appropriate\nsystems to segregate between timber and timber products from verified sources\nwith timber and timber products from other sources, and maintain records that\ndistinguish between these two sources. Companies at each point in the supply\nchain are required to record whether the involved logs, products or timber\nconsignment are TLAS-verified. \nOperators in the supply chain are required to\nkeep records on received, stored, processed and delivered timber and timber\nproducts so as to enable subsequent reconciliation of quantitative data between\nand within nodes of the supply chain. Such data shall be made available for\nprovincial and district forestry officials to carry out reconciliation tests.\nMain activities and procedures, including reconciliation, for each stage of the\nsupply chain are further explained in the Appendix of this Annex.\nDiagram 1: Control of the supply chain\nwhich shows the required key documents at each point in the supply chain.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutional\nset-up for Legality Verification and Export Licensing\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\nThe Indonesian TLAS is based on an approach\nknown as 'operator-based licensing' which has much in common with product or\nforest management certification systems. The Indonesian Ministry of Forestry\nnominates a number of conformity assessment bodies (LP and LV) which it\nauthorizes to audit the legality of operations of timber producers, traders,\nprocessors and exporters ('operators'). \nThe conformity assessment bodies (CAB) are\naccredited by the Indonesian National Accreditation Body (KAN). CAB are\ncontracted by operators who want their operations to be certified as legal and\nare required to operate according to relevant ISO guidelines. They report the\noutcome of the audits to the auditee and to the Ministry of Forestry. \nThe CAB ensure that the auditees operate in\ncompliance with the Indonesian legality definition as contained in Annex II,\nincluding controls to prevent material from unknown sources entering their\nsupply chains. When an auditee is found to be compliant, a legality certificate\nwith a validity of 3 (three) years is issued. \nLVs also act as export licensing authorities\nand check verified exporters' supply chain control systems. If compliant, they\nissue export licences in the form of V-Legal Documents. Thus exports without an\nexport permit are prohibited.\nIndonesia has enacted a regulation which allows\ncivil society groups to raise objections on the legality verification of an\noperator by CAB or in the event of illegal activities detected during\noperations. In case of complaints about the operations of a conformity\nassessment body, civil society groups can file complaints with KAN. \nThe relationship between different entities\ninvolved in implementing the TLAS is illustrated in Diagram 2:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conformity\nassessment bodies \nThe conformity assessment bodies play a key\nrole in the Indonesian system. They are contracted to verify the legality of\nthe production, processing and trade activities of individual companies in the\nsupply chain, including the integrity of the supply chain. LV also issue\nV-Legal Documents for individual shipments of exported timber.\nThere are two types of CAB: (i) assessment\nbodies (Lembaga Penilai/LP) which audits the performance of Forest Management\nUnits (FMUs) against the sustainability standard; and (ii) verification bodies\n(Lembaga Verifikasi/LV), which audit FMUs and forest-based industries against\nthe legality standards. \nIn order to ensure those audits that verify the\nlegality standards as set out in Annex II are of the highest quality, the LP\nand LV are required to develop the necessary management systems addressing\ncompetency, consistency, impartiality, transparency, and assessment process\nrequirements as outlined in ISO/IEC 17021 (SFM Standard for LPs) and/or ISO/IEC\nGuide 65 (Legality Standards for LVs). These requirements are specified in the\nTLAS Guidelines. \nLVs can also act as Licensing Authorities. In\nthis case the LVs issue export licences to cover timber products destined to\ninternational markets. For non-Union markets, the Licensing Authorities will\nissue V-Legal Documents, and as for the Union market, FLEGT licenses will be\nissued in accordance with the requirements as outlined in Annex IV. Indonesia\nis developing detailed procedures for the V-Legal Document or FLEGT licensing\nof export consignments.\nThe LVs are contracted by the auditees to carry\nout legality audits and will issue TLAS legality certificates and V-Legal\ndocument or FLEGT licences for exports to international markets. LPs will audit\ntimber producing concessions against the SFM standard. LPs do not issues export\nlicences.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accreditation body\nThe Indonesian National Accreditation Body\n(Komite Akreditasi Nasional - KAN) is responsible for the accreditation of CAB.\nIn case of problem with a LP or LV, complaints can be submitted to the KAN.\nOn 14 July 2009, the KAN signed a Memorandum of\nUnderstanding with the Ministry of Forestry to provide accreditation services\nfor the TLAS. KAN is an independent accreditation body established through\nGovernment Regulation (Peraturan Pemerintah/PP) 102/2000 concerning National\nStandardisation and Presidential Decree (Keputusan Presiden/Keppres) 78/2001\nregarding the National Accreditation Committee. \nThe KAN operates under the guidance of ISO/IEC\n17011 (General Requirements for Accreditation Bodies Accrediting Conformity\nAssessment Bodies). It has developed internal TLAS-specific supporting\ndocuments for the accreditation of LPs (DPLS 13) and LVs (DPLS 14). In addition,\nthe KAN will develop requirements and guidance for the accreditation of LVs for\nexport licensing.\nKAN is internationally recognised by the\nPacific Accreditation Cooperation (PAC) and the International Accreditation\nForum (IAF) to accredit certification bodies for Quality Management Systems,\nEnvironmental Management Systems and Product Certification. KAN is also\nrecognised by the Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (APLAC) and\nthe International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC). \n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Auditees\nAuditees are operators which are subject to\nlegality verification. They include forest management units (concessionaires or\ntimber utilization permit holders, community-based forest permit holders,\nprivate forest/land owners) and forestry-based industries. The forest\nmanagement units and forest-based industries must comply with the applicable\nTLAS standard. For export purposes, the forest-based industries must comply\nwith export licensing requirements. The system allows auditees to submit appeals\nto the LP or LV on the conduct of or results of audits. \n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Independent monitor\nCivil society plays a key role in the\nIndependent Monitoring (IM) of the TLAS. Findings from the Independent Monitor\ncan also be used as part of the Periodic Evaluation (PE) which is required\nunder this Agreement.\nIn the event of an assessment-related\nirregularity, complaints by civil society shall be submitted directly to the\nconcerned LP or LV. If no appropriate response is given to the complaints,\ncivil society entities may file a report to the KAN. For accreditation-related\nirregularities, complaints shall be submitted directly to the KAN. Whenever\ncivil society entities discover wrongdoings by operators, they can lodge\ncomplaints with the relevant LP or LV. \n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Government \nThe Ministry of Forestry regulates the TLAS and\nauthorises the accredited LPs to undertake SFM assessment and LVs to undertake\nlegality verification and to issue V-Legal Documents.\nFurthermore, the Ministry of Forestry also\nregulates the Licence Information Unit (LIU) as a unit responsible for\ninformation exchange which receives and stores relevant data and information on\nthe issuance of V-Legal Documents and which responds to queries from competent\nauthorities or stakeholders. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legality Verification\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction \nIndonesian timber is deemed legal when its\norigin and production process as well as subsequent processing, transport and\ntrade activities are verified as meeting all applicable Indonesian laws and\nregulations, as set out in Annex II. LVs carry out conformity assessments to\nverify compliance.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legality verification\nprocess\nIn accordance with ISO/IEC Guide 65 and the\nTLAS Guidelines, the legality verification process consists of the following:\nApplication and contracting: The permit holder submits to the LV an application that defines\nthe scope of verification, permit holder\u2019s profile and other necessary\ninformation. A contract between the permit holder and the LV, setting out the\nconditions for verification, is required prior to the commencement of the\nverification activities.\nVerification plan: After the signing of the verification contract, the LV prepares a\nverification plan, which includes nomination of the audit team, verification\nprogramme and schedule of activities. The plan is communicated to the auditee\nand the dates of verification activities agreed upon. This information shall be\nmade available in advance for the independent monitors through the websites of\nLVs and the Ministry of Forestry or mass media.\nVerification activities: The verification audit consists of three stages: (i) opening audit\nmeeting, (ii) document verification & field observation and (iii) closing\naudit meeting.\n\u00b7              \nOpening audit meeting: the audit\u2019s objective, scope, schedule and methodology are discussed\nwith the auditee, so as to allow the auditee to raise questions on methods and\nconduct of verification activities;\n\u00b7              \nDocument verification and field observation\nstage: in order to collect evidence on the\nauditee\u2019s compliance with the Indonesian TLAS requirements, LV checks the\nauditee\u2019s systems and procedures, relevant documents and records. LV carries\nout field checks to verify compliance, including cross-checking the findings of\nofficial inspection reports. LV also checks the auditee\u2019s timber traceability\nsystem to ensure that, with adequate evidence, all timber meets the legality\nrequirements. \n\u00b7              \nClosing audit meeting: the verification results, in particular any non-compliances that\nmay be detected, are presented to the auditee. The auditee may raise questions\non the verification results and provide clarification on the evidence presented\nby the LV.\nReporting and decision making: The audit team draws up a verification report, following a\nstructure provided by the Ministry of Forestry. The report is shared with the\nauditee within fourteen calendar days after the closing audit meeting. A copy\nof the report, which includes a description of any findings of non-compliances,\nis submitted to the Ministry of Forestry.\nThe report is used primarily to decide on the\noutcome of the verification audit by the LV. The LV takes the decision on\nwhether to issue a legality certificate based on the verification report\nprepared by the audit team.\nIn cases of non-compliance, the LV will refrain\nfrom issuing a legality certificate, which will prevent the timber from\nentering the supply chain of verified legal timber. Once the non-compliance has\nbeen addressed, the operator may resubmit a request for legality verification. \nInfringements, which are discovered by LV\nduring the verification and reported to the Ministry of Forestry, shall be\nhandled by the responsible authorities in accordance with administrative or\njudicial procedures. If an operator is suspected of breaching regulations, the\nnational, provincial and district authorities may decide to halt the operator\u2019s\nactivities.\nIssuance of the legality certificate and\nrecertification: the LV will issue a legality\ncertificate if an auditee is found to comply with all the indicators in the\nlegality standard, including the rules on control of the timber supply chain. \nThe LV may report at any time to the Ministry\nof Forestry on issued, changed, suspended and withdrawn certificates and every\nthree months shall issue a report. The Ministry of Forestry will then publish\nthese reports on its website. \nA legality certificate is valid for a period of\nthree years, after which the operator is subject to a re-certification audit.\nThe re-certification shall be done prior to the expiry date of the certificate.\nSurveillance:\nOperators with a legality certificate are subject to annual surveillance that\nfollow the principles of the verification activities summarised above. The LV\nmay also carry out surveillance earlier than scheduled before the annual audit\nif the scope of the verification has been extended.\nThe surveillance team draws up a surveillance\nreport. A copy of the report, including a description of any non-compliance\nfound, is submitted to the Ministry of Forestry. Non-compliances detected by\nthe surveillance will result in to suspension or withdrawal of the legality\ncertificate.\nInfringements discovered by the LV during the\nsurveillance and reported to the Ministry of Forestry shall be handled by the\nrelevant authorities, in accordance with administrative or judicial procedures.\n\nSpecial audits:\nOperators with a legality certificate are obliged to report to the LV any\nsignificant changes in ownership, structures, management, and operations that\naffect the quality of its legality controls during the period of validity of\nthe certificate. The LV may carry out special audits to investigate any\ncomplaints or disputes filed by the independent monitors, government\ninstitutions or other stakeholders or upon receipt of the operator\u2019s report on\nchanges that affect the quality of its legality controls \n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Government responsibility\nfor enforcement\nThe Ministry of Forestry, as well as provincial\nand district forestry offices are responsible for the control of timber supply\nchains and checking of related documents (e.g. annual work plans, log felling\nreports, log balance-sheet reports, transport documents, logs/raw\nmaterial/processed products balance-sheet reports and production tally sheets).\nIn the event of inconsistencies, forestry officials may withhold approval of\nthe control documents resulting in a suspension of operations. \nInfringements detected by forestry officials or\nby independent monitors are communicated to the LV, which upon verification may\nlead the LV to suspend or withdraw the awarded legality certificate. Forestry\nofficials may take appropriate follow-up action in accordance with the\nregulatory procedures. \nThe Ministry of Forestry also receives copies\nof the verification reports and subsequent surveillance and special audit\nreports issued by the LVs. Infringements discovered by the LVs, by forestry\nofficials or by independent monitors are handled in accordance with\nadministrative and judicial procedures. If an operator is suspected of\nbreaching regulations, the national, provincial and district authorities may\ndecide to suspend or halt the operator\u2019s activities.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FLEGT Licensing \nThe Indonesian FLEGT licence is known as the\n\u201cV-Legal Document\u201d. This is an export licence that provides evidence that the\ntimber products exported meet the Indonesian legality standard as set out in\nAnnex II and were sourced from a supply chain with adequate controls against\nthe inflow of timber from unknown sources. The V-Legal Document is issued by\nthe LVs who act as Licensing Authorities and will be used as a FLEGT licence\nfor shipments to the Union once the parties have agreed to start the FLEGT\nlicensing scheme.\nIndonesia will clearly define the procedures\nfor issuing V-Legal Documents and communicate these procedures to the exporters\nand any other parties concerned through its licensing authorities (the LVs) and\nthe website of the Ministry of Forestry.\nThe Ministry of Forestry has established a\nLicence Information Unit to maintain a database with copies of all V-Legal\nDocuments and LV non-compliance reports. In the event of an inquiry concerning\nthe authenticity, completeness, and validity of the V-Legal Document or FLEGT\nlicence, the competent authorities in the Union will contact the Licence\nInformation Unit in the Ministry of Forestry for further clarification. This\nunit will communicate with the relevant LV. The Licence Information Unit will\nrespond to the competent authorities upon receipt of the information from the\nLV.\nThe V-Legal Document is issued at the point at\nwhich the export consignment is established prior to the transportation to the\npoint of export. The procedure is as follows:\n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The V-Legal Document is\nissued by the LV, which holds a contract with the exporter, for the consignment\nof timber products to be exported.\n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exporter\u2019s internal\ntraceability system shall provide evidence on the legality of timber for export\nlicensing.

Introduction\nThe Parties are committed to ensuring that\nkey forestry-related information is made available to the public. \nThis Annex provides for this objective to\nbe met by outlining (i) the forestry-related information to be made available\nto the public, (ii) the bodies responsible for making that information\navailable, and (iii) the mechanisms by which it can be accessed. \nThe aim is to ensure that (1) JIC\noperations during implementation of this Agreement are transparent and\nunderstood; (2) a mechanism exists for the Parties as well as relevant\nstakeholders to access key forestry-related information; (3) TLAS functioning\nis strengthened through the availability of information for independent\nmonitoring; and (4) larger objectives of this Agreement are achieved. The public\navailability of information represents an important contribution to reinforcing\nIndonesia\u2019s forest governance.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mechanisms to access\ninformation\nThis Annex is in line with the Indonesian\nLaw on Freedom of Information No. 14/2008. According to this Law, it is\nmandatory for every public institution to develop regulations on access to\ninformation by the public. The Law distinguishes four categories of\ninformation: (1) information available and actively disseminated on a regular\nbasis; (2) information that should be made public without delay; (3)\ninformation that is available at all times and provided upon request; and (4)\ninformation that is restricted or confidential. \nThe Ministry of Forestry (Ministry of\nForestry), provincial and district offices, the National Accreditation Body\n(KAN), the conformity assessment body (CAB), the licensing authorities are all\nsignificant institutions in the functioning of the TLAS and therefore obliged\nas part of their duties to disclose forestry-related information to the public.\n\nTo implement the said Law, the Ministry of\nForestry, provincial and district offices and all other public agencies\nincluding KAN have developed or are developing procedures for making\ninformation available to the public. \nThe KAN is also required to make\ninformation available to the public under ISO/IEC 17011:2004, clause\n8.2-Obligation of the accreditation body. Verification bodies and licensing\nauthorities are required to make information available to the public under Minister for Forestry Regulations and ISO/IEC\n17021:2006 clause 8.1-Publicly accessible information and ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996\nclause 4.8-Documentation.\nCivil society organisations function as one\nof the sources of forestry-related information under Minister\nfor Forestry Regulations.\nThe Minister for\nForestry has issued Regulation No. P.7/Menhut-II/2011\ndated 2 February 2011, which provides that requests for information held by the\nMinistry of Forestry are to be addressed to the Director of the Centre for\nPublic Relations of the Ministry of Forestry in a \u201cone-door\u201d information\npolicy. Further implementing guidance is being developed by Ministry of\nForestry. Information available at regional, provincial, and district forestry\noffices can be accessed directly. \nTo make this Annex operable, the\nprocedures/guidelines/instructions for the mentioned institutions to respond to\nrequests for information need to be developed and approved. In addition, the\nreporting and public disclosure provisions that apply to verification bodies\nand Licensing Authorities will be clarified. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Categories of information\nused to reinforce monitoring and evaluation of the functioning of the TLAS \nLaws and regulations: All laws, regulations, standards, and guidelines listed in the\nlegality standards. \nLand and forest allocation: land allocation maps and provincial spatial plans, procedures for\nland allocation, forest concession or utilisation rights\nand other rights of exploitation and processing, and related document such as concession maps,\nforest area release permit, land title documents and land title maps. \nForest management practices: forest use plans, annual work plans including maps and equipment\npermit, minutes of consultation meetings with communities living in and around\npermit area required for the development of the annual work plans, forest\ntimber exploitation work plan and annexes, Environmental Impact Assessment\ndocuments and minutes of public consultation meetings required for the\ndevelopment of the Environmental Impact Assessment reports, log production\nreports, and stand inventory data in state-owned forest land.\nTransport and supply chain information, e.g. log or forest product transport documents and annexes and\ntimber reconciliation reports, inter-island timber transportation registration documents, and documents showing\nship identity.\nProcessing and industry information: e.g. company establishment deed, business licence and company\nregistration number, report of the Environmental Impact Assessment, industrial\nbusiness licence or industrial registration numbers, industrial raw material\nsupply plans for primary forest product industries, registration of the\nexporter of forest industry products, raw material and processed product\nreports, list of holders of rights to processing, and information on companies\nin secondary processing. \nForest-related fees: e.g. area-based\npayment fees and payment slip\ninvoices, payment orders and invoices for reforestation and forestry\nresource fees.\nVerification and licensing information: quality guidance and standard of procedures for accreditation;
