An analysis of the Biocidal Products Regulation\nhas shown that certain provisions will lead to unforeseen consequences. \nThe main problem identified is that the\ntransitional rules of the Biocidal Products Regulation will introduce an\nun-intended market freeze of up to eleven years for articles treated with biocidal\nsubstances which are legal on the EU market, but which have not yet been\nevaluated at EU level. Other un-intended market barriers for certain companies\nhave also been identified. Finally, the Biocidal Products Regulation fails to\ndefine a protection period for data relating to those products with the most\nfavourable risk profile.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nStakeholders and experts have been\nconsulted in several meetings of the expert group named Competent authorities\nfor biocidal products. The proposal has received broad support in those\nmeetings.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposal contains provisions that will\nremove market barriers for suppliers of new articles treated with biocidal products\nand for a large number of suppliers of biocidal active substances. It also\ndefines the protection periods for the data relating to those biocidal products\nwith the best profile.\n2013/0150 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) No 528/2012\nconcerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products with\nregard to certain conditions for access to the market\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 19(4)(c) of\nRegulation (EU) No 528/2012[2]\nprohibits authorisation for making available for use by the general public of\nbiocidal products meeting the criteria for being persistent, bioaccumulative\nand toxic ('PBT'), or very persistent and very bioaccumulative ('vPvB') in\naccordance with Annex XIII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration,\nEvaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a\nEuropean Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council\nRegulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as\nCouncil Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC,\n93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC[3].\nHowever, whereas biocidal products are often mixtures and sometimes articles, those\ncriteria apply only to substances. Article 19(4)(c) of Regulation (EU) No\n528/2012 should therefore refer to biocidal products consisting of, containing or\ngenerating substances meeting those criteria.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 19(1)(e) and Article\n19(7) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, it should be clarified that the limits\nrequired to be established in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on materials\nand articles intended to come into contact with food[4] are specific migration limits.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since comparative\nassessments are not regulated by Annex VI to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012,\nthe reference to that Annex in Article 23(3) of that Regulation should be\ndeleted.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article 35(3)\nof Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, where all Member States concerned have reached\nan agreement with the reference Member State on mutual recognition, a product is\nto be authorised in accordance with Article 33(4) or Article 34(6).\nHowever, the provisions referring to decisions by all Member States concerned\nto grant authorisations by mutual recognition are laid down in Article 33(3)\nand Article 34(6). Article 35(3) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second subparagraph of\nArticle 45(1) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 requires an application for\nrenewal of Union authorisation to be accompanied by the fees payable under\nArticle 80(1). However, fees can only be paid subsequent to the information\nabout their level provided by the European Chemicals Agency (hereinafter 'Agency')\nin accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 45(3). Therefore, and to\nensure consistency with Article 7(1), Article 13(1), and Article 43(1), the\nsecond subparagraph of Article 45(1) should be deleted.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first and second subparagraphs\nof Article 60(3) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 refer to authorisations granted\nin accordance with Article 30(4), Article 34(6) or Article 44(4). However, the\nprovisions referring to decisions to grant authorisations are laid down in\nArticle 30(1), Article 33(3), Article 33(4), Article 34(6), Article 34(7),\nArticle 36(4), Article 37(2), Article 37(3), and Article 44(5). Furthermore,\nthe second subparagraph of Article 60(3) does not indicate any period for\nprotection of data referred to in Article 20(1)(b) submitted in an application\npursuant to Article 26(1). Article 60(3) should therefore also refer to Article\n26(3), Article 30(1), Article 33(3), Article 33(4), Article 34(6), Article\n34(7), Article 36(4), Article 37(2), Article 37(3), and Article 44(5).\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow the\npreparation of applications for product authorisation by the date of approval\nof an active substance as provided for by the second subparagraph of\nArticle 89(3) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, the electronic public access\nto information on active substances provided for by Article 67 of that\nRegulation should be granted as of the day when the Commission adopts the Regulation\nproviding that the active substance is approved.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first subparagraph of\nArticle 77(1) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 provides for appeals against\ndecisions of the Agency taken pursuant to Article 26(2). However, since Article\n26(2) does not empower the Agency to take any decision, the reference to that\nArticle in Article 77(1) should be deleted.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 86 of Regulation\n(EU) No 528/2012 refers to active substances included in Annex I to Directive\n98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998\nconcerning the placing of biocidal products on the market[5] It should be clarified that the\nprovision applies to all active substances for which the Commission has adopted\na Directive including them in that Annex, that the conditions for an inclusion\nis applicable to an approval, and that the approval date is considered to be the\ndate of inclusion.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first subparagraph of\nArticle 89(2) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 allows Member States to apply their\ncurrent system until two years after the date of approval of an active\nsubstance. The first subparagraph of Article 89(3) requires Member States to\nensure that product authorisations are granted, modified or cancelled within\ntwo years of approval of an active substance. However, taking into account the\ntime required for the various steps of the authorisation process, in particular\nwhere a disagreement on mutual recognition persists between Member States and\ntherefore has to be submitted to the Commission for a decision, it is\nappropriate to extend those deadlines to three years, and to reflect that\nextension in the second subparagraph of Article 37(3).\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first subparagraph of\nArticle 89(2) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 allows Member States to apply\ntheir current system to existing active substances. A biocidal product may\ncontain a combination of new active substances which have been approved and\nexisting active substances which have not yet been approved. For the purpose of\nrewarding innovation by granting such products access to the market, Member\nStates should be allowed to apply their current systems to such products until\nthe existing active substance has been approved, and the products are hence\neligible for authorisation in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 89(4) and Article\n93(2) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 provide phase-out periods for biocidal\nproducts for which no authorisation is granted. The same periods should apply\nfor phasing out the existing form of a product already on the market, where an\nauthorisation is granted but the conditions of the authorisation require the\nproduct to be changed.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first and second subparagraphs\nof Article 93(2) should clarify that the derogation provided for therein\napplies only subject to Member States' national rules.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 94(1) of Regulation\n(EU) No 528/2012 seeks to allow placing on the market of articles treated with\nbiocidal products containing active substances which, albeit not yet approved,\nare being evaluated, either in the context of the work programme referred to in\nArticle 89(1) or based on an application submitted pursuant to Article 94(1).\nHowever, the reference to the entire Article 58 could be interpreted as an\nunintended derogation from the labelling and information requirements in\nArticle 58(3) and (4). Article 94(1) should therefore refer to Article\n58(2).\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 94(1) of Regulation\n(EU) No 528/2012 only applies to treated articles already placed on the market,\nand will hence introduce an unintended ban on most new treated articles,\nlasting from 1 September 2013 until the approval of the last active substance\ncontained in the articles. Its scope should therefore be extended to include\nnew treated articles. Article 94(1) should also provide for a phasing-out\nperiod for treated articles for which no application for the approval of the\nactive substance for the relevant product-type will be submitted by 1 September\n2016. In the interest of simplification, Article 94(2) should be merged\nwith Article 94(1).\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first subparagraph of\nArticle 95(1) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 prescribes the submission of a\ncomplete substance dossier. It should be clarified that such a complete dossier\nmay include data referred to in Annex IIIA or IVA to Directive 98/8/EC.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The third subparagraph of\nArticle 95(1) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 intends to extend the right to\nrefer to data provided in the second subparagraph of Article 63(3) to all\nstudies required for the human health and environmental risk assessment, in\norder to allow prospective relevant persons to be included in the list referred\nto in Article 95(2). Without such a right to refer, many prospective relevant\npersons will not have time to comply with Article 95(1) by such time as\nrequired in order to be included in the list by the date referred to in Article\n95(3). However, the third subparagraph of Article 95(1) fails to include\nstudies on environmental fate and behaviour. Moreover, since prospective\nrelevant persons will pay for the right to refer in accordance with\nArticle 63(3), they should be entitled to fully benefit from that right by\npassing it onto applicants for product authorisation. This Article should\ntherefore be amended accordingly.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fifth subparagraph of\nArticle 95(1) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 intends to limit the protection\nperiod for data which can be shared already as of 1 September 2013 for the\npurpose of compliance with the first subparagraph of Article 95(1) before it\nwill be shared for the purpose of substantiating applications for product\nauthorisations. Such will be the case for data relating to\nsubstance/product-type combinations for which a decision on inclusion in Annex\nI to Directive 98/8/EC has not been taken on 1 September 2013. Article 95 of\nthat Regulation should therefore refer to that date.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 95(2)\nof Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, the list published by the Agency is to contain\nthe names of the participants in the work programme referred to in Article\n89(1). The provision aims to allow those participants to benefit from the cost\ncompensation mechanism set forth by Article 95. That possibility should cover all\npersons who have submitted a complete dossier in accordance with Regulation\n(EU) No 528/2012 or with Directive 98/8/EC, or a letter of access to such a\ndossier. It should also cover dossiers submitted for any substance which is not\nitself an active substance, but which generates such active substances.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first subparagraph of\nArticle 95(3) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 prohibits the placing on the\nmarket of biocidal products containing active substances for which the\nmanufacturer or importer (the 'relevant person') is not included in the list\nreferred to in that Article. By virtue of Article 89(2) and Article 93(2),\ncertain active substances will be legally on the market in biocidal products\nalthough no complete dossier has yet been submitted. The prohibition should not\napply to such substances. Furthermore, where no substance manufacturer or\nimporter is listed for a substance for which a complete dossier has been\nsubmitted, another person should be allowed to place biocidal products\ncontaining that substance on the market, subject to the submission of a dossier\nor a letter of access to a dossier by that person or the manufacturer or\nimporter of the biocidal product.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The phase-out period for\nuse of biocidal products provided for by the second subparagraph of Article\n95(3) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 should depend on the time when the\nsubstance is included in the list.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 95(4) of Regulation\n(EU) No 528/2012 stipulates that Article 95 applies to active substances listed\nunder category 6 in Annex I. Those substances have been included in Annex I\nbased on submissions of complete dossiers, the owners of which should be\nentitled to benefit from the cost compensation mechanism installed by that\nArticle. In the future, other substances may be included in Annex I based on\nsuch submissions. Category 6 in Annex I to that Regulation should therefore be\nregulating all such substances.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The description in Annex V\nto Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of products used in food contact materials\nshould be consistent with the terminology used in Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be clarified in\nthe first subparagraph of Article 96 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 that\nDirective 98/8/EC is repealed without prejudice to all provisions of\nRegulation (EU) No 528/2012 referring to Directive 98/8/EC.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 528/2012\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EU) No 528/2012 is amended as\nfollows: \n(1)                   \nArticle 19 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 1, point (e) is replaced by\nthe following:\n\"(e) where appropriate, maximum residue\nlimits for food and feed have been established with respect to active\nsubstances contained in a biocidal product in accordance with Council\nRegulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures\nfor contaminants in food*, Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum\nresidue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin**,\nRegulation (EC) No 470/2009 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 6 May 2009 laying down Community procedures for the establishment of\nresidue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal\norigin*** or Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 7 May 2002 on undesirable substances in animal feed****, or\nspecific migration limits have been established with respect to such active\nsubstances in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on materials and articles\nintended to come into contact with food*****.\n* OJ L 37, 13.2.1993, p. 1.\n** OJ L 70, 16.3.2005, p. 1.\n*** OJ L 152, 16.6.2009, p. 11.\n**** OJ L 140, 30.5.2002,\np. 10.\n***** OJ L 338, 13.11.2004, p. 4. \";\n(b) in paragraph 4, point (c) is replaced by\nthe following:\n\"(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it consists of, contains or\ngenerates a substance that meets the criteria for being PBT or vPvB in\naccordance with Annex XIII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006;\";\n(c) paragraph 7 is replaced by the following:\n\"7.
