The flagship initiatives \u201cA Digital Agenda\nfor Europe\u201d and \u201cInnovation Union\u201d both address demographic ageing as a\npriority. The Digital Agenda focuses on ICT-enabled innovative services,\nproducts and processes, and includes several actions on eHealth and a specific\naction on reinforcing the AAL Programme. The AAL Programme will make an\nimportant contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy and related flagship\ninitiatives and will help addressing the demographic challenge and create new\nopportunities, in particular for small and medium size enterprises The\nEuropean Innovation Partnership on Active and Health Ageing (EIP AHA) expects\nICT solutions to play an important role in meeting its goals of two additional\nhealthy life years by 2020 as well as improving quality of life for citizens\nand improving efficiency of care systems in Europe. The AAL Programme is a\nmajor component for supporting the EIP AHA with ICT-based innovation as it\nfocuses on the \"Valley of Death\" part of the innovation chain where\nresearch results need to be translated into new products and services ready to\nenter the market. The AAL Programme will also benefit from the EIP, because the\nEIP will accelerate market creation, large scale uptake and also contribute to\nimproved boundary conditions for the market: standardisation and\ninteroperability for example, which are not covered by the Programme, but are\nmentioned in evaluation and consultations as barriers to deployment. The AAL\nProgramme is complemented by major national initiatives, such as a national\ninitiative on AAL and ageing in Germany, an Assisted Living Innovation Platform\nin the UK and a Platform on Innovation in Ageing in France.\nWith these inter-related programmes that\njointly cover a significant part of the research and innovation \u2018chain\u2019, Europe\nhas a globally unique strength in ICT for ageing well. The AAL Programme\ncomplements well the proposed ICT and ageing longer-term research and\ninnovation and market validation activities under the Horizon 2020 Framework\nProgramme.\nThe AAL Programme is also complementary to\nthe \"More Years, Better Lives\" Joint Programming Initiative (JPI) on\ndemographic change that brings together 13 European Countries, to address new\nscience based knowledge for future policy making on ageing, based on a wide\nrange of research disciplines. The AAL Programme can provide an application\ncontext for the JPI\u2019s multi-disciplinary research and feed the JPI research\nagenda with user experience, while sharing research methodologies such as the\nlife course approach.\nTaken together, these initiatives cover a\nlarge part of the chain from fundamental research to market uptake, as\nrecommended by a number of independent assessments on EU research and\ninnovation programmes, as well as EU policy documents. These synergies will be\nfurther strengthened under the Commission's proposal for Horizon 2020, the\nFramework Research Programme for 2014-2020, which has a specific section for\nsocietal challenges, with Health, Demographic Change and Wellbeing as one of\nthe priorities. The AAL Programme is mentioned as one of the Article 185 TFEU\ninitiatives eligible for continued support, provided they meet a given set of\ncriteria. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation on the future\non the AAL JP\nThe Commission has consulted the plans for\nthe AAL Programme with several external and internal stakeholders. The online\nPublic Consultation on the EIP-AHA carried out in 2011 reached 524 respondents which expressed their views on the\nexisting national, regional and local initiatives for active and healthy\nageing; from. About 38% of responses came from government institutions, 23%\nfrom the industry including SMEs, 7% from the health and social care sector, 17%\nfrom the research and academia and 15% from the organisation representing the\nolder people. The consultation showed that there is an insufficient involvement of end-users in the\ndevelopment stage, which is the most significant barrier to innovation.\nAn interim evaluation\nof the current AAL JP was carried out in December 2010 by five high level\nexperts headed by former Commissioner M. Kuneva[1].\nIt included interviews with over 40 selected stakeholders across Europe directly involved in the AAL\nJP value-chain. About 33% of them came from government institutions, 27% from\nthe industry including SMEs, 27% from the research and academia and 11% from\nthe organizations representing older people. The evaluation panel stressed that it is important for\nthe AAL JP and its follow-up to ensure high operational\nperformance, further increase focus on broadly targeted solutions in real life\nsituations, promote technology for carers and intermediaries and strengthen\nlinks with users and ensure deployment activities.\nFurthermore public online consultation on\nthe AAL JP was carried out in 2010 and projects\nfunded under the AAL JP were surveyed in 2011. \nThe Commission has also consulted its\ndifferent part through Impact assessment Steering Group meetings in 2012, which\ncontributed to the planning and roadmap for the preparation of the Impact\nassessment report, in particular concerning the problem statement and the\nrelevance of the AAL JP to other DGs. The Art. 185 Coordination Group led by DG\nRTD contributed to the structure and argumentation of this report.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The policy options\nThe Impact assessment report included the\nfollowing options:\nOption 1 - AAL JP2\nidentical to AAL JP1 - This 'business as usual'- option is baseline scenario\npresenting the continuation of the AAL JP for the years 2014 \u2013 2020, just as\nthe current AAL JP which runs from 2008 to 2013. \nOption 2 - No AAL JP2\n- This option entails that there is no dedicated EU programme and co-financing\nto bring together national research and innovation programmes in the field of\nICT for ageing well at the EU level after 2013. The money reserved for the\nfollow up to the AAL JP under the proposed H2020 could be spent \u2013 if it was\nadopted \u2013 on additional research for ageing well within H2020 framework. \nOption 3 - This\noption of the follow-up to AAL JP1 would comprise an adapted scope and improved\nimplementation. The scope of the AAL JP2 programme would be aligned to the full\nscope of the EIP AHA. Besides the Active Ageing and Independent Living pillar\nof EIP AHA also the other two pillars would covered: Prevention, screening and\nearly diagnosis, and Care and Cure. Due to the change of the scope by the\nalignment to EIP AHA, the name of the programme would change from Ambient\nAssisted Living JP to Active and Assisted Living JP. The programme would be\nco-financed by the Member States as well as project participants as during the\ncurrent AAL JP 2008 to 2013. The level of EC financing from Horizon 2020 would\nremain the same as under the FP7. This option would also entail higher involvement of end-users, broadening the basis of funding to all actors, and improving the\noperational performance. \n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation on the impact\nassessment\nThese options were reviewed in February\n2012 by the AAL JP General Assembly, which concluded by vote that continuing\nthe programme is of strategic importance and 15 out of 23 currently\nparticipating countries stated their preferred scenario is the Option 3. The\nsecond preferred option was to continue the programme in its current form\nrepresented by the Option 1. Only two countries would not support the\ncontinuation of the programme \u2013 Option 2. \nIn November 2012, the\nImpact Assessment Board reviewed and approved the report. In its Opinion it\nrequested improvements of the impact assessment report which have been taken\ninto account. In particular the report now better explains the policy context,\nthe remaining problems, market failures and the baseline scenario. The\nobjectives were revised to provide solid basis for the measurement of the\nprogress of the AAL JP2. Different funding scenarios were illustrated in a more\ncomprehensive manner in the sensitivity analysis and the possible social and\nhealth impacts were further developed. Finally the comparison of options in\nterms of effectiveness, efficiency and coherence was included. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe proposal for the AAL Programme is based\non Article 185 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which\nforesees that the Union may make provision for the participation of the European\nUnion in research and development programmes undertaken by several Member\nStates, including participation in the structures created for the execution of\nthose programmes.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle\nThe subsidiarity principle applies as the\nproposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the European Union.\nSubsidiarity is safeguarded by basing the proposal on Article 185 which\nexplicitly foresees the participation of the Union in research programmes\nundertaken by several Member States. By implementing all operational aspects\nwhere possible at national level, while ensuring a coherent approach at the\nEuropean level of the joint programme.\nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States alone as the specific knowledge and\nexcellence required for research and development of ICT based products and\nservices for ageing are spread across national borders and hence cannot be\ncombined at national level only. Without a coherent approach at European level\nwith critical mass, there is a high risk of duplication of efforts with the\nconsequence of increased costs. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a genuine\ninternal market for interoperable ICT solutions for ageing well can be\nestablished without a joint programme with a European dimension. \nThe EU added value is directly linked to\nthe problems: fragmentation of the EU market and of research efforts, a lack of\nfocus on trans-EU deployment and a lack of a shared European vision on the\nmarkets for ICT and ageing well. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\nArticle 185 of the TFEU invites the Union\nto \u2018make provision, in agreement with the Member States concerned, for\nparticipation in research and development programmes undertaken by several\nMember States, including participation in the structures created for the\nexecution of those programmes\u2019. Member States are the driving force of the\ninitiative.\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle as Member States will be responsible for developing\ntheir joint programme and all operational aspects. The dedicated implementation\nstructure AAL Association has already demonstrated for the current AAL JP\nthat it can implement the programme efficiently and effectively. The Union will\nprovide incentives for improved coordination, ensure synergies with and\ncontribution to EU policies and to the priorities of Horizon 2020, monitor\nimplementation of the programme and ensure the protection of the EU\u2019s financial\ninterests.\nNotably, the proposed organisational\nstructure ensures a minimum of administrative burden, by having the main\nadministrative work being executed through national agencies under the\nsupervision and overall responsibility of the AAL Association created for this\npurpose. \n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of the instrument\nThe proposed instrument is a Decision by\nEuropean Parliament and Council based on Article 185 of the TFEU. The\nconclusions of the interim evaluation and an analysis of the options in the\nimpact assessment have demonstrated that Article 185 is the most appropriate\nmeans for achieving the objectives of the AAL programme.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Derogations from the Horizon\n2020 Rules for Participation\nDerogations from the following provisions\nof Regulation (EU) No \u2026 [Rules for the participation and dissemination in\nHorizon 2020] are necessary to allow for the Union financial contribution and\nIntellectual Property Rights protection to be implemented in accordance with the\nrules for participation of the participating national programmes. \n\u00b7       \nVerification of financial capacity extended to\nall the participants and performed by participating national funding agencies:\nArt. 14.5\n\u00b7       \nThe dedicated implementation structure does not\nenter into agreement with the final beneficiaries: Art. 16(1)\n\u00b7       \nApplication of national rules for funding,\neligibility of costs, certificates on the financial statements and certificates\non the methodology: Art. 19[(1), (5) to (7)] and Art. 22-29\n\u00b7       \nRules governing IPR and dissemination of results\nfollowing national rules: Art. 38-45\nThis is justified because the AAL Programme\nis intended as a close to market programme, in which many different national\nfunding streams are joined up (such as research innovation, health and industry\nfunding programmes). These programmes have by their nature different participation\nrules and cannot be expected to fully align with Horizon 2020 Rules for\nParticipation. \nIn addition the AAL Programme is targeting\nin particular small and medium size enterprises and user organisations not\nusually participating in EU research and innovation activities. In order to\nlower the administrative and legal threshold for their participation, the Union\nfinancial contribution is provided in accordance with the rules of their national\nfunding programmes which they are more used to and implemented through a single\ngrant together with the corresponding national public support. The AAL JP\n(2008-2013) has demonstrated that this approach has worked well and has allowed\nto attract a high participation of more than 40% of small and medium size\nenterprises.\nThe proposal provides appropriate\nsafeguards to guarantee respect of the principles of equal treatment and\ntransparency by the dedicated implementation structure when providing financial\nsupport to third parties, as well as for the protection of the financial\ninterests of the Union. It also foresees the inclusion of detailed provisions\nto this effect in an agreement to be concluded by the Union and the dedicated\nimplementation structure.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe Legislative Financial Statement\npresented with this decision sets out the indicative budgetary implications. The\nprovisions of the Decision and of the delegation agreement to be concluded\nbetween the Commission and the dedicated implementation structure must ensure\nthat the EU\u2019s financial interests are protected.\nThe maximum amount EU contribution shall be\nEUR [175,000,000 from the Horizon 2020 DG Connect budget allocated to Societal\nChallenge 1, theme health, demographic change and wellbeing:[2]\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simplification\nThe proposal provides for simplification of administrative\nprocedures for private parties. Notably, recipients of the research funding\nfrom the new joint programme will benefit from a single contracting and payment\nscheme using familiar national rules without any need for separate reporting concerning\nthe Union contribution. The EU will deal directly with the AAL Association,\nwhich will be in charge of allocating, monitoring and reporting on the use of\nthe EU\u2019s contribution.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review/revision/sunset\nclause\nThe proposal includes a review clause for a mid-term review after\nthree years. The overall duration will be limited to seven years of\nintervention and three additional years of completion.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European Economic Area\nThe proposed act concerns an EEA matter and should therefore extend\nto the European Economic Area.\n2013/0233 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the participation of the Union in the\nActive and Assisted Living Research and Development Programme jointly\nundertaken by several Member States\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 185 and the second\nparagraph of Article 188, thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[3],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Communication \u2018Europe\n2020 A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth\u2019[4], the Commission underscores the\nneed to develop favourable conditions for investment in knowledge and\ninnovation so as to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the\nUnion. Both the European Parliament and the Council have endorsed that strategy.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Horizon 2020 - The\nFramework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) established by Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of \u2026 2013[5]\n(hereinafter \"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme\") aims at achieving a\ngreater impact on research and innovation by contributing to the strengthening\nof public-public partnerships, including through Union participation in\nprogrammes undertaken by several Member States in accordance with Article 185 of\nthe Treaty.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision No 742/2008/EC of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on the Community's participation\nin a research and development programme undertaken by several Member States\naimed at enhancing the quality of life of older people through the use of new\ninformation and communication technologies[6]\nprovides for a Community financial contribution to the Ambient Assisted Living Joint\nResearch and Development Programme (hereinafter \"AAL JP\") matching\nthat of the Member States but not exceeding EUR 150 000 000 for the\nduration of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for\nresearch, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013) established\nby Decision No 1982/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18\nDecember 2006[7].\n\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In December 2012, the\nCommission communicated to the European Parliament and the Council a report on the\ninterim evaluation of the AAL JP[8].\nThat evaluation was carried out by an expert panel. The overall opinion of that\nexpert panel was that AAL JP had achieved good progress towards its objectives\nand remarkable results and that it should be continued beyond the current\nfunding period. The expert panel noted however a few shortcomings, notably the\nneed for stronger user involvement in projects and further improvements of the\noperational performance in terms of time to contract and time to payment. [\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its communication entitled\n\u2018The demographic future of Europe \u2014 from challenge to opportunity\u2019[9], the Commission underlined the\nfact that demographic ageing is one of the main challenges facing all the\nMember States and that increased use of new technologies could help to control\ncosts, improve well-being and promote the active participation in society of elderly\npeople, as well as improving the competitiveness of Union economy.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its entitled \u2018Europe\n2020 Flagship Initiative Innovation Union\u2019[10],\nthe Commission indicated the ageing of the population as one of the societal\nchallenges where innovation breakthroughs can play an important role and boost\ncompetitiveness, enable European companies to lead in the development of new\ntechnologies, to grow and assume global leadership in new growth markets,\nimprove the quality and efficiency of public services and so contribute to\ncreating large numbers of new quality jobs.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its communication entitled\n\u2018European flagship initiative Digital Agenda for Europe\u2019[11], the Commission proposed to\nreinforce the AAL JP in order to help address the challenges of the ageing\npopulation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its communication entitled\n\u2018Taking forward the Strategic Implementation Plan of the European Innovation\nPartnership on Active and Healthy Ageing\u2019[12],\nthe Commission proposed to take account of relevant priorities of the Plan for\nfuture research and innovation work programmes and instruments which are part\nof Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. The Commission also proposed to take into\naccount the contributions that can be made by the AAL JP to the European\nInnovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the European\nInnovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing established under the\nInnovation Union, ICT solutions are expected to play an important role in\nmeeting its goals of two additional healthy life years by 2020 as well as\nimproving quality of life for citizens and improving efficiency of care systems\nin the Union. Its Strategic Implementation Plan sets out priorities for\naccelerating and scaling up innovation in active and healthy ageing across the\nUnion, in three domains: prevention and health promotion, care and cure, and\nindependent living and social inclusion.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Active and Assisted\nLiving Research and Development Programme (hereinafter \u2018the AAL Programme\u2019) should\nbuild on the achievements of the previous programme and address its\nshortcomings by encouraging stronger user participation in projects and by a\nmore agile programme implementation.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A ceiling should be\nestablished for the participation of the Union in the AAL Programme for the\nduration of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. Union participation in the\nAAL Programme should not exceed the financial contribution of the Participating\nStates for the duration of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme in order to achieve\na high leverage effect and ensure an active involvement of the Participating\nStates in achieving the Programme objectives.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with the objectives\nof Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013[H2020 FP], any Member State and any country\nassociated to the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme should be entitled to\nparticipate in the AAL Programme. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that a\nfinancial commitment by the Union will be matched by the Participating States,\nthe financial contribution by the Union should be subject to formal\ncommitments from the Participating States before the launch of the AAL\nProgramme and their fulfilment. The Participating States' contribution to the\nAAL Programme should include the administrative costs incurred at national\nlevel for the effective operation of the programme.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The joint implementation of\nthe AAL Programme requires an implementation structure. The Participating\nStates have agreed on the implementation structure for the AAL Programme and\nset up in 2007 the Ambient Assisted Living Association IASBL, an international\nnon-profit organisation under Belgian law (hereinafter \u2018AALA\u2019). Given that,\naccording to the report on the Interim Evaluation, the existing governance\nstructure of AAL JP has proven to be efficient and of good quality, the AALA\nshould be used as implementation structure and should take the role as\nallocation and monitoring body of the AAL Programme. The AALA should manage the\nUnion financial contribution and should ensure an efficient implementation of\nthe AAL Programme.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve the\nobjectives of the AAL Programme, the AALA should provide financial support\nmainly through grants to participants in actions selected by the AALA. Those\nactions should be selected following calls for proposals under the\nresponsibility of the AALA, which should be assisted by independent external\nexperts. The ranking list should be binding as regards the selection of\nproposals and the allocation of funding from the Union financial contribution\nand from the national budgets for AAL Programme projects.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union financial\ncontribution should be managed in accordance with the principle of sound\nfinancial management and with the rules on indirect management set out in\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general\nbudget of the Union[13]\nand Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the\nrules of application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012[14].\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to protect the\nfinancial interests of the Union, the Commission should have the right to\nreduce, withhold or terminate the Union financial contribution where the AAL\nProgramme is implemented inadequately, partially or late, or the Participating\nStates do not contribute, or contribute partially or late, to the financing of\nthe AAL Programme. Those rights should be provided for in the delegation\nagreement to be concluded between the Union and the AALA. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Participation in indirect\nactions funded by the AAL Programme is subject to Regulation (EU) No \u2026 /2013 of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 2013 laying down the rules for\nthe participation and dissemination in 'Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme\nfor Research and Innovation (2014-2020)'[15].\nHowever, due to specific operating needs of the AAL Programme it is necessary\nto provide for derogations from that Regulation in accordance with Article 1(3)\nof that Regulation. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific derogations from Regulation (EU) No \u2026 /2013 [H2020 RfP] are necessary as the AAL Programme is intended as a close to market innovation programme,\nin which many different national funding streams are joined up (such as\nresearch innovation, health and industry funding programmes).

Its Strategic\nImplementation Plan (SIP) sets out priorities for accelerating and scaling up\ninnovation in active and healthy ageing across Europe, in the three domains prevention\nand health promotion, care and cure, and independent living and social\ninclusion. The launch by the Council of the EIP AHA enhances the future\nrelevance of the AAL Programme and its follow up. The AAL Programme is a major\ncomponent for implementing the SIP, as it focuses on the \"Valley of\nDeath\" part of the innovation chain. The AAL Programme will also benefit\nfrom the EIP, because the EIP will accelerate market creation, large scale\nuptake and also contribute to improved boundary conditions for the market:\nstandardisation and interoperability for example, which are not covered by the\nAAL Programme, but are mentioned in evaluation and consultations as barriers to\ndeployment. \nAAL Programme is complemented by major national initiatives, such as\na national initiative on AAL and ageing in Germany, an Assisted Living\nInnovation Platform in the UK and a Platform on Innovation in Ageing in France.\nWith these inter-related programmes that jointly cover a significant\npart of the research and innovation \u2018chain\u2019, Europe has a globally unique\nstrength in ICT for ageing well. The AAL Programme complements well the\nlonger-term ICT and ageing research in the Horizon 2020 Programme and the ICT\nbased solutions it delivers can be fed into innovation and market validation activities\nunder the Horizon 2020 Programme.\nThe AAL Programme is also complementary to the \"More Years,\nBetter Lives\" Joint Programming Initiative (JPI)[24] on demographic change that brings\ntogether 13 European Countries, to address new science based knowledge for\nfuture policy making on ageing, based on a wide range of research disciplines.\nThe AAL Programme can provide an application context for the JPI\u2019s\nmulti-disciplinary research and feed the JPI research agenda with user\nexperience, while sharing research methodologies such as the life course\napproach.\nIn the Commission proposal for a Decision on the Strategic\nInnovation Agenda of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT)\n2014-2020, \"Innovation for healthy living and active ageing\" is one\nof the priority themes for the EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs)\nwave in 2014-2015. \nTaken together, these initiatives cover a large part of the chain\nfrom fundamental research to market uptake, as recommended by a number of\nindependent assessments on EU research and innovation programmes, as well as EU\npolicy documents. \n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial impact \nX Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration \n\u2013     \nProposal/initiative in effect from 01/01/2014 to\n31/12/2023\n\u2013     \nFinancial impact from 2014 to 2020 on commitment\nappropriations and from 2014 to 2023 on payment appropriations.\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged[25] \n\u00a8 Centralised direct management by the Commission \nX Centralised indirect management\nwith the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies set up by the European Union[26] \n\u2013     \nX\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with\npublic-service mission \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\n\"Comments\" section.\nComments \nA dedicated implementation structure entitled the Ambient Assisted\nLiving Association has been established and is governed by participating\ncountries for managing the initiative. The Union financial contribution to the\ninitiative will be provided through this organisation. National funding bodies\nor their delegated agencies will manage the EU financial contribution and enter\ninto grant agreements with organisations to receive financial support for\ncollaborative research and innovation activities.\nRelevant comments:\nThe financial contribution of the European Union will be paid to the\ndedicated management entity established by ParticipatingStates which will\nmanage the Programme. The Union contribution will be provided subject to\napproval of a work plan and associated national budgetary commitments.\nThe organisational structure for the AAL Programme is composed of\nthe following entities:\nThe AAL Association created as a dedicated management structure by ParticipatingStates\nwill sign a delegation agreement and annual transfer of funds agreements with\nthe European Commission to receive the annual funding from the Framework\nProgramme. It will be responsible for all the activities of the AAL Programme\nand will be headed by a director, who will be the legal representative of the\nAssociation. \nThe AAL Association will be responsible for all the activities of\nthe AAL Programme. The AAL Association's tasks include contract and budget\nmanagement, the development of the annual work programmes, organisation of the\ncalls for proposals, handling of the evaluation and ranking of projects. In\naddition it supervises project monitoring and transfers the associated payments\nof the European Union contributions to nominated national programme agencies.\nIt also organises dissemination activities. \nThe AAL Association is governed by the General Assembly. The General\nAssembly is the decision taking body of AAL Programme and it appoints the\nmembers of the Board of Directors and supervises the implementation of AAL\nProgramme, including approval of annual work plans, allocation of national\nfunding to projects and applications for new membership. It will work on the\nbasis of a one country one vote principle and will use simple majority for\ndecision making. The Commission will have an observer status in the meetings of\nthe General Assembly.\nThe AALA Board of Directors \u2013 consisting of a Director and two Vice-Directors\n(alternatively one vice-director and one treasurer) - will be elected to\nundertake the specific management responsibilities such as budget planning,\nstaffing and contracting. It legally represents the Association and reports to\nthe General Assembly.\nNational Programme Management Agencies are endorsed by the Participating\nStates to undertake work associated with project management and administrative and\nlegal aspects for the national project partners as well as to provide support\nfor the evaluation and negotiation of the proposals. They work under the\nsupervision of the AAL Association.\nAn Advisory Board with representatives from industry and other stakeholders\nwill provide recommendations for priorities and topics to be addressed in the calls\nfor proposals of the AAL Programme.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules \nSpecify frequency\nand conditions.\nIn accordance with the Horizon 2020 \u2013 Framework Programme for\nResearch and Innovation, the implementation of the AAL Programme is annually\nmonitored and reported by the dedicated management structure to the Commission,\nwhere applicable. The Programme will be monitored through annual reports which\nwill be provided by the dedicated management structure. These will give a\ndetailed overview on the implementation of the Programme according to the\nindicators presented in Section 1.4.4.\nA mid-term evaluation will be carried out after 3 years of operation\nwith assistance of independent experts and will assess: (1) the implementation\nof the Programme towards further scientific, management and financial\nintegration; (2) the added value and effectiveness of the joint programme in\nmeeting its objectives. A final evaluation by external experts shall be\nconducted by the end of the programme.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \n1) The key risks concern the capacity of the dedicated\nimplementation structure to manage the Unions budget contribution and the\neffective monitoring of the national agencies involved in the day to day\noperation of the programme\n2) Another risk is the effective protection against fraud and\npossible financial losses due to the high involvement of SMEs and the indirect\ncentralised management approach.\n3) A third risk concerns the capacity of involved countries to\neffectively finance their contributions to the programme.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control method(s) envisaged\n\nConcerning risks 1 and 2, see chapter 2.3.\nConcerning risk 3, then the safeguards which ensures that EU funds\nonly can be released upon evidence of national financial commitments both at\nannual transfer of funds agreement level and at the level of payments towards\nnational participants in the joint programme projects, Another safeguard is\nthat EU funding cannot exceed 50% of the total public funding provided in the\nprogramme and that EU support to administrative expenditures cannot exceed 6%\nof the overall EU contribution.\n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Costs and benefits of controls\nand probable non-compliance rate\nIn accordance with Article 7 of the decision on the Programme, the\ncontrol system set up for the implementation of the Programme will be designed\nso as to provide reasonable assurance of achieving adequate management of the\nrisks relating to the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations as well as\nthe legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, taking due account\nthe special nature of the AAL Programme as public-public partnership. The\ncontrol system shall ensure an appropriate balance between trust and control,\ntaking into account administrative and other costs of controls at all levels,\nespecially for participants so that it can best contribute to achieving the\nobjectives of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\nand irregularities \nSpecify existing or\nenvisaged prevention and protection measures.\nArticle 3 of the Decision establishing the AAL Programme states that\nthe Unions's contribution is conditional upon the compliance by the AAL\nAssociation with the reporting requirements set out in Article 60(5) of\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012. According to Article 8, the Commission\nmay terminate, reduce or suspend its contribution.\nThe delegation agreement to be concluded between the Commission and\nthe AALA in compliance with Article 61 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012,\nwill provide for the Commission to supervise the activities of the AALA, in\nparticular by carrying out audits.\nFurther anti-fraud measures will be implemented as part of the\ndetailed agreement between the Commission and the dedicated management\nstructure.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7       \nExisting budget lines \nIn order of\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number 09 04 03 01 Improving lifelong health and wellbeing of all || Diff./non-diff.
