By reducing fraud and evasion Member States could\nincrease tax revenues which would also provide them with added scope to\nrestructure their tax systems in a way that better promotes growth as outlined\nin the 2013 Annual Growth Survey. In addition, given the order of magnitude of\nthe challenge, stepping up the fight against tax fraud and evasion is not only\nan issue of revenue, but also of fairness. Particularly in these difficult\neconomic times, honest taxpayers should not suffer additional tax increases to compensate\nfor revenue losses incurred due to tax fraudsters and evaders. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For years, the European\nUnion (EU) has been working actively on these problems, in particular by adopting\nspecific legal instruments to implement automatic exchange of information (\"AEOI\")\nwithin the Union. The EU Savings Directive (the \"EUSD\") ensures AEOI on\ninterest income and a proposal to enlarge its scope is under discussion in the\nCouncil. The Directive on Administrative Cooperation (the \"DAC\")\nensures that, from 2015, Member States will exchange information automatically\nupon availability on five categories of income and capital: employment,\ndirectors' fees, life insurance products not covered by other Directives,\npensions and ownership of and income from immovable property. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States have now\nexpressed a clear wish to go beyond current levels of cooperation. The European Council of 2 March 2012 invited the Council and the\nCommission to develop rapidly concrete ways to improve the fight against tax\nfraud. On 6 December 2012, the Commission presented an Action plan to\nstrengthen the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion[1]. The Action Plan highlights the\nneed to promote AEOI as the European and international standard of transparency\nand exchange of information in tax matters. On 14 May 2013, the ECOFIN Council\nadopted conclusions welcoming the work by the Commission on developing measures\nto combat tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning and recognising\nthe useful role the Commission Action Plan can play in this regard[2]. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nEuropean Council on 22 May 2013 went even further, requesting the extension of\nAEOI at EU and global levels with a view to fighting against tax fraud, tax\nevasion and aggressive tax planning. On that occasion, the Commission committed\nitself to proposing amendments to the DAC in June 2013 in order to expand the\nscope of AEOI, in anticipation of the revision of the DAC already foreseen for\n2017.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of the\npresent proposal is, therefore, to expand the scope of AEOI in the EU beyond\nthat provided for in existing EU automatic information exchange arrangements.\nIt would bring the following other items within the scope of the AEOI:\ndividends, capital gains, other financial income and account balances. The\nprovision for a review and expansion of the DAC in 2017 would remain. However, in\nline with the objective of enhancing AEOI the removal of the condition of\navailability would now be considered at that time in respect of all five\nexisting categories together so that the DAC would cover the full range of\nincome. Furthermore, the categories to be considered for inclusion at that time\nwould be amended in the light of the present proposal (see below). Extending\nthe scope of the AEOI would also contribute to ensuring equality of treatment\nbetween different types of assets and to avoiding undesirable reallocation of\nportfolios.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission proposes to\nremove the reference in Article 8(3) of the Directive to a threshold below\nwhich a Member State may not wish to receive information from other Member\nStates. Discussions have revealed that such a threshold is not practical for\nthe Member States that are required to report. However, a Member State could continue to opt not to receive any information on a particular category of income.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An EU initiative is needed\nboth from an internal market perspective and in terms of efficiency and\neffectiveness: \n\u2013              \nAn EU initiative ensures a coherent, consistent\nand comprehensive EU-wide approach to AEOI in the internal market. It would mean\na single reporting approach across Member States which would lead to costs\nsavings both for tax administrations and economic operators (see also point 11\nbelow).\n\u2013              \nAn EU legal instrument would also ensure\ncertainty for tax administrations and economic operators within the EU.\n\u2013              \nAn EU legal instrument would contribute to the\ndevelopment of the international standard of AEOI.\n\u2013              \nAn EU legal instrument based on the DAC would involve\nthe use of the IT arrangements already in place or under development to\nfacilitate information reporting under the EUSD and the DAC. Under those\nDirectives, EU Member States share information in specific formats using a\nspecific communication channel (the CCN/CSI system). These formats could easily\nbe extended so as to be usable also for the additional items now proposed for\ninclusion. As Member States have invested considerable time and money in\ndeveloping these formats, there would be economies of scale if Member States\nalso exchanged information on the new items using these formats.\n\u2013              \nFurthermore, the Council already committed\nitself, in Article 8(5) of the DAC, to consider in due course whether automatic\ninformation exchange should be extended, on the basis of an EU-wide legal\ninstrument, to cover other categories of income such as dividends and capital\ngains. The present proposal is, therefore, merely accelerating work in line\nwith this commitment.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The agreements that many\ngovernments have concluded or will conclude with the US as regards the US\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)[3]\nhave given further impetus to AEOI as a way of combating tax fraud and evasion.\n\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 9 April 2013, France, Germany, the  United Kingdom, Italy and Spain announced plans for a pilot action on AEOI using\nthe FATCA model agreed with the US as a basis. These Member States also called on\n Europe to take a lead in promoting AEOI in the world and expressed the wish to\ndiscuss how progress could be made within the EU on improving tax information\nexchange between all Member States. \n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 19 of the DAC\nstates that a Member State that provides wider cooperation to a third country may\nnot refuse to provide such wider cooperation to any other Member State wishing to enter into such mutual wider cooperation with that Member State. The fact that Member States have concluded or will conclude agreements with the US as regards FATCA means that they provide for a wider cooperation within the meaning of\nthat provision. \n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expanded AEOI on the basis\nof an EU-wide legislative instrument would remove the need and incentive for\nMember States to invoke Article 19 of the DAC, with a view to concluding\nbilateral or multilateral agreements that may be considered appropriate on the\nsame subject in the absence of relevant Union legislation. The scenario of\nvarious agreements concluded under that provision would, in fact, present a\nnumber of disadvantages, compared to a solution brought about by EU action: \n\u2013              \nThe level playing field between the Member\nStates might be put at risk if Member States agreed to cooperate on increased\nAEOI in different ways. This could lead to distortions and artificial flows of\ncapital within the internal market. \n\u2013              \nIf the agreements between Member States were not\nidentical, this could also create difficulties for economic operators that are\nactive in several Member States as they could then face different compliance\nrequirements in different Member States. \n\u2013              \nIt might also mean that Member States would not\nbe able to utilise the IT reporting systems that have been developed within the\nEU (see above). \n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Timely adoption and\nimplementation are crucial so as to reap the benefits as quickly as possible. In\norder to ensure consistency with the deadline for the application of AEOI to\nthe categories of income and capital already covered by the DAC, the time\nlimits proposed for transposition and application of the new rules are 31\nDecember 2014 and 1 January 2015, respectively. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nIn addition to the discussions held in the\nCouncil of Ministers since April 2013 (see above under item 1), the Commission\nheld a technical meeting with Member States on 21 May 2013 to confirm the need\nfor a legislative proposal and to discuss its practical modalities and content.\nThe discussions revealed that Member States\ngenerally supported the need for enhancing automatic information exchange and\nfor accelerating the extension of the scope of Article 8 of the DAC as already\nenvisaged in Article 8(5).\nMost Member States wish to take speedy\naction to increase AEOI but uncoordinated action by Member States on this\nmatter could lead to potentially lasting fragmentation in the internal market.\nIt has, therefore, become exceptionally urgent to provide for a consistent and\ncoherent EU legal framework; for this reason, no impact assessment has been\nprepared. \nThe European Parliament adopted a resolution\non 21 May 2013[4],\nwhereby it welcomes the Commission Action Plan and its Recommendations, urges\nMember States to follow up their commitments and embrace the Commission's\naction plan, as well as emphasises that the EU should take a leading role in\ndiscussions on the fight against tax fraud, tax avoidance and tax havens and,\nin particular, in relation to the promotion of automatic exchange of\ninformation. \nThe European Economic and Social Committee\nalso adopted an opinion on 17 April 2013[5].\nThe Committee endorses the Commission's Action Plan and supports its efforts to\nfind practical solutions as regards reducing tax fraud and tax evasion. In\nparticular, it supports in points 4.6 and 4.7 the Commission's initiatives as\nregards the improvements in relation to the AEOI.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe proposal aims at modifying Article 8\nof the current DAC. The modifications are contained in Article 1 of the\nproposal.\nThe first modification concerns paragraph\n3 of Article 8. The proposal is to remove the reference to a threshold\nbelow which a Member State may not wish to receive information from other\nMember States. Discussions with Member States revealed that such a threshold is\nnot practically manageable. In addition, it is proposed to insert the expression\n\"one or several of\" before the term \"the categories\"; this\nwould prevent misunderstandings in a case where a Member State indicates that\nit does not wish to receive information on one or several categories of income\nand capital referred to in paragraph 1 even if it does want to receive\ninformation on others.\nIt is proposed to introduce, by way of a\nnew paragraph 3a of Article 8, automatic exchange of information for dividends,\ncapital gains, any other income generated with respect to the assets held in a\nfinancial account, any amount with respect to which the financial institution\nis the obligor (i.e. is legally or contractually obliged to pay) or the debtor,\nincluding any redemption payments, and account balances. These additional items\nrelate to income paid directly or indirectly to beneficial owners who are natural\npersons, as defined by Article 3(11)(a) of Directive 2011/16/EU, or capital held\ndirectly or indirectly by such persons. It is not proposed to extend to the new\nitems the existing condition provided for in Article 8(1) in respect of income\ncurrently included in the Directive, which is that the information only has to\nbe exchanged if it is \"available\". Information about those new items\nwill certainly be available as financial intermediaries will be required to\nreport it to tax administrations under the agreements that Member States have\nconcluded or will conclude with the US as regards FATCA. \nRegarding paragraph 5 of Article 8, the\nfollowing changes are proposed: \n\u2013                        \nIn the first subparagraph, a reference is made to\nthe new paragraph 3a and the review of the condition of availability will concern\nall five categories listed in paragraph 1 (instead of only three of them);\n\u2013                        \nIn point (b) of the second subparagraph, the\nreference to \"dividends and capital gains\" as matters to be\nconsidered for future addition to the Directive is removed as these categories\nare now added in the new paragraph 3a; \"other categories and items, including\nroyalties\" (royalties is already quoted in the existing text) is substituted\nso as to leave more open the scope of a new proposal in 2017.\nArticle 2 contains\nthe usual provision compelling Member States to transpose the Directive. The\ntime limits proposed for transposition and application of the new rules are 31\nDecember 2014 and 1 January 2015 respectively, in order to align them with the dates applicable in respect of the\ncategories of income and capital included in Article 8.1 of the existing Directive.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal does not entail budgetary\nimplications. This applies in particular in regard to the use of IT tools,\nsince the tools under development will also be used for the implementation of\nthis Directive.\n2013/0188 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\namending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards\nmandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 115 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Parliament[6],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[7],\n\nActing in accordance with a special\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In recent years, the\nchallenge posed by tax fraud and tax evasion has increased considerably and has\nbecome a major focus of concern within the Union and at global level.\nUnreported and untaxed income is considerably reducing national tax revenues. An\nincrease in the efficiency and effectiveness of tax collection is therefore\nurgently needed. The automatic exchange of information constitutes an important\ntool in this regard and the Commission in its Communication of 6 December 2012\ncontaining an Action plan to strengthen the fight against tax fraud and tax\nevasion[8]\nhighlighted the need to promote vigorously the automatic exchange of information\nas the future European and international standard for transparency and exchange\nof information in tax matters. The European Council on 22 May 2013 requested the\nextension of automatic information exchange at Union and global levels with a\nview to combatting tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive\n2011/16/EU of 15 February 2011 on administrative cooperation in the field of\ntaxation and repealing Directive 77/799/EEC[9]\nalready provides for the mandatory automatic exchange of information between\nMember States on certain categories of income and capital. It also establishes a\nstep-by-step approach to reinforcing automatic exchange of information by its\nprogressive extension to new categories of income and capital and the removal\nof the condition that the information only has to be exchanged if available.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As highlighted by the\nrequest of the European Council, it is appropriate to bring forward the\nextension of automatic information exchange already envisaged in Article 8(5)\nof Directive 2011/16/EU. A Union initiative ensures a coherent, consistent and\ncomprehensive Union-wide approach to the automatic exchange of information in\nthe internal market which would lead to cost savings both for tax\nadministrations and economic operators. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that Member\nStates have concluded or have expressed an intention to conclude agreements with\nthe United States of America relating to its legislation on Foreign Account Tax\nCompliance (commonly referred to as \"FATCA\") means that they are providing\nor will provide for a wider cooperation within the meaning of Article 19 of\nDirective 2011/16/EU, and are or will be under an obligation to provide such\nwider cooperation to other Member States as well. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The conclusion of parallel\nand uncoordinated agreements by Member States under Article 19 of Directive\n2011/16/EU would lead to distortions that would be detrimental to the smooth\nfunctioning of the internal Market. Expanded automatic information exchange on\nthe basis of a Union-wide legislative instrument would remove the need for\nMember States to invoke that provision, with a view to concluding bilateral or\nmultilateral agreements that may be considered appropriate on the same subject\nin the absence of relevant Union legislation. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scope of Article 8 of\nDirective 2011/16/EU, should be extended to include the following items covered\nby FATCA and related agreements by Member States: dividends, capital gains,\nother financial income and account balances, which are paid, secured or held by\na financial institution for the direct or indirect benefit of a beneficial\nowner who is a natural person resident in other Member States.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The condition that\nautomatic exchange may be subject to the availability of the information\nrequested as provided for in Article 8(1) of Directive 2011/16/EU should not\napply to the new items as information about those items must necessarily be\nmade available by financial intermediaries to tax administrations under the\nagreements with the United States as regards FATCA. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reference to a\nthreshold in Article 8(3) of Directive 2011/16/EU should be removed since such a\nthreshold does not appear to be manageable in practice. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The review of the\ncondition of availability to be undertaken in 2017 should be extended to all\nthe five categories referred to in Article 8(1) of Directive 2011/16/UE, so that the case for exchange of information by all Member States on\nall those categories be examined. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects the\nfundamental rights and observes the principles which are recognised in\nparticular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\nDirective, namely the efficient administrative cooperation between Member\nStates under conditions compatible with the proper functioning of the internal\nmarket, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore,\nby reason of the uniformity and effectiveness required, be better achieved at\nthe level of the Union, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the\nprinciple of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that\nArticle, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve\nthat objective.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2011/16/EU should\ntherefore be amended accordingly, \nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nArticle 8 of Directive 2011/16/EU is\namended as follows:\n(a) Paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n\u201c3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The competent authority of a Member State may indicate to the competent authority of any other Member State that it does not\nwish to receive information on one or several of the categories of income and\ncapital referred to in paragraph 1. It shall also inform the Commission thereof.\n\nA Member State may be considered as not wishing\nto receive information in accordance with paragraph 1, if it does not inform\nthe Commission of any single category in respect of which it has information\navailable.\" \n(b) After paragraph 3, the following paragraph\nis inserted: \n\u201c3a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The competent authority of each Member\nState shall, by automatic exchange, communicate to the competent authority of\nany other Member State, information regarding taxable periods as from 1 January\n2014 concerning the following items which are paid, secured or held by a\nfinancial institution for the direct or indirect benefit of a beneficial owner\nwho is a natural person resident in that other Member State: \n(a)          \ndividends;\n(b)         \ncapital gains;\n(c)          \nany other income generated with respect to the\nassets held in a financial account;\n(d)         \nany amount with respect to which the financial\ninstitution is the obligor or debtor, including any redemption payments;\n(e)          \naccount balances.\nThe first subparagraph shall not apply to the\nextent that the exchange of information at issue is ensured by paragraph 1 or\nby any other Union legal instrument.\"\n(c) Paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:\n\u201c5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before 1 July 2017, the Commission\nshall submit a report that provides an overview and an assessment of the\nstatistics and information received, on issues such as the administrative and\nother relevant costs and benefits of the automatic exchange of information, as\nwell as practical aspects linked thereto.
