Many of them are off-track towards the\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and they\ndo not benefit from sustainable development. The EU is helping ACP countries\naddress these problems. It is necessary for the EU to continue to support ACP\ncountries' efforts towards reducing and eventually eradicating poverty, while\nattaining the objectives of sustainable development and achieving their gradual\nintegration into the global economy. \nThe EU maintains privileged relations with\nthe ACP group of developing countries under the Partnership Agreement between\nthe ACP States of the one part, and the European Community and its Member\nStates of the other part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000 for a period of 20\nyears[1] (hereinafter referred to as the Cotonou Agreement). The European Development Fund (EDF) is the main\ninstrument for providing EU assistance for development cooperation under the\nCotonou Agreement with ACP countries and for cooperation with Overseas\nCountries and Territories (OCTs) under the Overseas Association Decision (OAD).\nThe EDF is funded outside the EU budget by the EU Member States on the basis of\nspecific contribution keys. Each EDF is concluded for a multi-annual period. \nFor the post-2013 multiannual financial\nframework, the European Commission proposed in its Communication \u2018A budget for\nEurope 2020\u2019[2] the overall volume (EUR 30 318.7 million in 2011 prices, i.e. EUR\n34 275.6 million in current prices) for the 11th EDF for cooperation with ACP\ncountries and OCTs. The Commission also adopted a Communication describing the\nmain elements that could figure in the Internal Agreement for the 11th EDF, for\nthe period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020[3]. The\nassumption of the European Commission is that an agreement will be reached by\nthe European Union and its Member States on laying down the financing mechanism\n(the 11th EDF), the exact period to be covered (2014-2020) and the amount\nof funds to be allocated to that mechanism, for implementing the ACP-EU\nPartnership, and that the Representatives of the Governments of the Member\nStates will agree on an Internal Agreement for an 11th EDF. The European\nCouncil set the global amount of the 11th EDF in its Conclusions on\nFebruary 8th 2013, i.e. EUR 30 506 million in current prices[4].\nNew challenges, together with the priorities\nset out in the Europe 2020 Strategy, have prompted the Commission to make a\nproposal to adapt the 11th EDF Implementation Regulation in line with the Communication\n'Increasing the Impact of EU Development Policy: An Agenda for Change'[5] of 13 October 2011. The European Consensus on Development adopted\non 22 December 2005 and the internationally agreed principles on aid\neffectiveness including the Busan Outcome Document (2011) also form part of the\ngeneral policy framework for the programming and implementation of the 11th\nEDF. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF THE CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nPublic Consultation\nThe Commission held a public consultation on\nfuture funding for EU external action between 26 November 2010 and 31 January\n2011. This process was based on an online questionnaire accompanied by a\nbackground paper 'What funding for EU external action after 2013?'. In general,\nthe replies did not suggest the need for a substantial change in the current\nimplementing mechanisms, although a significant majority of respondents\nsupported increased flexibility and simplification in implementation.\nImpact Assessment\nThe Commission carried out an Impact Assessment\n(IA)[6] that considered 3 basic policy\nalternatives for each objective identified (more differentiation and\nconcentration, strengthened coordination with EU Member States, more use of\ninnovative financial instruments, further flexibility): a status quo option (no\nchange compared to the 10th EDF), and an alternative option with two\nsub-options for amending the EDF framework. The status quo option was not\naccepted because it would not have solved the problems identified. The sub-options\nsolved the identified problems to different extents, each having particular\nimplications. The IA concluded that for each objective identified, the second sub-option\nwhich better adressed the new revised strategic orientations of the EU external\naction should be chosen as it:\n\u2013              \ncontributed through a sharpened geographical\nfocus to targeting resources where they were most needed having the greatest\npossible impact and value added ;\n\u2013              \ncontributed through a sharpened sectoral focus\nto concentrating resources on a limited number of sectors, thus increasing the\nEU's critical mass; \n\u2013              \nreinforced the efficiency and the political\nleverage of EU aid through increased division of labour among donors, joint\nprogramming and use of EU Trust Funds;\n\u2013              \nincreased the financial leverage of EU grant\nresources through use of innovative financial instruments;\n\u2013              \nallowed the adaption of aid allocations\nrapidly to take into account evolving circumstances or specific situations\n(such as crisis, fragility or transition), or to implement a more\nincentives-based approach.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe main policy objectives of EU external\naction are set in the Lisbon Treaty (Art. 21 TEU). In addition, the main\nobjective of EU development cooperation (Art. 208 TFEU) is the reduction and,\nin the long term, the eradication of poverty. In this context the EU will\ncomply with the commitments and take account of the objectives they have\napproved in the context of the United Nations and other international\norganisations.\nRegarding cooperation with ACP countries and\nregions, this legal framework is complemented by the Cotonou Agreement.\nThis proposal is presented by the Commission on\nthe basis of an Internal Agreement for the 11th EDF[7] which foresees that a Council\nRegulation on the implementation of the 11th EDF under the Cotonou Agreement should\nbe adopted by unanimity, on a proposal by the Commission and after consulting\nthe European Investment Bank (EIB).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\nIMPLICATION\nN/A \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MAIN ELEMENTS\nThe 11th EDF Implementation\nRegulation was prepared with the following objectives:\n\u2013                        \nin line with the key principles of\nsimplification and increased effectiveness, to align\nthe text as much as possible with the main provisions\nof the Commission proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation\n(DCI)[8]\n(in particular on programming) and of the Commission proposal for a Regulation\nof the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules and\nprocedures for the implementation of the Union's instruments for external\naction (CIR)[9] (in particular on implementation) which\nentails simplified and harmonised implementing rules and procedures for all\nexternal action instruments (except the EDF and Greenland). This effort for\nalignment also takes into account the results of the negotiations in Council on\nthese texts (Coreper level) as well as in Parliament Committees when this\nproposal was drafted, regarding compromises being acceptable for the\nCommission. Moreover, the Commission reserves the right to adapt this proposal\nafter its adoption, during the negotiations with the Council, in order to\ncontinue to ensure coherence with the texts of the DCI and the CIR being negotiated\nin parallel. This alignment will help pave the way towards possible inclusion\nof the EDF into the EU budget in the Multiannual Financial Framework post 2020,\nin line with the Commission proposals made in the above mentioned Communication\n\u2018A budget for Europe 2020' and\nwith the European Council Conclusions of February 8th 2013.\n\u2013                        \nto ensure the compliance of the text with the\nprovisions of the Cotonou Agreement, in particular its annex IV on\nimplementation and management procedures, while simplifying the text compared\nto the 10th EDF Implementing Regulation[10].\nTitle I: Objectives and general principles\n\u2013 Articles 1 and 2\nArticle 1 (Objectives and eligibility\ncriteria) is aligned as far as possible with\nArticle 2 of the Commission proposal for the DCI Regulation on objectives and\neligibility criteria, while including also a reference to the broader\nobjectives, principles and values described in the Cotonou Agreement, as well\nas to the development objectives and cooperation strategies set out in the policies\ndeveloped by the Union, including the Agenda for Change. This Article also\nrequires fulfilling the criteria for Official Development Assistance (ODA)\nestablished by the OECD/DAC to the greatest extent possible. It also explains\ncomplementarity between the Humanitarian and EDF instruments.\nArticle 2 (General principles) is aligned with Article 3(5) to 3(10) of the Commission\nproposal for the DCI Regulation. It sets out the main principles governing the\nimplementation of the Regulation, which are strengthened coherence of EU\nexternal action, improved coordination with the Member States and other\nbilateral or multilateral donors, and a partner country-led and region-led\ndevelopment process with mutual accountability, through an inclusive and\nparticipatory approach to development, using effective and innovative\ncooperation modalities in line with OECD/DAC best practices, thus improving the\nimpact of aid and reducing overlap and duplication.\nTitle II: Programming and allocation of\nfunds \u2013 Articles 3 to 7 \nArticle 3 (General framework for\nallocating funds) lays down the framework for\nallocation of funds under the EDF. It is aligned as far as possible with\nArticle 3(2) of the Commission proposal for the DCI Regulation on the\nprinciples of a differentiated approach towards the partner countries. Article\n3 provides for the application of the principles of the Communication\n'Increasing the Impact of EU Development Policy: An Agenda for Change' to the\nEDF, while also ensuring that the requirements of the Cotonou Agreement\nregarding resource allocation (criteria described in article 3 of annex IV of\nthe Cotonou Agreement) are respected. Therefore the allocation criteria are\ndescribed in two paragraphs: paragraph 1 recalls the Cotonou requirements on\nneeds and performance and paragraph 2 provides more specifically the\ndifferentiation principles of the Agenda for Change in the determination of the\nindicative national allocations (needs, capacities, commitments, performance\nand impact).\nArticle 4 (General framework for programming)\nlays down the general framework for EDF programming\nunder this Regulation. The Article recalls the principles of partnership and\nalignment of the Cotonou Agreement, i.e. that programming should be done\nwhenever possible jointly with the partner country or region concerned and\nincreasingly aligned with their poverty reduction strategies. The Article also\ntakes elements from Article 10(2) of the Commission proposal for the DCI Regulation:\nin order to ensure synergies and complementarity of the Union\u2019s measures and\nthose of the Member States, the latter will be fully involved in the\nprogramming process, including through joint programming. The participation of\nall Member States including those not locally represented is foreseen because\nof the specific nature of EDF funding. Consultation processes will also involve\nother donors and development actors as well as civil society and regional and\nlocal authorities. \nArticle 4(3) describes circumstances foreseen\nin the Cotonou Agreement where the Commission can establish specific provisions\nfor programming and implementing development aid unilaterally.\nArticle 4(4) recalls the EU's objective of\nconcentrating assistance announced in the Communication 'Increasing the Impact\nof EU Development Policy: An Agenda for Change', with a limitation to 3 sectors\nof intervention for bilateral programming, in line with Article 5(4) of the\nCommission proposal for the DCI Regulation. \nArticle 5 (Programming documents) is aligned as far as possible with Article 11 of the Commission\nproposal for the DCI Regulation. It outlines the requirement and principles for\npreparing strategy papers for the countries and regions and, based on these,\nmultiannual indicative programmes. The article also lists the cases when a\nstrategy paper would not need to be prepared in order to simplify and\nstreamline the programming process as well as to favour joint programming with\nMember States and alignment to the national programmes of developing countries.\nThus the Article also introduces the possibility of having a Joint Framework\nDocument that would lay down a comprehensive Union strategy, of which\ndevelopment policy would be part of. In line with the principle of partnership\nof the Cotonou Agreement, the agreement of the partner country government to use\nalternative programming documents is required; otherwise a strategy paper will\nhave to be drafted.\nArticles 5(5) and 5(6) provide for EDF-specific\ntypes of programming as foreseen in the Cotonou Agreement, i.e. for intra-ACP\ncooperation and special support programmes. \nArticle 6 (Programming for countries and\nregions in crisis, post-crisis or fragility situations) is aligned with Article 12 of the Commission proposal for the DCI Regulation.\nIt emphasises the special needs and circumstances of countries in crisis,\npost-crisis or fragility situation, which ought to be considered at the time of\ndrafting of programming documents. \nArticle 7 (Approval and modification of\nprogramming documents) is aligned as far as\npossible with Article 14 of the Commission proposal for the DCI Regulation on the\napproval of strategy papers and on the adoption of multiannual indicative\nprogrammes. The Article states that programming documents (i.e. strategy\npapers, multiannual indicative programmes and special support programmes) are approved\nby the Commission in accordance with Article 14 of this Regulation. It also\nreflects the provisions in the Cotonou Agreement regarding transmission of\ndocuments to the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and endorsement of programming\ndocuments by the ACP State or region after adoption by the Commission. It\nprovides for the review of programming, and the revision where appropriate (in\ncase of substantial evolution of the strategy or of the programmed priorities)\nof the corresponding documents. The Article provides flexibility and\nsimplification by establishing cases of non-substantial modifications, of which\nthe EDF Committee is informed. The Article also foresees a special urgency\nprocedure for modifying the programming documents on duly justified grounds of\nurgency, equivalent to the comitology procedure in article 8 of Regulation\n182/2011[11], as provided for by Article 14(10) of this Regulation.\nTitle III: Implementation \u2013 Articles 8 to\n13 \nArticle 8 (General framework for\nimplementation) sets the general framework for\nimplementation of EU assistance in relation with the Financial Regulation of\nthe 11th EDF.\nArticle 9 (Adoption of action programmes,\nindividual measures and special measures) is\naligned as far as possible with Article 2 of the Commission proposal for the\nCIR Regulation. It provides the principle that financing decisions taken by the\nCommission are to be in the form of action programmes, based on the multiannual\nprogramming documents. However, in line with the multiannual programming documents,\nindividual measures can be also adopted outside the action programme framework.\nIn the event of specific cases (exceptional circumstances or unforeseen needs) provided\nfor in the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission may also adopt special measures\nnot provided for in the multiannual programming documents. The Article establishes\nthe procedures for the adoption of the mentioned financing decisions. It also provides\nfor specific environmental screening, including Climate Change and Biodiversity\nimpact.\nArticle 10 (Additional Member State\ncontributions) describes the conditions for the\nmanagement of voluntary contributions which can be provided by Member States to\nthe Commission or the EIB in accordance with the 11th EDF Internal Agreement.\nArticle 11 (Taxes, duties and charges) describes possible arrangements with respect to taxes, duties and\ncharges, in line with Article 5 of the Commission proposal for the CIR Regulation,\nwhile respecting the provisions of Article 31 of Annex IV of the Cotonou\nAgreement.\nArticle 12 (Protection of the financial\ninterests of the Union) is aligned with Article 7\nof the Commission proposal for the CIR Regulation. It lays down measures\nto protect the Union's financial interests, and in particular to enable it\n(notably the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF) to carry out all the\nnecessary controls and checks on the measures implemented.\nArticle 13 (Rules on nationality and\norigin for public procurement, grants and other award procedures) is not aligned with Articles 8 and 9 of the Commission proposal for\nthe CIR Regulation, as it refers to the provisions on rules on nationality and\norigin which are defined in Article 20 of annex IV of the Cotonou Agreement.\nTitle IV: Decision-making procedures \u2013\nArticles 14 to 16 \nArticle 14 (Responsibilities of the EDF\nCommittee) describes the tasks and the involvement\nof the EDF Committee in the implementation of this Regulation. It aligns EDF\nprocedures with Article 15 of the Commission proposal for the CIR, which refers\nto the Regulation on comitology procedures. The procedures are equivalent\n'mutatis mutandis' to Article 3 (common provisions), 5 (examination procedure)\nand 8 (urgency procedure) of Regulation 182/2011 on comitology. \nArticle 15 (The African Peace Facility) establishes ad hoc procedures for the management of the African\nPeace Facility.\nArticle 16 (The Investment Facility\nCommittee) describes the structure and the functioning\nof the Investment Facility Committee, set up under the auspices of the EIB\naccording to the Internal Agreement, in the implementation of this Regulation.\nIt also describes the modus operandi and conditions for EIB operations.\nTitle V - Final provisions \u2013 Articles 17 to\n22\nArticle 17 (Participation by a third\ncountry or region) is based on the 10th EDF implementing\nRegulation, taking into account Article 15 of the Commission proposal for the DCI\nRegulation. It provides for the possibility to extend the eligibility of\nfunding under the EDF envelope dedicated to ACP countries to non-ACP developing\ncountries and regional integration bodies with ACP participation. It also\npromotes the reinforcement of regional cooperation programmes between ACP\ncountries, OCTs and Union's outermost regions.\nArticle 18 (Monitoring, reporting and\nevaluation of EDF assistance) is aligned with\nArticles 12 and 13 of the Commission proposal for the CIR Regulation. It\ncommits the Commission and the EIB to regularly evaluate the results of the\nimplemented policies and programmes and projects, and for the Commission, to\nlook at the effectiveness of programming itself, and to prepare a biennial\nCommission report on the progress and implementation of this Regulation. It\nalso provides for a Performance review to assess the degree of realisation of\ncommitments and disbursements and the results and impact of the aid provided,\nand for a mid-term and end-term evaluations of the ACP Investment Facility, as foreseen\nin Annex II to the Cotonou Agreement.\nArticle 19 (Climate action and\nbiodiversity expenditure) is aligned with Article\n14 of the Commission proposal for the CIR Regulation. It provides for a\nspecific tracking system based on the OECD methodology (\u2018Rio markers\u2019).\nArticle 20 (European External Action\nService) is a horizontal article to be found in all\nCommission proposals for the Regulations on external action, such as Article 21\nof the Commission proposal for the DCI Regulation. It highlights that this\nRegulation is to be applied in accordance with the Council Decision\nestablishing the organisation and functioning of the European External Action\nService[12], in particular Article 9 thereof.\nArticle 21 (Transitional measures) provides for a bridging facility to ensure the availability of\nfunds in case of late entry into force of the 11th EDF, in particular in view\nof possible delays in the ratification process of the 11th EDF Internal\nAgreement. Until the entry into force of the 11th EDF, action programmes,\nindividual measures, special measures and specific action programmes for\nsupport expenditure should thus be financed within the limits of the balances\nof the previous EDFs and from funds decommitted from projects under these EDFs.\nFunds committed[13]\nunder the bridging facility should be accounted for under the 11th EDF. By\nadopting the current regulation by unanimity, the Council takes the decision on\nthe use of the balances of previous EDFs, described in Article 1(5) of the 10th\nEDF Internal Agreement and in Article 5 of Annex Ib to the Cotonou Agreement. This\nArticle also provides for the continuation of the 10th EDF Financial Regulation\npending the entry into force of the 11th EDF Financial Regulation. \nArticle 22 (Entry into\nforce) provides that this Regulation shall apply from\n1 January 2014 until the final date of application of the 11th EDF Internal\nAgreement.\n2013/0211 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non the implementation of the 11th European\nDevelopment Fund\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European Union\nand to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to the Partnership Agreement\nbetween the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States of\nthe one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other\npart, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000[14] (hereinafter referred to as the Cotonou Agreement),\nHaving regard to the Internal Agreement\nbetween the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting\nwithin the Council, on the financing of European Union aid under the\nmultiannual financial framework for the period 2014 to 2020, in accordance with\nthe Cotonou Agreement, and on the allocation of financial assistance for the\nOverseas Countries and Territories to which Part Four of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union applies[15]\n(\"the Internal Agreement\"), and in particular Article 10(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\nCommission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\nInvestment Bank (EIB),\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision\nNo (\u2026) of the ACP-EU Council of Ministers[16] establishes the multiannual financial framework for cooperation with\nACP countries for the period 2014 to 2020 by adopting a new Annex Ic to the\nCotonou Agreement.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nInternal Agreement defines the various financial envelopes of the 11th European\nDevelopment Fund (\"the 11th EDF\"), the contribution key and\ncontributions to the 11th EDF, sets up the EDF Committee and the Investment\nFacility Committee (\"the IF Committee\"), and determines the voting\nweights and qualified majority rule therein.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\nthe Internal Agreement sets the aggregate amount of Union aid to the African,\nCaribbean and Pacific Group of States (\"the ACP States\") (excluding\nthe Republic of South Africa) and to the Overseas Countries and Territories (\"the\nOCTs\") for the seven-year period 2014 to 2020 at EUR 30 506 million\ncontributed by the Member States. From this amount, EUR (\u2026) million are\nallocated to the ACP States as specified in the multiannual financial framework\n2014 to 2020 referred to in Annex Ic to the Cotonou Agreement, EUR (...)\nmillion are allocated to the OCTs and EUR (\u2026) million are allocated to the\nCommission for support expenditures linked to programming and implementation of\nthe EDF by the Commission.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\n11th EDF allocation to the OCTs is governed by Council Decision (\u2026) of (\u2026) on\nthe association of the OCTs, with the European Union[17] and by its implementing rules and any subsequent updates thereof.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures\ncovered by, and eligible for funding under Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96\nof 20 June 1996 concerning humanitarian aid[18]\nshould only in exceptional circumstances be financed under the 11th EDF, where\nsuch assistance is required to ensure continuity of cooperation from crisis to\nstable conditions for development and cannot be financed from the general\nbudget of the European Union.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 11\nApril 2006, the Council adopted the principle of funding the African Peace\nFacility from the EDF.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nACP countries will also be eligible for Union assistance from thematic\nprogrammes provided by Regulation (\u2026) of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of (\u2026) establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation,\nby Regulation (\u2026) of the European Parliament and of the Council of (\u2026)\nestablishing a Partnership Instrument for cooperation with third countries, by\nRegulation (\u2026) of the European Parliament and of the Council of (\u2026)\nestablishing an Instrument for Stability and by Regulation (\u2026) of the European\nParliament and of the Council of (\u2026) establishing a financing instrument for\nthe promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide. Those programmes should\nadd value to, be consistent with and complementary to the programmes funded\nunder the 11th EDF.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nreferred to in Article 13(2) of Regulation (EU) No [\u2026/\u2026] of the European\nParliament and of the Council establishing \"Erasmus For All\" The\nUnion Programme for Education, Training, Youth and Sport[19], in order to promote the\ninternational dimension of higher education, an indicative amount of EUR 1 812\n100 000 from the different external instruments (Development Cooperation\nInstrument, European Neighbourhood Instrument, Instrument for Preaccession\nAssistance, Partnership Instrument and the European Development Fund), will be\nallocated to actions of learning mobility to or from non EU countries and to\ncooperation and policy dialogue with authorities/ institutions/ organisations\nfrom these countries. The provisions of the Regulation (EU) No [\u2026/\u2026] [\"Erasmus\nfor All\"] will apply to the use of those funds. The funding should be made\navailable through 2 multiannual allocations only covering the first 4 years and\nthe remaining 3 years respectively. This funding should be reflected in the multiannual\nindicative programming under this Regulation, in line with the identified needs\nand priorities of the countries concerned. The allocations should be revised in\nline with the EU external priorities in case of major unforeseen circumstances\nor important political changes.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nregional cooperation among the ACP States, the OCTs and the Union's outermost\nregions should be further encouraged.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to implement the 11th EDF, the procedure for programming, examining and\napproving aid should be established and the detailed rules for supervising the\nuse of aid should be laid down. On (\u2026) the representatives of the Governments\nof the Member States meeting within the Council adopted Decision (\u2026) on the\nprovisional application of the Internal Agreement[20], for the purpose of the\nadoption of the Implementation Regulation and the Financial Regulation and,\ninter alia, for the purposes of establishing the EDF Committee and the IF\nCommittee.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nEuropean Consensus on Development of 22 December 2005[21] and the Council Conclusions on\nthe Commission Communications 'Increasing the impact of EU development policy: an\nAgenda for Change'[22], and on 'The future approach to EU budget support to third countries'[23], should provide the general policy framework to guide the programming\nand implementation of the 11th EDF, including the internationally agreed\nprinciples on aid effectiveness such as the principles set out in the Paris Declaration\non Aid Effectiveness (2005), the EU Code of Conduct on Division of Labour in\nDevelopment Policy (2007), the EU Guidelines for the Accra Agenda for Action\n(2008), and the Busan Outcome Document (2011) and the United Nations Convention\non the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to which the Union is a party.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union also aims to\nensure coherence with other areas of its external action when formulating the\nUnion's development cooperation policy and its strategic planning programming\nand implementation of measures.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fighting climate change and\nprotecting the environment are among the great challenges which face the Union\nand where the need for international action is urgent. In accordance with the\nintent stated in Commission Communication \"A budget for Europe 2020\"\nof 29 June 2011, this Regulation should as far as possible contribute to the\nobjective of addressing at least 20% of the overall EU funding to climate action objectives, while respecting the principle of\npartnership with ACP countries enshrined in the Cotonou Agreement. Actions in\nlow carbon and climate resilient society should, wherever possible, be mutually\nsupportive in order to reinforce their impacts.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union and the Member\nStates should improve the consistency and the complementarity of their\nrespective policies on development cooperation, in particular by responding to\npartner countries' and regions' priorities at country and regional level.
