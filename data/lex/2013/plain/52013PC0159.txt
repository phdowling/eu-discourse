With a view to ensuring that the amounts for the financing of\nthe Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) comply with the annual sub-ceilings for\nmarket related expenditure and direct payments under heading 2 laid down in the\nRegulation to be adopted by the Council pursuant to Article 312(2) of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, a financial discipline\nmechanism has been provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009\nestablishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common\nagricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers[1]. According to this mechanism,\nan adjustment of the level of direct payments should be determined when the\nforecasts for the financing of direct payments and market related expenditure,\ntaking into account any financial transfers between the European Agricultural\nGuarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development\n(EAFRD), indicate that the annual sub-ceiling under heading 2 set out in the\nFinancial Framework will be exceeded.\nIn drawing up the 2014 Draft Budget, the\nfirst budgetary estimates for direct payments and market related expenditure\nshowed that that the sub-ceiling under heading 2 for financial year 2014, after\nfinancial transfers between EAGF and EAFRD, is likely to be exceeded. As a\nconsequence, the level of direct payments should be reduced in order to comply\nwith the ceiling. \nOn this basis, the Commission presents a\nproposal for setting the adjustment rate for direct payments in respect of\ncalendar year 2013, which is to be adopted by the European Parliament and the\nCouncil by 30 June 2013 in accordance with Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No\n73/2009 as amended by Regulation (EU) No 671/2012 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council[2].\nHowever, if this adjustment rate has not been set by 30 June 2013, the\nCommission will set that rate pursuant to Article 18(4) of Council Regulation\n(EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy[3]. \nFurther to determining the adjustment rate\nset by the present Regulation, Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005\nalso gives the possibility to the Commission to propose an adaptation of this\nrate on the basis of new information in its possession. The Commission will\nreview its forecasts for market related expenditure and direct payments when\npreparing the Amending Letter to the 2014 Draft Budget in October 2013, and\npropose the adaptation of the adjustment rate, if appropriate. The Council may\nadapt the adjustment rate by 1 December 2013.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThis proposal implements the rules provided\nfor in Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and Article 18 of\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. Prior consultation with the interested\nparties and the preparation of impact assessment were not needed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThis proposal sets the percentage rate of\nthe financial discipline adjustment rate in respect of calendar year 2013. \nConsidering that Member States have the\npossibility to make late payments to farmers outside the regulatory payment\nperiod applicable to direct payments and that the financial discipline\nadjustment rate might vary from one calendar year to another, the amounts of\ndirect payment to be granted to farmers should not be affected by the financial\ndiscipline differently depending on when the payment is made to farmers by the\nMember States. Therefore, in order to ensure equal treatment between farmers,\nthe adjustment rate should be applied to amounts of direct payments to be\ngranted to farmers for aid applications lodged in calendar year 2013 only,\nindependently when the payment will actually be made to the farmer.\nThe unequal distribution of direct payments\nbetween small and large beneficiaries remains a concern for the CAP. The\npresent regulation proposes to apply the financial discipline adjustment rate\nto amounts in excess of EUR 5000 in order to contribute to achieving the\nobjective of a more balanced distribution of payments. This is in line with\nwhat is proposed on financial discipline in the context of the CAP reform in\nArticle 8 of the Commission proposal for a Regulation (EU) establishing rules\nfor direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the\ncommon agricultural policy[4].\nDirect payments in Bulgaria, Romania and in Croatia, subject to its accession and as of the date of its accession, are\nin the process of phasing-in of direct payments in calendar year 2013. As a\nconsequence, the financial discipline will not apply in these Member States.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe calculation of the financial discipline\nadjustment rate is part of the preparation of the 2014 Draft Budget in order to\ncomply with the sub-ceiling for market related expenditure and direct payment\nunder Heading 2 for financial year 2014, after financial transfers between EAGF\nand EAFRD, set out in the Conclusions of the European Council (7/8 February\n2013) on the Multiannual Financial Framework[5].\nAccording to the Conclusions, the reserve for crises is included under Heading\n2 and will be established by applying at the beginning of each year a reduction\nto direct payments with the financial discipline mechanism,.\nThe first estimates of budget\nappropriations for direct aids and market related expenditure showed the need\nto reduce the total amount of direct payments that can be granted to farmers in\nrespect of calendar year 2013 by EUR 1471.4 million through financial\ndiscipline in order to respect the sub-ceiling for financial year 2014 set out\nin the Conclusions of the European Council (7/8 February 2013) on the\nMultiannual Financial Framework, reduced by the amounts made available to EAFRD\npursuant to Article 10(b) and 136 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and Article 52\nof Commission proposal for a Regulation (EU) establishing rules for direct\npayments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common\nagricultural policy. The financial discipline reduction also includes EUR 424.5\nmillion needed to establish the reserve for crises.\nThe percentage of the financial discipline\nadjustment rate necessary to respect the ceiling is 4.981759 %. It has been\ncalculated taking into account that it is to be applied only to amounts in\nexcess of EUR 5000 and not in all Member States.\nThe application of this adjustment rate\nwill result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines\ncovering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in\nrespect of calendar year 2013 (financial year 2014). The total reduction\nresulting from the application of financial discipline amounts to EUR 1471.4 million.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nAt this stage, as a precautionary measure,\nthe financial discipline adjustment rate proposed by the present regulation is\nbased on the Conclusions of the European Council (7/8 February 2013) on the\nMultiannual Financial Framework. However, the final calculation of the\nfinancial discipline rate will depend on the sub-ceiling under Heading 2 fixed\nin the Council Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for\nthe years 2014-2020 and the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European\nParliament, the Council and the Commission on cooperation in budgetary matters\nand on sound financial management.\n\u00a0\n2013/0087 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non fixing an adjustment rate to direct\npayments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in respect of calendar year\n2013\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\n[Having regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[6],]\n[Having regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[7],]\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 11(1) of Council\nRegulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for\ndirect support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and\nestablishing certain support schemes for farmers ([8]) lays down that in financial\nyear 2014, the amounts for the financing of the market related expenditure and\ndirect payments of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have to respect the\nannual ceilings set out in application of the Regulation adopted by the Council\npursuant to Article 312(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nArticle 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 also lays down that an adjustment\nof the direct payments (financial discipline) has to be determined when the\nforecasts for the financing of the direct payments and market related\nexpenditures, increased by the amounts resulting from the application of\nArticles 10c and 136 of that Regulation but before the application of Article\n10a thereof and without taking into account the margin of EUR 300 000 000,\nindicate that the annual ceiling will be exceeded. In accordance with Article\n11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, the European Parliament and the Council\nhave to determine that adjustment by 30 June based on a proposal from the\nCommission to be presented no later than 31 March of the calendar year in\nrespect of which the adjustment applies.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The forecasts for the\ndirect payments and market related expenditure determined in the preparation of\nthe 2014 Draft Budget show that the annual ceiling for the European\nAgricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) in respect of financial year 2014 is likely\nto be exceeded taking into account the need to establish the reserve for crises\nreferred to in the Conclusions of the European Council (7/ 8 February 2013) on\nthe Multiannual Financial Framework. An adjustment rate to the direct payments\nlisted in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 should therefore be determined.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a general rule, farmers\nsubmitting an aid application for direct payments for one calendar year (N) are\npaid within a fixed payment period falling under the financial year (N+1).\nHowever, Member States have the possibility to make late payments, within\ncertain limits, to farmers beyond this payment period without any time limits.\nSuch late payments may fall in a later financial year. When financial discipline\nis applied for a given calendar year, the adjustment rate should not be applied\nto payments for which aid applications have been submitted in the calendar\nyears other than that for which the financial discipline applies. Therefore, in\norder to ensure equal treatment of farmers, it is appropriate to provide that\nthe adjustment rate should be applied to payments for which aid applications\nhave been submitted in the calendar year for which the financial discipline is\napplied, irrespectively of when the payment is made to farmers. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mechanism of the\nfinancial discipline, together with the modulation, was introduced with the\n2003 CAP reform. Both instruments provided for a linear reduction of the amount\nof direct payments to be granted to farmers. Taking into account the\nimplications of the unequal distribution of direct payments between small and\nlarge beneficiaries, modulation has been applied to amounts in excess of EUR\n5000 in order to achieve a more balanced distribution of payments. In respect\nof calendar year 2013, the adjustment of direct payments referred to in Article\n10(a) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 continues to provide for the same exemption\nas the modulation. The financial discipline should be applied in a similar way\nto also contribute to achieving the objective of a more balanced distribution\nof payments; therefore, it is appropriate to provide for the application of the\nadjustment rate only for amounts in excess of EUR 5000.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 11(3) of\nRegulation (EC) No 73/2009 lays down that in the framework of the application\nof the schedule of increments provided for in Article 121 of that Regulation to\nall direct payments granted in the new Member States within the meaning of\nArticle 2(g) of that Regulation, the financial discipline should not apply to the\nnew Member States until the beginning of the calendar year in respect of which\nthe level of direct payments applicable in the new Member States is at least\nequal to the then applicable level of such payments in the other Member States.\nSince the direct payments are still subject to the application of the schedule\nof increments in calendar year 2013 in Bulgaria, Romania, the adjustment rate\nto be determined by the present Regulation should not apply to payments to\nfarmers in these Member States. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 73/2009\nhas been adapted by the Act of Accession of Croatia. The amendments resulting\nfrom the adaptation in question will enter into force only subject to and on\nthe date of the entry into force of the Treaty of Accession of Croatia. Since\nCroatia is subject to the application of the schedule of increments provided\nfor in Article 121 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in calendar year 2013 the\nadjustment rate to be determined by the present Regulation should not apply to\npayments to farmers in Croatia, subject to its accession and as of the date of\nits accession,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle

February 2013) on the Multiannual Financial Framework. However, the final budgetary implications will depend on the sub-ceiling under Heading 2 fixed in the Council Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 and the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.   The first estimates of budget appropriations for direct payments and market related expenditure for the 2014 Draft Budget showed the need to reduce the total amount of direct payments that can be granted to farmers in respect of calendar year 2013 by EUR 1 471.4 million through financial discipline, in order to respect the EAGF net ceiling for financial year 2014 and establish the reserve for crises (424.5 million \u20ac). The financial discipline adjustment rate necessary is 4.981759%.   The adjustment rate has been calculated taking into account the estimated share of direct payments to be granted to farmers below EUR 5000 for each direct payment scheme subject to financial discipline and for each Member States, except Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia. Since direct payments in Bulgaria, Romania and in Croatia, subject to its accession and as of the date of its accession, are in the process of phasing-in in calendar year 2013, the financial discipline will not apply to them as a consequence.   The estimated amount of reduction due to financial discipline per budget items are the following:   05 03 01 01 (SPS)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0
