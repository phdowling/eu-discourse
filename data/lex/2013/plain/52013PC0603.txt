In addition, participation in sport\r\nand physical activity is correlated with other factors such as social\r\ninteraction and inclusion. Physical activity is one of\r\nthe most important health determinants in modern society and sport constitutes\r\na fundamental part of any public policy approach aimed at improving levels of\r\nphysical activity.\nThe\r\nmany benefits of physical activity and exercise across the life course are well\r\nrecorded[1] and more generally add to quality of life, as confirmed by the\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO). Research supports the role that sport and\r\nphysical activity has in child and adolescent development[2] and suggests that participation in sport and physical activity in adolescence is\r\npositively associated with physical activity levels in adulthood. There is also\r\na growing body of evidence on the positive correlation between exercise and\r\nmental health, mental development and cognitive processes.[3] In the Union, physical activity\r\nlevels are positively correlated with life expectancy, meaning that those\r\ncountries with higher levels of physical activity tend to have a higher life\r\nexpectancy.[4]\nConversely,\r\na number of detriments are caused by the lack of physical activity, including\r\npremature mortality, rising overweight and obesity levels, breast and colon\r\ncancers, diabetes, and ischaemic heart disease. In 2009, physical inactivity was identified as the fourth leading\r\nrisk factor for premature mortality and disease in high-income countries\r\nworld-wide, accounting for more than 1 million deaths in the European region\r\nalone.[5]\r\nAvailable evidence shows that health problems caused by the lack of physical\r\nactivity have significant direct and indirect economic costs due to illness and\r\nmorbidity, sick leave and premature death, especially also in view of Europe's\r\nrapidly ageing societies.[6]\r\nStudies have attempted to monetise these. For instance, one study carried out\r\nfor the British government identified costs to England of just over \u20ac 3bn per\r\nyear, or \u20ac 63 per inhabitant[7]. Considering these facts, physical activity has been included in\r\nthe goals for global action on the control of non-communicable diseases.[8] \nIn\r\nthe Union, the promotion of health-enhancing physical activity (HEPA) is a\r\nmatter primarily for Member States. In light of the increasing awareness of the importance and beneficial effects of physical\r\nactivity and the growing financial burden of physical inactivity, many public\r\nauthorities have stepped up efforts to promote HEPA. As\r\nof 2010, a large majority of Member States reported to have at least some form\r\nof recommendations in place for\r\nphysical activity, and many have also developed specific strategies to enable\r\nand encourage their populations to become more physically active.[9] Specific measures for this purpose have been launched in different policy\r\nareas or sectors, in particular sport, health, transport and education and\r\nthere are many examples of good practice involving relevant stakeholders.\nIn\r\nan effort to support the Member States, the Union has been promoting physical\r\nactivity through its policies and financial instruments in particular in the\r\nfields of sport and health, and has provided evidence-based guidance to policy\r\nmakers in the form of the EU Physical Activity Guidelines[10]. These guidelines, drafted by\r\na group of 22 experts from around Europe representing various disciplines and\r\nbroadly representative of informed scientific opinion, were confirmed by EU\r\nSport Ministers in 2008. They reiterate WHO Recommendations on the minimum level of physical activity, emphasise the importance\r\nof a cross-sectoral approach to HEPA and provide 41 concrete guidelines for\r\naction. Already the 2007 White Paper on Sport[11]\r\nand the 2007 White Paper on a Strategy for Europe on Nutrition,\r\nOverweight and Obesity-related Health issues[12] underlined the importance of HEPA and have helped strengthen policy\r\ndebate and the exchange of good practice.\nDespite\r\nthe growing profile given to HEPA promotion and the available\r\ntools at national, European and international level, the rates of physical\r\ninactivity in the Union remain unacceptably high (e.g. in 2010, 60% of\r\nEuropeans responded that they exercised or played sport seldom or never[13]). According to the WHO, two-thirds\r\nof the adult population in the Union does not reach recommended levels of\r\nactivity. As a result, physical inactivity is estimated to deprive Europeans of\r\nover 8 million days of healthy life every year, on average.[14] While evidence demonstrates\r\nvast discrepancies between individual Member States, most countries have not\r\nachieved the principal policy objective, namely to increase the proportion of\r\ncitizens who reach the HEPA levels recommended by the WHO and reiterated in the\r\nEU Physical Activity Guidelines. For the Union as a whole, the HEPA promotion\r\npolicies of Member States have not been effective. This situation runs not only\r\ncounter to the Europe 2020 Strategy[15], which\r\nacknowledges the need to fight health inequalities as a prerequisite for growth\r\nand competitiveness, but is also incompatible with the Union's stated policy\r\nambitions in the fields of sport and health. Research indeed confirms the\r\n\u201cevidence-policy gap for action\u201d in addressing physical inactivity and has led\r\nto urgent calls for policy action on physical activity as a standalone public\r\nhealth priority.[16]\nThe\r\nreasons for the inability to reverse physical inactivity trends consist primarily\r\nin shortcomings in the way HEPA promotion policies are developed and\r\nimplemented. Taking account of the criteria for effective HEPA policy laid down in scientific tools, the following\r\nshortcomings are confirmed by evidence, expert opinion and consultation\r\noutcomes: the lack of sufficiently cross-sectoral approaches to HEPA (incl. collaboration among different ministries and bodies\r\nresponsible for HEPA); unclear objectives and goals of HEPA policies; and insufficient\r\nprovisions for monitoring and evaluation of HEPA rates and policies. Robust data is indeed seldom available, despite its value for\r\nformulating and refining policy.\nHEPA\r\nis only starting to become a policy field on its own and to get recognition as\r\na complex policy area that requires multi-sectoral interventions, such as those\r\nprovided for in the EU Physical Activity Guidelines. Physical activity has so\r\nfar been lacking advocacy power to ensure that it receives the appropriate\r\npolitical recognition.[17] Since HEPA as a policy field is a rather new topic on the agenda of\r\ngovernments[18], there is a need for improved understanding\r\nof the determinants of HEPA, which is essential for designing interventions to\r\nchange physical activity levels, as well as for institutional capacity to\r\npromote HEPA.\nTo\r\naddress this situation, and following expert work in\r\nthe context of the implementation of the European Union Work Plan for Sport\r\n2011-2014[19]\r\nand input from other fields and\r\nlevels of expertise (e.g. health and transport), the Council in its conclusions\r\non the promotion of HEPA of November 2012 called on the Commission to present a\r\nproposal for a Council Recommendation promoting a cross-sectoral approach based\r\non the EU Physical Activity Guidelines, including a light monitoring framework.\nThe success of the initiative will ultimately depend to a\r\nconsiderable extent on mobilising stakeholders, especially the ones most\r\ndirectly related to physical activity and with strong assets to reach out to\r\ncitizens. The sport sector, in particular through its activities at grassroots\r\nlevel and with a sport-for-all focus, is therefore a key player in any\r\nsuccessful effort to promote HEPA.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe\r\nproposal is based on the work of the Commission and Member States in the framework of the implementation of the Work Plan for Sport 2011-2014. The\r\nsubstance of the proposal, including the monitoring framework, has been the\r\nsubject of extensive consultations with Member States, experts, stakeholders\r\nand the general public from different backgrounds, including sport, health,\r\neducation and transport.\r\nInterested parties have been consulted at different levels on their views\r\nregarding the need for and scope of the promotion of physical activity in a\r\nUnion context. Following the Communication on sport in January 2011[20], which included an action\r\npoint to consider such a proposal, the Commission has regularly presented its\r\nplans and the work in progress for this initiative to policymakers and\r\nstakeholders and sought feedback in different fora. In its Resolution on the\r\nEuropean dimension in sport of 2 February 2012, the European Parliament called\r\non the Union and on Member States to facilitate engagement in sport and to\r\npromote a healthy lifestyle, fully exploiting the opportunities of sport,\r\nthereby reducing spending on healthcare.[21]\nMember\r\nStates have underlined the need for further exchanges of experience and good\r\npractice at Union level on HEPA and have been supportive of a new Union policy\r\ninitiative. Member States have confirmed the difficulties in involving relevant\r\nsectors at national level and the lack of solid data, while also highlighting\r\nthe need to keep the burden of data collection limited. Sport stakeholders,\r\nincluding the sport movement but also sport-related organisations, such as the\r\nsporting goods industry, have strongly encouraged further Union action on HEPA.\r\nThe view that the Union has a role to play in promoting HEPA is shared not only\r\nby the Union institutions, existing Union level cooperation structures for\r\nsport and health, the expert level and sport stakeholders, but also by a large\r\nsegment of Union citizens, as confirmed in an online consultation in 2010.\nThe\r\nImpact Assessment Board provided its positive opinion on the draft Impact\r\nAssessment on 7 December 2012. The Board's comments are taken into account in\r\nthe final version of the Impact Assessment Report.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nLegal basis\nThe\r\nproposed initiative takes a focused approach on HEPA, a\r\nrelatively new discipline under rapid scientific development, combining physical activity, which is closely related to sport and exercise, on the one\r\nhand, and public health on the other. To reach the objectives of the proposal\r\nand to support the Member States in their efforts to promote HEPA, the Union can\r\nact by making use of two legal bases: Articles 165 and 168 of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU), both of which assign a supporting\r\ncompetence to the Union. Article 165 stipulates that the Union shall\r\n\u2018contribute to the promotion of European sporting issues\u2019 and that action shall\r\nbe aimed at \u2018developing the European dimension in sport\u2019. Article 168\r\nstipulates that \u2018Union action [...] shall be directed towards improving public\r\nhealth [...] and obviating sources of danger to physical and mental health\u2019.\nIn\r\nboth areas (sport and public health) the Treaty states that, in pursuit of\r\nthese objectives, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may adopt\r\nrecommendations. In addition, the Treaty explicitly authorises the Commission\r\nto take \u2018any useful initiative\u2019 to promote policy co-ordination among the\r\nMember States in the area of public health, in particular \u2018initiatives aimed at\r\nthe establishment of guidelines and indicators, the organisation of exchange of\r\nbest practice, and the preparation of the necessary elements for periodic\r\nmonitoring and evaluation\u2019. The proposed Recommendation aims to strengthen\r\nMember States' efforts in the field of promoting HEPA and to support them by\r\nproviding a framework for monitoring their policies. The Recommendation aims at\r\nstrengthening cooperation and policy coordination between the Member States and\r\nat providing for further exchanges of good practice within the relevant Union level\r\nstructures for sport and for health.\nThis\r\nRecommendation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles which\r\nare recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\nSummary of the\r\nproposed initiative\nFollowing\r\nthe request from the Council, this Recommendation sets out the main elements\r\nfor coherent, cross-sectoral and evidence-based policies to promote HEPA and\r\nthereby aims to help Member States in their efforts to enable citizens to\r\nbecome (more) physically\r\nactive.\nThe Recommendation reflects the clear\r\nevidence that HEPA promotion policies, to be successful, need to be based on a\r\ncross-sectoral approach. It takes into account that Member States, while\r\nsharing common objectives and respecting fundamental rights, set different\r\npriorities with regard to HEPA due to different social, economic and cultural\r\ncontexts and therefore take different policy approaches. Provisions for policy\r\ncoordination at Union level are intended to support Member States in their\r\nefforts to develop and implement effective HEPA policies. The monitoring\r\nframework, including its indicators developed by HEPA experts, is designed as a\r\nsufficiently flexible tool to inform policy making in this context. A detailed\r\ndescription of the operationalization of indicators and data sources is set out\r\nin the attached Commission Staff Working Document.\nThe\r\nRecommendation invites Member\r\nStates:\n\u00b7                        \r\nto develop a national strategy and a\r\ncorresponding action plan as well as adequate instruments for promoting HEPA\r\nacross sectors, reflecting the EU Physical Activity Guidelines;\n\u00b7                        \r\nto monitor physical activity levels and the\r\nimplementation of HEPA policies by making use of the monitoring framework and\r\nindicators set out in the Annex to the Recommendation, according to their national\r\ncircumstances;\n\u00b7                        \r\nto cooperate closely among themselves and with\r\nthe Commission by engaging in a process of regular exchange of information and\r\ngood practice on HEPA promotion within relevant Union level structures;\nThe\r\nRecommendation invites the Commission:\n\u00b7                        \r\nto assist Member States in their efforts to\r\neffectively promote HEPA and in developing and implementing policies consistent\r\nwith the EU Physical Activity Guidelines;\n\u00b7                        \r\nto provide support for the establishment and\r\nfunctioning of the monitoring framework, based on\r\nexisting forms of monitoring and data collection in this field;\n\u00b7                        \r\nbased on the information provided by Member\r\nStates, to regularly report on progress in implementing this Recommendation.\nWhile the Recommendation\r\nwill first and foremost target public authorities in the Member States\r\nresponsible for HEPA promotion, it will ultimately help reaching out to Union citizens\r\nat large (e.g. children, working population, seniors) by encouraging the\r\nimplementation of cross-sectoral policies providing for opportunities to engage\r\nin physical activity. The initiative will also rely on mobilising stakeholders,\r\nincluding the ones most directly related to physical activity, such as sport organisations.\nSubsidiarity\nWhile\r\nthe main responsibility for promoting HEPA and for the definition of sport and health\r\npolicies lies with the Member States, Union action can add significant value\r\nover and above what Member States can achieve on their own. The Union can provide renewed political momentum toward focused\r\naction on HEPA. More effective HEPA policies will help\r\ncontribute to other policy areas where Member States have agreed to set common\r\nobjectives. By helping to reduce the significant social and economic costs of\r\nphysical inactivity, and by addressing key factors contributing to active and\r\nhealthy ageing, a healthy workforce and ultimately higher productivity they\r\nwill strengthen Member States' ability to achieve the growth objectives set in\r\nthe Europe 2020 Strategy. They will also address the determinants of health\r\ninequities outlined in the Strategy as a prerequisite for growth and competitiveness. Better HEPA\r\npolicies will also respond to recent calls from the Council and the Parliament\r\nfor action to support healthy lifestyle behaviours, including physical activity\r\nand engagement in sport, as a means to address premature mortality, morbidity\r\nand disability in the Union. The Council conclusions on HEPA adopted in\r\nNovember 2012 make these requests even more explicit. The recent Evaluation of\r\nthe implementation of the Strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Obesity and\r\nOverweight-related Health issues also supports a policy initiative at European\r\nlevel, as it encourages the Commission to raise the profile of nascent\r\ninitiatives focussing on physical activity.[22]\nThe\r\nRecommendation's focus on enhanced\r\npolicy coordination between Member States \u2013 in the form\r\nof sharing of experience, peer learning and\r\ndissemination of good practice -\r\nseems particularly useful given the vast differences that currently exist between the\r\nMember States in the priority afforded to HEPA, the approaches chosen and the\r\nnational policy co-ordination mechanisms. Union support\r\nand coordination will contribute to improving Member\r\nStates' capacity to promote HEPA across sectors and to shape policies that\r\nensure better interventions. The Union is well situated\r\nto enhance provisions for monitoring and evaluation of HEPA and HEPA policies\r\nand thereby to help Member States track developments over time. The monitoring\r\nframework will deliver the evidence to Member States to justify more focused\r\napproaches to HEPA promotion. \nThe proposed Recommendation builds on\r\nexisting strategies and tools developed at the international level, in\r\nparticular the WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health of May\r\n2004[23], the 2010 Global Recommendations which recommend at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical\r\nactivity for adults[24], and the global consensus achieved by the World Health Assembly on\r\n27 May 2013 laid down in the \"Omnibus Resolution on Non-communicable\r\nDiseases\"[25].\r\nIt takes account of the cooperation developed with the WHO Regional Office for\r\nEurope in the framework of the Strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Overweight and\r\nObesity-related Health issues and the 2013 evaluation of the latter[26]. It aims to improve further\r\nthe tools developed with regard to the monitoring of physical activity, in\r\nparticular the WHO European database on nutrition, obesity and physical\r\nactivity (NOPA)[27].\r\nThe information and data to be provided by the Member States in this context is\r\nto a large extent already available and collected as part of existing surveys\r\nor projects; a number of indicators are already in use. Collection of data will\r\nrequire more efforts only in the case of a very limited number of indicators,\r\nin particular in the early phase of the monitoring framework. It is expected to\r\nimprove over time and with increasing capacity in the Member States. The\r\nmonitoring framework should be implemented in close cooperation with the WHO\r\nand with support from HEPA experts.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nIt\r\nis difficult to calculate the budget currently allocated to HEPA policies\r\nbecause the costs of HEPA promotion are spread around government ministries and\r\nauthorities, as well as various NGOs and the private sector. In addition,\r\nspending on HEPA is not recorded comprehensively across the Union. This is\r\nexacerbated by the fact that HEPA is by nature cross-sectoral, that many\r\npolicies are tangentially related to HEPA and that policies which promote HEPA often do not include\r\nHEPA promotion as a primary objective. Member States would ultimately bear\r\nthe costs relating to the implementation of HEPA policies following this\r\ninitiative.\nAdministrative\r\ncosts for the Member States would mainly stem from\r\nthe reporting requirements in the context of the light monitoring framework. They\r\nwould already be low in the first year, with further reductions once the\r\nmechanism is fully operational, as staff becomes familiar with the monitoring\r\nand because of better data availability over time.[28]\nThe\r\ncosts that would fall on the Union budget relate to the establishment and\r\nfunctioning of the monitoring mechanism; and to the provision of support to\r\nMember States for monitoring activities in the form of capacity building. These\r\ncosts would be covered by the Sport Chapter of the Erasmus+ programme for the\r\nperiod 2014-2020.[29]\r\nIn addition, the Union budget would cover the organisation of Expert Group\r\nmeetings at Union level.\n2013/0291 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL RECOMMENDATION\non promoting health-enhancing physical\r\nactivity across sectors\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 165 and 168\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The benefits of\r\nphysical activity and exercise across the life course are paramount and include\r\nlowered risk of cardiovascular disease, some types of cancers and diabetes,\r\nimprovements in musculoskeletal health and body weight control, as well as\r\npositive effects on mental health development and cognitive processes. Physical\r\nactivity, as recommended by the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO), is important for all age groups, and has particular\r\nrelevance for children, the working population and the elderly.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Physical activity being a prerequisite for\r\na healthy lifestyle and a healthy workforce, contributes to the achievement of\r\nkey objectives defined in the Europe 2020 Strategy[30], notably with\r\nregard to growth, productivity and health.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While efforts to\r\npromote health-enhancing physical activity (henceforth: HEPA) have been stepped\r\nup by public authorities in some Member States over the past years, rates\r\nof physical inactivity in the European Union remain unacceptably high. The\r\nmajority of Europeans do not engage in sufficient physical activity with 60%\r\nnever or seldom playing sport or exercising[31]. The lack of\r\nleisure-time physical activity tends to be more common in the lower\r\nsocio-economic groups. There are currently no indications that the negative\r\ntrends are being reversed for the Union as a whole.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Insufficient physical activity has been\r\nidentified as a leading risk factor for premature mortality and disease in\r\nhigh-income countries world-wide, being responsible for about 1 million deaths\r\nper year in the European Region alone[32]. The detriments caused\r\nby the lack of physical activity in the European Union are well recorded, as\r\nare the significant direct and indirect economic\r\ncosts associated to the lack of physical activity and related health problems,\r\nespecially in view of the fact that most European societies are ageing rapidly.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding physical activity levels, there are vast\r\ndiscrepancies between Member States. While some have made considerable progress\r\nin increasing the proportion of citizens who meet the minimum level of recommended\r\nphysical activity, many others have made none or even regressed. Current policies\r\nhave proved ineffective in reducing the physical inactivity levels for the Union as a whole. There is considerable potential to learn from successful approaches to\r\ndevelop and implement HEPA policies.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A number of policy areas, in particular\r\nsport and health, can contribute to the promotion of physical activity and can\r\nprovide new opportunities for Union citizens to become physically active. For\r\nthis potential to be fully exploited, and therefore for physical activity\r\nlevels to increase, a strategic cross-sectoral approach in the field of HEPA\r\npromotion, including involvement of all relevant Ministries, bodies and\r\norganisations, is indispensable. The availability of more and better data on\r\nphysical activity levels and HEPA promotion policies is an essential element to\r\nunderpin this process and a requirement for policy evaluation aimed at leading\r\nto more effective future policy development and implementation. This data is,\r\nhowever, lacking to a considerable extent.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EU Physical Activity Guidelines[33], confirmed by EU\r\nSport Ministers meeting informally in December 2008 and by the Council in\r\nNovember and December 2012[34], advocate a\r\ncross-sectoral approach covering all thematic areas responsible for HEPA\r\npromotion. The implementation of these\r\nGuidelines in the Member States has so far remained patchy.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The 2011 Communication on Developing the\r\nEuropean Dimension in Sport[35] invited the Commission\r\nand the Member States to, based on the EU Physical Activity Guidelines,\r\ncontinue progress towards the establishment of national guidelines, including a\r\nreview and coordination process, and to consider a Council Recommendation in\r\nthat field.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Resolution of the Council on a European\r\nUnion Work Plan for Sport 2011-2014[36] recognised the\r\nneed to strengthen cooperation between the Commission and the Member States in sport in a few priority areas, including the promotion of HEPA. In July 2012,\r\nthe Expert Group on Sport, Health and Participation expressed support for a new\r\nUnion initiative to promote HEPA.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council conclusions of 27 November 2012\r\non promoting HEPA acknowledged the need for further action at Union level and\r\ncalled on the Commission to present a proposal for a Council Recommendation, including\r\na light monitoring framework based on a set of indicators covering the thematic\r\nareas of the EU Physical Activity Guidelines.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS RECOMMENDATION:\n(1)                   \r\nMember States should:\n\u2013              \r\nWork towards effective HEPA policies by developing a\r\ncross-sectoral approach involving policy areas including sport, health,\r\neducation, environment and transport, as described in the EU Physical Activity\r\nGuidelines, and in accordance with national specificities. This should include:\n\u2013              \r\nthe adoption of a national strategy on HEPA\r\npromotion, taking into account different groups of society and respecting the\r\nprinciples of non-discrimination and equality between men and women;\n\u2013              \r\nthe adoption of a corresponding action plan;\n\u2013              \r\nMonitor\r\nphysical activity levels and HEPA policies by making use of the light\r\nmonitoring framework[37] and indicators set out in\r\nthe Annex to this Recommendation according to national circumstances;\n\u2013              \r\nWithin\r\nsix months from the adoption of this Recommendation, appoint national HEPA focal\r\npoints who will support the abovementioned monitoring framework, and inform the\r\nCommission of their appointment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\nThe national HEPA focal points will in particular be tasked to coordinate the process of making data on physical activity available\r\nfor the monitoring framework; data should feed into the existing WHO database\r\non nutrition and physical activity (NOPA); they should also facilitate\r\ninterdepartmental cooperation on HEPA policies;\n\u2013              \r\nCooperate\r\nclosely among themselves and with the Commission by engaging in a process of\r\nregular exchange of information and best practices on HEPA promotion in the\r\nrelevant Union level structures for sport and for health as a basis for\r\nstrengthened policy coordination. \n(2)                   \r\nThe Commission\r\nshould take the following measures:\n\u2013              \r\nAssist Member States in adopting national strategies,\r\ndeveloping cross-sectoral HEPA policy approaches and implementing corresponding\r\naction plans by facilitating the exchange of information and good practice,\r\neffective peer-learning, networking and identification of successful approaches\r\nto HEPA promotion;\n\u2013              \r\nPromote the establishment and functioning of the HEPA\r\nmonitoring framework, based on existing forms of monitoring and data collection\r\nin this field, by:\n\u2013              \r\nproviding, with the help of scientific experts,\r\ntargeted support for capacity building and training to national HEPA focal points, and, as appropriate, to other representatives from relevant public\r\nauthorities;\n\u2013              \r\nexamining the possibility to use data collected\r\nto potentially produce European statistics[38]\r\non physical activity levels every two years;\n\u2013              \r\nsupporting the WHO in further developing the\r\nphysical activity aspects of the NOPA database by adapting it to the monitoring\r\nframework set out in the Annex to this Recommendation;\n\u2013              \r\nsupporting and closely cooperating with the WHO\r\nin the preparation and issuing of country-specific overviews on HEPA and\r\nanalysis of HEPA trends;\n\u2013              \r\nReport every three years on progress in implementing\r\nthis Recommendation, on the basis of information provided within the reporting\r\narrangements set out in the monitoring framework and of other relevant\r\ninformation about HEPA policy development and implementation provided by Member\r\nStates;\n\u2013              \r\nCarry\r\nout an evaluation of the implementation of the Council Recommendation after six\r\nyears.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nANNEX\nProposed\r\nindicators to evaluate the implementation of the EU Physical Activity\r\nGuidelines (GL)\n Thematic areas of the GL || Proposed indicators \n International PA recommendations and guidelines (GL 1-2) || 1.
