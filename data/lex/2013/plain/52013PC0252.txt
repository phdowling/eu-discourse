Agreement between the United States of America and the European Community on cooperation in the regulation of civil aviation safety, concerning the Decision N\u00b0 0004 amending Annex 1 to the Agreement /* COM/2013/0252 final - 2013/0132 (NLE) */\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONTEXT\nOF THE PROPOSAL\n1.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Background\nIn 2007, the U.S. aviation industry raised concerns that\nthe EU rules on the fees and charges levied by the European\nAviation Safety Agency (EASA) do not differentiate\nbetween European certification projects and EASA validation of Federal Aviation\nAdministration (FAA) approvals of U.S. products.\nFollowing several exchanges on this issue, the European Commission\n(EC) eventually agreed that EASA fees for validation would be discussed pursuant\nto the Agreement between the United States of America and the European Community\non cooperation in the regulation of civil aviation safety (the \u201cAgreement\u201d). \nThe Bilateral Oversight\nBoard (BOB) agreed at its June 2011 meeting to address the fees charged by EASA\nto U.S. applicants for validation of FAA approvals under the terms of Annex 1\nof the Agreement.\u00a0 Consequently the Terms of Reference\nestablishing the formation of a Validation Fees Team (VFT) was approved at the\nBOB meeting on December 11, 2011.\nThe VFT, composed\nof representation from the FAA, the EC and EASA, was tasked by the BOB to\nreview the current EASA process and methods for setting fees and charges as\napplied to validation of U.S. products and to develop recommendations regarding\namendments to the Agreement which will address the issues associated with EASA\nfees for validation of U.S. products.\u00a0 \n1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nUnderstanding the EASA Fees and Charges system\nAll fees charged\nby EASA are mandated by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 593/2007 (as amended)\nthat establishes the fees and charges which are to be levied by EASA for all\ncertification tasks. \nThis Regulation\nidentifies the exact fees that are to be charged for each certificate (annually\nfor multi-year projects) and approval, as well as an hourly rate for certain\ntasks that are charged by the hour.\u00a0 All tasks related to certification of\nproducts, parts and appliances (including approval of data for repairs, etc.)\nas well as activities related to the approval of organizations (including\ndesign organizations, production organizations, maintenance organizations,\netc.) must be fully covered from the applicants requesting these certificates/approvals.\u00a0\nAdditionally, EASA\u2019s costs related to the continued airworthiness of these products,\nparts and appliances as well as the costs related to the oversight of approved organizations\nmust also be fully covered and are addressed in this same Regulation.\nThe fees in Regulation\n(EC) No. 593/2007 are adjusted by a factor on an annual basis to account for\ninflation. \u00a0Further, to ensure that fees continue to offset EASA\u2019s costs, those\nfees are subject to periodic reviews and may be revised as necessary by the Commission in accordance with the\nregulatory procedure with scrutiny.\u00a0 Fees are developed and updated using a combination\nof real certification activity data and costs incurred in the past and business\nplan data for future developments.\u00a0 Based on these data, hourly rates and\napplicable flat fees are calculated.\u00a0 This method allows for both increases or reductions\nof fees if justified by the supporting data.\n1.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nApplication of a reduction factor in the Agreement\nDuring the VFT\ndiscussions, it became apparent that both EASA and the FAA have not fully\ninternalized the Agreement.\u00a0 Even though both Technical Agents are working to a\ncommon set of validation principles, which are meant to represent the intent\nand spirit of the Agreement, it is evident that, in reality, the full benefits\nof the Agreement are not being realized.\nThe EASA fee\nschedules do give special consideration to non-EU certificate activity in some\nareas.\u00a0 For example, Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) that are classified\nas \u201cbasic\u201d are charged as simple STCs regardless of the complexity of the\ndesign change.\u00a0 Also the fees for activities associated with the continued\nairworthiness of a non-EU certificate are charged at a reduced rate. \u00a0In the\narea of organization approvals accepted, Part 145 approvals are also subject to\nreduced fees.\nNevertheless,\nRegulation (EC) No 593/2007 mandates that EASA collect fees that reflect its total\ncertification costs. \u00a0For certificates and approvals, fees are computed primarily\nusing historical data of resource engagement in similar projects in combination\nwith business plan data. \u00a0Based on this method, it is not possible for EASA to\ngive any special consideration to its bilateral partners, including the United States, in the fees and charges regulation itself. \u00a0If there is to be special\nconsideration which transcends this regulation, it must be granted through a\nsuperseding regulation or through an international treaty which takes\nprecedence over the regulation.\u00a0 \nOn this basis,\nand in order to align more fully with the intent of Article 14 of the Agreement, which states that fees\nshould be just, reasonable and commensurate with the\nservices, the VFT has agreed and recommended a decision from the BOB to apply a\nreduction factor to the relevant fee tables in Regulation (EC) No 593/2007 to\naccount for the efficiencies of the validation process in the Agreement.\u00a0 This\nreduction factor would be incorporated into the provisions of Annex 1 to\nprovide the needed derogation from Regulation (EC) No 593/2007 via the\nAgreement.\n1.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nProcedural aspects\nThe relevant Council Decision and the\nAgreement entered into force on 1 May 2011 following the notification by the\nParties that their respective internal procedures necessary for its entry into\nforce had been completed.\nArticle 218(9) of\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishes that the\nCouncil, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt a decision establishing\nthe positions to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf in a body set up by an\nagreement, when that body is called upon to adopt acts having legal effects.\nArticle 4.4 of\nCouncil Decision 2011/719/EU[1]\nconcerning the conclusion of the Agreement \u00a0between the United States of America and the European Community on cooperation in the regulation of\ncivil aviation safety establishes that the Council shall decide on amendments\nto Annexes to the Agreement when they entail any modification to relevant Union\nlegal acts.\nAs such, a\nCouncil Decision on the position to be taken by the EU within the Bilateral\nOversight Board on the Decision to amend Annex 1 to the Agreement as per the\ndraft Decision 0004 annexed to the proposed Council Decision. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nMember States were regularly informed throughout\nprogress of the work.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of the proposed\naction\nThe proposed amendment of Annex 1 to the\nAgreement will introduce a reduction factor applicable to EASA levied Fees and\nCharges in the context of the validation of U.S. (aviation) products, thus reflecting the spirit and benefits\nto be attained from the Agreement. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nArticle 100(2) in conjunction with Article 218(9)\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle\nThe agreement covers issues where the EU\nhas competence and where relations with United States of America need to be\nmaintained at the EU level.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact on existing EU\nlegislation\nUnder the current provisions of Regulation\n(EC) No 593/2007 no distinction is made between EASA Fees and Charges levied\nfor (European) certification projects as opposed to the validation of products\nemanating from 3rd countries with whom the EU has a bilateral\naviation safety agreement. A critical element of these agreements, being the\nproduct of mutual trust and recognition of the equivalent level of safety of\nthe respective parties' systems, are the efficiency gains to result from\nrelying on the work processes and outcomes of the other party, the result of\nwhich is a decrease in workload and associated costs when carrying out a\nvalidation.\nThe legal impact of introducing the envisaged\nreduction factor in Annex 1 to the Agreement will, by virtue of the status of\nthe Agreement as an International Treaty, be that such provisions will have\nprecedence over current provisions in Regulation (EC) 593/2007. In order for\nthis provision to become applicable not solely as a result of the (EU/US)\nAgreement, a dedicated provision will need to be included in Regulation (EC) 593/2007,\na process that is ongoing at the time of writing.\nAs for likely budgetary implications,\nplease refer to point 4 below.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nAn estimated deficit in EASA Fees and\nCharges revenue resulting from the entry into force of this amendment to Annex\n1 to the Agreement would amount to approximately \u20ac450.000 that will fully be\ncovered by redeployment within the Fees and Charges budget of the Agency.\n2013/0132 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be taken by the\nEuropean Union within the
