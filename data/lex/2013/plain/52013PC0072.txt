The Commission had in its disposal sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and the parts thereof were being circumvented by means of transhipment via Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. The attached proposal for a Council Implementing Regulation is based on the findings of the investigation, which has confirmed that transhipment of certain Chinese-origin stainless steel fasteners was taking place via the Philippines and that all other criteria for the establishment of circumvention as set out in Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation are met. It is therefore proposed to extend the anti-dumping measures in force on certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the PRC to imports of the same product consigned from the Philippines. The duty corresponds to the country-wide duty on imports of certain stainless steel fasternes and part thereof from the PRC (27,4%). The duty shall be levied from the date of initiation of the investigation. Three Filipian companies came forward following the initiation, with a request for exemption from the possible extension of the measures as genuine producers in the Philippines. It is proposed to grant the exemption to two of them. The exemption request of the third company was rejected as during the investigation it was found that it was not a producer or exporter of the product concerned. At the same time findings of the investigation has not confirmed that transhipment of certain Chinese-origin stainless steel fasteners was taking place via Malaysia and Thailand. It is therefore proposed to terminate the investigation with regard to these two countries. The relevant Council Regulation should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union no later than 13 March 2013. \n Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community and in particular Article 13 thereof. \n Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n Indication of how the financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n Choice of instruments \n Proposed instruments: Regulation. \n Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The above-mentioned basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the\nUnion budget.\n2013/0046 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION \nextending the definitive anti-dumping duty\nimposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2/2012 on imports of\ncertain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the People's\nRepublic of China to imports of certain stainless steel fasteners consigned\nfrom the Philippines, whether declared as originating in the Philippines or not\nand terminating the investigation concerning possible circumvention of\nanti-dumping measures imposed by that regulation by imports of certain\nstainless steel fasteners and parts thereof consigned from Malaysia and\nThailand, whether declared as originating in Malaysia and Thailand or not\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[1]\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Article 13 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing measures\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation\n(EU) No 2/2012[2] the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 24,7% on\nimports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (\u2018the PRC\u2019) for all other companies than the\nones mentioned in Article 1(2) of that Regulation, following the expiry review\nof the measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/2005[3] ('the original Regulation'). These measures will hereinafter be\nreferred to as 'the measures in force' or 'original measures' and the\ninvestigation that led to the measures imposed by the original Regulation will\nbe hereinafter referred to as 'the original investigation'.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined, after\nconsulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient prima facie evidence\nexisted for the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Articles 13(3) and\n14(5) of the basic Regulation, the European Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) has\ndecided, to investigate on its own initiative the possible circumvention of the\nanti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain stainless steel fasteners\nand parts thereof originating in the PRC and to make imports of certain\nstainless steel fasteners and parts thereof consigned from Malaysia, Thailand\nand the Philippines, whether declared as originating in Malaysia, Thailand and\nthe Philippines or not, subject to registration.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation was initiated on 15 June 2012 by Commission Regulation (EU) No 502/2012[4] (\u2018the initiating Regulation\u2019).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The prima facie\nevidence at the Commission's disposal was that following the imposition of the\nmeasures established in the original investigation a significant change in the\npattern of trade involving exports from the PRC, Malaysia, Thailand and the\nPhilippines to the Union occurred, for which there was no sufficient due cause\nor justification other than the imposition of the measures established in the\noriginal investigation. This change stemmed allegedly from the\ntranshipment of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating\nin the PRC via Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines to the Union.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the evidence\npointed to the fact that the remedial effects of the measures in force were\nbeing undermined both in terms of quantity and price. The evidence showed that\nthese increased imports from Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines were made\nat prices below the non-injurious price established in the original\ninvestigation, adjusted for the increase in the costs of the raw material.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, there was\nevidence that the prices of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof\nconsigned from Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines were dumped in relation\nto the normal value previously established during the original investigation,\nadjusted for the increase in the costs of the raw material.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the authorities of the PRC, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, the\nexporting producers in those countries, the importers in the Union known to be\nconcerned and the Union industry of the initiation of the investigation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exemption forms were sent\nto the producers/exporters in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines known to\nthe Commission or through the Missions of the countries concerned to the\nEuropean Union. Questionnaires were sent to the producers/exporters in the PRC\nknown to the Commission or through the Mission of the PRC to the European\nUnion. Questionnaires were also sent to the known importers in the Union.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties were\ngiven the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a\nhearing within the time limit set in the initiating Regulation. All parties were informed that non-cooperation\nmight lead to the application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation and to\nfindings being based on the facts available.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seven Malaysian, six Thai\nand three Filipino producers/exporters and their related companies in the PRC, where\napplicable, have submitted replies to the exemption forms. Submissions of two\nMalaysian, one Thai and one Filipino companies were rejected due to formal reasons\nas the companies in question were either found not to be producers of the\nproduct under investigation or they failed to cooperate after the submission of\nthe exemption form or the exemption form was submitted in a very late stage of\nthe investigation.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The questionnaire replies\nwere submitted by two Chinese exporters and four Union importers/groups of\nimporters.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission carried out\nthe verification visits at the premises of the following companies:\n\u2013              \nMCP Precision Sdn.

In this case Eurostat data was used\nto determine overall import volumes from the Philippines to the Union and\nChinese export statistics were used for the determination of the overall\nexports from the PRC to the Phillipines.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the Chinese\nexport statistics it should be noted that statistics of trade flows between the\nPRC and the Philippines cover whole HS codes that is a larger product group\nthen the product concerned and the product under investigation. However, taking\ninto account the very clear trend that existed, these data can be used to\nestablish a change in pattern of trade.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, as an additional\nsource of information the data provided by the Filipino authorities were used.\nAlthough these data were not complete and detailed enough to be a sole basis for\nthe analysys they were suitable to cross-check findings with regard to the\npattern of trade.\n2.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change in\nthe pattern of trade\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the imposition of the\noriginal measures on the imports from the PRC, imports into the Union of the\nproduct under investigation from the Philippines increased suddenly and markedly.\nFrom the minimal level of below 100 MT yearly in 2004-2005 it raised to more\nthan 12 thousand MT in the RP.\n   || 2004 || 2005 || 2006 || 2007 || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RP \n Volume (MT) || 69 || 23 || 1 369 || 6 048 || 7 046 || 5 406 || 15 580 || 14 528 || 12 075 \nSource: Eurostat\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time exports\nfrom China to the Philippines were increasing sharply in the years 2004-RP from\n1.1 thousand MT to more than 15\nthousand MT. \n   || 2004 || 2005 || 2006 || 2007 || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RP \n Volume (MT)   || 1104 || 2022 || 2107 || 3727 || 3856 || 7513 || 11262 || 15553 || 15632   \nSource: Chinese export statistics (Global\nTrade Atlas Database)\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The data clearly show that imports\nfrom the Philippines into the Union were negligible in 2004 and 2005. However,\nin 2006, following the imposition of the measures on the PRC, the imports\nsurged suddenly and partly replaced the exports from the PRC on the Union\nmarket in terms of volume. Moreover, since the imposition of the measures in\nforce, the decrease of the exports from the PRC to the Union has been\nsignificant (70%). Furthermore, it is noted that the data received from the\nFilipino authorities confirm that only small percentage of imports from the PRC\nwas released for trade in the Filipino custom territory. Most of the import was\ndirected to the special economic zones. \n2.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nature of the circumvention\npractice\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 13(1) of the basic\nRegulation requires that the change in the pattern of trade stems from a\npractice, process or work for which there is insufficient due cause or economic\njustification other than the imposition of the duty. The practice, process or\nwork includes, inter alia, the consignment of the product subject to\nmeasures via third countries.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is noted that Filipino\nexports of the cooperating companies amounted to some 10% of the total Filipino\nexports to the Union in the RP. The remaining exports can be attributed to the\nproducers that have not cooperated with the investigation or by pure\ntranshipment practises. The latter conclusion is supported by the information\nand data provided by the Filipino authorities, in particular the facts that i)\nmost of the imports from the PRC of the product concerned was directed to\nspecial economic zones and did not enter the Filipino custom territories, ii)\nthe number of genuine producers of the product under investigation in the\nPhilippines is very limited.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nexistence of transhipment of Chinese-origin products via the Philippines was\ntherefore confirmed.\n2.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Insufficient due cause or economic\njustification other than the imposition of the anti-dumping duty\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation did not\nbring to light any other due cause or economic justification for the\ntranshipment than the avoidance of the measures in force on the product\nconcerned. No elements were found, other than the duty, which could be\nconsidered as a compensation for the costs of transhipment, in particular\nregarding transport and reloading, of certain stainless steel fasteners and\nparts thereof originating in the PRC via the Philippines.\n2.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Undermining of the remedial\neffect of the anti-dumping duty \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To assess whether the\nimported product under investigation had, in terms of quantities and prices,\nundermined the remedial effects of the measures in force on imports of the\nproduct concerned, Eurostat data was used as the best data available concerning\nquantities and prices of exports by the non-cooperating companies in the\nPhilippines. The prices so determined were compared to the injury elimination\nlevel established for Union producers in the original investigation. Given the substantial\ntime difference between the original IP and the RP in the present\ninvestigation, the significant developments in the basic elements of costs of\nproduction had to be taken into account. This was reflected in the adjustement\nof the non-injurious price on the basis of the increase in the price of the\nbasic raw-materials and, for the remaining elements of costs of manufacturing\nand sales, on the basis of the variation in the consumer price index in the\nUnion. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The increase of imports\nfrom the Philippines to the Union from below 100 MT in 2004 to over 12 thousand\nMT in the RP was considered to be significant in terms of quantities.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the adjusted\ninjury elimination level and the weighted average export price showed\nunderselling. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was therefore concluded\nthat the remedial effects of the measures in force are being undermined in\nterms of both quantities and prices.\n2.3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evidence of dumping\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, in accordance with\nArticle 13(1) of the basic Regulation it was examined whether there was\nevidence of dumping in relation to the normal value established in the original\ninvestigation. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the original Regulation\nthe normal value was established on the basis of prices in Taiwan, which in\nthat investigation was found to be an appropriate market economy analogue\ncountry for the PRC. However, given the substantial time difference between the\noriginal IP and the RP in the present investigation, the siginificant developments\nin the basic elements of costs of production had to be taken into account. This\nwas relflected in the adjustement of the normal value on the basis of the\nincrease in the price of the basic raw-materials and, for the remaining\nelements of costs of manufacturing and sales, on the basis of the variation in\nthe consumer price index in Taiwan. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The export price from the\nPhilippines was based on facts available, i.e. on the average export price of\ncertain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof during the RP as reported\nin Eurostat. The use of facts available was due to the minimal level of\ncooperation by producers of the product under investigation in the Philippines.\nThe average export price used for the calculation was cross-checked with the\nlevel of export prices of the two cooperating Filipino exporters and it\nappeared to be compatible with them. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of a fair\ncomparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance, in the\nform of adjustments, was made for differences which affect prices and price\ncomparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.\nAccordingly, adjustments were made for differences in transport, insurance and\nfor non-refundable VAT on export sales in the PRC. Given that there was limited\ncooperation from the producers in the Philippines and the PRC, the adjustments\nhad to be established on the basis of the best facts available. Thus, the\nadjustments for transport and insurance were based on per tonne transport and\ninsurance cost established in the original investigation.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation, dumping was calculated by comparing adjusted\nweighted average normal value as established in the original Regulation and the\ncorresponding weighted average export prices of the Filipino import during this\ninvestigation\u2019s RP, expressed as a percentage of the CIF price at the Union\nfrontier duty unpaid.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the\nweighted average normal value and the weighted average export price as established\nshowed dumping.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Findings with regard to\nMalaysia\n2.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Level of cooperation\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in recital (10)\nabove, seven Malaysian companies submitted exemption form replies. One of these\ncompanies appeared not to be the producer of the product under investigation,\nwhile the other submitted its incomplete reply in the late stage of the investigation\nwhich made it impossible to supplement deficiences and verify the submitted\ninformation and data. Therefore, these two exemption form replies had to be disregarded.\nNevertheless, the remaining five cooperating Malaysian companies represented 93%\nof the Malaysian exports of the product under investigation to the Union in the\nRP.\n2.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change in pattern of trade\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the imposition of the\noriginal measures on the imports from the PRC, imports into the Union of the\nproduct under investigation from Malaysia was increasing steadily. From the\nlevel of below 2 thousand MT yearly in 2004-2005 it raised to more than 13\nthousand MT in the RP.\n   || 2004 || 2005 || 2006 || 2007 || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RP \n Volume (MT) || 1 701 || 1 849 || 7 930 || 13 548 || 13 712 || 9 809 || 9 615 || 13 498 || 13 363 \nSource: Eurostat\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, it should be\nstressed that following the verification visits it was confirmed that this\nincrease in Malaysian exports to the Union can be explained by the increase of\ngenuine production in Malaysia over the same period. Cooperating companies,\nwhich were found to be Malaysian producers not involved in the circumvention\npractices, represent 93% of the export to the Union. The investigation revealed\nthat only one of these companies was transhipping the product concerned but\nthis practice concerned small part of its sales and ended in 2009. None of the\ncooperating companies was also found to be involved in the assembling\noperations where the Chinese-origin parts or semi-products would be used.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\nabove it is concluded that increased imports from Malaysia are justified by\nincrease in the domestic production. Therefore, the change in the pattern of\ntrade between Malaysia and the Union does not result from circumvention\npractices.\n2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Findings with regard to\nThailand\n2.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Level of cooperation\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in recital (10)\nabove, six Thai companies submitted exemption form replies. One of these\ncompanies failed to cooperate in the further procedure which made it impossible\nto supplement deficiences and held on spot verification of the submitted\ninformation and data. Therefore, this exemption form reply was disregarded.\nNevertheless, the remaining five cooperating Thai companies represented 67% of\nthe Thai exports of the product under investigation to the Union in the RP.\n2.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change in the pattern of\ntrade\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the imposition of the\noriginal measures on the imports from the PRC, imports into the Union of the\nproduct under investigation from Thailand showed the following trend:\n   || 2004 || 2005 || 2006 || 2007 || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RP \n Volume (MT) || 5 373 || 3 308 || 1 290 || 850 || 453 || 128 || 367 || 5 546 || 6 715 \nSource: Eurostat\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analyses of the exports\nfrom Thailand into the Union have to be made against the background of the fact\nthat from November 2005 on Thailand, like the PRC, was subject to the Union anti-dumping\nmeasures[5].\nThese measures lapsed in November 2010. Following that, there was a sharp\nincrease in Thai exports to the Union \u2013 from 367 MT in 2010 to more than 5.5\nthousand MT in 2011 and more than 6.7 thousand MT in the RP.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, it should be noted\nthat the Thai exports of the product under investigation to the Union in the RP\nare in absolute terms not much higher than in 2004 before the anti-dumping\nmeasures were imposed on the PRC and Thailand. In relative terms (as share in\nthe total Union imports) imports from Thailand even dropped from almost 12% to\n7%.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation did not\nreveal any transhipping or assembling operations where the Chinese-origin parts\nor semi-products would be used. Taking into account the fact that before the\nimposition of anti-dumping measures the exports from Thailand were definitely\nof genuine Thai production it is difficult to conclude that the current level\nof export which is similar in volume would have different origin. It should be\nalso stressed that the two biggest Thai producers cooperating in this\ninvestigation were also present in the original investigation against Thailand.\n\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\nabove it is concluded that increased imports from Thailand are to a large\nextent justified by domestic production. Therefore, the change in the pattern\nof trade between Thailand and the Union does not result from circumvention\npractices.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MEASURES\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the above, it was\nconcluded that the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of certain stainless\nsteel fasteners and the parts thereof originating in the PRC was circumvented\nby transhipment via the Philippines within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the\nbasic Regulation.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nfirst sentence of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, the measures in force\non imports of the product concerned, should be extended to imports of the product\nunder investigation, i.e. the same product but consigned from the Philippines,\nwhether declared as originating in the Philippines or not.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the low level\nof the cooperation in this investigation, the measures to be extended should be\nthe measures established in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 2/2012 for\n\"all other companies\" from the PRC, which is presently a definitive\nanti-dumping duty of 27,4% applicable to the net, free-at-Union-frontier price,\nbefore duty.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, which provide that any extended\nmeasure should apply to imports which entered the Union under registration\nimposed by the initiating Regulation, duties should be collected on those\nregistered imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof consigned\nfrom the Philippines.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 TERMINATION OF THE\nINVESTIGATION IN RESPECT OF IMPORTS FROM MALAYSIA AND THAILAND\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the findings\nregarding Malaysia and Thailand, the investigation concerning possible\ncircumvention of anti-dmping measures by imports of certain stainless steel\nfasteners and parts thereof consigned from Malaysia and Thailand should be\nterminated and the registration of imports of certain stainless steel fasteners\nand parts thereof consigned from Malaysia and Thailand, introduced by the initiating\nRegulation, should be discontinued.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As explained in the recital\n(10), 16 companies located in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines submitted\nexemption form responses requesting an exemption from the possible extended\nmeasures in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nexemption requests of the Malaysian and Thai companies were not assessed as the\nmeasures are not extended on these two countries.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the three Filipino\ncompanies requesting exemption was found not to produce and export the product under\ninvestigation during the IP and no conclusions could be drawn as to the nature\nof its operations. Therefore, an exemption to this company can not be granted\nat this stage. However, should it appear, after extension of the anti-dumping\nmeasures in force, that the conditions in Article 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic\nRegulation are fulfilled, the company may request a review of its situation.\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe verification visits it was confirmed that the\nremaining two Filipino exporting producers were genuine. It is therefore\nconcluded that they were not engaged in circumvention practices and therefore\nexemptions to these companies can be granted.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is considered that\nspecial measures are needed in this case in order to ensure the proper\napplication of such exemptions. These special measures are the requirement of\nthe presentation to the customs authorities of the Member States of a valid\ncommercial invoice, which shall conform to the requirements set out in the\nAnnex to this Regulation. Imports not accompanied by such an invoice shall be\nmade subject to the extended anti-dumping duty. \n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other Filipino producers which did not come forward in this\nproceeding and did not export the product under investigation during the IP,\nwhich intend to lodge a request for an exemption from the extended anti-dumping\nduty pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic Regulation will be\nrequired to complete an exemption form in order to enable the Commission to\nassess such a request. The Commission would normally also carry out an on-spot\nverification visit. Provided that the conditions set in Articles 11(4) and\n13(4) of the basic Regulation are met, an exemption may be warranted. Where an\nexemption is warranted, the Commission may, after consultation of the Advisory\nCommittee, authorise by decision, the exemption of imports from companies which\ndo not circumvent the anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EU) No\n2/2012, from the duty extended by this regulation.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DISCLOSURE\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All interested parties were\ninformed of the essential facts and considerations leading to the above\nconclusions and were invited to comment.
