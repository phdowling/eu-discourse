As the technological\r\npotential for emissions reduction is limited in the aviation sector,\r\nmarket-based measures (MBMs) allow aviation to contribute to emission\r\nreductions by the airlines offsetting their strong emission growth through funding\r\nemission reductions in other sectors.\nThe suitability of MBMs for international\r\naviation has long been recognised. The 2001 ICAO Assembly endorsed the\r\napplication of open emissions trading systems to international aviation.\r\nFollowing the ICAO's 2004 endorsement of regional MBMs, the EU led the way by\r\nincluding aviation in its Emission Trading System (EU ETS). Despite its positive\r\nenvironmental effects at low economic costs, the implementation of the EU ETS\r\nhas had to face significant international opposition (e.g. allegations that\r\nregulating emissions from airlines based outside the EU would violate the\r\nsovereignty of third states). The European Court of Justice has, however,\r\ndismissed appeals by foreign airlines in this respect and confirmed the\r\nlegality of the EU ETS[1].\nAt the same time, the integration of\r\naviation into the EU ETS has been decisive in driving forward ICAO discussions.\r\nThe intensive engagement of the EU in tackling climate change has been crucial\r\nin generating momentum in ICAO towards global action for addressing aviation\r\nemissions. Clearly, given the EU ETS would only ever cover a proportion of\r\ninternational aviation emissions, the overall strong global growth of these\r\nemissions will continue if no MBM is implemented on a global level, and\r\nemission reduction goals will remain aspirational.\nThe 2013 38th ICAO Assembly has now\r\ndecided on the development of a global MBM to be finalised at the next ICAO\r\nAssembly in 2016 and to be implemented by 2020. Progress was not made on a \"framework\"\r\nfor national/ regional MBMs up to 2020, as in particular the Assembly\r\nresolution repeated the same language as from the 2007 and 2010 Assemblies and\r\nthe European States confirmed their position on the 2007 and 2010 Assembly\r\nresolutions as concerns so-called 'mutual agreement'. In response to this progress on a global MBM and\r\nto promote further momentum, the Commission considers\r\nit appropriate to propose lowering the proportion of emissions to which the EU\r\nemissions trading system should apply up to 2020, as the further action already\r\nenvisaged in Decision No. 377/2013/EU.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultations on aviation's inclusion in the EU ETS began in\r\nSeptember 2005 with the Communication ''Reducing the Climate Change Impact of\r\nAviation\", COM(2005)459, which led to the proposal of legislation in\r\nDecember 2006. Consultations with third countries on aviation and emissions\r\ntrading have taken place since then, both formally e.g. in the context of EU-US\r\nJoint Committee meetings and through bilateral and multilateral meetings. Most\r\nrecently, an online public consultation was held for 12 weeks from 21 June to\r\n13 September 2013. The public consultation was carried out using the \u201cGeneral\r\nprinciples and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties by the\r\nCommission\u201d, and it asked all stakeholders \u2013 including public authorities from\r\nthird countries \u2013 on their views concerning the scope of regional and global\r\nMBMs. The Commission will continue to engage in\r\nconstructive bilateral and multilateral contacts with third countries.\nThe public consultation confirms strong\r\nsupport for MBMs from public authorities, NGOs and the airlines. All\r\nrespondents favour MBMs for the aviation sector, with one association opposing\r\nregional MBMs in advance of a global MBM. With regard to regional action,\r\nairlines emphasise administrative simplicity and political\r\nacceptability, as well as environmental effectiveness and avoiding\r\ndiscrimination on routes and between operators. Public authorities and NGOs\r\nemphasise covering meaningful emissions, administrative simplicity and\r\npolitical acceptability.\nThe Impact Assessment has shown that\r\nadapting the EU ETS to accord with what was expected to be ICAO's MBM\r\nResolution for the period up to 2020 is feasible at low administrative costs.\r\nThe chief benefit from reducing the scope of the EU ETS up to 2020 is that,\r\nwith a global MBM applying from 2020 closing the global \"emission\r\ngap\", doubling coverage of international aviation emissions compared to\r\nthe EU ETS, and leading to a halving of these emissions by 2050, this will have\r\nsignificantly greater overall environmental benefits.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nIn line with the outcome of the 38th\r\nICAO Assembly held in September 2013, there should be a single global\r\nmarket-based measure (MBM) applying to international aviation emissions from\r\n2020 onwards. In response to this\r\nprogress and to promote further momentum towards the successful establishment\r\nof a global MBM, amendments should be made to the aviation activities covered\r\nby the EU ETS.\nThis proposal for a Directive follows on\r\nfrom the Decision No. 377/2013/EU, which was adopted in order to promote\r\nprogress on global action through ICAO. As with Decision No. 377/2013/EU, it is\r\nimportant that this proposal is agreed swiftly between the European Parliament\r\nand Council, so as to be in place for when the next allowance surrender\r\nobligations fall due on 30 April 2014. In the absence of a further agreed\r\nrevision, the ETS reverts to the position before the Decision No. 377/2013/EU. The\r\nkey features of the revised ETS system resulting from this proposal would be as\r\nfollows:\n\u2013                        \r\nFlights between aerodromes in the EEA remain\r\nfully covered, as under the original Directive and Decision No. 377/2013/EU.\n\u2013                        \r\nFlights to and from third countries which are\r\nnot developed countries and which emit less than 1% of global aviation\r\nemissions would be exempted. This would exclude routes to around 80 countries\r\non a non-discriminatory basis.\n\u2013                        \r\nFlights to and from third countries are\r\nresponsible for emissions taking place not beyond EEA countries, as from 2014.\r\nA simplified procedure is proposed to determine the relevant proportion of\r\nemissions of a given flight which is covered by the ETS. It is proposed that\r\noperators can choose between approaches to MRV methodology for compliance.\n\u2013                        \r\nOverflights of EEA countries are exempt, as are\r\nemissions from flights between airports in third countries and EEA airports as\r\nregards European dependencies and territories, and flights to and from EEA\r\nairports and those territories.\nWith effect from 2013 onwards, this act\r\nderogates from the ETS Directive in respect of a proportion of flight emissions\r\nto and from third countries. In 2013, this relates to\r\nall emissions from flights to and from countries outside the European\r\nEconomic Area (EEA). For each calendar year between 2014 to 2020, these proportions\r\nare set out in an Annex, and have been calculated by Eurocontrol on the basis\r\nof the proportion of the Great Circle Distance between the main airports in the\r\nEEA and in third countries, that is not more than 12 miles beyond the furthest point\r\nof EEA coastline. The percentages are low estimates of the actual climate\r\nchange impact from aircraft taking off and landing from aerodromes in the Union\r\nsince aviation also impacts on climate change from emissions of nitrogen\r\noxides, water vapour and sulphate and soot particles which have been estimated\r\nto have climate change effects of the same level as those from the carbon\r\ndioxide emissions, which have not been taken into account.\nThe process of applying percentages for\r\nflights to and from third countries is designed to be workable and pragmatic,\r\nusing existing reporting categories applicable since 2010. Working on the basis\r\nof country-pairs means that figures are needed for flights on the routes from\r\neach Member State to third countries. Where flights operate to multiple time\r\nzones in a third country, a percentage shall be included for each timezone to\r\nwhich flights operate. These percentages are developed based on best available\r\ninformation, including from Eurocontrol. A table containing all these\r\npercentages will be inserted in the Annex. \nTo provide further flexibility and\r\nalternative monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), it is proposed to\r\noffer a choice to operators. In respect of flights to and from third countries,\r\nan aircraft operator should be able to choose not to report verified emissions\r\nfrom these flights but instead to rely upon a determination of estimated\r\nemissions not beyond EEA Member countries from such flights that is as accurate\r\nas possible, based on Eurocontrol calculations of the\r\nprecise distance flown not beyond EEA countries. \nThe Member States will\r\nadjust allocations for the years 2013-2020 in accordance with the proportions\r\nset out in the Annex. The number of allowances auctioned by Member States will\r\nbe adjusted accordingly.\nAn additional\r\nsimplification proposed to the ETS Directive is to\r\nprovide that action not be taken against non-commercial aircraft operators in\r\nrespect of emissions from small aircraft operators emitting less than 1000\r\ntonnes CO2 per annum. This is expected to reduce the\r\nnumber of aircraft operators regulated by Member States by around 2200 representing\r\n0.2% of emissions. Alongside other measures being taken to simplify\r\nadminstration for small aircraft operators, this is a significant lightening of\r\nadminstrative tasks for aircraft operators and for Member States' competent\r\nauthorities, in line with the EU's better regulation agenda.\nAll other obligations in respect of flights\r\nremain unaffected. This limited approach has shown itself to be workable, as\r\nwas the case under Decision No. 377/2013/EU. Issuing additional free\r\nallocations to operators would undermine the emission reductions that the ETS\r\nwill bring, and carrying out a new benchmarking exercise would place\r\nsignificant requirements on aircraft operators and Member States when the\r\nglobal MBM is expected to apply in 7 years and, if not, new benchmarking would\r\nin any case take place in 2018 according to Article 3e of the ETS Directive.\nThe environmental benefit of this proposal\r\ncomes from two key elements: First, it gives impetus to the global MBM that\r\nwill cover the total emissions from international aviation from 2020 onwards.\r\nDepending on the ambition level agreed for the global MBM, total international\r\naviation emissions will be capped at their 2020 level and even be halved by\r\n2050 below 2005 levels. Second, the EU ETS will continue to achieve substantial\r\nemission reductions that are expected to be up to 250 million tons CO2 in the\r\nperiod from 2013 to 2020.\nIt should also be noted\r\nthat, in terms of administration a global MBM, States will need to enact\r\nnational provisions. After the 2016 ICAO Assembly, the ETS Directive should be\r\namended as appropriate to provide for the implementation of this global MBM. The global MBM to apply from 2020 onwards should, in terms of the\r\nrecognition of early action called for by IATA, take offsetting of emissions\r\noutside the aviation sector under the EU ETS into account, as well as emission\r\nreductions within the sector. Paragraph 26 of ICAO Resolution A38/17-2 calls\r\nfor these emission reductions to be reported to ICAO.\nThis\r\nproposal should be adopted by the European Parliament and Council early in\r\n2014, so as to provide legal certainty and clarity for aircraft operators who\r\nwould otherwise have to surrender allowances for their full emissions to and\r\nfrom third countries by 30 April 2014, as referred to in Directive 2003/87/EC.\n2013/0344 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Directive 2003/87/EC establishing\r\na scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community, in\r\nview of the implementation by 2020 of an international agreement applying a\r\nsingle global market-based measure to international aviation emissions\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1)\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[2],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[3],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union is endeavouring\r\nto secure a future international agreement to control greenhouse gas impacts\r\nfrom aviation and, in the meantime, is limiting climate change impacts from\r\naviation activities to and from aerodromes in the Union by autonomous action.\r\nIn order to ensure that these objectives are mutually supportive and not in\r\nconflict, it is appropriate to take account of developments at and positions\r\ntaken in international fora and in particular to take account of the Resolution\r\ncontaining the \"Consolidated statement of continuing ICAO policies and\r\npractices related to environmental protection\" adopted at the 38th\r\nsession of the Assembly of the International civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently it is\r\ndesirable to temporarily consider the requirements set out in Directive\r\n2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[4] as satisfied, when obligations\r\nare met in respect of a certain percentage of the emissions from flights to and\r\nfrom aerodromes in third countries. In doing so, the\r\nUnion emphasises that requirements can be applied in respect of certain\r\npercentages of emissions from flights to and from aerodromes in countries of\r\nthe European Economic Area (EEA), in the same manner as legal requirements can\r\nbe placed on more of the emissions from flights to and from such aerodromes.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the application of\r\nDirective 2003/87/EC continues to be based on arrival at or departure from\r\naerodromes in the Union, in order to be a simple and workable means to limit\r\nthe application of regional market-based measures for the 7 years until a\r\nglobal market-based measure begins operation, the percentages have been\r\ncalculated by Eurocontrol on the basis of the proportion of the Great Circle Distance\r\nbetween the main airports in the EEA and in third countries that is not more\r\nthan 12 miles beyond the furthest point of EEA coastline. Since the Union does\r\nnot consider that a global market-based measure should be based on actual\r\nairspace considerations, as compared to the arrival or departure from\r\naerodromes, the relevance of the percentages is limited to the period up to\r\n2020.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogations provided\r\nfor in this directive take into account the results of bilateral and\r\nmultilateral contacts with third countries, which the Commission will continue\r\nto pursue on behalf of the Union.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid\r\ndistortions of competition, it is important that all flights on the same route are\r\ntreated in the same way. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to establish a\r\npercentage of verified emissions for flights to and from aerodromes in third countries,\r\nwhole flight emissions have to be known. However, no account is being taken of\r\nemissions not covered by that percentage.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, in respect of\r\nflights to and from third countries, an aircraft operator should be able to\r\nchoose not to report verified emissions from these flights but instead to rely\r\nupon a determination of estimated emissions taking place not beyond EEA Member\r\ncountries from such flights that is as accurate as possible.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\na simplification and to in order to lighten administrative tasks for the\r\nsmallest aircraft operators, non-commercial aircraft operators emitting\r\nless than 1000 tonnes CO2 per annum should be considered as meeting the\r\nrequirements of the Directive, and additional measures\r\nby Member States' competent authorities should be facilitated to simplify\r\nadminstration for small aircraft operators.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The application of a\r\npercentage to verified emissions for flights to and from aerodromes in third\r\ncountries, or the use of an alternative approach by operators, should relate to\r\nemissions from 2014 onwards to give time for operators to understand these\r\napproaches when planning their flight activities,\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without prejudice to the\r\nglobal market-based measure applying from 2020, emissions from flights to and\r\nfrom countries which are developing countries and whose share of total revenue\r\nton kilometres of international civil aviation activities is less than 1%\r\nshould be exempted for the period 2014 to 2020. Countries considered to be\r\ndeveloping for the purposes of this proposal should be those which benefit at\r\nthe time of adoption of this proposal from preferential access to the Union\r\nmarket in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council, that is those which are not classified in 2013 by\r\nthe World Bank as high-income or upper-middle income countries. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure legal\r\ncertainty for aircraft operators and national authorities it is appropriate to allow\r\nuntil 2015 for the surrender and reporting deadlines for 2013 emissions.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the 2016 ICAO\r\nAssembly the Commission should submit a report to the European Parliament and\r\nto the Council in order to ensure that international developments can be taken\r\ninto account and any issues about the application of the derogation be addressed.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2003/87/EC should\r\nbe amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nDirective 2003/87/EC is hereby amended as\r\nfollows:\n(1)                   \r\nThe following Article 28a is inserted after\r\nArticle 28:\n\"Article 28a\r\nDerogations applicable in\r\nadvance of the implementation by 2020 of an international agreement applying a\r\nsingle global market-based measure\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of derogation from Article\r\n12(2a) and Article 14(3), Member States shall consider the requirements set out\r\nin those paragraphs satisfied in respect of:\n(a)         \r\nall emissions from flights to and from countries\r\noutside the European Economic Area in 2013;\n(b)         \r\nemissions from flights to and from countries\r\noutside the European Economic Area (EEA) in each calendar year between 2014 and\r\n2020 where the operator of such flights has surrendered\r\nallowances in respect of the percentages of their verified emissions from those\r\nflights listed in accordance with Annex IIc, or calculated in accordance with paragraph\r\n6;\n(c)         \r\nemissions from flights operated by a non-commercial\r\naircraft operator in each calendar year up to 2020\r\nwhere the emissions for which that aircraft operator are responsible in the\r\ncalendar year are less than 1000 tonnes;\n(d)         \r\nthe surrender of allowances corresponding to\r\nverified 2013 emissions from flights between countries in the EEA taking place\r\nby 30 April 2015 instead of 30 April 2014, and verified\r\n2013 emissions for those flights being reported by 31 March 2015 instead of 31\r\nMarch 2014. \nThe verified emissions referred to in paragraph\r\n1(b) calculated in accordance with Annex IIc shall be considered to be the\r\nverified emissions of the aircraft operator for the purposes of Articles 11a,\r\n12 and 14.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of derogation from\r\nArticle 3e(5) and Article 3f, an aircraft operator benefitting from the\r\nderogations provided for in paragraphs 1(a) to 1(c) shall be issued a number of\r\nfree allowances reduced in proportion to reduction of the surrender obligation\r\nprovided for in those paragraphs.\nAs regards activity in 2013 to 2020, Member\r\nStates shall publish the number of free aviation allowances allocated to each\r\noperator by [OP: insert a date 4 months after the entry into force of this Directive].\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of derogation fom\r\nArticle 3d, Member States shall auction a number of aviation allowances reduced\r\nin proportion to the reduction in the total number of allowances issued.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of derogation from\r\nArticle 3d(3), the number of allowances to be auctioned by each Member State in\r\nrespect of the period from 2013 to 2020 shall be reduced to correspond with its\r\nshare of attributed aviation emissions resulting from the application of Article\r\n28(a) to (c).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of derogation from\r\nArticles 3g, 12, 15 and 18a, where an aircraft operator has total annual emissions lower than 25000 tonnes, its emissions shall be considered to be verified emissions if determined using a\r\nsmall emitters tool approved by the Commission and populated by Eurocontrol\r\nwith data from its ETS support facility, and Member States may implement\r\nsimplified procedures for non-commercial aircraft operators as long as there is\r\nno less accuracy than such a tool provides.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of derogation from\r\nArticle 12(2a) and Article 14(3), for flights to and from countries outside the\r\nEEA, an aircraft operator may choose not to report emission data using the percentages\r\nin Annex IIc, in order that such emissions shall be calculated by the competent\r\nauthority.
