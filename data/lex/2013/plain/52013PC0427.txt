The scheme set out in the proposal\nwould allow for the import and export of rough diamonds from Greenland to the\nUnion as well as to other participants of the certification scheme, provided\nthat all imports and exports of rough diamonds are verified and, for exports,\ncertified by Union authorities pursuant to the rules set out in Regulation (EC)\nNo 2368/2002 implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme for the\ninternational trade in rough diamonds. \nThis association would strengthen economic\nrelations between the European Union and Greenland in the diamond industry, and\nin particular it would enable Greenland to export rough diamonds accompanied by\nthe European Union Certificate issued for the purposes of the certification\nscheme, with a view of promoting the economic development of Greenland.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nGreenland and Denmark has agreed to the approach\ntaken by the proposal and will undertake to transpose and implement in the\nlegislation applicable to Greenland the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC)\nNo 2368/2002 as regards the conditions and formalities for importing and\nexporting rough diamonds, their transit to a participant other than the Union,\nthe participation of the Union, including Greenland, in the Kimberley Process\ncertification scheme, obligations relating to due diligence,\nanti-circumvention, exchange of information, and ensuring compliance with such\nprovisions.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis of the proposal is Article\n207. The proposal extends the territory of the Union to also cover the territory of Greenland for the purposes of the Kimberley Process certification scheme.\nAccordingly, Greenland will be prohibited to accept imports or exports of rough\ndiamonds to or from outside of the territory of the Union without a valid\nKimberley Process (KP) certificate. The amendments will allow for the export of\nrough diamonds from Greenland to third countries as long as they are\naccompanied by an EU KP certificate. The conditions for certification\npreviously required evidence that the rough diamonds were lawfully imported\ninto the Union. For diamonds mined and extracted in Greenland that have never\nbeen exported before, an alternative condition is introduced by this proposal,\nnotably to demonstrate proof in this regard. \nIn addition, the proposal sets out the\nmodalities of submitting rough diamonds to Union authorities for verification,\nextends the special rules for transit to Greenland, enables Greenland's\nparticipation in the Committee for the implementation of the Regulation and\nenables Greenland's representation in the Kimberley Process and cooperation\nwith other Member States through the Commission.\nThe proposal is closely connected to a\nproposal for a Council Decision setting out specific rules for the circulation\nof rough diamonds between the Union and Greenland. As proposed in this Decision,\nthe main requirements for rough diamonds to enter or leave the territory of\nGreenland or the Union would be to (i) be accompanied by some form of an official\ndocument, either a document attesting that they were mined in Greenland, or a\ncopy of a Kimberley Process certificate as validated by a Union authority, and\n(ii) be in sealed tamper-resistant containers. \nAs proposed in this Decision, rough diamonds mined or extracted in\nGreenland, provided that they have not been exported previously to a third\ncountry, may enter the Union\u2019s customs territory by the use of an attesting\ndocument issued by authorities in Greenland. Once rough\ndiamonds mined or extracted in Greenland had been exported to a third country,\nupon their return they may circulate between the Union and Greenland according\nto the same rules that apply to all other rough diamonds imported into the Union.\nThe application of the Decision is proposed\nto align with the entry into force of this amendment. \n2013/0198 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\n2368/2002 as regards the inclusion of Greenland in implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n2368/2002 implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme for the\ninternational trade in rough diamonds[1]\nsets up a Community System of certification and import and export controls for\nrough diamonds for the purposes of implementing the Kimberley Process\ncertification scheme.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Greenland is not part of\nthe Union territory but it is included in the list of overseas countries and\nterritories set out in Annex II to the Treaties. In accordance with Article 198\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the purpose of the\nassociation of the overseas countries and territories with the Union is to\npromote the economic and social development of the overseas countries and\nterritories and to establish close economic relations between them and the Union as a whole.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision [...]\nsets out the rules and procedures enabling Greenland's participation in the\nKimberley Process certification scheme on rough diamonds through its\ncooperation with the European Union. This association would strengthen economic\nrelations between the European Union and Greenland in the diamond industry, and\nin particular it would enable Greenland to export rough diamonds accompanied by\nthe European Union Certificate issued for the purposes of the certification\nscheme, with a view to promoting the economic development of Greenland.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n2368/2002 should be amended in order to enable this Decision to enter into\nforce and in particular to provide for the inclusion of Greenland in the\ncertification scheme. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, Greenland will\nbe prohibited to accept imports or exports of rough diamonds to or from a\nparticipant other than the Union without a valid Kimberley Process certificate.\nThe amendments will allow for the export of rough diamonds from Greenland to third countries as long as they are accompanied by a European Union Kimberley\nProcess certificate. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To the existing condition\nfor certification requiring evidence that the rough diamonds were lawfully\nimported into the Union, an alternative condition should be introduced for\ndiamonds mined an extracted in Greenland that have never been exported before,\nnotably to demonstrate proof in this regard. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, amendments\nshould be made to the modalities of submitting rough diamonds to Union\nauthorities for verification, extending the special rules for transit to\nGreenland, enabling Greenland's participation in the Committee for the\nimplementation of the Regulation and providing for Greenland's representation\nin the Kimberley Process and cooperation with other Member States through the\nCommission.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n2368/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 2368/2002 is amended as\nfollows:\n(1)                   \nArticle 1 is replaced by the following:\n\"Article\n1\nThis Regulation sets up a Union system of\ncertification and import and export controls for rough diamonds for the\npurposes of implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme.\nFor the purposes of the certification scheme, the\nterritory of the Union and that of Greenland shall be considered as one entity\nwithout internal borders.\nThis Regulation does not prejudice or\nsubstitute any provisions in force relating to customs formalities and\ncontrols. \"\n(2)                   \nIn Article 3, the introductory phrase is\nreplaced by the following:\n\"The import of rough diamonds into the\nterritories of the Union or Greenland shall be prohibited unless all of the\nfollowing conditions are fulfilled:\"\n(3)                   \nIn Article 4, paragraph 1 is replaced by the\nfollowing:\n\"1.
