For Croatia, as for the previous 2004 and 2007 enlargements,\nthe so-called \"Schengen two-phase implementation process\" has been\nfollowed in matters related to the Schengen acquis (Article 4 of the Act\nconcerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Croatia and the\nadjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union is founded\n(hereinafter: the 2012 Act of Accession)). This implies that Croatia, as previous accession countries, has to apply, from the date of accession the\nprovisions of Regulation (EC) 539/2001[1]\nand thus, to subject third-country nationals listed in its Annex I to a visa\nrequirement.\nCroatia, as the countries who acceded to the\nEuropean Union in 2004 and 2007, has this obligation even if the persons\nconcerned hold a uniform visa, a long-stay visa or a residence permit issued by\na Schengen Member State, as indeed, other Schengen provisions will not apply to\nCroatia from the date of its accession, such as:\n-the Schengen mutual recognition rules laid\ndown in Articles 18 and 21 of the Schengen Implementing Convention[2] and in Article 5(4)(a) of\nRegulation (EC) No 562/2006\n(Schengen Borders Code)[3], according to which aliens who hold valid\nresidence permits or valid long-stay visas issued by one of the Schengen Member\nStates may move freely for short stays within the territories of the other\nMember States,\n- the provisions on\nuniform visas issued laid down in Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 810/2009\n(Visa Code)[4],\naccording to which uniform visas are valid for the entire territory of the Schengen\nMember States.\nIn addition, the national visas issued by\nother EU Member States, who are not Schengen Member States yet (Cyprus), are also not valid for the territory of Croatia.\nTo avoid imposing\nunnecessary administrative burdens on the countries who acceded to the European\nUnion in 2004 and 2007, by way of derogation from Regulation 539/2001, Decisions\nNo 895/2006/EC[5] and No 582/2008/EC[6] authorised the optional\nunilateral recognition by the new Member States not yet fully implementing the\nSchengen acquis of uniform visas, long-stay visas and residence permits issued\nby Schengen Member States as well as of national short-stay\nvisas, long-stay visas and residence permits issued by other Member States not\nyet fully implementing the Schengen acquis for the\npurpose of transit not exceeding five days. In addition,\nDecision No 896/2006/EC[7]\nauthorised new Member States to recognise residence permits issued by Switzerland and Liechtenstein who were not yet part of the Schengen area without internal borders for the purpose of transit not exceeding five days. \nPersons holding such\ndocuments have already passed a strict screening process by the issuing Schengen State and are not considered a threat to public policy or a risk in terms of\nillegal immigration by that State. Such a regime of unilateral recognition does\nnot affect the acceding countries\u2019 obligation to refuse entry of a person for\nwhom an alert has been issued in its national data base\nfor the purposes of refusing entry in accordance with\nArticle 5(1) of the Schengen Borders Code.\nSimilarly, by way of derogation from\nRegulation 539/2001, this proposal aims at introducing an optional regime based\non common rules authorising Croatia on a transitional basis until its full\napplication of the Schengen acquis to unilaterally recognise as\nequivalent to their national visas, uniform visas, long-stay visas and\nresidence permits issued by Schengen Member States, as well as similar\ndocuments issued by Member States not yet fully implementing the Schengen acquis\n(Cyprus). However this authorisation is not limited to the purpose of transit\nnot exceeding five days as in Decisions 895/2006 and 582/2008, but is valid for\nboth transit through or intended stays on its territory\nnot exceeding 90 days in any 180-day period. In fact, at\nthe time of the adoption of the aforementioned Decisions the then applicable\nCommon consular instructions on visas for the diplomatic missions and consular\nposts still foresaw the distinction between \"transit visas\" and\n\"short-stay\" visas. This distinction was abolished by Regulation (EC)\nNo 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing\na Community Code on Visas (Visa Code), so that the aforementioned limitation is\nnot appropriate anymore.\nThe above-mentioned previous transit\ndecisions adopted at the occasion of the last two EU enlargements dealt only\nwith uniform Schengen visas, i.e. visa allowing to circulate within the\nSchengen area. The visas with limited territorial validity (LTVs) were excluded\nfrom the scope of these previous decisions. However, currently the issue of\nKosovo* (as defined by the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10.06.1999.) not\nrecognised by all the Schengen States must be addressed. \nThere is an essential difference between visas\nwith limited territorial validity which in principle are only valid for the\nterritory of the issuing Member State, and such visas issued for the citizens\nof Kosovo (in accordance with Article 25 (3) first sentence of the Visa Code)\nwhich allow to circulate in all Schengen Member States except those few Member\nStates that do not recognise Kosovo. This specific characteristic justifies\nbringing these LTVs within the application of the regime of unilateral\nrecognition, also because in this case there is no real threat of irregular\nmigration or security risks for the Schengen area. \nThe extension of the unilateral recognition\nregime by a Union instrument would not impose any new obligations on Croatia in addition to those listed in the 2012 Act of Accession. It would thus not\nconstitute a derogation from this Accession Treaty. The proposed regime would\nbe implemented on an optional basis: Croatia would have the possibility either\nto implement the proposed regime or to continue issuing national visas as required\nby the Accession Treaty. Should Croatia opt for the implementation of the\ncommon regime, Croatia would have to accept the documents issued by any Schengen Member  State, thus avoiding any distinction as regards the issuing Member State.\nIn this context, it should be recalled that\nuntil the date of accession, on the basis of its national legislation, Croatia accepts valid Schengen visas, long stay visas and residence permits issued by\nSchengen States for entry and stay or transit through its territory.\nThe current proposal repeals No 895/2006/EC\nand No 582/2008/EC. With regard to those Member States to whom these decisions\nwere addressed who have meanwhile become Schengen Member States these Decisions\nhave become obsolete (all but Cyprus)[8].\nWith regard to Cyprus, which fully implements the common regime established by\nDecision No 895/2006/EC since 10 July 2006 and that established by Decision No\n582/2008/EC since 18 July 2008, the current proposal foresees that this regime\nshall be replaced by a regime that authorises Cyprus, like Croatia, to\nunilaterally recognise the short-stay visas, long-stay visas and residence\npermits issued by Schengen Member States as well as of national\nshort-term visas, long-term visas and resident permits issued by Member States\nnot yet fully implementing the Schengen acquis (Croatia) for transit through or intended stays on their territories not exceeding\n90 days in any 180-day period[9].\nThe current proposal foresees that Cyprus, like Croatia, is authorised to recognise visas and residence permits by the countries\nassociated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen\nacquis.\nThis regime will be applicable until the end\nof the transitional period and the full participation of the Member States\nconcerned in the area without internal borders, date from which the mutual\nrecognition of such documents becomes compulsory under Articles 18 and 21 of\nthe Schengen Implementing Convention, Article 5(2) of the Schengen Borders Code\nand the Visa Code.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nSummary\nThe main elements of this proposal can be\nsummarised as follows:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 common\nrules authorising Croatia and\nCyprus on a transitional basis to unilaterally recognise uniform visas,\nlong-stay visas, visas with limited territorial validity issued to citizens of\nKosovo in accordance with Article 25 (3) first sentence of the Visa Code and\nresidence permits issued by Schengen Member States as well as similar documents\nissued by each other as equivalent to its national visas for transit through or intended stays on its territory not exceeding 90\ndays in any 180-day period;\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nunilateral recognition regime introduced by the current proposal must be\nlimited to documents whose validity would cover the whole duration of the short\nstay in Croatia and Cyprus. In this context and having in mind the problems faced in the past (Decisions\n895/2006 and 582/2008) by third country nationals, holders of one entry uniform\nvisa when travelling back from their stay into the Schengen area with a visa\nwhich was not valid anymore, the current proposal should limit the unilateral\nrecognition regime to uniform visas authorising two or multiple entries into the Schengen area.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member\nStates addressed by this Decision have to communicate their decision on the use\nof the authorisation to the Commission. The Commission will publish this information in the Official\nJournal of the European Union and ensure in this way that the whole system\nis transparent;\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 repeal of\nDecision No 895/2006/EC and Decision No 582/2008/EC.\n* This designation\nis without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR\n1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence\"\nLegal basis\nThe proposed Decision is based on Article 77(2)(a)\nand (b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as it\nconstitutes a measure concerning the common policy on visas and other\nshort-stay residence permits as well as the checks to which persons crossing\nexternal borders are subject. This instrument will be adopted under the\nordinary legislative procedure.\nInsofar as the proposed decision should be\naddressed to Croatia, this proposal is subject to the entry into force of the\nTreaty between the Member States of the European Union and the Republic of Croatia concerning the Accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union[10].\nSubsidiarity principle\nArticle 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union\nstates that, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the\nUnion shall act only if and in so far as the objective of the proposed action\ncannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason\nof the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union\nlevel. As the objective pursued by this proposal requires derogation from\nexisting Union law it can only be attained through action at Union level.\nProportionality principle\nArticle 5(4) of the Treaty on European\nUnion states that the content and form of Union action must not exceed what is\nnecessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. The form chosen for this\naction must enable the proposal to achieve its objective and be implemented as\neffectively as possible. As to the content, this initiative temporarily\nauthorises the Member States concerned to derogate from\ntheir obligations under Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 by unilaterally recognising visas and residence permits issued\nby states fully implementing the Schengen acquis, during their period of\nvalidity, for transit through or intended stays on its\nterritory not exceeding 90 days in any 180-day period. The\nentry and stay on the territories of the Member States concerned of persons\nholding visas or residence permits issued by states fully implementing the\nSchengen acquis or Croatia or Cyprus do not represent any risk as they\nhave been subject to the applicable controls by the state that issued the visa\nor residence permit. The proposed unilateral derogation from Regulation (EC) No\n539/2001 is therefore justified in order to avoid imposing unnecessary\nadministrative burdens on the Member States concerned. Also, it applies only\nduring a transitional period until the date of the Member States' concerned\nfull integration into the common area without internal borders, date from which\nthe mutual recognition regime becomes compulsory. Furthermore, the derogation\nis optional, thus not imposing on the Member States concerned any obligations\nadditional to those laid down by the applicable Acts of Accession. The proposal therefore complies with the proportionality principle.\nIt takes the form of a Decision, likewise the similar instruments adopted for\nthe Member States acceding to the EU in 2004 and 2007.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONSEQUENCES OF THE VARIOUS PROTOCOLS\nANNEXED TO THE TREATIES AND OF THE ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS CONCLUDED WITH THIRD\nCOUNTRIES\nThe legal basis for this proposal is to be\nfound in Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion, with the result that the system of \u2018variable geometry\u2019, provided for in\nthe Protocol on the position of Denmark, the Protocol on the position of the\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and\njustice, and the Protocol on the Schengen acquis integrated into the\nframework of the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, applies. It follows that Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland are not taking part in its adoption, bound by it or subject\nto its application. The latter also follows from the fact that the proposed\ndecision is addressed exclusively to Member States that are bound by the\nSchengen acquis without yet applying it.\nBecause the proposed decision is addressed exclusively\nto Member States that are bound by the Schengen acquis without yet\napplying it, this proposal does not constitute a development of the provisions\nof the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the respective association\nagreements with Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It therefore\ndoes not bind the aforementioned countries. However, for\nthe coherence and proper functioning of the Schengen system, this Decision also\ncovers visas and residence permits issued by the countries associated with the\nimplementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis.\n2013/0210 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nintroducing a simplified regime for the\ncontrol of persons at the external borders based on the unilateral recognition\nby Croatia and Cyprus of certain documents as equivalent to their national\nvisas for transit through or intended stays on their territories not exceeding\n90 days in any 180-day period\n\u00a0and \nrepealing Decision No 895/2006/EC and Decision No 582/2008/EC of the European\nParliament and the Council \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 77 (2) (a) and (b)\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant\nto Article 4(1) of the 2012 Act of Accession, Croatia, which acceded to the\nUnion on 1 July 2013, is required from that date to subject nationals of third\ncountries, which are listed in Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001\nof 15 March 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in\npossession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose\nnationals are exempt from that requirement[11],\nto a visa obligation.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According\nto Article 4(2) of the 2012 Act of Accession, the provisions of the Schengen acquis\non the conditions and criteria for issuing uniform visas, as well as the\nprovisions on mutual recognition of visas and on the equivalence between\nresidence permits/long stay visas and short stay visas, apply in Croatia only\npursuant to a Council decision to that effect. However, they are binding on that\n  Member State from the date of accession.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Croatia is therefore required to issue national\nvisas for entry into or transit through their territory to third country\nnationals holding a uniform visa or long-stay visa or residence permit issued\nby a Member State fully implementing the Schengen acquis as well as\nsimilar documents issued by Cyprus.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nholders of documents issued by those Member States as well as documents issued by\n Cyprus do not represent any risk for Croatia as they have been subjected to\nall necessary controls by those States. In order to avoid imposing unjustified\nadditional administrative burdens on Croatia, common rules should be adopted authorising Croatia to recognise unilaterally certain documents issued by those Member States as\nequivalent to its national visas and to establish a simplified regime for the\ncontrol of persons at the external borders based on that unilateral\nequivalence.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ncommon rules introduced by Decision No 895/2006/EC and by Decision No 582/2008/EC should be repealed .\nWith regard to Cyprus, which implements the common regime established by\nDecision No 895/2006/EC since 10 July 2006 and that established by Decision No\n582/2008/EC since 18 July 2008, common rules should be adopted authorising Cyprus,\nlike Croatia, to recognise\nunilaterally certain documents issued by Member States fully implementing the\nSchengen acquis as well as similar documents issued by Croatia, as\nequivalent to its national visas and to establish a simplified regime for the\ncontrol of persons at the external borders based on that unilateral equivalence.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsimplified regime laid down in this Decision should apply for a transitional\nperiod, until the date to be determined in a Council decision as referred to in\nthe first subparagraph of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession in respect\nof Cyprus and the first subparagraph of Article 4(2) of the 2012 Act of\nAccession in respect of Croatia.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Participation\nin the simplified regime should be optional, without imposing on the Member\nStates obligations additional to those laid down by the 2003 Act of Accession and\nthe 2012 Act of Accession.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ncommon rules should apply to short-term uniform visas, long-stay visas and\nresidence permits issued by Member States fully implementing the Schengen acquis,\nvisas with limited territorial validity issued in accordance with Article\n25 (3) first sentence of the Visa Code and by the countries associated with the\nimplementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis as\nwell as to short-term visas, long-term visas and residence permits issued by\nCroatia and Cyprus. The recognition of a document should be limited to the\nperiod of validity of the document. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nentry conditions laid down in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a\nCommunity Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders\n(Schengen Borders Code)[12]\nhave to be fulfilled, with the exception of the condition laid down in Article\n5(1)(b) thereof, insofar as this Decision sets up a regime of unilateral\nrecognition by Croatia and Cyprus of certain documents issued by Member States\nfully implementing the Schengen acquis as well as similar documents\nissued by Croatia and Cyprus for transit through or\nintended stays on their territories not exceeding 90 days in any 180-day period.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\nthe objective of this Decision, namely the introduction of a regime of\nunilateral recognition by Croatia and Cyprus of certain documents issued by\nother States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can,\ntherefore be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in\naccordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the\nTreaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality,\nas also set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary\nin order to achieve that objective.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Iceland and\nNorway, this Decision does not constitute a development of the Schengen acquis\nwithin the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European\nUnion and by the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the\nlatters\u2019 association with the\nimplementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis,[13] as it is\naddressed only to Croatia and Cyprus, which are not yet fully implementing the\nSchengen acquis. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Switzerland,\nthis Decision does not constitute a development of the provisions of the\nSchengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement between the European\nUnion, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss\nConfederation's association with the implementation, application and\ndevelopment of the Schengen acquis,[14]\nas it is addressed only to Croatia and Cyprus, which are not yet fully\nimplementing the Schengen acquis.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Liechtenstein,\nthis Decision does not constitute a development of the Schengen acquis within\nthe meaning of the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community,\nthe Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession\nof the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European\nUnion, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss\nConfederation\u2019s association with the implementation, application and\ndevelopment of the Schengen acquis,[15]\nas it is addressed only to Croatia and Cyprus, which are\nnot yet fully implementing the Schengen acquis.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However,\nfor the coherence and proper functioning of the Schengen system, this Decision\nalso covers visas and residence permits issued by third countries associated\nwith the implementation,\napplication and development of the Schengen acquis and fully implementing\nthe Schengen acquis, such as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on\nEuropean Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Decision constitutes a\ndevelopment of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United\nKingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC\nof 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of\nthe Schengen acqui;s[16]\nthe United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Decision constitutes a\ndevelopment of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland\ndoes not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC\nof 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some\nof the provisions of the Schengen acquis[17] ;Ireland is therefore not\ntaking part in its adoption,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThis Decision introduces a simplified\nregime for the control of persons at the external borders whereby Croatia and\nCyprus may recognise unilaterally as equivalent to their national visas for\ntransit through or intended stays on their territory not exceeding 90 days in\nany 180-day period the documents referred to in Article 2(1) and those referred\nto in Article 3 issued by Member States and countries\nassociated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen\nacquis and fully implementing the Schengen acquis and by Cyprus and Croatia to third country\nnationals subject to a visa obligation pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001.\n\nThe implementation of this Decision shall\nnot affect the checks to be carried out on persons at the external borders in\naccordance with Articles 5 to 13 and Articles 18 to 19 of Regulation (EC) No\n562/2006.\nArticle 2\n1. Croatia and Cyprus may consider as\nequivalent to their national visas, for transit through or intended stays on their\nterritory not exceeding 90 days in any 180-day period, the following documents\nissued by the Member States and associated countries fully implementing the\nSchengen acquis, irrespective of the nationality of the holders:\n(i) a \u2018uniform visa\u2019 as defined in Article 2\n(3) of Regulation (EC) No 810/2009, valid for 2 or multiple entries;\n(ii) a \u2018long-stay visa\u2019 as referred to in\nArticle 18 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement;\n(iii) a \u2018residence permit\u2019 as defined in\nArticle 2(15) of Regulation (EC) 562/2006.\n2.
