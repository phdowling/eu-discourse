At\nthe end of the negotiations a new draft protocol was initialled by the\nnegotiators on 24 April 2013. The new\nProtocol covers a period of three years from the date of provisional application\nlaid down in Article 14, that being the date on which this new Protocol was\nsigned.\nThe main purpose of the Protocol to the Agreement is to grant fishing\nopportunities to European Union vessels in Gabonese waters, in compliance with\nthe best scientific opinions available and the recommendations of the\nInternational Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), within\nthe limits of the available surplus. The\nCommission's negotiating position was based in part on the results of an\nex-post evaluation carried out by external experts.\nThe general aim is to enhance the cooperation between the European\nUnion and the Gabonese Republic, thereby creating a partnership framework\nwithin which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation\nof fishery resources in the Gabonese fishing zone, in the interests of both\nParties.\nMore specifically, the Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in\nthe following categories:\n27 freezer tuna seiners:\n8 pole-and-line tuna vessels.\nThe method for allocating fishing opportunities among the Member States\nshould be defined. The Commission proposes, on\nthis basis, that the Council adopt the Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe interested parties were consulted as part of the evaluation of the\nProtocol for the period 2007\u201113.
