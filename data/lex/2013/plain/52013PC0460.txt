They are marginalised and mostly live in\nvery bad socio-economic conditions. On average, only one in two Roma children\nattend pre-school or kindergarten; participation in education drops\nconsiderably after compulsory school with only 15% of young Roma adults\ncompleting upper-secondary education; on average, fewer than one in three Roma\nreport to be in employment; 20 % are not covered by health insurance and\n90 % are living below the poverty line[1].\nThis undermines social cohesion and sustainable human development, hampers\ncompetitiveness and generates costs for society as a whole. Discrimination of\nthe Roma is also incompatible with the values upon which the EU is founded. The\ncrux of the problem lies in the close links between discrimination and social\nexclusion experienced by Roma.\nPolicy context\nOn 5 April 2011, the Commission adopted an\nEU Framework for national Roma integration strategies up to 2020[2]. The European Council endorsed\nit in June 2011. It expressed the EU\u2019s political will to address the situation\nof Roma.\nWith this Framework, the European\nCommission aims to ensure that Member States adopt an effective approach to\nRoma integration and endorse goals on the four pillars of education, employment,\nhealth and housing.\nUnder the Framework, the Commission must\nreport annually on progress made by the Member States. In 2012, it assessed for\nthe first time the national strategies presented by the Member States and\nadopted horizontal conclusions \u2014 COM(2012) 226 final \u2014 and specific\nindications on the strengths and weaknesses of each Member State\u2019s strategy \u2014 SWD(2012)133 final.\nOne year on, the Commission\u2019s report\nfocuses on the progress the Member States have made in ensuring that several pre-conditions\nare in place for successfully implementing the national strategies. These\npre-conditions include involving regional and local authorities, working\nclosely with civil society, monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the\nstrategies, including by reinforcing the role of the National Roma Contact Points,\nallocating the necessary funding, stepping up the fight against discrimination\nand mainstreaming it into other policies. In its assessment, the Commission\ntook into consideration input from civil society and other stakeholders.\nBuilding on\nthe conclusions of this report and on the Commission\u2019s 2012 progress report[3], the proposal for a Council\nRecommendation aims to speed up progress by focusing the attention of the\nMember States on a number of concrete measures that are crucial for\nimplementing their strategies more effectively.\nPurpose\nof the proposal\nThe proposal for a Council recommendation is\nbased on the 2011 and 2012 Commission communications[4] and on the 2011 Council Conclusions\non Roma inclusion[5].\nIt aims to provide guidance to Member States in enhancing\nthe effectiveness of their measures to achieve Roma integration and to strengthen\nthe implementation of their national Roma integration strategies or sets of\npolicy measures to improve the situation of Roma, in line with the challenges\nfaced by Member States according to the respective size and situation of their\nRoma population. It reinforces the EU Framework with a non-binding\nlegal instrument in order to make it easier for Member States to turn their\ncommitments into reality. The Recommendation specifically covers:\n\u00b7                        \nspecific targeted action, building on best\npractices, to strengthen Roma integration in full\nrespect of the principle of subsidiarity and without duplicating existing EU\nlegislation. This is the case for education, employment,\nhealth and housing;\n\u00b7                        \nhorizontal issues that are essential for\nputting into practice Roma integration policies and for securing their\nsustainability. These particularly include the fight against discrimination and stereotyping; the protection of\nchildren and women; the adoption of a social investment approach; the collection\nof information on the situation of Roma to monitor the impact of policies; the translation\nof national commitments into local action; the support of the work of bodies that\npromote equal treatment of Roma; the reinforcement of the resources and\ncapacities of the National Roma Contact Points and the development of\ntransnational cooperation;\n\u00b7                        \ngeneral principles of securing the transparent\nand appropriate allocation of funds\u00a0 to Roma inclusion (not only EU but also national and local funds). Overall\nrecommendations on EU funding are based on the experience of the current\nprogramming period and on the proposed Regulation on common provisions on the\nEuropean Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion\nFund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European\nMaritime and Fisheries Fund.\nWhile primary\nresponsibility for Roma integration rests with national public authorities, it\nremains a challenge given that the social and economic integration of Roma is a\ntwo-way process which requires a change of mindsets of the majority of the\npeople as well as of members of the Roma communities\nConsistency\nwith other policies and objectives of the Union \nEquality is one of the Union's founding values and core aims under Article 2 TEU.\nMoreover, Article 3 TEU\nenshrines the combat against social exclusion and discrimination as one of the Union's aims.\nIn accordance with\nArticle 8 TFEU, the EU aims to eliminate inequalities, and promote equality,\nbetween men and women in all its activities. Article 10 TFEU states that \u2018in\ndefining and implementing its policies and activities, the Union shall aim to\ncombat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or\nbelief, disability, age or sexual orientation\u2019.\nFinally, Article 21 of\nthe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union particularly prohibits\ndiscrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin among other grounds.\nThe proposal is consistent with existing\nsecondary legislation in the field of anti-discrimination in so far as it\ncomplements the established legal framework. Council Directive 2000/43/EC\nimplements the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of\nracial or ethnic origin and sets out a binding framework by prohibiting\ndiscrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin throughout the EU in the\nareas of employment and training, education, social protection (including\nsocial security and healthcare), social advantages and access to goods and\nservices (including housing). It prohibits direct and indirect discrimination, harassment\nand instruction to discriminate. All EU Member States have transposed this\nDirective into national legislation. The European Commission checks that the\nDirective is correctly implemented and will publish a report on its\nimplementation in 2013.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES\nThe proposal is based on the work that took\nplace during two meetings of a group of Member States set up in 2012 in the context of the network of National Roma Contact\nPoints[6].\nThe meetings, held on 7-8 November and 6-7 December 2012, and to which\nparticipation was on a voluntary basis, produced fruitful discussions between\nthe Member States on a number of issues considered crucial to boost Roma\ninclusion.\nIn line with the EU Framework, Member States\nwere requested to submit National Roma Integration Strategies by the end of 2011.\nAll Member States fulfilled their commitments in this respect and the national\nRoma integration strategies were published on the Commission's website to be\naccessible for all citizens. The Commission received a wide range of\ncontributions from various stakeholders, including civil society, on the\nstrategies themselves and more recently on their implementation[7], including\nduring a dialogue between Commissioners and civil society representatives on 15\nMay 2013.\nIn addition, regular meetings took place with\nthe representatives of European umbrella Roma organisations[8] on the challenges and most\nimportant issues required at all levels to actively promote Roma inclusion.\nGiven the number of contributions received in\nthis framework, the Commission considered that no further public consultation\nwas necessary specifically on the Recommendation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nLegal basis\nA proposal for a Council Recommendation must\nlink its content to a policy area of the Treaties. Such a link is also necessary\nto determine the adoption rules of the act (unanimity or qualified majority).\nAccording to settled Court of Justice case\nlaw, the choice of a legal basis must be based on objective criteria that can\nbe judicially reviewed, including in particular the aim and content of the\nmeasure in question[9].\nArticle 292 TFEU sets out the Council\u2019s\nmandate to adopt recommendations. It reads as follows:\n\u2018The Council shall adopt recommendations.\nIt shall act on a proposal from the Commission in all cases where the Treaties\nprovide that it shall adopt acts on a proposal from the Commission. It shall\nact unanimously in those areas in which unanimity is required for the adoption\nof a Union act. The Commission, and the European Central Bank in the specific\ncases provided for in the Treaties, shall adopt recommendations.\u2019\nThe EU\u2019s right to act in matters of\nanti-discrimination, notably with regard to discrimination on the grounds of\nrace or ethnic origin, stems from Article 19(1) TFEU. This provision is the\nlegal basis for any binding and non-binding measures to combat discriminatory acts\nand practices. It reads as follows:\n\u20181. Without\nprejudice to the other provisions of the Treaties and within the limits of the\npowers conferred by them upon the Union, the Council, acting unanimously in\naccordance with a special legislative procedure and after obtaining the consent\nof the European Parliament, may take appropriate action to combat\ndiscrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief,\ndisability, age or sexual orientation.\u2019\nArticle 292 TFEU is therefore to be read\ntogether with the appropriate legal basis for the substance of the proposal, namely\nArticle 19(1) TFEU.\nSubsidiarity and proportionality\nAccording to the principle of\nsubsidiarity, the EU shall act only if and insofar as the objectives of the\nproposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States (necessity\ntest), but can rather, either by reason of its scale or effects, be better\nachieved at EU level (test of EU added value).\nThe measures introduced by some Member\nStates vary broadly in terms of scope and effectiveness and many Member States\nhave not taken specific action in the area of Roma inclusion. According to the\nconclusions of the 2013 progress report on the implementation of the National\nRoma Integration Strategies[10],\nthe Commission took note that while Member States have had the legal\npossibility to act to address the issue of Roma integration, the measures planned\nso far are not sufficient. Due to the lack of a coordinated approach to the\nissue of Roma integration, there are growing discrepancies among Member States.\nScattered, divergent regulation at national\nlevel is also bound to exacerbate the situation by creating further practical problems\nbetween Member States. Indeed, tackling the issue of Roma integration in an\nuncoordinated manner has proven to be inefficient in the European Union as a\nwhole, where the free movement of citizens is guaranteed. This situation could result\nin a significant increase of Roma migrants in Member States where living\nconditions are more favourable and where social inclusion measures for the disadvantaged\npeople are more favourable.\nIn this regard, the present proposal aims\nto supplement existing EU action in the areas concerned (i.e.: free movement of\ncitizens Directive 2004/38/EC, racial discrimination Directive 2000/43/EC) in\nview of achieving more efficient results by better coordinating the measures to\nbe adopted by the Member States.\nThe objectives of the proposed action cannot\nbe sufficiently achieved by the Member States on their own and may therefore be\nbetter achieved through coordinated action at EU level rather than through\nnational initiatives of varying scope, ambition and effectiveness.\nAccording to the principle of\nproportionality, the content and form of EU action shall not exceed what is\nnecessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. As past experience shows, in\nspite of some progress achieved in the Member States and at EU level over the\npast few years, little has changed in the day-to-day situation of most Roma.\nAccording to the Commission\u2019s findings, strong and proportionate measures are\nstill not in place to tackle the social and economic problems of much of the EU\u2019s\nRoma population.\nIn line with the proportionality principle,\nthe non-binding proposal is limited to setting common objectives and recommending\nspecific measures, including positive action measures specifically provided for\nunder Article 5 of Directive 2000/43/EC to prevent or compensate for\ndisadvantages linked to racial or ethnic origin under the conditions developed\nin the case law of the CJEU in the area of sex discrimination[11]. This gives Member States enough\nleeway to determine how to best achieve these common objectives at national\nlevel, taking into account national, regional or local circumstances.\nThe proposal will not impede on the Member\nStates' competence to deal with the issue of the social inclusion of\ndisadvantaged communities, like the Roma, as it does not impose rigid obligations.\nIt merely recommends several options to Member States, leaving them determine\nthe appropriate way of achieving the objectives set out.\nChoice of instrument\nThe choice of a non-binding instrument aims\nat providing practical guidelines to the Member States as regards the problem\nof Roma social inclusion, but without laying down strict binding rules.\nThe choice for a Council recommendation aims\nat reinforcing the existing political commitments of Member States while ensuring\nconsistent minimum standards in the European Union in the implementation of\neffective national Roma strategies. It also strengthens transnational\ncooperation, while allowing a sufficient margin of manoeuvre to Member States\non the forms and methods.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implications for\nthe EU\u2019s budget.\n2013/0229 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL RECOMMENDATION\non effective Roma integration measures in\nthe Member States\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE\nEUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, in particular Article 19(1) and Article 292 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 2 and Article 3 TEU\nenshrine the right to equality, the fight against social exclusion and discrimination\nas essential values and objectives of the European Union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 10 TFEU states\nthat \u2018in defining and implementing its policies and activities, the Union shall aim to combat discrimination based on [\u2026] racial or ethnic origin\u2019.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 19(1) TFEU enables\nthe adoption of measures to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or\nethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 21(1) of the\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union obliges the institutions,\nbodies, offices and agencies of the EU and the Member States, when implementing\nEU law, to respect the prohibition of discrimination on any ground, such as\nrace, colour and ethnic or racial origin, and membership of a national\nminority, and to promote its application in accordance with their powers.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive\n2000/43/EC[12]\nsets out a binding framework prohibiting discrimination on the basis of racial\nor ethnic origin throughout the Union in employment and training, education,\nsocial protection (including social security and health care), social\nadvantages and access to goods and services (including housing).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The term \u201cRoma\u201d is used \u2013\nsimilarly to other political documents of the European Parliament and the\nEuropean Council \u2013 as an umbrella which includes groups of people who have more\nor less similar cultural characteristics, such as Sinti, Travellers, Kal\u00e9, Gens\ndu voyage, etc. whether sedentary or not[13].\n\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many Roma in the EU are in\na worse socio-economic situation than the general population and benefit less\nthan the rest of the disadvantaged population from general social inclusion\nmeasures. They therefore require additional, more ambitious social inclusion\nmeasures adapted to their situation and needs. As Roma often face\ndiscrimination, social exclusion and deep poverty, they are considered\nvulnerable and at greater risk of human trafficking.\n\u00a0(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Roma who are third-country\nnationals staying legally in the Member States are particularly vulnerable as\nthey share the same severe living conditions as many Roma EU citizens, whilst\nfacing also challenges of migrants coming from outside the EU. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe context of free movement and intra-EU mobility, it\nis necessary to accompany the full exercise of free movement rights with\nimprovements in the living conditions of Roma, and their economic and social\nintegration in Member States of origin as in Member States of residence.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Parliament\nResolutions on the Situation of Roma People in Europe (9 September 2010) and on\nthe EU Strategy on Roma Inclusion (9 March 2011) called on the Commission and\nthe Member States to mobilise existing EU strategies and instruments with a\nview to securing the socio-economic inclusion of Roma. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The 2011 Commission's\nCommunication An EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies[14] called on Member States\nto adopt or further develop a comprehensive approach to Roma integration and\nendorse a number of common goals in education, employment, health and housing\nin order to speed up the integration of Roma.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council adopted Conclusions[15] on 19 May 2011 on the EU\nFramework for national Roma integration strategies, expressing the Member\nStates' commitment to advance the social and economic inclusion of the Roma.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the\nEuropean Council of 23 and 24 June 2011 called for the rapid implementation of\nthe Council's conclusions of 19 May 2011 on the EU framework for national Roma\nintegration strategies up to 2020 in particular as regards the preparation,\nupdating or development of Member States' national Roma inclusion strategies or\nintegrated sets of policy measures for improving the situation of the Roma.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The 2012 Commission's\nCommunication National Roma integration strategies: a first step in the\nimplementation of the EU Framework[16]\nand the accompanying staff working document[17]\nprovided the results from the first assessment of all national Roma integration\nstrategies and invited Member States to envisage a number of adaptations as a\nway forward. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission enhanced its\ndialogue with the Member States on Roma integration, in particular by\nestablishing in October 2012 the network of National Roma Contact Points, in\norder to discuss solutions to the identified challenges. In November and\nDecember 2012, a group of National Contact Points further discussed how to\nenhance the effectiveness of measures to achieve Roma integration in the Member\nStates, and reported subsequently to the entire network.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its 2013 Communication\non Progress in implementing national Roma integration strategies, the\nCommission highlights the need for further action in order to secure the\nnecessary preconditions for a successful implementation of measures aimed at\nstepping up Roma integration as soon as possible.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Europe 2020 Strategy\nhas given new impetus to the fight against poverty and social exclusion by\nsetting a common European target to reduce the number of people at risk of\npoverty and social exclusion, to reduce the rate of early school leaving,\nincrease school attainment and employment levels. Roma inclusion is an\nessential part of the convergent EU and Member States' efforts in this respect.\nIn this context, the current governance of the European Semester promotes\nimplementation of the relevant country specific recommendations, and the Social\nInvestment Package[18]\nprovides further guidance for the efforts to secure inclusive growth.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the\nconsiderations above and of the shortcomings identified, while fully respecting\nthe principle of subsidiarity and the Member States\u2019 primary responsibility for\nRoma inclusion, the effectiveness of Roma integration measures needs to be\nimproved.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Recommendation aims to\nbuild on the recommendations in the Commission Communications, European\nParliament Resolutions and Council Conclusions on Roma inclusion, to complement\ncurrent EU legislation on anti-discrimination and to help make its implementation\nand enforcement more effective.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Recommendation does\nnot cover difference of treatment based on nationality and is without prejudice\nto provisions and conditions related to the legal status of Roma under national\nand Union law or to the legal effects of that status.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2011, the Commission\nproposed in the draft Common Provisions Regulation[19] that Member States set out an\nintegrated approach to address the specific needs of geographical areas most\naffected by poverty or of target groups at highest risk of discrimination or\nexclusion, with special regard to marginalised communities. In complementarity\nwith the other European Structural and Investment Funds it also proposed in the\ndraft European Social Fund[20]\nregulation for the 2014-2020 programming period an investment priority for the\nintegration of marginalised communities such as the Roma.\nHEREBY RECOMMENDS:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PURPOSE\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this Recommendation\nis to provide guidance to Member States in enhancing the effectiveness of their\nmeasures to achieve Roma integration and strengthen the implementation of their\nnational Roma integration strategies or sets of policy measures to improve the\nsituation of Roma.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SUBSTANTIVE POLICY ISSUES\nTargeted policy measures\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to ensuring\nfull equality in practice, the Member States should take targeted measures to\nensure equal treatment and respect of fundamental rights, including equal access\nof Roma to education, employment, healthcare, housing and public utilities.\nThis should include, in compliance with the case-law of the Court of Justice of\nthe European Union, specific measures to prevent or compensate for\ndisadvantages linked to racial or ethnic origin.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures to be adopted\nshould be based on socio-economic or geographic indicators, such as high\nlong-term unemployment, low level of education attainment, or disadvantaged and/or\nsegregated areas.\nAccess to education\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member States should\ntake specific measures to ensure equal treatment and secure the full access of\nRoma to good quality and mainstream education, with a view to close the gap\nbetween Roma and other pupils and ensure that all Roma pupils will complete at\nleast compulsory education, and notably primary education. This goal should be\nattained by:\n(a)         \neliminating school segregation, including by\nputting an end to the inappropriate placement of Roma pupils in special needs\nschools;\n(b)         \nreducing early school leaving[21] throughout education,\nincluding at secondary level, with a focus on vocational tracks;\n(c)         \nincreasing the access to and quality of early childhood\neducation and care, including targeted support, as necessary;\n(d)         \nusing inclusive and personalised teaching and\nlearning methods, including learning support for struggling learners and\nfighting illiteracy;\n(e)         \nencouraging greater parental involvement and\nsupporting families with school mediators dedicated to Roma;\n(f)           \nimproving teacher training and school mediation\ndedicated to Roma;\n(g)         \nwidening access to second-chance education, supporting\nthe transition between educational levels, and ensuring that Roma acquire a mix\nof skills that will help them to enter the labour market.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member States should\ntake specific measures to encourage Roma participation in secondary and\ntertiary education. \nAccess to employment\n2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to the targeted\nmeasures Member States may take, they should ensure equal treatment and close\nthe gap between Roma and other workers so as to improve the situation of Roma as\nregards employment within their mainstream policies. This goal should be\nattained by:\n(a)         \nsupporting first work experience, on-the-job\ntraining, life-long learning and skills development; \n(b)         \nsupporting self-employment and entrepreneurship;\n(c)         \nproviding equal access to mainstream public\nemployment services, along with specific and individualised services to Roma\njob seekers, and promoting the employment of qualified Roma civil servants;\n(d)         \ntraining and employing qualified Roma mediators\nfor the provision of counselling and advice on career opportunities;\n(e)         \neliminating barriers, including discrimination,\nto (re)entering the open labour market.\nAccess to healthcare\n2.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member States should take\nspecific measures to ensure equal treatment and close the gap between Roma and\nother patients so as to improve the access of Roma, on a par with the latter, to\nprevention, primary, emergency and specialised healthcare services. This goal\nshould be attained by:\n(a)         \nensuring the provision of basic social security\ncoverage and comprehensive health services to Roma;\n(b)         \noffering regular medical check-ups, prenatal and\npostnatal care and family planning;\n(c)         \napplying free vaccination schemes targeting in\nparticular those living in marginalised and remote areas;\n(d)         \ntraining qualified Roma health mediators.\nAccess to housing\n2.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member States should\ntake specific measures to ensure equal treatment and close the gap between Roma\nand the general population so as to extend their housing policies and measures\nto Roma.
