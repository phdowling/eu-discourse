The complexity is the result of providing\r\ndifferent information, the information not having harmonised definitions, the\r\nlack of good common guidance, different rules and procedures for the submission\r\nand corrections, and needing to use the national language. This all leads to an\r\nincrease in burdens on business, reduced accuracy and timeliness of VAT\r\ndeclarations, and restricts cross-border trade.\nTo address these problems the Commission\r\nsought stakeholder views on a standard VAT declaration through the consultation\r\non the Green Paper on the Future of VAT[1].\r\nPositive replies from stakeholders led the Commission to include in the\r\nCommunication on the Future of VAT[2]\r\na commitment to come forward with a proposal for a standard VAT declaration\r\nbefore the end of 2013.\nThe proposal supports other Commission\r\ninitiatives. The Action Programme for Reducing Administrative Burdens in the EU\r\nis helped by a high-level group, in place until October 2014, which advises the\r\nCommission on reducing administrative burdens linked to EU legislation. It\r\nfocuses on SMEs and micro enterprises, as well as how to make Member State public administrations more efficient and responsive to the needs of stakeholders\r\nwhen implementing EU legislation. The standard VAT declaration fits well with\r\nthese burden reduction aims.\nBuilding on the \"Think Small\r\nFirst\" principle from the Small Business Act by cutting \"red\r\ntape\" for SMEs is a key Commission aim. The recent Communication on Smart\r\nregulation - Responding to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises has\r\nhighlighted, from an on-line survey of SMEs, the VAT Directive[3] as an area of EU legislation\r\nmost burdensome. The VAT declaration, in particular, is identified as an area\r\nwhere divergences constitute an obstacle to EU trade. This proposal aims to\r\nreduce burdens on all business, and particularly SMEs, and is highlighted in\r\nthe Communication on Smart regulation[4].\nBusinesses increasingly complain that in\r\ndoing business in the EU, it can be difficult to be VAT compliant. This can be\r\nparticularly true for e-commerce and the supply of goods in the internal market,\r\nwhere the customer is a private individual and the supplier needs to register,\r\ndeclare and pay the VAT in the Member State of the customer. These obligations\r\ncan create obstacles to cross-border trade and a standard VAT return can reduce\r\nthose obstacles. The Single Market Act II[5]\r\nis therefore calling for the introduction of a standard VAT return.\nMoreover, growth-friendly fiscal\r\nconsolidation is one of the five priorities of the Annual Growth Survey 2012.\r\nAs VAT represents around 21% of national tax revenues, and with 12% of VAT\r\nreceipts uncollected, a more efficient fraud proof VAT system is needed. The\r\nexchange of timely information between Member States is a key element in\r\nreducing fraud and improving compliance and a standard VAT return can help in\r\nthis regard.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation\r\nof interested parties\nThe standard VAT declaration has been the subject\r\nof several consultations. It was included in the Green Paper on the Future of\r\nVAT for which the results can be found at:\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/common/consultations/tax/2010_11_future_vat_en.htm\nBusinesses and Member States have been\r\nconsulted during the study undertaken by PwC which included a Fiscalis seminar\r\norganised in October 2012. In addition businesses have been further consulted\r\nin meetings of the VAT Expert Group in January 2012 and in the Small Business Act\r\nfollow-up meeting with SME stakeholders in April 2013, and Member States in the Group on the Future of VAT held in January 2013. \nResults of the VAT Expert Group can be found\r\nat:\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/vat/key_documents/expert_group/index_en.htm\nResults of the Group on the Future of VAT\r\ncan be found at:\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/vat/key_documents/discussions_member_states/index_en.htm\nImpact\r\nAssessment\nThe proposal is accompanied by an Impact\r\nAssessment. \nOf the options evaluated in detail the\r\npreferred option is for a standard VAT return, mandatory for Member States and\r\nfor business, which provides a list of standardised information of which only a\r\nsmall number of items are required in all cases. This maximises the burden\r\nreduction for businesses while limiting the cost for Member States.\nThe preferred option is estimated to reduce\r\nadministrative burdens by a maximum of EUR 15 billion per annum.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe proposal is based on Article 113\r\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) to the extent\r\nthat harmonisation is necessary to ensure the functioning of the internal\r\nmarket and to avoid distortion of competition.\nSubsidiarity\r\nprinciple\nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\r\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States. Standardisation of the VAT return\r\nobligation can only be achieved through the EU's legislative process by\r\namending the VAT Directive which sets out the relevant rules of the VAT return.\nThe scope of the proposal is limited to\r\nwhat can only be achieved with EU legislation and therefore complies with the\r\nsubsidiarity principle.\nProportionality\r\nprinciple\nThe amendments to the VAT Directive are\r\nnecessary to achieve a standardisation of VAT returns and to limit the\r\ninformation requirements to that necessary for the control and collection of\r\nVAT so as to reduce burdens on business and remove obstacles to the proper\r\nfunctioning of the internal market.\nIn addition distortions of competition can\r\nbe better avoided through the enhanced possibilities of control which a\r\nstandard form offers to Member States.\nThe proposal therefore complies with the\r\nproportionality principle.\nChoice of\r\ninstruments\nThe proposed instrument is a Directive as\r\nthe legislation being amended is a Directive and so no other legislative act\r\nwould be suitable.\nExplanatory\r\ndocuments\nMember States are required to communicate\r\nto the Commission the text of national provisions transposing the Directive as\r\nwell as providing an explanatory document explaining the relationship between\r\nthe components of this directive and the corresponding parts of national\r\ntransposition instruments. This is justified and proportional.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no negative impact on the\r\nEU budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe idea behind a standard VAT declaration\r\nis to allow all businesses to provide standardised information to each Member State submitted in a common, preferably electronic, format. In this way a business\r\nsubmitting a VAT return in one Member State can easily complete and submit a\r\nVAT return in another Member State because the information and submission is\r\nstandardised.\nThe standard VAT declaration should be\r\navailable to all businesses because to limit it to certain categories of\r\nbusinesses would only serve to reduce its scope, increase complexities and\r\nthereby lower burden reduction. Equally to lower costs and complexities for\r\nMember States only one VAT return should be offered at the level of the EU, the\r\nstandard VAT declaration. \nThe proposal addresses issues in relation\r\nto the content, submission in terms of when and how, and corrections of the\r\nstandard VAT return. For the content it is both the amount of information and\r\nstandardising that information that are the key elements in reducing burdens on\r\nbusiness. The proposal lists a maximum number of twenty six boxes of\r\ninformation to be completed by business for which Member States may choose to\r\nexempt businesses from all but five. The information provided should be\r\nconsistent in all Member States so that information declared in one Member State is determined in exactly the same way as it is in all the other Member States.\nAdditionally Member States may require\r\nextra information for the control and administration of VAT for specific\r\nregions, territories, or special regimes allowed exceptionally in VAT\r\nlegislation. Only in these duly justified cases may Member States require\r\nbusinesses to provide more than the twenty six standard boxes of information. \nFor the submission the proposal provides\r\nfor a minimum standard. All businesses should be allowed to submit monthly VAT\r\nreturns, with VAT being due and paid by the end of the month following the VAT\r\nreturn period. Beyond that Member States may introduce further burden\r\nreductions to allow for longer VAT return periods of up to one year and to\r\nextend the due date for submission and payment by up to a further month. This\r\nshould ensure that no business is required to file more frequent VAT returns\r\nnor submit or pay the VAT due within a reduced deadline.\nThe proposal also encourages electronic\r\nfiling. Businesses should have the right to submit in all Member States the\r\nstandard VAT return electronically, including by electronic file transfer, using\r\nadvanced electronic signatures interoperable throughout the EU or other\r\ntechnologies offering a similar level of security.\nTo ensure that certain technical aspects of\r\nthe VAT return are standardised, which cannot be achieved through a directive,\r\nscope is provided in the proposal for the use of the comitology procedure. This\r\nis envisaged where needed for the technical details of the return, for the common\r\ndefinitions and procedures, for the detailed treatment of corrections, as well\r\nas for the common methods of electronic submission.\nArticles 178,\r\n185, 211, 271 and 318\nWhere the VAT Directive uses the term\r\n\"VAT return\" this has been replaced with the term \"standard VAT\r\nreturn\" to avoid confusion as Chapter 5 in Title XI has been\r\nsplit into two sections, namely \"Standard VAT return\" and \"Other\r\nreturns and information\". This affects the changes to Articles 178,\r\n185, 211, 271 and 318.\nThe definition of \"VAT return\" in\r\npoint 5 of Article 357 and point 4 of Article 358 from\r\n1 January 2015 is specific to the Chapter relating to the special schemes\r\nfor non-established taxable persons supplying telecommunications, broadcasting\r\nand electronic services to non-taxable persons and can be left unchanged.\nArticles 206\r\nand 252\nArticle 206 in its current form allows\r\nMember States to opt for a different payment deadline than the one of\r\nsubmitting the VAT return and to require interim payments. Such a provision\r\nwhich allows the coexistence of different payment deadlines would partially\r\nremove the benefits of the proposed standard VAT return. Therefore, the general\r\nrule that the payment of VAT is made when the standard VAT return is submitted\r\nis maintained in Article 206 but the possibility for Member States to\r\nchoose any other payment date is removed. \nBy Article 252 the standard VAT return\r\nis to be submitted by the end of the month following the standard VAT return\r\nperiod. To avoid in some cases reducing payment deadlines for businesses Member\r\nStates are allowed to extend the deadline for submission of the standard VAT\r\nreturn by a further month. Thus the VAT return and payment are both due at a\r\nminimum of one month and a maximum of 2 months after the end of the VAT\r\nreturn period.\nThe standard VAT return period is set in\r\nArticle 252 at one month. However, to prevent businesses having to submit\r\nmore frequent standard VAT returns than is currently the case Member States can\r\nallow businesses to submit standard VAT returns for a period of up to one year.\nIn line with the common Union\u2019s policy concerning\r\nthe definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises[6], for micro enterprises with an\r\nannual turnover less than EUR 2 000 000 they can submit\r\nquarterly VAT returns unless there is a risk to the control and collection of\r\nVAT. \nArticle 250\nFive items of information are required on\r\nall standard VAT returns corresponding to output and input tax, the associated\r\nnet figures and the net amount to pay or to be refunded. All Member States\r\ncurrently require this information and this is covered by the current\r\nArticle 250(1).\nCommon rules for the correction of VAT\r\nreturns are necessary to achieve the desired level of standardisation. Member States\r\nshould however be allowed to determine their own correction period as these\r\nperiods are closely linked to national audit procedures. Therefore, in the\r\nsecond paragraph, the principle of allowing taxable persons to correct VAT\r\nreturns under a time period determined by Member States is introduced. The\r\ntotal value of intra-Community supplies of goods and of intra-Community\r\nacquisitions of goods can be established on the basis of the EU sales lists and\r\nthus should not be included in the standard VAT return. However, a transitional\r\nperiod is necessary to adjust national statistical systems which currently, for\r\nthe compilation of intra-Community trade in goods statistics[7], rely to a high degree on the\r\ninformation provided in VAT returns.\nArticle 251\nIn addition to mandatory information on the\r\nstandard VAT return other information may be required by Member States for risk\r\nanalysis and control purposes. To reduce burdens on business and to exclude\r\ninformation needed for statistical, and not VAT, purposes the additional\r\ninformation requirements should be standardised and kept to a minimum.\nPart of the additional information is\r\nspecific to certain transactions in the VAT Directive and is standardised. Article 251(1)\r\nallows extra standardised information in relation to sales and VAT due and\r\ncontains eight items of information. Article 251(2) allows thirteen items\r\nof standardised information in relation to purchases and deductible VAT.\nHowever, other additional information is necessary\r\nwhere Member States apply special rules in certain regions or territories or\r\nfor special schemes applying to certain taxable persons or transactions. This\r\nis provided for in Article 251(3). Due to its specific character, the\r\ncontent of additional information referred to in Article 251(3) will be\r\nstandardised through the comitology procedure. \nTo provide transparency and to facilitate\r\nbusiness compliance where Member States require additional information this\r\nshould be notified to the appropriate committee.\nNew\r\nArticle 252a\nE-filing should be further promoted and\r\nalthough Member States must allow, and may require, electronic submission this\r\nshould be further enhanced to allow file transfer, as is the case with\r\nrecapitulative statements, and to provide common secure methods of transmission\r\nincluding the use of advanced electronic signatures. The definitions used in\r\nthis Article are in line with the Directive 1999/93/EC[8] on electronic signatures. However\r\nthese definitions may need to be adapted after the adoption of the Commission\r\nproposal on the Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for\r\nelectronic transactions in the internal market[9].\nThis article standardises further the\r\ncurrent Article 250(2).\nArticle 253\nThis is deleted as it is a specific measure\r\napplicable only to Sweden and would be contrary to the aims of a standard VAT\r\nreturn.\nArticle 254\nThe content of this article is moved to a\r\nnew Article 257a in a new Section 2 under the heading of \"Other\r\nreturns and information\". This is because any specific information\r\nrequired from the seller of a new means of transport under the current Article 254\r\nshould not be included in a standard VAT return but the information is nevertheless\r\nstill needed.\nArticle\r\n255\nThis article replaces Articles 255,\r\n256 and 257 and brings them together in a single article. There is no change of\r\nsubstance.\nArticles 256\r\nand 257\nThe content of these articles is moved to\r\nArticle 255.\nArticles\r\n258 and 259\nArticle 258 on the submission of\r\ninformation relating to intra-Community acquisitions of new means of transport\r\nand of products subject to excise duties, as well as Article 259 on the\r\ninformation needed to check the correct application of rules relating to the\r\nacquisition of new means of transport are still needed but are amended to\r\nreflect the fact that this information may be required in other returns.\nArticle 260\nThe information on the importation of goods\r\nis now included in Articles 251(1)(g) and 251(2)(g) and consequently this\r\narticle should be deleted.\nArticle 261\nMember States are no longer allowed to\r\nrequire taxable persons to submit an annual summarising VAT return that details\r\nall the transactions declared in the previous year's periodic VAT returns and\r\nwhich provides the information necessary for any adjustments. The adjustments\r\nare included in the standard VAT return through Article 251(2)(h) and Article 261\r\nshould, therefore, be deleted.\nNew\r\nArticles 255a and 255b\nAs was the case with the VAT return for the\r\nspecial schemes for non-established taxable persons supplying\r\ntelecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services to non-taxable\r\npersons, the VAT Directive should set out the information requirements and a\r\nCommission Implementing Regulation should provide the technical details. These\r\narticles replicate that procedure by providing that the technical details\r\nrelating to the information referred to in Articles 250 and 251, common definitions\r\nand procedures for the submission of the information, common procedures by\r\nwhich corrections can be made and common electronic methods beyond using\r\nadvanced electronic signatures may be agreed upon through a Commission\r\nImplementing Regulation using the comitology procedure.\nNew\r\nArticle 257a\nArticle 254 is moved to a new Section 2\r\non \"Other returns and information\" as the information on the sale of\r\nnew means of transport is not included in the standard VAT return.\nArticle 272\nIn order to ensure a consistent application\r\nof the standard VAT return Member States should only be allowed to release\r\ntaxable persons from the requirement to submit a VAT return in certain limited\r\ncases. These cases are when the taxable person is not subject to VAT on his intra-Community\r\nacquisitions, or is covered by the exemption for small enterprises or the\r\ncommon flat rate scheme for farmers.\nArticle 273\nTo ensure that the standard VAT return is indeed\r\nstandardised Member States should not be allowed to impose additional standard VAT\r\nreturn obligations on businesses other than those mentioned and therefore the\r\noption to do so in Article 273 is excluded as regards the standard VAT return.\n2013/0343 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\namending Directive 2006/112/EC on the\r\ncommon system of value added tax as regards a standard VAT return\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 113 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[10],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[11],\nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 2006/112/EC[12] requires taxable persons to\r\nsubmit VAT returns but allows flexibility for the Member States to determine\r\nthe information needed. This gives rise to disparate rules and procedures\r\ngoverning the submission of VAT returns in the Union, added complexity for\r\nbusinesses and VAT obligations that create obstacles to Union trade.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To reduce burdens on\r\nbusiness and improve the functioning of the internal market a standard VAT\r\nreturn should be introduced for all businesses trading in the Union. the use of\r\nstandardised returns should facilitate the control of VAT returns by the Member\r\nStates. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary that\r\nadministrative burdens are reduced to a minimum. The information required on\r\nthe standard VAT return should therefore have a limited set of mandatory\r\ninformation. Moreover, as regards the standard VAT return and other returns,\r\nMember States should not be allowed to require other information than the one\r\nlaid down in chapter 5 of Title XI of the Directive.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should be\r\nallowed to require further information from taxable persons and for this\r\npurpose it is appropriate to establish a standardised list of additional\r\ninformation that may be requested. This is useful in terms of risk analysis and\r\nfor control purposes. To ensure transparency and standardisation Member States\r\nrequiring such additional information should notify the Standing Committee on\r\nAdministrative Cooperation. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To allow Member States to\r\nadjust their systems for the compilation of statistics concerning supplies and\r\nacquisitions of goods within the Union, information on the total value of\r\nsupplies of goods within the Union and of acquisitions of goods within the Union should be part of mandatory information set out in the standard VAT return until 31\r\nDecember 2019.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The tax period should be\r\nmonthly for all businesses except for micro enterprises which should submit standard\r\nVAT returns quarterly. It should still be possible for Member States to extend\r\nthis period for up to one year in order to reduce the administrative burden. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A common minimum deadline\r\nfor submitting the standard VAT return should be set at the end of the month\r\nfollowing the tax period to create a minimum standard but with flexibility for\r\nMember States to extend that period by a further month to avoid increasing\r\nburdens on business. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Payment deadlines should\r\nbe harmonized in order to reduce the administrative burden and the net amount\r\nof VAT should be paid when submitting the standard VAT return or in any event\r\nat the expiry of the deadline by which the standard VAT return must be\r\nsubmitted. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To encourage electronic\r\nfiling, the submission of the standard VAT return should be allowed by electronic\r\nmeans. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that the standard VAT\r\nreturn covers all the information needed for any adjustments to be made, it is\r\nappropriate to dispense with the specific requirements for the importation of\r\ngoods and for an annual summarising VAT return.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The standard VAT return\r\nshould be used by all businesses making certain similar supplies and therefore\r\nthe option for Member States to exempt certain businesses from the obligation\r\nto submit a standard VAT return should be restricted so that the requirement to\r\nsubmit such a return is applied in a consistent manner throughout the Union.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For new means of transport\r\nand products subject to excise duty, the information required is specific and\r\nlimited in nature. The standardisation of such information in the standard VAT\r\nreturn is not appropriate. Instead, the information should be collected through\r\na separate return so as to reduce the burden for the majority of businesses. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of Directive 2006/112/EC, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission as regards the provision of the technical\r\ndetails, including a common electronic message for the transmission, a common\r\nset of definitions and procedures for the submission, common procedures by\r\nwhich corrections can be made and common electronic methods offering a\r\nsufficient level of security for the submission of the standard VAT return.\r\nThose powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 February 2011\r\nlaying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control\r\nby Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers[13].\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nJoint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September\r\n2011 on explanatory documents[14],\r\nMember States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the\r\nnotification of their transposition measures with one or more documents\r\nexplaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the\r\ncorresponding parts of national transposition instruments.
