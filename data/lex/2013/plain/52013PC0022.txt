The tax in question is the Taxe Int\u00e9rieure sur\nles Produits P\u00e9troliers \u2013 Domestic Tax on Petroleum Products (TIPP), which\nis an excise duty.\nBy letter dated 10 February 2012, under\nArticle 19 of the Directive, the French authorities requested the renewal of\nthis scheme on identical terms, but for a period of six years from\n1 January 2013 to 31 December 2018. Additional information and\nclarifications were provided by the French authorities on 24 May 2012 and 5\nOctober 2012. \nOperation\nof the measure\nThe French Customs Code fixes single\nmaximum tax rates for unleaded petrol and gas oil. \nThe regions are allowed to reduce these\nrates with an amount that, as before, cannot exceed EUR 35,4 per 1 000\nlitres of unleaded petrol, including E10 fuel, and EUR 23,0 per 1 000\nlitres of gas oil throughout the derogation period. These amounts constitute\nthe maximum revenue per 1 000 litres that accrues directly to the regions.\nEvery year, the regional Councils decide the amount of the reduction by vote,\nproving the decision making autonomy of the regions and giving an incentive to\nimprove the quality of their administration which cannot be achieved by a\ntransfer from the national budget to the local budgets. \nThe level of taxation after reductions can\nnever be lower than the EU minima set in Directive 2003/96/EC and no reduction\nwould apply to gas oil for commercial use. \nControl\nand movement measures for the products concerned\nCentral government would retain responsibility\nfor collecting and controlling excise duty on gas oil and unleaded petrol,\nirrespective of the reductions adopted by the regions.\nThe products would be moved under duty-paid\narrangements and the fuels would be taxed when released for consumption at the\nrate of duty in force in the region to which they are supplied.\nTo respond to the specific fraud risk\nidentified (diversion of deliveries to benefit from tax differentials between\ntwo regions), the logistical chain would be supervised by means of prior\nidentification of recipients by suppliers and notification of this information\nto the customs administration. The risk analysis indicates that recipients\nshould be divided into three categories: end users with the capacity for bulk\nstorage, service stations and distributors of duty-paid fuel. In the case of a\ndomestic movement of fuel duty-paid, customs could verify the origin of the\nproduct and its region of destination. In cases of atypical routes or\ninexplicably long transport times, customs could investigate whether\nconsignments had been diverted from the regional destination initially\ndeclared.\nArguments\nof France concerning the impact on the internal market and state aid aspects\nThe French authorities indicate that the\nmeasure would not affect the proper functioning of the internal market, in\nparticular since the scope of the measure is confined to fuels for non\u2011commercial\nuse. Moreover, the variations between distribution networks in the retail price\nof fuel for non\u2011commercial use are greater than the amount of variations\nthat can result from the measure. According to the French authorities, no\ncomplaints about distortive effects of the measure have been received during\nits application. \nAs regards the exclusion from the scope of\nthe measure of gas oil for commercial use, French or EU road hauliers who meet\nthe conditions for partial refund of excise on gas oil for commercial use would\nbe subject to the same rate of excise duty, irrespective of the region in which\nthey bought the fuel. The planned arrangements would maintain the current\nrefund procedure, completely offsetting the effects of the rate reductions\ndecided on by the regions through equivalent reductions in the amount of the\nrefund on gas oil for commercial use. The arrangements would not therefore\ndistort competition in the transport sector or affect trade within the EU. They\nwould not constitute a state aid, the French authorities submit, since road\nhaulage companies would be subject to the same rate of excise duty on gas oil\nfor commercial use irrespective of the region in which they bought it.\nArguments\nof France concerning the period of application of the measure\nWith regard to the duration of the\narrangement, France stresses that to allow the policies pursued by the regions\nto apply for a certain length of time the derogation should be renewed for a\nperiod of six years. The three-year period set by Decision 2011/38/EU has\nproven particularly short and was justified only by the unusual nature of the\nmeasure and the concerns of Member States which feared that it might distort\ncompetition. Initially the measure in question was to accompany the move\ntowards decentralisation in France. In this context, a period of application of\nthree years is particularly short and unsuited to the objective pursued since\nsuch a timescale does not provide any clarity to the regions. Since none of the\nsupposed difficulties associated with the measure has materialised, the French\nauthorities therefore request a period of application of six years for the renewal\nof this derogation.\nAssessment\nof the measure under Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\nSpecific policy considerations\nArticle 19(1), first subparagraph, of the\nDirective reads as follows: \nIn addition to the provisions set out in the\nprevious Articles, in particular in Articles 5, 15 and 17, the Council, acting\nunanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member State to introduce further exemptions or reductions for specific policy\nconsiderations.\nAccording to Decision 2011/38/EU, the\nnational measure in question fulfils this requirement. It follows from the\nDecision that the regional differentiation of rates, as part of a wider\ndecentralisation policy, aims at the specific policy objective of increasing\nadministrative effectiveness. It was considered that the possibility of\nregional differentiation offers regions an additional incentive to improve the\nquality of their administration in a transparent fashion. The same decision\nrequires that the reductions be linked to the socio-economic conditions of the\nregions in which they were applied.\nIn this regard, the information supplied by\n  France confirmed that a link can indeed be established between application of\na regional rate below the national rate and the socio-economic conditions of the\nregions concerned. \nDuring the period of application of\nDecision 2011/38/EU (2010, 2011 and 2012), respectively two (Poitou-Charentes\nand Corse), five (Ile-de-France, Poitou-Charentes, Rhone-Alps,\nProvence-Alps-Cote d'Azur and Corse) and three regions (Poitou-Charentes,\nRhone-Alps and Corse) applied a downward tax differentiation.\nMost of the regions which applied the\ndownward adjustment reported GDP per capita below the national average. One of\nthe regions in addition reported a higher unemployment rate compared to the\naverage national level of unemployment. \nIt can therefore be concluded that the\npossibility to modulate the national rate downward seems to have offered the\nregional authorities the possibility to use the tax in question in a way\nadapted to the socio-economic circumstances prevalent in their territory. \nConsistency with the other policies and\nobjectives of the Union.\nAccording to Article 19(1), third\nsubparagraph, of the Directive, each request shall be examined taking into account, inter alia, the proper functioning of the internal\nmarket, the need to ensure fair competition and Community health, environment,\nenergy and transport policies.\nThis examination has already been conducted\nat the occasion of the previous requests by France and which has led to the\nadoption of Decision 2005/767/EC and Decision 2011/38/EU. As stated in these\nDecisions, the general mechanics of the measure were found not to create any\nobstacles to intra-EU trade; at the same time a number of conditions were fixed\nin order to ensure that the application of the derogation would not lead to any\nproblem with the functioning of the internal market and would not counteract\nthe achievement of the EU's policy objectives especially in the fields of\nenergy, climate change and environment. \nFor a possible renewal of the scheme as\nrequested by France, the Commission therefore has to assess whether, in light\nof the conditions laid down in Article 1(2) and (3) of the previous decision,\ncompliance with the objectives and policies set out in Article 19(1), third\nsubparagraph, of the Directive, has been achieved during its application, so\nthat the same can be predicted, in principle, for the period from 1 January 2013.\n\nIn this context, it has also to be verified\nwhether the EU policy context has undergone a relevant change since the\nadoption of Decision 2011/38/EU or risks to undergo a future change material to\nthe assessment.\nInternal market and fair competition\nThe risk of competitive distortions was\nconsidered low as Decision 2005/767/EC and Decision 2011/38/EU set low maximum\namounts for the reductions. Hence, the differentiation of duty rates between\nregions remains small and might not even exceed price differences between\ndistribution networks. Moreover, commercially used gas oil is excluded from the\napplication of the measure.\nAs for the levels of differentiation, a\nstrict limit was set namely that the reductions are no greater than \u20ac35.4 per\n1000 litres of unleaded petrol or \u20ac23.0 per 1000 litres of gas oil. This\ncondition has been respected by France. \nThe experience gathered with the\napplication of the derogation does not seem to raise doubts as to the\nassessment reached in 2005 and 2011. The Commission is not aware of any\ncomplaints about distortive effects of the measure on intra-EU trade. \nNo obstacles to the proper functioning of\nthe internal market have been reported either as regards more particularly the\ncirculation of the products in question in their capacity as products subject\nto excise duty.\nAs regards the State aid aspect, it should\nfirst be repeated that commercially used gas oil is excluded from the measure.\nHowever, as far as other business users not falling under the definition of\nArticle 7(3) of the Energy Taxation Directive benefiting from the reduced rates\nare concerned, or to the extent that competition on the level of producers of\noil products is affected, the measure might constitute State aid in accordance with\nArticle 107(1) of the TFEU. Provided that the reduced rates are above the EU\nminima, to the extent the measure would constitute State aid, it would be\ncovered by Article 25 of Regulation 800/2008/EC[4]\n(the \"General Block Exemption Regulation\") and would thus be\nconsidered compatible with the internal market. However, as the period of\nvalidity of the General Block Exemption Regulation ends on 31 December 2013 any\naid inherent in the measure would need to be notified to the Commission under\nState aid rules, in case the Commission would not have adopted a new Regulation\ncomparable to the General Block Exemption Regulation or in case such new\nRegulation would not contain a rule equivalent to the present Article 25.\nUnion energy, climate change and\nenvironment policies\nTaxes on energy products have the effect of\nlowering the demand for these products and therefore also reduce emissions\nrelated to their consumption. The Commission therefore has to assess whether\nthe reduction of rates applied in certain regions does not lead to an increase\nin fuel consumption (and thus related emissions) that would be in contradiction\nwith the objectives quoted above.\nDecision 2011/38/EC noted that the\nintroduction of the possibility for a downward adjustment of rates was\naccompanied by an increase in the underlying national rate in France. It concluded that it was unlikely that the overall effect of the new scheme would\nbe a reduced incentive for fuel efficiency since the application of the\nderogation did not allow regions to go below the rate in force on national\nlevel before the introduction of the scheme. Decision 2011/38/EC also concluded\nthat there was little risk that the regional variations would lead to\ndifferences in retail prices that would induce traffic detours as the level of\ndifferentiation was low and these were superseded by differences in retail\nprices among distribution networks. It was therefore expected that the measure\nwould not, in principle, come into contradiction with EU energy, climate change\nand environment policy.\nNo new elements regarding these matters\nhave come to the Commission's attention, and the assessment referred to remains\nvalid.\nPeriod of\napplication of the measure and development of the EU framework on Energy\nTaxation\nThe Commission proposal of 13 April 2011\nfor a revision of the Energy Taxation Directive[5]\nprovides for a permanent derogation that would allow France, within certain\nlimits, to apply differentiated levels of taxation at the level of the French\nregions. Hence, the Commission is of the view that the period of application of\na new Council Decision should be limited to three years and shall, in any case,\nexpire on the day on which those modified rules become applicable.\nIndependently from the above, it should als\nbe recalled that, according to the above mentioned proposal energy taxation\nwould be split into two components. This system would be different from the one\nof Directive 2003/96/EC as it currently stands and on which the present\nauthorisation is based. It is important not to undermine such future general\ndevelopments of the existing legal framework. Consequently, it is also appropriate\nto provide that, should the Council, acting on the basis of Article 113 of the\nTreaty, introduce a modified general system for the taxation of energy products\nto which the present authorisation would not be adapted, this Decision shall\nexpire on the day on which those modified rules become applicable.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested\nparties\nThis\nproposal is based on a request made by France and concerns only this Member State.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was\nno need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThis\nproposal concerns an authorisation for an individual Member State upon its own request.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe\nproposal aims at authorising France to derogate from the general provisions of\nCouncil Directive 2003/96/EC and to apply,\nwithin defined limits, differentiated levels of taxation to gas oil and\nunleaded petrol. \nLegal basis\nArticle 19\nof Council Directive 2003/96/EC.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe field\nof indirect taxation covered by Article 113 TFEU is not in itself within the\nexclusive competence of the Community within the meaning of Article 3 TFEU.\nHowever,\nthe exercise by Member States of their concurrent competences in this field is\nstrictly circumscribed and limited by existing EU law. Pursuant to Article 19\nof Directive 2003/96/EC, only the Council is empowered to authorise a Member State to introduce further exemptions or reductions within the meaning of that\nprovision. Member States cannot substitute themselves for the Council. \nThe\nproposal therefore respects the principle of subsidiarity. \nProportionality principle\nThe\nproposal respects the principle of proportionality. The tax reduction does not\nexceed what is necessary to attain the objective in question.\nChoice of instruments\nInstrument\nproposed: Council Decision.\nArticle 19\nof Directive 2003/96 makes provision for this type of measure only.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe measure\ndoes not impose any financial and administrative burden on the EU. The proposal\ntherefore has no impact on the EU budget.\n2013/0018 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nauthorising France to apply reduced levels\nof taxation to petrol and gas oil used as motor fuels in accordance with\nArticle 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to Council Directive\n2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the\ntaxation of energy products and electricity[6],\nand in particular Article 19(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Implementing Decision\n2011/38/EU (hereafter \"Decision 2011/38/EU\") authorises France to\napply, for a period of three years, differentiated levels of taxation to gas\noil and unleaded petrol for the purposes of an administrative reform involving\nthe decentralisation of certain specific powers previously exercised by central\ngovernment. Decision 2011/38/EU expires on 31 December 2012.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter dated 10\nFebruary 2012, France requested authorisation to continue to apply\ndifferentiated rates of taxation under the same conditions for a further six\nyears after 31 December 2012.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2011/38/EC was\nadopted on the basis that the measure requested by France met the requirements\nset out in Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC, allowing tax exemption or\nreduction, but no tax increase, for specific policy reasons. In particular, it\nwas considered that the measure would not hinder the proper functioning of the\ninternal market. It was also considered that it was in conformity with the\nrelevant Community policies. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The national\nmeasure is part of a policy designed to increase administrative effectiveness\nby improving the quality and reducing the cost of public services, as well as a\npolicy of subsidiarity. It offers regions an additional incentive to improve\nthe quality of their administration in a transparent fashion. In this respect, Decision 2011/38/EU requires that the reductions\nbe linked to the socio-economic circumstances of the\nregions in which they are applied.\nConsequently, a number of regions with either lower than average GDP or higher than\naverage unemployment have applied lower rates. Overall, the national measure is\nbased on specific policy considerations. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The tight limits set for\nthe reduction of rates on a regional basis as well as the exclusion of gas oil\nused for commercial purposes from the measure imply that the risk of\ncompetitive distortions in the internal market is very low. Moreover, the\napplication of the measure so far has shown a strong tendency on behalf of\nregions to levy the maximum rate allowable, which has further decreased any\npotential for competitive distortions.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No obstacles to the proper\nfunctioning of the internal market have been reported as regards, more\nparticularly, the circulation of the products in question in their capacity as\nproducts subject to excise duty.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When originally requested,\nthe national measure had been preceded by a tax increase equal to the margin\nfor regional reductions. Against this background and in light of the conditions\nof the authorisation as well as experience gathered, the national measure does\nnot, at this stage, appear to be in conflict with EU energy and climate change policies.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from Article\n19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC that each authorisation granted under this\nArticle must be strictly limited in time. Moreover, the Commission proposal for\na Council Directive amending Directive 2003/96/EC restructuring the Community\nframework for the taxation of energy products and electricity[7] provides for a permanent rule allowing\n  France, within certain limits, to apply differentiated levels of taxation at\nthe level of the French regions. It is therefore appropriate to limit the\nperiod of application of this Decision to three years and to stipulate that, in\nany event, this Decision expires once the said permanent rule becomes\napplicable. Moreover, in order not to undermine future general developments of\nthe existing legal framework, it is also important to provide that, should the\nCouncil introduce a modified general system for the taxation of energy products\nto which the present authorisation would not be adapted, this Decision shall\nexpire on the day on which the rules on this modified system become applicable.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be ensured that France can apply the specific reduction to which this Decision relates seamlessly following\non from the situation existing before 1 January 2013, under Decision 2011/38/EU.\nThe authorisation requested should therefore be granted with effect from 1\nJanuary 2013.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Decision is without\nprejudice to the application of the Union rules regarding State aid,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 France is hereby\nauthorised to apply reduced rates of taxation to unleaded petrol and gas oil\nused as motor fuel.
