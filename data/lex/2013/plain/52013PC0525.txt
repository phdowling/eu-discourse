European statistics are also indispensable for ensuring that Europe is understood by the general public and for allowing citizens to take part in the\r\ndemocratic process and debate the present and future of the EU.\nAgainst this background, Regulation (EU) No\r\n99/2013 on the European statistical programme 2013-17 was adopted on 15 January\r\n2013 to provide an overall framework for the development, production and\r\ndissemination of European statistics over the period from 2013 to 2017.\nThe Commission proposal for this Regulation\r\nincluded a financial envelope of EUR 299.2 million for the five years of the\r\nprogramme, which was questioned by neither the Council nor the European Parliament\r\nduring the ordinary legislative procedure. However, in its resolution of 13\r\nJune 2012 on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and own resources, the\r\nEuropean Parliament stressed that the negotiations on the legislative proposals\r\nrelating to the multiannual programmes would be finalised once an agreement on\r\ntheir financial envelopes had been reached.\nThis is why Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 only\r\nsets the financial envelope for 2013, covered by the programming period\r\n2007-2013, and invites the Commission to make a legislative proposal\r\nintroducing the financial allocation for the period 2014-2017 to the European\r\nParliament and the Council no later than three months after the adoption of the\r\nMFF for the years 2014-2020.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nInterested parties had been consulted and\r\nan impact assessment conducted for the proposal for a Regulation on the European\r\nstatistical programme 2013-17, COM(2011) 928 final of 21.12.2011, which\r\nincluded the budget for 2014-2017. \nTherefore no further consultation or\r\nassessment is deemed necessary. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposal provides the financial envelope\r\nfor the four years of the European statistical programme 2013-17 that are\r\ncovered by the programming period 2014-2020 (MFF). For this purpose it is\r\nproposed to amend Article 7 on financing.\nOther provisions of the Regulation\r\nestablishing the European statistical programme 2013-17 remain unchanged, in\r\nparticular the objectives and the annex defining statistical outputs for the\r\nfive years covered. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nSince the specific objectives and\r\nstatistical outputs for the five-year period are set in the Regulation, the\r\namount of budget proposed for the period from 2014 to 2017 is EUR 234.8\r\nmillion, covered by the programming period 2014-2020.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposed Regulation concerns an EEA matter\r\nand should therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n2013/0249 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 on the\r\nEuropean statistical programme 2013-17\n(Text with relevance for the EEA and for Switzerland)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 99/2013\r\non the European statistical programme 2013-17[1]\r\nprovides the framework and defines the objectives and outputs for the\r\nproduction, development and dissemination of European statistics for the period\r\nfrom 2013 to 2017.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 99/2013\r\nonly sets the financial envelope for 2013, covered by the programming period\r\n2007 to 2013, and invites the Commission to submit a legislative proposal\r\nintroducing the financial allocation for the period 2014 to 2017 to the\r\nEuropean Parliament and the Council no later than three months after the\r\nadoption of the multiannual financial framework for the period 2014 to 2020.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EU) No\r\n\u2026/\u2026 laying down the Multiannual Financial Framework for the programming period\r\n2014 to 2020 was adopted on \u2026\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 99/2013\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EU) No 99/2013 is amended as\r\nfollows:\nArticle 7 is replaced by the following: \n\u201cArticle 7 \nFinancing\n(1) The Union financial envelope for the\r\nimplementation of the programme for 2013 is set at EUR 57.3 million, covered by\r\nthe programming period 2007 to 2013.

It\r\nmust lay down priorities concerning the needs for information for the purpose\r\nof carrying out the activities of the European Union. The target beneficiaries\r\nof the proposal are the users and producers of European statistics, i.e. the\r\nEuropean Parliament and the Council, the Commission Directorates-General, the\r\nEuropean Central Bank, the National Statistical Institutes and other national\r\nproducers of European statistics, the ESAC, the Committee on Monetary, Financial\r\nand Balance of payments statistics (CMFB) and other non-institutional users,\r\nand, of course, the general public.\n1.5.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nPolicymakers and actors in the market constantly need statistics in\r\norder to make decisions and monitor and evaluate their implementation.\r\nStatistics provide an essential infrastructure for democracies and modern\r\neconomies to function soundly and efficiently. The European Union needs a\r\nhigh-quality statistical information service in order to fulfil its mission.\r\nEuropean statistics must be reliable, timely and independent of political\r\ninfluence and provided in a convenient form for users. Furthermore, their\r\npreparation should not impose an excessive burden on data providers and their\r\ncollection must be undertaken in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity\r\nand proportionality.\nTogether with the national statistical authorities and other\r\nnational authorities responsible in each Member State for the development,\r\nproduction and dissemination of European statistics, Eurostat has created a\r\npartnership collectively called the ESS. This partnership also includes the EEA\r\ncountries. Member States collect data and compile statistics for national and\r\nEU purposes.\nThe ESS functions as a network in which Eurostat\u2019s role is to lead\r\nthe way in the harmonisation of statistics in close cooperation with the\r\nnational statistical authorities. ESS work concentrates mainly on EU policy\r\nareas \u2014 and, with the extension of EU policies, harmonisation has been extended\r\nto nearly all statistical fields. \nThe ESS facilitates the sharing of knowledge and \u2018best practices\u2019\r\nacross Member States and the development of new technologies, common tools and\r\ncollaborative networks with a view to taking advantage of possible synergies\r\nand avoiding duplication of effort, thus paving the way for a modern production\r\nsystem equipped to meet future challenges.\nEfforts to harmonise, streamline and regulate can best be initiated\r\nat European Union level, where such projects can be carried out with optimal\r\nefficiency.\n1.5.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nA major constraint encountered with the Community Statistical\r\nProgramme 2008-2012[5]\r\nis that the structure is fixed for a period of five years and the objectives\r\nare described in detail. Since the current programme was adopted, a number of\r\nimportant developments have taken place. The basic legal framework for the\r\nproduction of European statistics has changed. The Communication on the\r\nproduction method of EU statistics has been adopted, followed by a joint ESS\r\nstrategy; the Lisbon Treaty has come into force; a new European Commission has\r\ntaken office (as of January 2010 until December 2014); several new political\r\ninitiatives (such as Europe 2020) have been launched and the ESS governance\r\nstructure has been reinforced. None of these developments are reflected in the\r\ncurrent programme; parts of it have become outdated and there is a gap between\r\nplanned and actual activities. This diminishes the relevance of the reporting\r\non the implementation of the programme as many relevant activities are not\r\nreflected in the programme while we have to report on some activities that are\r\nmentioned in it but are no longer carried out. \nWith regard to the process of preparing the European statistical\r\nprogramme, the Partnership Group[6]\r\nTask Force 3 proposed the multiannual programming cycle for 2013-2017. It was\r\nsuggested that the role of the ESS partners (ESS Committee, DGINS, Directors\u2019\r\nGroups and ESAC) be strengthened in the programme preparation process.\nIt should also be mentioned that the Commission\u2019s report to the\r\nEuropean Parliament (EP) and the Council on the ex-post evaluation of the community\r\nstatistical programme (CSP) 2003-2007[7]\r\nincluded recommendations with regard to future multiannual programmes, namely: \nImprove the link between the CSP and annual work programmes. The CSP is designed to be a framework programme formulating a\r\nstrategic vision for five years and ensuring, together with the annual work\r\nprogrammes, the CSP\u2019s flexibility and relevance over the entire period. In\r\nusing the CSP as a reference, the annual work programmes should make explicit\r\nmention of and be based on the relevant CSP.\nImprove monitoring of CSP implementation. Overall monitoring of the CSP should be done by defining a key set\r\nof indicators that provide sufficient information on the achievement of\r\noperational and strategic objectives over the programme period.\nThe Commission\u2019s report to the EP and the Council on the mid-term\r\nevaluation of the CSP 2008-2012 highlighted the following points to be taken\r\ninto account in the future:\n- Definition of new needs for statistical information. A more\r\nintegrated approach using multiple and combined data sources together with\r\nharmonisation of methodology, concepts and definitions is required.\n- Strengthened partnership in the ESS. Establishment of more\r\nand different integration cooperation models with the Member States was\r\nemphasised.\n- Reflection on conceptual approach to reprioritisation of\r\nactivities and availability of resources for implementing the CSP in order\r\nto reduce response burden and producers\u2019 costs was considered necessary.\nIt is worth mentioning that the current CSP 2008-2012 was one of the\r\nsubjects of the Eurostat Internal Audit Capacity\u2019s audit report on the\r\nevaluation function[8],\r\nwhich noted the absence of an ex-ante evaluation for the current programme and\r\nrecommended that such an evaluation should be carried out for future programmes\r\nin accordance with the Financial Regulation[9] (Article 27) and its\r\nImplementing Rules[10]\r\n(Article 21).\nTo avoid the limitations of too detailed a programme in order to be\r\nable to adapt to new or changing political priorities and developments, the ESP\r\n2013-2017 is designed as a general planning instrument describing in a general\r\nway the objectives to be met and actions to be undertaken, thus providing the\r\noverall framework for the preparation of annual statistical work programmes\r\nwith detailed objectives and actions.\nDevelopments in the ESS as well as the implementation of the\r\nCommunication on the production method of EU statistics require the European\r\nstatistical programme 2013-2017 to focus particularly on meeting future\r\nchallenges and balancing demands and resources. A strong ESS partnership is\r\ncrucial and more extensive consultation of stakeholders has therefore been\r\nintegrated into the roadmap for the preparation of this programme.\nDrawing on past experience, mechanisms are being put in place to\r\nensure consistency in planning and reporting processes by better linking the\r\nprogramme\u2019s objectives with annual work programmes and improving the monitoring\r\nand evaluation of programme implementation.\nThe recommendations of the mid-term evaluation of the CSP 2008-20125\r\nhave been taken into account when drafting the objectives and indicators of the\r\nESP 2013-2017. In particular, with regard to reprioritisation of statistical\r\nrequirements aiming at the reduction of response burden and producers\u2019 costs, provision has been made for the implementation of the priority-setting\r\nmechanism, as presented to the ESS Committee on 18 November 2010[11].\nFinally, the ex-ante evaluation was prepared\r\nin accordance with the Financial Regulation[12]\r\n(Article 27) and its Implementing Rules[13]\r\n(Article 21).\n1.5.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\r\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nAlong with the current CSP 2008-2012, another multiannual programme,\r\nnamely the Programme for the Modernisation of European Enterprise and Trade\r\nStatistics (MEETS), is being implemented from 2009 to 2013. In order to manage\r\nthe programmes more efficiently, Eurostat decided to have one multiannual\r\nprogramme in future instead of two. This means that the objectives in the area\r\nof enterprise and trade statistics beyond 2013 and actions related to the\r\nmodernisation of social statistics are part of the ESP 2013-2017.\nIn addition, Eurostat has a coordinating role in the area of\r\nproduction of European statistics in line with Commission Decision 2012/504/EU\r\nof 17 September 2012. Commission Directorates-General and other services\r\ninvolve Eurostat at an early stage in the development of their programmes\r\nrelated to statistics.\n1.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00fe Proposal/initiative\r\nof limited duration\n\u2013     \r\n\u00fe Proposal/initiative\r\nin effect from [01/01] 2014 to [31/12] 2017\n\u2013     \r\n\u00fe Financial impact\r\nfrom 2014 to 2017 for commitment appropriations and from 2014 to 2021 for\r\npayment appropriations.\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\r\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\r\nenvisaged[14] \n\u00fe Centralised direct management by the Commission\n\u00a8 Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[15]\r\n\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\r\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\r\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\r\n\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations, in particular with the OECD, the\r\nUnited Nations and the World Bank.\nIf more than one\r\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and\r\nreporting rules \nSpecify frequency\r\nand conditions.\nThe ex-ante evaluation of the ESP 2013-17 was carried out on the\r\nbasis of the provisions of the Financial Regulation for expenditure programmes\r\nbetween October 2010 and April 2011 by the Strategic Planning unit of Eurostat\r\nwith the help of the Financial and Legal Affairs units. It was discussed with\r\nthe internal Eurostat Task Force for the preparation of the ESP 2013-17\r\ncomposed of representatives at Head of Unit level from all the Directorates of\r\nEurostat and then approved at the Eurostat Directors\u2019 meeting on 12 April 2011.\nThe key findings of the ex-ante evaluation were incorporated into\r\nthe Legislative Financial Statement. Lessons learnt from past experience that\r\nwere taken into account when establishing the ESP are presented in the\r\nLegislative Financial Statement, Part 1.5.3 \u2018Lessons learned from similar\r\nexperiences in the past\u2019. The objectives of the ESP are presented in the\r\nproposal itself. \nArticle 2 of the proposal stipulates that the ESP will be subject to\r\nannual planning through the Commission\u2019s annual statistical work programmes in\r\nline with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009. These programmes and their corresponding\r\nfinancing will be the subject of Commission decisions detailing the outputs and\r\nresults (objectives and indicators) to be achieved during the reference period.\r\nMonitoring will be ensured through regular reports on the consumption of\r\nresources and on progress made in the achievement of objectives.\nWith regard to reporting it is expected that, in line with the\r\nRegulation on European statistics, an interim progress report will be prepared\r\nand, after the ESS Committee has been consulted, submitted to the European\r\nParliament and the Council no later than June 2015.\nAt the end of the period covered by the programme, the ESP will be\r\nsubject to an ex-post evaluation. The ESS Committee will be consulted on the\r\nevaluation report, which will be submitted to the European Parliament and the\r\nCouncil by the end of 2018.\n2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\r\nsystem \n2.2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThe management mode of the proposed programme is central direct\r\nmanagement by the Commission and to a limited extent joint management with international\r\norganisations. From a financial point of view the programme will be implemented\r\nby awarding contracts, in particular to firms specialised in statistics or\r\ninformatics services, and by grants financing provided mainly to national statistical\r\nauthorities. Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European Statistics allows for direct\r\nawards of grants to those authorities. \nThe main risks identified for the implementation of the programme come\r\nmainly from the management of grant procedures. As is apparent from the\r\nimplementation of the Community Statistical Programme 2008-2012, some\r\nbeneficiaries experienced difficulties in submitting the required documentation\r\nto determine the eligibility of costs incurred.\n2.2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control method(s)\r\nenvisaged \nThe main elements of the internal control system are: Ex-ante\r\nverification of each financial transaction\u2019s operational and financial\r\naspects (legality, regularity and sound financial management) according to\r\nArticle 49(3) of the Implementing Rules of the Financial Regulation. Ex-ante\r\ncontrols cover the whole expenditure life cycle, from planning and programming\r\nto commitments and payments. To this end, for each financial transaction,\r\ncontrols following specific checklists have to be used by each actor in the\r\nfinancial circuits. \nNot only financial circuits, but also appropriate supervision,\r\nfinancial and performance-based reporting, audit and evaluation contribute to\r\nimplementation of the programme\u2019s budget in accordance with the principles of\r\nsound financial management and for ensuring that the requirements of legality\r\nand regularity are complied with. Complementarity will be ensured between the\r\naforementioned sources of assurance, to avoid duplication of effort and allow\r\nfor cost-efficiency of controls.\nAgainst the background of the comprehensive and compulsory controls\r\napplied to each financial transaction that will be authorised under the\r\nprogramme, the following additional control actions will be applied to the\r\nmanagement of grant procedures. In addition to ex-ante controls described above\r\nand based on an annual risk analysis, reinforced ex-ante and ex-post\r\nverification will be performed. Reinforced ex-ante verifications will be\r\ncarried out on a sample basis, i.e. in-depth controls of additional supporting\r\ndocumentation before final payments for co-financed grant actions. Furthermore,\r\nand based on experience gained since 2005, ex-post controls will be\r\ncarried out in order to check that operations financed by the budget are\r\ncorrectly implemented and in particular that the criteria set out for the\r\nex-ante verification are complied with. Specific emphasis will be put on reducing\r\nadministrative complexity and therefore the likelihood of errors linked to the\r\nmanagement of grants. This will be achieved in particular by focusing on bigger\r\nprojects (and limitation of small grants), requirements of specific audit\r\ncertificates, and last but not least by the introduction of alternative options\r\nto payments based on actual costs, i.e. grants based on flat rates and scales\r\nof unit costs. \nCosts and benefits of controls: The\r\nprogramme control strategy is deemed to limit the risk of non-compliance to\r\nunder 2 %, which is in line with the assessment carried out under the\r\nAnnual Activity Report 2010. Given that the internal control objective for the\r\nnew programme is not to exceed an average residual error rate of 2 % for\r\nthe whole programming period from 2013 to 2017, the internal control system as\r\nwell as its costs is deemed adequate to achieve this objective. DG ESTAT\r\nconsiders that the costs of additional reinforced ex-ante and ex-post controls\r\nreferred to above remain at around 1 % of the programme budget, about the\r\nsame ratio as in the previous programme. In terms of nature and intensity of\r\ncontrols, 100 % of financial transactions (and thus 100 % of the\r\nbudget) will be subject to obligatory ex-ante controls in accordance with the\r\nFinancial Regulation. As outlined above, controls based on in-depth analysis of\r\nunderlying documentation will be undertaken following an annual risk analysis.\r\nThey may cover 4-6 % of the budget.\n2.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent\r\nfraud and irregularities \nSpecify existing or\r\nenvisaged prevention and protection measures.\nIn addition to the application of all regulatory control mechanisms,\r\nan anti-fraud strategy in line with the Commission\u2019s new anti-fraud strategy\r\n(CAFS) adopted on 24 June 2011 will be devised in order to ensure inter alia\r\nthat internal anti-fraud related controls are fully aligned with the CAFS and\r\nthat the fraud management risk approach is geared to identifying fraud risk\r\nareas and adequate responses. Where necessary, networking groups and adequate\r\nIT tools dedicated to analysing fraud cases related to the European Statistical\r\nProgramme will be set up.\nEurostat has defined a 2013-17 control strategy accompanying the\r\nimplementation of the ESP. Reducing complexity, applying cost-effective\r\nmonitoring procedures as well as conducting risk-based ex-ante and ex-post\r\ncontrols will aim to reduce the likelihood and contribute to the prevention of\r\nfraud. Specific awareness-raising measures and relevant training with regard to\r\nfraud prevention are part of the control strategy.\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL\r\nIMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      Existing expenditure budget lines \nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Description\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.] || Diff./non-diff.
