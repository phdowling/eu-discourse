Parts of the airspace governed by Norway and Iceland are high seas\nairspace within the ICAO NAT region. Consequently, Norway and Iceland have, as\nmembers of the Chicago Convention and in accordance with the established\nprocedures, rights, obligations and responsibilities to provide air traffic\nservices, where uniform rules apply in accordance with the requirements of\nannexes 2 and 11 of the Chicago Convention. Furthermore, a long standing\nagreement regarding the airspace serviced by Iceland enables operations that\nare comparable, and serve the objectives of a functional airspace block as\ndefined by the SES regulations.\nThe services in the NAT region are based on\nICAO requirements, the Organisation\u2019s Global Air Navigation Plan and the vision\nstatement on the global Air Traffic Management. There is consistency to a great\nextent between the objectives of the ICAO Global Air Navigation Plan and the\nregional requirements in the NAT region on the one hand, and the objectives\nreflected in the SES packages I and II on the other. However, some objectives\nof the SES II, e.g. aiming at solving congestion problems in the EUR region,\nmight not be relevant or unnecessarily burdensome in the NAT region. To this\nend regional or national performance targets are more relevant to the services\nprovided by Iceland within the NAT region.\nRegulation (EC) No 549/2004\nParticipation in the Single Sky\nCommittee (Article 5), adaptation (a):\nThe current adaptation allows, without\nprejudice to Article 100 EEA, the EFTA States\u2019 right to full participation in\nthe Committee. This adaptation is retained. Due to the increased role of the\nEFTA Surveillance Authority after the incorporation of Regulation (EC) No\n1070/2009, the adaptation text also would allow that the EFTA Surveillance\nAuthority can be present as observer in the meetings of the Committee. \nThe application of Article 11 to\nIceland, adaptation (b):\nIn order to adapt Article 11 to the special\ncircumstances in Iceland, an adaptation has been added so that \u201cCommunity-wide\u201d\nshall read \u201cregional or national\u201d.\nCommunity wide performance targets\n(Article 11):\nThe Commission will adopt Community-wide\nperformance targets. Those targets will only apply to the EFTA States once the\nCommission decisions are incorporated into the EEA Agreement. \nApplicability of Article 11 to Iceland\nAs the current reference period ends on 31\nDecember 2014, Article 11 shall not apply to Iceland until 1 January 2015. As\nthere are no performance scheme requirements currently in force for Iceland\nthis will give Iceland the time to prepare a scheme before the requirements\ntake effect and will allow the reference period for Iceland to be in sync with\nthe European reference period.\nThe designation of a Performance Review\nBody (Article 11(2)), adaptation (d):\nIn line with the two pillar structure of\nthe EEA Agreement, the Performance Review Body (\u2018PRB\u2019) has to be separately\ndesignated for the EFTA States. With a view to ensuring consistency, coherence\nand homogeneity, the same PRB designated for the EU Member States should be\ndesignated for the EFTA States as well.. \nSurveillance tasks (Article 11(3)(c) and\n(e)), adaptations (e) and (f):\nFor functional airspace blocks, which\nexclusively cover the area of either one or more EFTA States or one or more EU\nMember States, the EFTA Surveillance Authority or the Commission, respectively,\nwill carry out the tasks and exercise the powers set out in the points. \nThe adaptation concerning letter (c) sets\nout the rules related to functional airspace blocks which cover the area of\nboth one or more EFTA States and one or more EU Member States. The adaptation\nupholds the two pillar system by conferring the competence to carry out tasks\nregarding the EFTA States to the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the competence\nregarding the EU Member States to the Commission. \nThe adaptation for letter (e) is based on\nthe same line of reasoning as the adaptation for letter (c). This adaptation,\nhowever, foresees that the assessment of the EFTA Surveillance Authority with\nregards to functional airspace blocks which also cover the area of one or more\nEU Member States shall be presented jointly to the Single Sky Committee, and\nnot to a separate Committee in the EFTA pillar. This adaptation is motivated by\nthe fact that the Single Sky Committee is highly specialised and that the\nparticular EFTA issues are expected to be so interlinked with the EU issues\nthat a separate discussion in an EFTA Committee would not be viable.\nCoordination with EASA (Article 13a),\nadaptation (g):\nThe adaptation ensures that the EFTA States\nand the EFTA Surveillance Authority, like the EU Member States and the\nCommission, shall coordinate with the EASA.\nRegulation (EC) No 550/2004\nFunctional airspace blocks (Articles\n9a(2)(c) and 9a(2)(i)), adaptations (a) and (b):\nThe NAT region has a different regulatory\nobligation, as ICAO is the body proposing the set of rules governing the High\nSeas. The adaptation ensures this different regulatory context is taken into\naccount. The management of traffic flow is conducted by the NAT states\nthemselves on both sides of the Atlantic. It is therefore necessary that\nconsistency with European or NAT Route Network is ensured by Iceland.\nDispute resolution with regard to a\ncross-border functional airspace block (Article 9a(5)):\nThe procedure set out in Article 9a(5) will\nnot apply to the EFTA States, as sectoral adaptation III in Annex XIII sets out\na separate dispute resolution procedure for disputes involving one or more EFTA\nStates. There is therefore no need for any adaptation text.\nThe assessment of the functional\nairspace blocks (Article 9a(6)), adaptation (c):\nIf a functional airspace block covers only\nEU Member States or only EFTA States, Protocol 1 to the EEA Agreement will\napply, and, respectively, the Commission and the EFTA Surveillance Authority\nwill carry out the tasks set out in the point. The adaptation sets out the\nprocedure in case the functional airspace block covers both one or more EU\nMember States and one or more EFTA States. It ensures that the two pillar\nstructure of the EEA Agreement is adhered to as far as practically possible.\nRegulation (EC) No 551/2004\nNetwork management and design (Article\n6(2)), adaptations (a), (b) and (c):\nThis provision deals, inter alia, with the\nCommission\u2019s responsibilities and tasks in relation to network management and\ndesign. Furthermore, the Commission is given the power to entrust tasks to a\nnetwork manager, which was done on 7 July 2011. \nThe adaptation texts set out the necessary\nprovisions in order to designate a network mnager in the EFTA pillar by the EEA\nEFTA States. Accordingly, the Standing Committee of the EFTA States is given\nthe tasks and functions of the Commission. Clearly, in order to facilitate that\nthe work carried out in the two pillars are appropriately coordinated, it is important\nthat the same network manager is designated for the EEA EFTA States as has been\ndesignated for the EU Member States.\nAdaptation (c) ensures that the Standing\nCommittee of the EFTA States nominates the Network Manager for the EEA EFTA\nStates. Before the Network Manager is nominated, an agreement with the relevant\nmanager must be concluded. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE
