It is\naccordingly the Protocol and not the Convention that prevails as regards each\ncategory of mobile equipment. The Member States\u2019 obligations under the\nConvention vary with the Protocol to which they accede. The Convention can\napply to a category of mobile equipment only when the relevant Protocol comes\ninto force and only as between the Parties to that Protocol. But the Convention\nand the Protocol must then be read together as a single instrument.\nThe Convention applies when the debtor is\nsituated in a contracting State (Article 3) since the various protocols provide\nfor specific connecting factors (i.e. the State of registration). The interest\nestablished by the Convention (Articles 1 and 2) concerns the asset registered,\nbut also associated rights and proceeds, and the relevant protocol may provide\nfor the Convention to apply to the sale of an asset (Article 41 of the\nConvention). The Convention strengthens the rights of the beneficiaries of this\nunified interest in rem in mobile equipment assets if the debtor should default\non his obligations (Articles 8 to 15). The Convention finally establishes an\ninternational system for creditors to register interests in the various\ncategories of mobile equipment assets (Articles 16 to 26), giving priority to\nthe creditor's registered interest (Article 29).\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objectives\nof the Rail Protocol\nThis instrument is intended to facilitate\nthe financing of high-value railway rolling stock by creating a particularly\nstrong international guarantee for creditors (sellers on credit and\ninstitutions supplying credit for such sales) which gives them\n\"absolute\" priority over these assets in an international register.\nThe Rail Protocol fixes certain rules\nconcerning the priority and enforceability of registered international\ninterests for certain types of creditors financing rolling stock \u2013 i.e. the\nchargor, conditional seller or lessor. Furthermore the Protocol provides to\ncreditors specific default remedies (Article VII) and three alternatives for\nremedies on insolvency of the debtor (Article IX). Under Chapter III an\ninternational registry will be accessible through the internet and a\nSupervisory Authority is created. Finally Article XXV authorises under certain\nconditions Contracting States to make declarations on public service\nexemptions.\nThe Rail Protocol creates an international\nsystem of unique and unchangeable registration of international interests. The\nProtocol is complementary to, and supportive of, the European Vehicle\nIdentification Numbering system (adopted under the Railway Interoperability\nDirective). It guarantees that the parties can register and search against\ntheir interests from wherever they are within the EU, using internet thereby\nmaking the register accessible 24 hours/day.\nSuch instrument is likely to be of great\nbenefit to the European rail industry, banks and Governments by encouraging\ncapital investment in the rail sector and boosting the creation of a genuine\nlease market. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES \nThe Commission's initiative to propose the approval\nof the Rail Protocol, after the EU signature in 2009, was\npreceded by consultations with the Rail Working Group,\na cross-industry association dedicated to the implementation of the Rail\nProtocol, whose Members are, inter alia, Bombardier Transportation,\nDeutsche Bahn, English Welsh and Scottish Railways, European Investment Bank, Intergovernmental\nOrganisation for International Carriage by Rail (OTIF), UIC-International Union\nof Railways, Union of European Railway Industries. \nDuring the consultations, it was\nparticularly highlighted the close link between the conclusion of the Rail\nProtocol and the adoption of the 4th Railway Package on 30 January\n2013.\nThe 4th Railway Package is aimed at encouraging more innovation in EU\nrailways by opening EU domestic passenger markets to competition, simplifying\nthe procedures for authorisation of rolling stock and improving the governance\nof infrastructure. It comprises legislative proposals\nto amend 3 Directives and 2 Regulations together with a\nCommunication and 3 Reports[2]\nand stresses the importance of financing rolling stock in support of opening\nfinancial markets, which is the objective of the Rail Protocol.\nThe adoption of the Rail Protocol will\nsupport new investment in rolling stock in the EU with consequent benefit for\noperators and the public. It underpins in that way the EU's growth agenda, by\nencouraging more infrastructure investment and supporting jobs in the\nmanufacturing sector as well. \nThe Rail Protocol is also consistent with\nthe objective of supporting the shift to greener and more sustainable mode of\ntransport such as the rail transport, as highlighted in the 2011 Transport White\nPaper.[3]\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European Union powers\nThe Cape Town Convention and its Protocols\nfall partly under exclusive European Union competence. Accordingly,\nMember States cannot ratify the Protocols without first having the Protocols\napproved by the EU. \nBy means of Council decisions, the EU has\nindeed acceded to the Aircraft Protocol at the same time with the Cape Town\nConvention on 28.4.2009[4] and has signed the Rail Protocol on 10.12.2009[5]. A declaration on the competences of the European Community was\nmade at the time of signature of the Rail Protocol, following Article XXII(2) of the Rail Protocol which requires that at the time\nof signature, acceptance, approval or accession, the Regional Economic\nIntegration Organisation make a general declaration indicating the matters\ncovered by the Rail Protocol which fall in respect of which competences have\nbeen transferred to that Organisations by its Member States.\nThe paragraph 6 of the declaration on\nCommunity competence made at the time of signature should be amended in order\nto update it, namely to take into account Commission decision 2012/757/EU and correct the reference to Article\nV(2) of the Protocol which should be instead Article XIV. Therefore, at the\ntime of the approval, the declaration should be modified accordingly. The\nrevised text of the declaration on the European Union competences is set out in\nthe Annex. \nThe European Union has exclusive competence over certain\nmatters governed by the Rail Protocol and affecting Regulation (EC) No 44/2001\nof 22 December 2000 on Jurisdiction and the Recognition and\nEnforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters[6], Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on\ninsolvency proceedings[7] and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of 17\nJune 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I)[8]. Furthermore,\nthere is European Union legislation in matters governed by the Rail Protocol and affecting Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 17 June 2008 on interoperability of the Rail system\nwithin the Community (Recast)[9] and Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 of 29\nApril 2004 establishing a European railway agency[10].\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Declarations\non matters falling under the scope of European Union's exclusive competence\nSeveral rules of the Rail Protocol require\nor enable the contracting parties to make declarations as to the applicability\nor scope of its provisions or the way they will be implemented.\nThe European Union has the power to make\ndeclarations relating to the Articles VI, VIII, IX, and X of the Rail Protocol,\nwhose subject matter fall under its exclusive competence.\nArticle VI of the Rail Protocol (choice\nof law) provides that the parties to an agreement or related guarantee\ncontract can choose the applicable law. Hence, it regulates a matter covered by\nRegulation (EC) No 593/2008 of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual\nobligations (Rome I).\nThis extensive choice of law is not\ncompatible with the system established by Regulation No 593/2008. \nSimilarly to the solution chosen in Council\nDecision 2009/370/EC of 6 April 2009 on the accession of the European\nCommunity to the Convention on International\nInterests in Mobile Equipment and its Aircraft Protocol, the Member States of the European Union will continue to apply the\nprovisions of Regulation No 593/2008.\nAs Article VI applies only if a declaration\npursuant Article XXVII of the Rail Protocol is made, at the time of approval of\nthe Rail Protocol the European Union should not make a declaration concerning\nthe application of Article VI.\nArticle 55 of the Cape Town Convention, \"Modification\nof provisions regarding relief pending final determination\", foresees the possibility not to apply the provisions of Articles 13 or Article 43 or both, wholly or in part. Upon its\naccession to the Cape Town Convention, the European Union declared that\nArticles 13 and 43 will apply only in accordance with Article 31 of the\nBrussels I Regulation[11].\nIt must be stressed that that declaration is entirely applicable to the\nversions of Articles 13 and 43 of the Cape Town Convention as amended by the\nRail Protocol in its Article VIII. As stated in Article XXIX of the Rail\nProtocol \"Declarations under the Convention\", declarations\nmade under the Cape Town Convention, including that made under Article 55,\nshall be deemed to be made under the Rail Protocol unless stated otherwise. \nUnder Article VIII(1), Article VIII of the\nProtocol, which covers interim relief, applies in whole or in part only if a\nContracting State has made a positive declaration to that effect and to the\nextent stated in such declaration. Where a Contracting State makes such a\ndeclaration with regard to Article VIII(2), it must specify the required time\u2011period\nfor obtaining the forms of interim relief set out in Article 13(1) of the\nConvention. It is proposed that, similarly to what has been decided in the\ncontext of the accession to the Aircraft Protocol, the European Union should\nnot make the declaration referred to in Article VIII pursuant to Article\nXXVII(2).\nArticle IX (Remedies\non insolvency) and Article X (Insolvency assistance) are\nvirtually identical to the correspondent provisions of the Aircraft Protocol\nwhere the Council decided not to opt-in. Indeed, the above-mentioned provisions\napply only where a Contracting State that is the primary insolvency\njurisdiction makes a positive declaration to this effect pursuant to Article\nXXVII.\nThe\nCommission considers that, where the primary insolvency jurisdiction is in an\nEU Member State, Regulation No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency\nproceedings should in any case be applicable instead of the Rail Protocol,\nsimilarly to what has been decided in relation to the Cape Town Convention and\nits Aircraft Protocol. To achieve this objective and preserve certainty in the\nlaw, it recommends that the European Union should not opt for full or partial\napplication of either of the alternatives set out in Article IX of the\nProtocol. \nIt follows\nthat it is proposed that the European Union should not make the declaration\nreferred to in Article IX of the Protocol pursuant to Article XXVII(3), or the\ndeclaration on insolvency assistance referred to in Article X, which is\nlinked to that in Article IX, pursuant to Article XXVII(1).\n2013/0184 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL\nDECISION\non the approval,\non behalf of the European Union, of the Luxembourg Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile\nEquipment on Matters specific to Railway Rolling Stock, adopted in Luxembourg on 23 February 2007\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion, and in particular Article 81(2), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\nEuropean Parliament[12],\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union is working towards the establishment of\na common judicial area based on the principle of mutual recognition of judicial\ndecisions.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Protocol to the\nConvention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (hereinafter referred\nto as the \"Cape Town Convention\") on matters specific to railway\nrolling stock (hereinafter referred to as the \"Rail Protocol\"), adopted\nin Luxembourg on 23 February 2007, makes a useful contribution to the\nregulation at international level. It is therefore desirable that the\nprovisions of this instrument which concern matters falling within the\nexclusive competence of the European Union should be applied as soon as\npossible. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission negotiated\nthe Rail Protocol on behalf of the European Community, for the parts falling\nwithin the exclusive competence of the European Community.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article XXII(1) of the\nRail Protocol provides that Regional Economic Integration Organisations, which\nhave competence over certain matters governed by the Rail Protocol, may sign,\naccept, approve or accede to the said Protocol.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some of the matters\ngoverned by Regulation\n(EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition\nand enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters [13],\nRegulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency\nproceedings [14],\nRegulation (EC) No 593/2008 of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to\ncontractual obligations (Rome I)[15], Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 17 June 2008 on interoperability of the Rail system\nwithin the Community (Recast)[16] and Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 of 29\nApril 2004 establishing a European railway agency[17] are also\ndealt with in the Rail Protocol.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Community signed the Rail Protocol\non 10.12.2009, after the Council authorised the signature by means of Decision 2009/940/EC of 30 November 2009[18].\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union has exclusive competence over some of the matters governed by the\nRail Protocol, while the Member States have competence over other matters\ngoverned by this instrument. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union should\ntherefore approve the Rail Protocol. Article XXII(2) of the Rail Protocol provides\nthat, at the time of signature, acceptance, approval or accession a Regional\nEconomic Integration Organisation shall make a declaration specifying the\nmatters governed by the said Protocol in respect of which competence has been\ntransferred to that organisation by its Member States.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The declaration on the\ncompetence of the European Community was made at the time of the signature of\nthe instrument. It is advisable to renew this declaration at the time of the\napproval of the Rail Protocol in order to take into account legislative\ndevelopments and correct a factual mistake in the previous declaration.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Articles VII, VIII, IX and\nX of the Rail Protocol apply only where a Contracting State has made a\ndeclaration to that effect pursuant to Article XXVII of\nthe said Protocol and under the conditions specified by that declaration. At\nthe time of approval of the Rail Protocol, the European Union will not make a declaration pursuant to Article XXVII(2) concerning the\napplication of Article VIII nor will it make any of the declarations permitted\nunder Article XXVII(1) and (3). The competence of the\nMember States concerning the rules of substantive law as regards insolvency\nwill not be affected. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The United Kingdom and\nIreland are bound by Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on\njurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and\ncommercial matters, Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency\nproceedings, Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable\nto contractual obligations (Rome I) and are therefore taking part in the\nadoption of this Decision.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naccordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and\nis not bound by it or subject to its application. \nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile\nEquipment on matters specific to railway rolling stock, adopted in Luxembourg on 23 February 2007, is hereby approved on behalf of the European Union.\nThe text of the Protocol is attached to\nthis Decision. \nArticle 2\nThe President of the Council shall\ndesignate the person empowered to proceed, on behalf of the European Union, to the\ndeposit of the instrument of approval provided for in Article XXVII of the\nProtocol, in order to express the consent of the European Union to be bound by\nthe Protocol. \nArticle 3\nAt the time of approval of the Protocol,\nthe European Union shall make the declaration set out in the Annex, in\naccordance with Article XXII (2) of the Protocol.\nArticle 4\nThis\nDecision shall enter into force on [\u2026][19].\nDone at Brussels, \nFor the Council\nThe President\nANNEX\nDeclaration pursuant to Article XXII(2)\nconcerning the competence of the European Union over matters governed by the\nProtocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on\nmatters specific to railway rolling stock (\"Rail Protocol\"), adopted\nin Luxembourg on 23 February 2007, in respect of which the Member States have\ntransferred their competence to the European Union\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article XXII of the Rail Protocol\nprovides that Regional Economic Integration Organisations which are constituted\nby sovereign States and which have competence over certain matters governed by\nthe Protocol may approve it on condition that they make the declaration\nreferred to in Article XXII(2). The European Union has decided to approve the\nRail Protocol and is accordingly making that declaration.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current Members of the\nEuropean Union are the Kingdom of Belgium, the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech\nRepublic, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic\nof Estonia, Ireland, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French\nRepublic, the Italian Republic, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia,\nthe Republic of Lithuania, the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, the Republic of\nHungary, the Republic of Malta, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of\nAustria, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic, Romania, the Republic\nof Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of\nSweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, this declaration does\nnot apply to the Kingdom of Denmark, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of\nProtocol 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the\nTreaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union to the Treaties.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This declaration is not\napplicable in the case of the territories of the Member States in which the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union does not apply and is without prejudice to such acts or positions as\nmay be adopted under the Rail Protocol by the Member States concerned on behalf\nof and in the interests of those territories.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member States of the European Union have\ntransferred competence to the Community as regards matters\nwhich may affect or alter the rules in Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on\njurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and\ncommercial matters[20], Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of\n29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings [21], Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of 17 June 2008 on\nthe law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I)[22],\nDirective 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June\n2008 on interoperability of the Rail system within the Community (Recast)[23] and Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 of 29\nApril 2004 establishing a European railway agency[24].\n6. As far as\nthe numbering system of vehicles is concerned, the EU has adopted by way of\nDecision 2006/920/EC (Commission Decision of 11 August 2006 concerning the\ntechnical specification of interoperability relating to the subsystem Traffic\nOperation and Management of the trans-European conventional rail system),\nrecently updated through Commission decision 2012/757/EU a numbering system\nwhich may be appropriate for the purpose of identification of railway rolling\nstock as referred to in Article XIV of the Rail Protocol.\nFurthermore, as\nfar as data exchange between Member States of the European Union and the\nInternational Registry is concerned, the EU has made considerable progress by\nway of Decision 2007/756/EC (Commission Decision of 9 November 2007 adopting a\ncommon specification of the national vehicle register provided for under\nArticles 14(4) and (5) of Directives 96/48/EC and 2001/16/EC), recently updated\nthrough Commission Decision 2012/757/EU.
