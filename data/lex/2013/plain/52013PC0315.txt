In 2011 around 30 000 people were killed\nand more than 1.5 million injured in about 1.1 million traffic accidents on EU\nroads. In addition to the tragedy of loss of life and injury, this also carries\nan economic burden of around EUR 130 billion in costs to society every year. The\nEU is fully committed to reducing the number of road accidents (through accident\nprevention or active safety), mitigating the consequences of accidents when\nthey occur (passive safety), and improving the efficiency of the emergency\nservices and the effectiveness of post-accident medical care (tertiary safety).\nIn this context, eCall can significantly contribute to the reduction of road\nfatalities and alleviation of severity of road injuries.\nEvery minute is crucial to save lives and\nreduce the severity of injuries when emergency services are called to a road\naccident. eCall devices alert emergency services immediately, even if the\ndriver or passenger is unconscious or otherwise unable to call, and speed up\nthe arrival of emergency teams by an estimated 40% in urban areas and 50% in\nrural areas. eCall can also have a significant impact on the reduction of the\ncongestion caused by the traffic accidents and thus the overall congestion of\nthe European roads.\nTherefore, the harmonised implementation of\nan interoperable EU-wide eCall service in the EU has been in the agenda of the\nCommission since 2005 and has become now a priority action for the improvement\nof road safety and the deployment of ITS in Europe.\nAs part of a voluntary deployment approach,\nthe Commission in its 2005 Communication \u2014 entitled \u2018Bringing eCall to Citizens\u2019[1] \u2014 strongly urged national and\nregional governments to act and to invest in the necessary emergency\ninfrastructure for eCall, with a view to launching the full pan-European\nservice in 2009. The Commission also asked the European Standardisation Organisations\n(ETSI, CEN) to draw up the necessary common European standards and provided\nsupport to this end.\nOn 21 August 2009 the Communication \u2018eCall:\nTime for Deployment\u2019[2]\nreported on the progress in introducing eCall and concluded that the voluntary\napproach had not been sufficient. The Commission indicated that unless\nsignificant progress was made by the end of 2009, it would consider regulatory\nmeasures to ensure that eCall standard equipment was installed in all new\nvehicles in Europe, starting with certain categories (passenger cars and light\ncommercial vehicles).\nIn August 2010, Directive 2010/40/EU of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on the framework for the\ndeployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and\nfor interfaces with other modes of transport[3]\nentered into force with \u2018harmonised provision for an interoperable EU-wide\neCall\u2019 as one of the six priority actions identified for the adoption of\nspecifications.\nIn its non-legislative resolution \u2018report\non eCall: a new 112 service for citizens\u2019[4]\nadopted on 3 July 2012, the European Parliament stated the following:\n\u2013                        \n\u2018Considers that eCall should be a public EU-wide\nemergency call system, embedded in the vehicle and based on 112 and on common\npan-European standards\u2019,\n\u2013                        \n\u2018Recalls that the Commission\u2019s impact assessment\nshows that the adoption of regulatory measures to enforce the mandatory\nintroduction of eCall is at present the only option to achieve all positive\neffects\u2019,\n\u2013                        \n\u2018Urges the Commission to submit a proposal\nwithin the framework of Directive 2007/46/EC in order to ensure the mandatory\ndeployment of a public, 112-based eCall system by 2015 in all new type-approved\ncars and in all Member States\u2019,\n\u2013                        \n\u2018Welcomes the Commission\u2019s recommendation of 8\nSeptember 2011, and urges the Member States and the Mobile Network Operators\n(MNOs) to implement its required measures and upgrades at the latest by the end\nof 2014; regrets, however, that only 18 Member States responded in time; calls\non the remaining Member States to do so as soon as possible\u2019,\n\u2013                        \n\u2018Urges the Commission to adopt the common\nspecifications for PSAPs within the framework of the ITS Directive by the end\nof 2012, and to propose a directive on the implementation of eCall\u2019.\nThe deployment of eCall will also constitute\na delivery of the CARS 2020 Action Plan, which is included in the Communication\nof 8 November 2012 \u2018CARS 2020: Action Plan for a competitive and sustainable\nautomotive industry in Europe\u2019[5].\nOn 26 November 2012, the Commission adopted\nthe Delegated Regulation (EU) No 305/2013 supplementing Directive 2010/40/EU of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the harmonised\nprovision for an interoperable EU-wide eCall[6]\nwhich establishes the specifications for upgrading the Public Safety Answering\nPoint (PSAP) infrastructure required for the proper receipt and handling of\neCalls, in order to ensure the compatibility, interoperability and continuity\nof the harmonised EU-wide eCall service.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the proposal\nGiven the absence of any significant\nprogress in the voluntary deployment of eCall by the end of 2009, the\nCommission decided to conduct an Impact Assessment in order to assess the most\nappropriate policy option to implement the EU-wide eCall service in Europe.\nAs explained in the Impact Assessment[7], eCall requires three types of\nmeasures: the fitting of a specific system in vehicles, the ability of mobile\nnetwork operators to transmit messages in a certain format and, lastly, the\ncapacity of the emergency call response centres (also known as PSAPs \u2014 Public\nSafety Answering Points) to handle these messages. The system can only be\noperational if all three parts are in operation simultaneously.\nThe Impact Assessment concluded that the\nbest option to implement eCall effectively is a \u2018regulatory\u2019 approach. eCall will\nthen be based on the installation of type-approved equipment for the Single\nEuropean Emergency Number 112 in all vehicles, starting with certain categories\nof vehicles, and a framework for handling eCalls in the telecommunication\nnetworks and PSAPs. This approach will make eCall available to all citizens in Europe as an EU-wide service, accelerate take-up and realise the full potential of eCall to\nsave lives and mitigate the severity of injuries. Building on or coexisting\nwith this 112 standard factory equipment, additional in-vehicle emergency\nand/or added value services may be provided to the end-user giving further\nsafety and economic benefits.\nAccordingly, the Commission unveiled on 8\nSeptember 2011 its strategy on regulatory measures for eCall, together with the\nadoption of the first part of this strategy, which consisted of a Commission\nRecommendation[8]\non support for an EU-wide eCall service in electronic communication networks\nfor the transmission of in-vehicle emergency calls based on 112 (\u2018eCalls\u2019).\nIn order to complete the implementation of\nits eCall strategy and ensure timely and parallel implementation of the eCall\nservice based on 112 by the three stakeholder groups involved (mobile network\noperators, public emergency services and automotive industry) by 2015, the\nCommission proposes the following:\n\u2013                        \nIn-vehicle system: a proposal under the\nframework provided by Directive 2007/46/EC to mandate eCall in all new types of\nM1 and N1 vehicles (passenger cars and light duty vehicles).\n\u2013                        \nMobile communication networks: the\nabove-mentioned eCall Commission Recommendation.\n\u2013                        \nPublic Safety Answering Points: the adoption of the\nabove mentioned Delegated Regulation as a delegated act under Directive\n2010/40/EU in order to address the specifications for the PSAPs. \nArticle 6(2) of Directive 2010/40/EU requests\nthe Commission to present at the latest 12 months after the adoption of the\nnecessary specifications for a priority action, where appropriate and after\nconducting an impact assessment including a cost-benefit analysis, a proposal\nto the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with Article 294 of\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) on the deployment of\nthat priority action.\nThis is the specific object of this proposal,\nwhich completes the \u2018PSAP\u2019 part of the Commission strategy on eCall. \nThese different texts are complementary and\ntogether will allow for the 112 eCall service to be fully operational by 1\nOctober 2015.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultations with\ninterested parties\nThis proposal is the result of extensive\nconsultations with major stakeholders: \nIt takes into consideration all the\nconsultations in the course of the eCall Impact Assessment. These included, in\nparticular, extensive contributions from stakeholders involved in several fora\nsuch as the European eCall Implementation Platform (EeIP), the eCall PSAPs Expert\nGroup and the eCall Driving Group within the eSafety/i-Mobility Forum, and a\npublic consultation on the implementation of eCall from 19 July to 19 September\n2010.\nThe proposal also takes into account the\ndiscussions in the meetings held with experts from Member States, EEA countries\nand Switzerland on 13 October 2011, 29 May, 19 June and 03 July 2012 to prepare\nthe specifications for the PSAPs. These meetings were also attended by\nrepresentatives from the European Parliament and the European Data Protection\nSupervisor[9].\nFinally, this proposal also takes into\nconsideration the opinion of the European ITS Advisory Group, composed of 25\nhigh level representatives from ITS service providers, associations of users,\ntransport and facilities operators, manufacturing industry, social partners,\nprofessional associations, local authorities and other relevant fora[10].\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment and\ncost-benefit analysis\nAn extensive cost-benefit analysis was\nconducted as part of the eCall Impact Assessment for the three proposed\noptions, including the preferred option on regulatory measures.\nAs far as the cost-benefit analysis of the\nchosen option (option 3) is concerned, each of the three planned eCall\nregulatory measures (in-vehicle, telecommunication, PSAP) is inseparable from\nthe other two. While costs for the PSAPs can be estimated separately from the in-vehicle\nand telecommunication parts of eCall, the benefits can be estimated only for\nthe whole eCall initiative.\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis of main costs for\nPSAPs\nThe marginal costs of handling the 112\neCalls for each PSAP equipped to handle 112 calls enhanced with location\ncapabilities \u2014 E112 calls (obligation under the Universal Service Directive[11])\n\u2014 cover the following:\n\u2013                        \nIn-band modem server (from \u20ac3 000 to \u20ac20 000,\ndepending on the number of eCalls)\n\u2013                        \nSoftware to decode the MSD (minimum set of data)\nand integration with the PSAP software\n\u2013                        \nTraining\nAnnual operational costs should be added to\nthese costs. Where the eCalls will be received in a PSAP that also receives other\nemergency calls, the majority of these costs will be subsumed within the normal\noperational costs. Otherwise they will depend on the number of operators needed\nto handle the estimated number of eCalls[12].\nThe estimated costs of upgrading PSAPs\naverage around EUR 1.1 million per Member State[13]. This estimate derives from a\ncluster analysis based on the density of population of the country, accident typologies,\nroad and emergency response infrastructures, and other general statistics. The\ncost in each country varies considerably depending on the number of PSAPs, but\nalso on the technical solution chosen for upgrading the PSAPs. \nAdditional information on costs was\nprovided by the HeERO pre-deployment pilot[14]\n(Jan. 2011 to Jan. 2013) which involved the authorities of nine Member States and associated countries, as well as forty partners. The objective of the\nproject was to prepare for the deployment of the necessary infrastructure,\nincluding the start-up of an interoperable, harmonised 112-based in-vehicle\nemergency call system. The project will be followed up by the HeERO2 pilot launched\nin early 2013 and that will run for 24 months, involving an additional nine Member States and associated countries.\nThe HeERO pilot has helped to demonstrate\nthat innovative solutions can reduce costs in comparison to the rather conservative\napproach followed in the eCall impact assessment, especially for those Member\nStates where there are a large number of PSAPs. It also confirmed that the\nestimated and real costs of implementation were within the expected ranges.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis of main benefits\nThe benefits identified in the impact\nassessment and several studies, including national ones, include:\n\u2013                        \nReduction in fatalities (with all vehicles\neCall-equipped, between 1% and 10% depending on country population density and road\nand emergency response infrastructure)[15].\n\u2013                        \nReduction in the seriousness of the injuries (between\n2% and 15%)[16].\n\u2013                        \nReduction in congestion costs caused by traffic\naccidents. This is due to improved accident management, as the accident is\nimmediately notified to the PSAPs and can therefore be transferred to the\nappropriate Traffic Management Control, which can immediately inform other road\nusers, and help reduce secondary accidents.\n\u2013                        \nFacilitation of rescue services and increased\nsecurity of rescue team (e.g. fire-fighters) when extracting trapped occupants,\nas the MSD will, among other things, provide information on the fuel type.\n\u2013                        \nReduced SOS roadside infrastructure, as each\nroad user would be able to trigger an emergency call from their vehicle.\n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cost\u2013benefit ratio\nBenefits have also been monetised[17] and a cost-benefit analysis\ndrawn up for the different options and for types of affected categories. The estimations are calculated up to year 2033 as this is the expected\nyear of full penetration of the eCall service under the preferred policy option. \n   || Policy option 1 No EU action || Policy Option 2 Voluntary approach || Policy Option 3 Regulatory measures \n Benefit-Cost Ratio || 0.29 || 0.68 || 1.74 \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nArticle 6(2) of Directive 2010/40/EU\nrequires the Commission to present at the latest 12 months after the adoption\nof the necessary specifications for a priority action, where appropriate and\nafter conducting an impact assessment including a cost-benefit analysis, a\nproposal to the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with Article\n294 TFEU on the deployment of these specifications.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\nproportionality\nAccording to the principle of subsidiarity\n(Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union), action at EU level should be\ntaken only when the aims envisaged cannot be achieved sufficiently by Member\nStates alone and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the\nproposed action, be better achieved by the EU.\nRoad safety is an issue of major concern\nacross the entire European Union and for all of its inhabitants: 500 million\ncitizens in the 27 Member States use more than 230 million vehicles on over 5\nmillion km of roads. The purpose of the interoperable EU-wide eCall initiative is\nultimately to introduce in all vehicles in Europe the minimum functionalities\nneeded to ensure adequate handling of emergency calls by the emergency response\nservices. Currently, there are more than 100 million road journeys every year across\nthe various Member States and the number is increasing due to further consolidation\nof the European Union (through the free movement of goods, people and\nservices). Action is needed at EU level in order to guarantee interoperability\nand continuity of the service throughout Europe, which cannot be satisfactorily\nachieved by individual Member States alone. Moreover, taking action at EU level\nusing common European eCall standards approved by the European Standardisation\nOrganisations (CEN and ETSI) will ensure efficient provision of the emergency\nresponse service across Europe, for example in the case of vehicles travelling\nabroad, and also help to avoid market fragmentation (which may occur as a\nresult of the proliferation of national and/or proprietary private solutions\nimplemented in differing ways).\nThe EU-wide eCall, in line with 112 and\nE112 deployment, has been designed in such a way as to minimise the impact on\nall stakeholders in the value chain (automotive industry, mobile network\noperators, Member States, PSAPs), and to distribute this impact fairly. \nThe current proposal calls on Member States\nto deploy the necessary eCall PSAP infrastructure required\nfor the proper receipt and handling of all eCalls on their territory, in accordance with the specifications laid down by Commission\nDelegated Regulation (EU) No 305/2013 of 26 November 2012 supplementing\nDirective 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard\nto harmonised provision for an interoperable EU-wide eCall, in order to ensure\nthe compatibility, interoperability and continuity of the EU-wide eCall service.\nThe plan is to keep the financial and administrative costs for\nnational/regional authorities to a minimum, commensurate with the objectives to\nbe achieved. A substantial part of implementation (organisation of the PSAPs)\nis left to national decision-making bodies. The PSAPs infrastructure will be upgraded\nby the Member States in a manner best suited to their national/local\narchitecture, thereby respecting the specific issues and circumstances that apply\nin each Member State. Each Member State will be able to organise its emergency\nservices in the way most cost effective and appropriate to its needs, including\nthe possibility to filter calls that are not emergency calls and may not be\nhandled by eCall PSAPs, in particular in the case of manually triggered eCalls.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed explanation of\nthe proposal\nArticle 1 requires the\nMember States to deploy the necessary eCall PSAP infrastructure required for the proper receipt and\nhandling of all eCalls on their territory no later than 1 October 2015.\nArticle 2 requires the\nMember States to report to the Commission on the state of implementation of\nthis Decision 18 months at the latest after the entry\ninto force of this Decision.\nArticle 3 provides for the\nDecision to enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its\npublication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThere are no budgetary\nimplications for the EU budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n\u00b7                        \nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposed act concerns an EEA matter and\nshould therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n2013/0166 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the deployment of the interoperable\nEU-wide eCall\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN\nPARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91 thereof,\nHaving regard to the\nproposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of\nthe draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the\nopinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[18],\nHaving regard to the\nopinion of the Committee of the Regions[19],\nActing in accordance\nwith the ordinary legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under Article 3(d) of Directive\n2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on the\nframework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of\nroad transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport[20],\nthe harmonised provision for an interoperable EU-wide eCall service constitutes\na priority action for the development and use of specifications and standards.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 6 of Directive\n2010/40/EU requires the Commission to adopt delegated acts as regards\nspecifications necessary to ensure compatibility, interoperability and\ncontinuity for the deployment and operational use of intelligent transport\nsystems (ITS) for the priority actions.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Delegated\nRegulation (EU) No 305/2013 of 26 November 2012 supplementing Directive\n2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the\nharmonised provision for an interoperable EU-wide eCall[21] establishes the specifications\nfor upgrading the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) infrastructure required\nfor the proper receipt and handling of eCalls, in order to ensure the\ncompatibility, interoperability and continuity of the harmonised EU-wide eCall\nservice.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 6(2) of Directive\n2010/40/EU requires the Commission to present at the latest 12 months after the\nadoption of the above-mentioned Delegated Regulation, where appropriate and\nafter conducting an impact assessment including a cost-benefit analysis, a\nproposal to the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with Article\n294 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union on the deployment of\nthese specifications.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is expected that, by\nreducing the response time of the emergency services, the interoperable EU-wide\neCall service will reduce the number of fatalities in the Union as well as the\nseverity of injuries caused by road accidents. The interoperable EU-wide eCall\nservice is also expected to bring savings to society by improving incident\nmanagement and by reducing road congestion and secondary accidents.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the interoperability\nand continuity of the service throughout the Union, and reduce the costs of\nimplementation for the Union as a whole, it is necessary that all Member States\ndeploy the eCall priority action in accordance with the common specifications\nestablished in Delegated Regulation (EU) No 305/2013. This should be without\nprejudice to the right of each Member State to deploy additional technical\nmeans to handle other emergency calls.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As experienced with other\nemergency calls systems, manually triggered eCalls may include a share of\nassistance calls.
