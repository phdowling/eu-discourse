Introduction\nAfter a joint EU-IMF medium-term financial\r\nassistance programme for Romania from spring 2009 to spring 2011, during which\r\nEUR 5 billion were disbursed on the European side and EUR 12.9 billion by\r\nthe IMF, the Council of the European Union adopted on 12 May 2011 a decision on\r\na follow-up precautionary programme, making available EU medium-term financial\r\nassistance of up to EUR 1.4 billion for Romania[1].\r\nIn the second programme, which was also a joint EU-IMF programme, no funds were\r\ndisbursed either by the EU or by the IMF in line with its precautionary\r\ncharacter.\nOn 4 July 2013, in the light of remaining risks\r\nto its balance of payments, the Romanian authorities requested a third EU\r\nmedium-term financial assistance programme, again jointly with an IMF Stand-By\r\nArrangement. The EU and IMF assistance is expected to be treated as\r\nprecautionary, with no actual disbursements foreseen. On 9 July, the EFC\r\nresponded favourably to this request and mandated the Commission to negotiate a\r\nnew joint EU-IMF precautionary programme.\nFrom 17 to 31 July 2013, the Commission\r\nservices conducted with the IMF staff a joint negotiation mission to Bucharest. Staff-level agreement on the modalities and contents of a new programme was\r\nreached. A new programme would continue to provide support to the economic\r\nprogramme of the government aiming, among other things, at consolidating\r\nmacroeconomic, fiscal and financial stability, increasing the resilience and\r\nthe growth potential of the economy, enhancing administrative capacity,\r\nreforming the tax administration and improving public financial management and\r\ncontrol. A new programme would run for 24 months and would be composed of\r\nprecautionary assistance by the European Union of up to EUR 2 billion and by\r\nthe IMF of up to SDR 1.75 billion (around EUR 2 billion) supported by a\r\nstand-by arrangement. In addition, the World Bank will continue providing\r\nearlier committed support of EUR 891 million, of which EUR 514 million is still\r\nto be disbursed.\n2. Macroeconomic development and outlook\nRomania has\r\nregistered positive economic growth since 2011. Recent developments suggest\r\nthat growth in 2013 will be at about 2%, somewhat stronger than the 1.6%\r\nprojected in the Commission's spring forecast. A stellar export performance\r\n(mainly on account of the automotive industry and services) and a good harvest are\r\nthe main drivers of growth. These positive trends, however, mask weak domestic\r\ndemand, with consumption being flat and investment contracting in the first\r\nhalf of 2013.\nGoing forward, growth is expected to\r\ngradually strengthen as structural reforms start paying off, EU funds\r\nabsorption improves, and exports remain strong as the European economy\r\nrecovers. Assuming an average harvest, growth is projected to be slightly above\r\n2% in 2014. Domestic demand is expected to be the main driver of growth, driven\r\nby investment and private consumption, while net exports is projected to have a\r\nsmall negative contribution, as imports are expected to pick up in 2014 on the\r\nback of strengthening domestic demand.\nInflation, as measured by the HICP,\r\nremained high, at around 6%, in Romania in 2009-2011, but came down in 2012 to\r\nan average of 3.4%. Upward price pressures, however, became stronger again\r\ntowards the end of 2012 and in the first half of 2013. Inflation is expected to\r\nsubside during the second half of 2013 thanks to a sharp drop in food prices\r\nand a reversal of base effects, and to fall below 3.5% by end-2013, thus within\r\nthe central bank's target range (2.5% \u00b11pp). A further deceleration is expected\r\nin 2014.\n3. Public\r\nfinances\nRomania has\r\nsuccessfully consolidated its public finances over recent years, reducing its\r\nbudget deficit from 9% of GDP in 2009 to just below 3% in 2012. This\r\nachievement allowed the Council, on 21 June 2013, to abrogate the excessive\r\ndeficit procedure for Romania. A new programme would support the government's\r\nfurther fiscal consolidation efforts which aim to reaching Romania\u2019s medium-term objective (MTO) of a structural budget deficit of 1% of GDP by 2015.\r\nThe authorities remain committed to the previous programme's deficit target of\r\n2.4% in ESA terms for 2013. In 2014, further consolidation in line with the\r\nStability and Growth Pact (SGP) requirements is planned. Based on current\r\nindications, Romania would target a 2% deficit in ESA terms in line with its 2013\r\nupdate of its convergence programme.\nThe July negotiation mission agreed on the mid-year\r\nbudget rectification allowing for some shifts in revenue and expenditure while\r\nmaintaining the overall deficit target for 2013 of 2.3% in cash and 2.4% in ESA\r\nterms. The revised budget caters for lower revenues and lowers domestic capital\r\ninvestments, reduces provisions for corrections related with EU Funds, and lowers\r\ntransfers to other public administration units. Regarding the 2014 budget, the\r\nauthorities are looking into ways to increase revenues, mainly via base\r\nbroadening. On the expenditure side, one important challenge is the phasing in of\r\nthe Unified Wage Law agreed under the first programme.\nWith the main part of the required fiscal\r\nconsolidation having been achieved, the focus of a new programme will be on\r\nimproving fiscal governance. It will aim to upgrade the fiscal framework to\r\nbring it in line with Fiscal Compact requirements, along with a number of other\r\nimprovements to the content of the Fiscal Strategy and to the transparency of\r\nthe budgeting process. It will require improvements in annual and medium-term\r\ncapital budgeting, the finalisation of the commitment control system (to\r\nprevent new arrears), as well as improvements in tax administration aimed at\r\nmore efficient tax collection.\n4. Financial markets and banking sector\r\ndevelopments\nFinancial market conditions have\r\nsignificantly improved since the summer of 2012 amid an improvement in global market\r\nsentiment and following the stabilisation of the domestic political situation\r\ntowards year-end. It has moved broadly in tandem with the regional peers, and\r\nremained relatively favourable in the first half of 2013. The 5-year CDS\r\nsovereign spreads for Romania dropped from nearly 500 basis points in May 2012\r\nto below 200 bps in early January 2013, and it has hovered slightly above 200\r\nbps since end-June 2013. After substantial losses in May 2012 the BET stock\r\nmarket index recovered until end-2012; it has been volatile since then but\r\ngained around 10% until early-September 2013.\nNotwithstanding the upward trend in\r\nimpaired assets (the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio reached 20.3% in June\r\n2013), the banking sector\u2019s capitalisation remained at reassuring levels (the\r\ncapital adequacy ratio stood at 14.7% in June). Risks associated with\r\nincreasing NPLs have been mitigated by a prudent loan-loss provisioning policy,\r\nalthough provisions continue to put a strain on profitability (return on equity\r\nreached 6% in H1 2013 after 3 years of losses). The central bank continues to\r\nclosely oversee banks with parents from peripheral euro-area countries which\r\nhave maintained sufficient capital buffers. The spill-overs from the crisis in\r\nCyprus were mitigated through the agreement to transfer the local deposit base\r\nof the Romanian branch of Bank of Cyprus to Marfin Bank, the subsidiary of the Laiki\r\nGroup, the deleveraging process of foreign banks and the reduction in parent\r\nbank funding (-14.6% since December 2012., albeit in line with regional\r\ndevelopments and overall conducted in an orderly fashion, continue to require\r\nclose attention by the supervisor.\n5.\r\nBalance of payment and external financing requirements\nRomania is expected\r\nto maintain full access to sovereign debt markets over the envisaged programme\r\nperiod (24 months) barring adverse external developments. CDS spreads have\r\nreached their lowest levels since 2010. The current-account deficit is expected\r\nto decrease from around 4% of GDP in 2012 to around 2% in 2013, mainly thanks\r\nto a decline in trade deficit.\nUnder the baseline scenario no sovereign or\r\nexternal financing gap should materialise in the next two years. However, Romania remains vulnerable to exchange-rate volatility and volatile international capital\r\nmovements. In an adverse scenario, the financing of the current account could\r\nbecome difficult and sovereign market access could be impeded. In the latter\r\ncase, a first line of defence would be the Treasury\u2019s cash buffer (about\r\n6-month of financing needs) and to a lesser extent the NBR's international\r\nreserves. Should Romania experience protracted and acute financing\r\ndifficulties, the precautionary programme could be activated and the funds\r\navailable (EUR 2 bn from the EU disbursable in two EUR 1 bn instalments and up\r\nto EUR 2 bn from the IMF Stand-By Arrangement) would allow to cover sovereign\r\nfinancial and budgetary commitments. A new programme would also provide\r\nreassurance to the financial markets that Romania is committed to an ambitious\r\neconomic reform agenda.\n6. EU support under the balance-of-payments\r\nfacility comes as part of an international effort\nIn the light of remaining vulnerabilities\r\nand risks to its balance of payments and conditional on the Romanian\r\nauthorities' commitment to implement a programme of fiscal, financial and\r\nstructural adjustment, the Commission, after having consulted the Economic and\r\nFinancial Committee (EFC) on 3 October 2013, recommends the Council to adopt a\r\nDecision granting further mutual assistance to Romania as foreseen by Article\r\n143 of the Treaty (TFEU). The Romanian government shall implement its economic\r\nprogramme in order to deal with the remaining vulnerabilities, to mitigate\r\nremaining threats to the sustainability of its balance of payments and shall\r\ndevelop the necessary capacity to design and implement economic policies\r\nwithout international support.\nFurthermore, the Commission, after consulting\r\nthe EFC, proposes the Council to adopt a Decision providing precautionary EU\r\nmedium-term financial assistance of up to EUR 2 billion to Romania so as to underpin the sustainability of Romania's balance of payments. Activation of the precautionary Union financial assistance\r\nand disbursements may be requested until 30 September 2015.\n7. Main contents of a new programme\nThe new precautionary financial assistance\r\nprovides support to the economic programme of the government aiming, inter alia,\r\nat consolidating macroeconomic, fiscal and financial stability, increasing the\r\nresilience and the growth potential of the economy, enhancing administrative\r\ncapacity, reforming the tax administration, and improving public financial\r\nmanagement and control. The specific economic policy conditionality will be set\r\nout in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to be concluded by the Commission\r\nwith the Romanian authorities. It will preserve the achievements of the\r\nprevious two programmes and will carry over the yet unfulfilled conditions from\r\nthe second programme.\nA: Fiscal consolidation\nFollowing the correction of its excessive\r\ndeficit, Romania is expected to reduce its structural budget balance in line\r\nwith SGP requirements until it reaches its medium-term objective of a\r\nstructural general government deficit of 1% of GDP by 2015, and maintain it\r\nthereafter. Furthermore, the programme will continue efforts to prevent the\r\nbuild-up of government arrears, both at central and local government level. The\r\npublic sector wage bill will need to stay on a sustainable footing, limiting\r\nwage growth as well as public sector employment levels.\nB: Fiscal governance and structural\r\nfiscal reform\nTo firmly anchor fiscal consolidation, the\r\nprogramme will involve a further strengthening of the fiscal governance\r\nframework.. The implementation of the Fiscal Compact is crucial in this respect,\r\nas well as improvements in multi-annual budgetary planning will ensure a more\r\nsustainable fiscal policy.\nThe government will be supported by\r\nextensive technical assistance provided by the IMF and the World Bank in the\r\narea of public financial management and control. The implementation of a commitment\r\ncontrol system, which will be rolled out in several steps, will help ensure the\r\nreduction and control of arrears. In the health sector, budget control\r\nmechanisms will be strengthened through improved reporting and monitoring\r\nframeworks, in particular with regard to hospitals and pharmaceutical spending\r\nin order to avoid a re-accumulation of payment arrears. Prioritisation of\r\npublic investments will be strengthened, to enhance the country's growth\r\npotential.\nC: Public debt management\nThe authorities will take the necessary\r\nsteps to improve public debt management with a view to reducing funding cost\r\nand risks and increase average maturity of public debt.\nD: Financial sector regulation and\r\nsupervision\nIn the financial sector, authorities will\r\ncontinue improving the bank resolution framework and the legislation on the\r\nDeposit Guarantee Fund by amending GO 39/1996 and GEO 99/2006. To speed up the\r\nprocess of balance sheet cleaning, the National Bank of Romania (NBR) has\r\nclarified the provisions applicable to the write-off of loans with the Romanian\r\nBanking Association and will produce a comprehensive analysis of the asset\r\nquality in the banking sector. In order to further develop the capital market\r\nand diversify the sources of funding for banks, authorities will amend the\r\ncovered bonds legislation. Preserving credit discipline and avoiding moral\r\nhazard among debtors contributes significantly to enhancing financial\r\nstability. Therefore, the government will continue refraining from adopting\r\nlegislative initiatives (such as the personal insolvency law) and promoting\r\nprovisions in the debt collection law, which would undermine credit discipline.\r\nAuthorities will consult extensively with all relevant stakeholders, taking\r\ninto account also the impact assessment finalised by the NBR, on the new\r\nprovisions on abusive clauses in the law for the application of the civil\r\nprocedure code, will ensure that court cases involving abusive clauses are\r\ndealt with by higher ranking courts or by a unique specialised court, and will\r\ntake all other necessary measures to ensure a consistent application of these\r\nprovisions. To strengthen the supervision of non-bank financial market and\r\nfoster consumer protection, authorities will ensure that the legislation on the\r\nintegrated non-bank financial regulator, the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA),\r\nwill be amended to comply with international good practices.\nE: Structural reforms\nThe structural reforms aim at improving\r\nmarket functioning, at increasing resilience to external shocks and at\r\nstrengthening Romania's long-run growth potential. The structural reform agenda\r\nof this programme is a part of the broader agenda set in Romania's National Reform Programme and covered by the country-specific recommendations addressed to\r\n  Romania in the context of the European Semester.\nThe restructuring of state-owned\r\nenterprises (SOEs), including privatisation, will be stepped up in order to\r\nreduce risks to the general government budget from accumulated arrears and\r\noperational losses, while increasing the financial viability of most of these\r\ncompanies' operations. Authorities will take measures to strengthen corporate\r\ngovernance of SOEs, including in the financial sector.\nIn the energy sector outstanding measures\r\nagreed under the two previous programmes will be implemented, among which the\r\nimplementation of the roadmaps for the gas and electricity market\r\nliberalisation.\nImprovement of the business environment and\r\nfacilitating access to finance for the small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs)\r\nis another important pillar of the structural reform agenda of the programme.\r\nThe programme aims at reducing administrative burden for the SMEs, facilitating\r\ntheir access to bank and equity capital, reducing the legal uncertainty by\r\nimproving the land and property registration and supporting SMEs when going\r\nabroad. Furthermore, the programme supports the reform of the intellectual\r\nproperty rights framework, in particular in relation to patents, with the view\r\nto attract foreign direct investment in research and innovation activities.\nIn the field of labour markets, the\r\nprogramme supports the completion of the 2010 pension reform by equalising the\r\npensionable age for men and women. \nIn addition to the above described broad\r\nareas of measures to improve the efficiency of public administration in areas\r\ncritical to program implementation, the Romanian authorities will be invited to\r\nreport every six months to the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC)/Economic\r\nPolicy Committee (EPC) on the progress made in this area.\nF: Monetary Policy\nMonetary policy will remain geared towards\r\nprice stability with a view to keeping inflation within the National Bank of Romania\u2019s inflation target band (2.5% \u00b1 1 percentage point).\n2013/0338 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nproviding precautionary EU medium-term\r\nfinancial assistance to Romania\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n332/2002[2]\r\nof 18 February 2002 establishing a facility providing medium-term financial\r\nassistance for Member States' balances of payments and in particular Article\r\n3(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nCommission made after consulting the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC),\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Decision 2013/XXX/EU[3], the Council has decided to\r\ngrant mutual assistance to Romania.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Precautionary medium-term\r\nfinancial assistance for Romania under the balance-of-payments facility for\r\nMember States is appropriate under the current circumstances of unstable\r\ncapital flows affecting in particular emerging markets, risks to the\r\nmacroeconomic scenario, and remaining vulnerabilities in the banking sector.\r\nWhile under present market conditions Romania does not intend to request the disbursement\r\nof any instalment, the precautionary assistance can be expected to help\r\nconsolidate macroeconomic, budgetary and financial stability and, through the\r\npursuit of structural reforms, increase the resilience and the growth potential\r\nof the Romanian economy.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If negative risks\r\nmaterialise, Romania may not be able to cover its external financing needs from\r\navailable funding resources. These risks are associated, among others, with important\r\nexternal debt and financial sector roll-overs, a high negative net investment position,\r\nand spill-overs from adverse developments in the euro-area. In such a stress\r\nscenario, the residual financing needs may have to be covered from activating\r\nthe precautionary EU financial assistance.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\r\nprovide EU support to Romania of up to EUR 2 billion on a precautionary basis\r\nunder the facility providing Union medium-term financial assistance for Member\r\nStates' balance of payments established in Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002.\r\nThis assistance should be provided in conjunction with IMF support through a\r\nStand-by Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of SDR 1,751.34 million (about\r\nEUR 2 billion, 170% of Romania's IMF quota), approved on 27 September\r\n2013, which the authorities will also treat as precautionary. The World Bank\r\n(WB) has made EUR 1 billion available under a Development Policy Loan\r\n(DPL) with a deferred drawdown option (DDO) valid through June 2015. In\r\naddition, the WB will continue providing earlier committed support of EUR 891\r\nmillion of which EUR 514 million is still to be disbursed.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The assistance should be\r\nmanaged by the Commission who will agree with the authorities of Romania, after consulting the EFC, the specific economic policy conditions attached to the\r\nprecautionary financial assistance. Those conditions should be laid down in a\r\nMemorandum of Understanding.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the\r\nprecautionary nature of the assistance, Romania will not request the\r\ndisbursement of any instalment under the Union loan, unless difficulties as\r\nregards its balance of current payments or capital movements emerge. If Romania makes a request for funding to the Commission, the latter will decide, after having\r\nconsulted the EFC, on the activation of the programme and on the amount and\r\ntiming of such instalments. The detailed financial terms related to possible\r\ndisbursements will be laid down in a Precautionary Loan Facility Agreement (PLFA).\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The precautionary\r\nfinancial assistance shall be provided with a view to contributing to the\r\nsuccessful implementation of the Government's economic policy programme, and,\r\nin this way, shall support the sustainability of Romania's balance of payments,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union shall make\r\navailable to Romania a precautionary medium-term financial assistance amounting\r\nto a maximum of EUR 2 billion. In case the facility is activated and\r\ndisbursements are provided, the assistance shall be provided in the form of a\r\nloan with a maximum average maturity of eight years.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Activation of the\r\nprecautionary Union financial assistance and disbursements may be requested\r\nuntil 30 September 2015.\nArticle 2\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The assistance shall be\r\nmanaged by the Commission in a manner consistent with Romania's undertakings and the recommendations by the Council, in particular in the context of the\r\nimplementation of the national reform programme (NRP) as well as of the annual\r\nupdate of Romania's convergence programme (CP).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall agree\r\nwith the Romanian authorities, after consulting the EFC, the specific economic\r\npolicy conditions attached to the precautionary financial assistance as listed under\r\nArticle 3(3). Those conditions shall be laid down in a Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding (MoU) consistent with the undertakings and recommendations\r\nreferred to in paragraph 1. The detailed financial terms shall be laid\r\ndown by the Commission in a PLFA.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall\r\nverify at regular intervals, in collaboration with the EFC, that the economic\r\npolicy conditions attached to the assistance are fulfilled.\nArticle 3\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The activation of the\r\nprecautionary Union financial assistance shall be examined by the Commission,\r\nfollowing a written request by Romania to the Commission. The Commission, after\r\nconsulting the EFC, shall decide if the activation of the assistance and the\r\nrequest for disbursements under the assistance is justified, and shall decide\r\non the amount and timing of such disbursements. In case the financial\r\nassistance is being activated, the funds may be made available in not more than\r\ntwo instalments.

It will be\r\nprovided in the context of an international financing package, and in\r\nparticular by an IMF loan of SDR 1.75 billion (around EUR 2 billion) supported\r\nby a stand-by arrangement. The World Bank has made EUR1 billion available under\r\na Development Policy Loan (DPL) with a deferred drawdown option (DDO). In\r\naddition, the WB will continue providing earlier committed support of EUR 891\r\nmillion, of which EUR 514 million is still to be disbursed. The precautionary\r\nEU medium-term financial support to Romania is intended to address the remaining\r\nrisks surrounding the sustainability of the balance of payments of Romania; even\r\nif the current account deficit has clearly come down, volatile capital flows\r\nimply risks for its financing. The precautionary assistance also continues to\r\nprovide support to the economic programme of the government aiming, among other\r\nthings, at consolidating macroeconomic, fiscal and financial stability, enhancing\r\nadministrative capacity, reforming the tax administration, improving public\r\nfinancial management and control, and increasing the resilience and the growth\r\npotential of the Romanian economy. Finally, the assistance managed by the\r\nCommission, in consultation with the Economic and Financial Committee, is a way\r\nto encourage economic policies in Romania to be consistent with the country's\r\nundertakings in the EU context and recommendations by the Council, in\r\nparticular as concerns the implementation of the National Reform Programme as\r\nwell as of the Convergence Programme. \nThe EU funds raised on the capital markets or\r\nfrom financial institutions for the purpose of extending the loan to Romania, in case of a request by Romania and a positive evaluation of such a request by the\r\nCommission after consulting the EFC, are covered by the EU guarantee. The loan\r\nis raised on the capital markets or from financial institutions. The amount in\r\nprincipal of loans which could be granted to Romania would amount to up to EUR\r\n2 billion.\nThe structure for the guarantee provided by the\r\nEU will enable the Commission to service the debt should Romania default.\nIn order to honour its obligations, the\r\nCommission may draw on its cash resources to service the debt provisionally. In\r\nthis case, Article 12 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 of 22\r\nMay 2000 implementing Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom on the system of the\r\nEuropean Communities' own resources (OJ L 130, 31.5.2000, p. 1) will\r\napply.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 METHOD OF CALCULATION\r\nADOPTED\nNot applicable.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PAYMENT SCHEDULE (IN\r\nEURO)\nNot applicable.\n Heading || Appropriations || Payments \n   ||   ||   || Year n || Year n+1 || Year n+2 || Year n+3 || Subsequent financial years \n   || Year n ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n   || Year n+1 ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n   || Year n ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n   || Year n+1 ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n   || Total ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first programme was covered by Council Decision\r\n2009/459/EC and the second programme by Council Decision 2011/288/EU.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 53, 23.2.2002, p. 1.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See page xx of this Official Journal.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
