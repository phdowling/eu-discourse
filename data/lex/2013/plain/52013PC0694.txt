In each meeting session new\r\namendments to existing UNECE Regulations or Global Technical Regulations are\r\nadopted in order to allow for technical progress. Prior to each WP29 meeting\r\nthese amendments were adopted by one of the six working groups (GRs) that are\r\nactive under WP29.\nSubsequently, in a WP29 meeting the final\r\nvote for adoption of the amendments, supplements and corrigenda takes place,\r\nprovided the quorum is reached and there is a qualified majority among contracting\r\nparties. The EU is a contracting party to two Agreements (1958 and 1998\r\nAgreements) under WP29 and votes on behalf of the Member States. A Council Decision,\r\nreferred to as \"mega decision\", containing the list of amendments,\r\nsupplements and corrigenda, is prepared each time and permits the Commission to\r\nvote on behalf of the Member States in each WP29 meeting.\nThis Council Decision defines the Union's\r\nposition in the voting of the amendments, supplements and corrigenda submitted\r\nfor vote in the November 2013 WP29 meeting that will take place on 11 to 15 November\r\n2013.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Technical Committee Motor Vehicles has\r\nbeen consulted and the comments from Member State experts taken into account.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \r\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe\r\nproposal defines the Union's position in the voting of the amendments to UNECE\r\nRegulations No 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, 23, 31, 37, 38, 43, 48, 49,\r\n50, 54, 67, 69, 70, 77, 83, 87, 91, 94, 95, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 107, 110, 112,\r\n113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 128 and 129, regarding a proposal for amendments\r\nto the Consolidated Resolution on the Construction of Vehicles (R.E.3), regarding\r\nthe adoption of a proposal for a Global Technical Regulation on Pole Side\r\nImpact.\n\u00b7                        \r\nLegal basis\nArticle 114, in conjunction with Article\r\n218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\u00b7                        \r\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe vote in favour of international\r\ninstruments like draft UNECE Regulations and Global Technical Regulations and\r\ntheir incorporation into the Union system for the type-approval of motor\r\nvehicles can only be done by the Union. This does not only prevent\r\nfragmentation of the Internal Market, but also ensures equal health and safety\r\nstandards across the Union. It also offers advantages of economies of scale:\r\nproducts can be made for the whole Union market and even the international\r\nmarket, instead of being customised to obtain national type-approval for every\r\nsingle Member State.\nThe proposal therefore complies with the\r\nsubsidiarity principle.\n\u00b7                        \r\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle as it does not go beyond what is necessary in order\r\nto achieve the objectives of ensuring the proper functioning of the Internal\r\nMarket, while at the same time providing for a high level of public safety and\r\nprotection.\n\u00b7                        \r\nChoice of instruments\nThe use of a Council Decision is required\r\nby Article 218(9) TFEU in order to establish the positions to be adopted on the\r\nUnion\u2019s behalf in a body set up by an international agreement.\n2013/0334 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted on behalf of\r\nthe Union within the relevant Committees of the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Europe regarding the proposed amendments to Regulations Nos 3,\r\n4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, 23, 31, 37, 38, 43, 48, 49, 50, 54, 67, 69,\r\n70, 77, 83, 87, 91, 94, 95, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 107, 110, 112, 113, 115,\r\n117, 119, 121, 123, 128, 129, and the Consolidated Resolution on the\r\nConstruction of Vehicles (R.E.3), and regarding the draft Global Technical\r\nRegulation on Pole Side Impact\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114, in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision\r\n97/836/EC[3],\r\nthe Union acceded to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission\r\nfor Europe (UNECE) concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions\r\nfor wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used\r\non wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals\r\ngranted on the basis of these prescriptions (\u2018Revised 1958 Agreement\u2019 ).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision\r\n2000/125/EC[4],\r\nthe Union acceded to the Agreement concerning the establishing of global\r\ntechnical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be\r\nfitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles (Parallel Agreement).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2007/46/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council [5]\r\nreplaced the Member States\u2019 approval systems with a Union approval procedure,\r\nestablishing a harmonised framework containing the administrative provisions\r\nand general technical requirements for all new vehicles, systems, components\r\nand separate technical units. That Directive incorporated UNECE Regulations in\r\nthe EC type-approval system, either as requirements for type-approval or as\r\nalternatives to Union legislation. Since the adoption of Directive 2007/46/EC,\r\nUNECE Regulations have increasingly replaced Union legislation in the framework\r\nof EC type-approval.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the
