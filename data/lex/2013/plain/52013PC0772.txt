Under Articles 10 and 118 of the Conditions of\r\nEmployment of Other Servants of the European Union, those provisions apply by\r\nanalogy to temporary and contract staff serving in third countries.\nRemuneration is payable in euros in\r\nBelgium, however upon request of an official, a member of temporary or contract\r\nstaff, all or part of it may be paid in the currency of the country of\r\nemployment. In that event, it is subject to the weighting for the place of\r\nemployment and is converted on the basis of the corresponding exchange rate. \nIn order to ensure as far as possible that\r\nofficials, temporary and contract staff of the Union enjoy equivalent\r\npurchasing power irrespective of their place of employment, the Council should adjust\r\nthe weightings once a year. To establish the purchasing power equivalence of\r\nthe remuneration paid in Brussels, as the reference city, with that paid in the\r\nother places of employment Eurostat calculates the economic parities. \nThe weighting is the factor obtained by\r\ndividing the economic parity by the exchange rate. The exchange rates used are established\r\nin accordance with the rules for the implementation of the Financial Regulation\r\nand correspond to the date of application of the weightings. \nThe initial weightings applicable from 10\r\nOctober 1987 were laid down in the Council Regulation (ECSC, EEC, Euratom) No\r\n2175/88 of 18 July 1988. The most recent weightings, which took effect on 1\r\nJuly 2012, were laid down by the Council in Regulation (EU) No 679/2013 of 15\r\nJuly 2013.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe elements of the proposal have been\r\ndiscussed with the staff representatives in accordance with the appropriate\r\nprocedures.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 13 of Annex X to the Staff\r\nRegulations constitute the legal basis.\nThe attached proposal for the Council\r\nRegulation adjusts the weightings applicable from 1 July 2013 to the\r\nremuneration of officials, temporary staff and contract staff of the European\r\nUnion serving in a third country.\nThe Council should, by the written\r\nprocedure within one month, act on a proposal from the Commission by the\r\nqualified majority provided for in Article 16(4) and (5) of the Treaty on\r\nEuropean Union. Should a Member State request formal examination of the\r\nCommission proposal, the Council should act within two months.\nThe Annex to the proposed Council Regulation\r\nsets out the weightings derived from the parities communicated by Eurostat for\r\nJuly 2013 for all places of employment outside the European Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe budgetary impact is small (in\r\npercentage terms); see the Financial Statement.\n2013/0380 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nlaying down the weightings applicable from\r\n1 July 2013 to the remuneration of officials, temporary staff and contract\r\nstaff of the European Union serving in third countries\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to the Staff Regulations of\r\nOfficials and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European\r\nUnion, as laid down by Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 ([1]), and in particular the first\r\nparagraph of Article 13 of Annex X thereto, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission, \nWhereas: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to take\r\naccount of changes in the cost of living in third countries and to determine\r\naccordingly the weightings applicable from 1 July 2013 to remuneration paid in\r\nthe currency of the country of employment to officials, temporary staff and\r\ncontract staff of the Union serving in third countries. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The weightings in respect\r\nof which payment has been made on the basis of Council Regulation (EU) No\r\n679/2013 ([2])\r\nmay lead to back-dated upward or downward adjustments to remuneration. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision should be made\r\nfor back-payments in the event of an increase in remuneration as a result of\r\nthe new weightings. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision should be made\r\nfor the recovery of sums overpaid in the event of a reduction in remuneration\r\nas a result of the new weightings for the period between 1 July 2013 and the\r\ndate of entry into force of this Regulation. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision should be made\r\nfor any such recovery to be restricted to a period of no more than six months\r\npreceding the date of entry into force of this Regulation,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.

The figure provided in the\r\nfirst column (PPP) is the product of multiplying the exchange rate (TX) by the\r\nweighting (CC). The mathematical formula used to calculate the CC is therefore:\r\nPPP (provided by Eurostat) divided by TX = CC. The amounts due to staff are\r\ncalculated by applying the invariable PPP established by this table \u2014 not by\r\nmultiplying each time the CC by the TX of the date of the transaction, since\r\nthis TX is variable and will produce a different (wrong) PPP.\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FRAMEWORK OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Title of the\r\nproposal/initiative \nProposal for a Council Regulation laying down the\r\nweightings applicable from 1 July 2013 to the remuneration of officials,\r\ntemporary staff and contract staff of the European Union serving in third\r\ncountries\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Policy area(s) concerned\r\nin the ABM/ABB structure[4] \nAll areas and activities are potentially concerned\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nTo ensure the same purchasing power of EU officials and\r\nother civil servants regardless of their place of employment\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00fd Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\n\u2013      Implementation with a start-up period from 1 July 2013,\n\u2013      followed by full-scale operation.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) planned[5] \n\u00fd Centralised\r\ndirect management by the Commission: PMO\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL\r\nIMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the multiannual\r\nfinancial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7     \r\nExisting budget lines \n\u00b7      The proposal has a financial impact on all budgetary lines related\r\nto staff expenditure in the Commission and the EEAS.\nIn order of multiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Description\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026.] || DA/NDA ([6]) || from EFTA[7] countries || from candidate countries[8] || from third countries || within the meaning of Article 18(1)(aa) of the Financial Regulation \n   || European Commission: XX-01.01.02, 08.01.05.01, 19.01.04.02, 19.01.04.03, 21.01.04.01, 21.01.04.10.
