It is\r\nbased on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening\r\nthe conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth\r\nunderpinned by financial stability, thereby supporting the achievement of the Union's objectives for sustainable growth and jobs. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n473/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on common\r\nprovisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the\r\ncorrection of excessive deficit of the Member States in the euro area sets out\r\nprovisions for enhanced monitoring of budgetary policies in the euro area and\r\nfor ensuring that national budgets are consistent with the economic policy\r\nguidance issued in the context of the SGP and the European Semester. Since\r\npurely budgetary measures might be insufficient to ensure a lasting correction\r\nof the excessive deficit, additional policy measures and structural reforms may\r\nbe required.\u00a0 \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 9 of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 473/2013 sets out the modalities for Economic Partnership Programmes,\r\nto be submitted by euro area Member States under an Excessive Deficit\r\nProcedure. Setting out a roadmap of measures to contribute to an effective and\r\ndurable correction of the excessive deficit, the Economic\r\nPartnership Programme should detail the main\r\nfiscal-structural reforms, in particular those referring to taxation, pension\r\nand health systems and budgetary frameworks, which will be instrumental to\r\ncorrect the excessive deficit in a lasting manner. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 21 June 2013, the Council\r\nadopted a decision according to Article 126(6) of the Treaty, whereby Malta is placed in an excessive deficit procedure. In this context, Malta was requested to present an Economic Partnership Programme by 1 October 2013. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 October 2013, and thereby\r\nwithin the time frame established by Article 9(3) of Regulation (EU) No 473/2013,\r\nMalta presented to the Commission and to the Council an Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme, setting out structural reforms that aim at strengthening public\r\nfinances and, more broadly, complying with the 2013 Country-Specific\r\nRecommendations (CSRs). These policies can be grouped under the following\r\nobjectives: (i) ensuring public finance sustainability (CSR 1, 2 and 4), (ii)\r\nenhancing the efficiency of the public administration (CSR 2 and 5), (iii)\r\nraising potential output, while enhancing competitiveness and promoting a\r\ndiversified and balanced economy (CSR 2, 3 and 4) and (iv) safeguarding\r\nfinancial stability (CSR 5). \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fiscal-structural\r\nmeasures that Malta plans to implement are the following: (i) reform of the\r\nfiscal framework, (ii) a spending review at ministry level, (iii) taking the\r\npension reform further by introducing a third pension pillar, (iv) measures to\r\nimprove the provision of services in the health sector, (v)\r\nrestructuring of state-owned enterprises, (vi) increasing the efficiency of the\r\npublic administration and (vii) gradually shifting the burden of taxation from\r\ndirect to indirect taxes. The set of measures is broadly adequate and could be\r\nexpected to contribute to the strengthening of the public finances.\r\nNevertheless, further efforts in some areas, such as ensuring the long-term\r\nsustainability of public finances, appear necessary.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reform of the fiscal\r\nframework is adequate and can be expected to strengthen fiscal governance and\r\nto help contain fiscal slippages. The appointment of an independent fiscal\r\ncouncil can be expected to contribute to an enhanced monitoring and planning of\r\n  Malta's public finances. The reform, however, has not been adopted by the\r\nparliament yet.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ongoing spending\r\nreview that aims to identify expenditure savings and improve the efficiency of\r\npublic spending can result, on the one hand, in lower growth in expenditure\r\nand, on the other, in more growth-friendly public spending.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The introduction of a\r\nthird pension pillar could improve the adequacy of the pension system, but it\r\nwould not contribute towards improving its sustainability. None of the other\r\nrelevant measures recommended to Malta under CSR 2, namely accelerating the\r\nincrease of the statutory retirement age and increasing the effective\r\nretirement age, appear to be under consideration.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The planned measures to\r\nimprove the provision of services in the health sector can be expected to\r\nimprove the efficiency and adequacy of the system. Still, at the same time it\r\ncan contribute to higher demand and take-up of government-funded healthcare\r\nservices. In the absence of more detailed information on the measures it is not\r\npossible to determine to what extent the reform can lower the pressure on\r\npublic expenditure in the long-term.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Restructuring state-owned\r\nenterprises, such as the national airline Air Malta and the energy company\r\nEnemalta, could improve their financial performance and in turn reduce the\r\ncontingent liabilities on the government finances. Policy efforts in the energy\r\nsector are particularly notable, where the main energy provider Enemalta holds\r\ngovernment-guaranteed debt of around 10% of GDP. In addition, this can be\r\nexpected to reduce the need for government subsidies in the future.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The authorities present a\r\nmix of ongoing and new measures that can be expected to raise the capacity of\r\nthe public administration to enforce tax compliance and to reduce tax evasion.\r\nIn addition, the programme contains measures that would reduce the length and\r\nincrease the efficiency of public procurement procedures.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The indicated gradual shift\r\nfrom direct to indirect taxation could encourage job creation and improve the\r\ngrowth-friendliness of the tax system. However, the shift is described in very\r\nbroad terms without providing details. In addition, plans to reduce the debt\r\nbias in corporate taxation are still missing.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme also contains a variety of non-fiscal structural measures that\r\nbroadly aim at complying with the 2013 Country-Specific Recommendations. The\r\npolicy plans include comprehensive reforms of the judicial system and the\r\ndiversification of energy sources. The measures appear to be in the right\r\ndirection and can be expected to contribute to the creation of growth and jobs\r\nin Malta, while also safeguarding financial stability. Nevertheless, in general\r\nthey are still work in progress, while the information provided is often\r\nlimited. Therefore, further analysis of the impact of the policy plans and\r\ntheir contribution to addressing the challenges identified in the 2013 CSRs\r\nwill be needed once the policy plans become more concrete and their\r\nimplementation advances,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS OPINION: \nThe Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme of Malta presented to the Commission and to the Council on 1 October\r\n2013 includes a set of fiscal-structural reforms that is partially adequate to\r\nsupport the achievement of a sound fiscal position. Specifically, the Economic\r\nPartnership Programme takes further the fiscal and non-fiscal reform agenda\r\nincluded in the 2013 National Reform Programme and Stability Programme and adds\r\npolicy plans aiming at improving the efficiency of government expenditure,\r\nreinforcing the public administration and restructuring state-owned\r\nenterprises. In general, however, all reforms are work in progress and their\r\nadoption and implementation remain subject to risks. In addition, some CSRs are\r\nyet to be fully addressed, namely the debt bias in corporate taxation in CSR 1 and\r\nthe long-term sustainability of public finances in CSR 2. Malta is therefore\r\ninvited to provide additional information on the implementation of the planned\r\nreforms in the upcoming National Reform Programme and Stability Programme,\r\nwhile considering additional measures that would be instrumental to ensuring\r\nlong-term public finance sustainability. The Commission and the Council will\r\nmonitor the implementation of the reforms in the context of the European\r\nSemester.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 140, 27.5.2013 p. 11.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
