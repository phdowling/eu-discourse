In line with\r\nArticle 266 of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the\r\ninstitutions of the European Union are obliged to comply with the judgment of\r\nthe General Court. Consequently, the European Commission initiated the partial\r\nreopening of the anti-subsidy investigation in so far as it concerns Novatex. \nThe enclosed Commission proposal for a\r\nCouncil Regulation imposing an amended definitive countervailing duty on Novatex\r\nis made upon the interested parties having been given sufficient time to\r\nprovide comments to the revised final disclosure document of 25 June 2013. \nIt is proposed that the Council adopt the\r\nattached proposal for a Regulation which should be published in the Official\r\nJournal of the European Union as soon as possible.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nCouncil Regulation (EC) 597/2009 on\r\nprotection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the\r\nEuropean Community.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union.

PROCEDURE\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Implementing Regulation\r\n(EU) No 857/2010[5]\r\n('the contested Regulation'), the Council imposed definitive anti-subsidy duties\r\nranging from 44,02 euro per tonne to 139,70 euro per tonne eon imports of certain\r\npolyethylene terephthalate having a viscosity number of 78 ml/g or higher,\r\naccording to ISO Standard 1628-5, originating in Iran, Pakistan and the United\r\nArab Emirates.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 6 December 2010, the\r\nco-operating exporting producer in Pakistan, namely Novatex Ltd ('Novatex' or\r\n'the company concerned'), lodged an application at the General Court seeking\r\nthe annulment of the contested Regulation in so far as it applied to the\r\napplicant[6].\r\n\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 11 October 2012, the\r\nGeneral Court in its judgment in case T-556/10 ('the General Court judgment')\r\nfound that the failure of the Commission and the Council to take account of the\r\nfigure resulting from the revision of line 74 of the 2008 tax return and the\r\nerror resulting therefrom affect the legality of Article 1 of the contested Regulation\r\nin so far as the definitive countervailing duty fixed by the Council exceeded\r\nthe duty applicable in the absence of that error. Therefore, the General Court\r\nannulled Article 1 of the contested Regulation in so far as it concerned Novatex\r\nand in so far as the definitive countervailing duty exceeded that applicable in\r\nthe absence of the error. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The General Court in case\r\nT-2/95[7]\r\n(the 'IPS case') has recognised that, in cases where a\r\nproceeding consists of several administrative steps, the annulment of one of\r\nthose steps does not annul the complete proceeding. This anti-subsidy\r\nproceeding is an example of such a multi-step proceeding. Consequently, the\r\nannulment of part of the contested anti-subsidy Regulation does not imply the\r\nannulment of the entire procedure prior to the adoption of that Regulation.\r\nMoreover, according to Article 266 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union ('TFEU'), the\r\nUnion institutions are obliged to comply with the General Court judgment of 11\r\nOctober 2012. This also implies the possibility to remedy the aspects of the\r\ncontested Regulation which led to its partial annulment, while leaving\r\nunchanged the uncontested parts which are not affected by the General Court\r\njudgment[8].\r\nIt should be noted that all other findings made in the contested Regulation\r\nremain valid.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\r\nthe General Court judgment of 11 October 2012, the Commission partially\r\nreopened, on 17 May 2013, the anti-subsidy investigation concerning imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating, inter alia, in Pakistan[9]. The reopening was limited in scope to the implementation of the General\r\nCourt judgment in so far as Novatex is concerned. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission officially advised the exporting producers, importers, users and raw\r\nmaterial suppliers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting\r\ncountry and the Union industry of the partial reopening of the investigation.\r\nInterested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in\r\nwriting and to request a hearing within the time-limit set out in the notice.\r\nNone of the interested parties requested to be heard.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All parties concerned were\r\ninformed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was\r\nintended to recommend the imposition of an amended definitive countervailing\r\nduty on Novatex. They were granted a period within which to make\r\nrepresentations subsequent to disclosure. \nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GENERAL\r\nCOURT JUDGMENT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary\r\nremark\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis recalled that the reason for the partial annulment of the contested\r\nRegulation was that the Commission and the Council should have taken account of\r\nthe fact that line 74 of the 2008 tax return of the company concerned had been\r\nrevised. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of interested\r\nparties\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Within the applicable\r\ndeadline for submitting comments the company concerned, Novatex, commented that\r\nfollowing the judgment of 11 October 2012, the definitive countervailing duty\r\nfor imports into the European Union of certain polyethylene terephthalate\r\noriginating in Pakistan should be reduced by 1.02%. Novatex further stated that\r\nthe countervailing duty applicable to Novatex should be set at 4.1% or EUR 35,39\r\nper tonne as from 1 June 2010 (the alleged date of entry into force of the\r\nprovisional duty).\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No further comments of any\r\nsubstance on the partial re-opening were received.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis of comments \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having analysed the above\r\ncomments, it is confirmed that the annulment of Implementing Regulation (EU) No\r\n857/2010 with regard to Novatex, insofar as the definitive countervailing duty\r\nexceeded the duty applicable in the absence of the error identified by the\r\nCourt, should not imply the annulment of the entire procedure prior to the\r\nadoption of the Regulation. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The recalculation of\r\nNovatex\u2019 subsidy duty rate, taking account of the modified line 74 of the\r\ncompany\u2019s tax return, indeed results in a corrected amount of EUR 35,39 per\r\ntonne.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The revised duty rate\r\nshould indeed be applied retroactively, i.e. from the date of entry into force\r\nof Implementing Regulation (EU) No 857/2010. By virtue of Article 2 of that\r\nregulation, it will also apply from the entry into force of Commission\r\nRegulation (EU) No 473/2010 imposing a provisional countervailing duty. That\r\nCommission Regulation entered into force the day following its publication in\r\nthe Official Journal of the European Union, i.e. on 2 June 2010 (and not on 1\r\nJune 2010 as stated by Novatex). \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Account taken of the\r\ncomments made and the analysis thereof it is therefore concluded that the\r\nimplementation of the General Court judgment should take the form of a revision\r\nof the countervailing duty duty rate applicable to Novatex, which should be\r\nreduced from 44.02 euro/tonne to 35.39 euro/tonne. As Novatex was the sole\r\nexporting producer of the product concerned in Pakistan during the investigation\r\nperiod, this revised duty rate applies to all imports from Pakistan. The revised duty rate should be applied retroactively, i.e. as from the date of\r\nentering into force of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 857/2010. By virtue of\r\nArticle 2 of that Regulation, it should also apply from the entry into force of\r\nCommission Regulation (EU) No 473/2010 imposing a provisional countervailing\r\nduty.. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Customs authorities should\r\nbe instructed to proceed with the reimbursement of the amount of duties paid in\r\nexcess of the amount of 35,39 euro/tonne for the imports concerned in\r\ncompliance with the applicable customs legislation. \nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DISCLOSURE\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties were\r\ninformed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was\r\nintended to implement the General Court judgment.
