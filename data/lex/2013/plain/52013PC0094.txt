These measures have expired on 13 December 2012. \n Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n Consultation of interested parties \n Interested parties concerned by the proceeding have had the possibility to defend their interests during the investigation, in line with the provisions of the basic Regulation. \n Collection and use of expertise \n There was no need for external expertise. \n Impact assessment This proposal is the result of the implementation of the basic Regulation. The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n Summary of the proposed action The attached proposal for a Council Implementing Regulation is based on the findings of the investigation, which has confirmed that assembly of lighters in Vietnam using Chinese parts is taking place and that all other criteria for the establishment of circumvention as set out in Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation are met. It is therefore proposed that the Council adopt the attached proposal to extend the anti-dumping measures on gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the PRC to imports of the same product consigned from Vietnam. The relevant Council Regulation should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union no later than 23 March 2013. \n Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community and in particular Article 13 thereof. \n Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n Indication of how the financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n Choice of instruments \n Proposed instruments: Regulation. \n Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The above-mentioned basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the\nUnion budget.\n2013/0058 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nextending the definitive anti-dumping duty\nimposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1458/2007 on imports of gas-fuelled,\nnon-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina to imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters consigned\nfrom the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, whether declared as originating in the\nSocialist Republic of Vietnam or not\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[1]\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Article 13 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) after consulting the Advisory Committee,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Background\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\n1991, the Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 3433/91[2],\nimposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 16.9% on imports of gas-fuelled,\nnon-refillable pocket flint lighters originating, inter alia, in the People's\nRepublic of China ('PRC') (the product under investigation).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 1995, by Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1006/95[3] the original ad valorem duty was replaced by a specific duty of ECU\n0,065 per lighter.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further to an\ninvestigation in accordance with Article 13 of the basic Regulation the above\nmeasures were extended by Council Regulation (EC) No 192/1999[4] to (1) imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters\nconsigned from or originating in Taiwan and (2) imports of certain refillable\nlighters originating in the PRC or consigned from or originating in Taiwan with\na free-at-Community frontier, duty unpaid value per piece below EUR 0,15. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2001, the Council, by\nRegulation (EC) No 1824/2001[5] confirmed the definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1006/95 as extended by Council Regulation (EC) No 192/1999\n('existing measures') pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2007, the Council, by\nRegulation (EC) No 1458/2007[6] (\u2018the original Regulation\u2019) confirmed the definitive anti-dumping\nduty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001 pursuant to Article 11(2) of the\nbasic Regulation. These measures will hereinafter be\nreferred to as 'the original measures' and the investigation that led to the\nmeasures imposed by the original Regulation will be hereinafter referred to as\n'the original investigation'. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, published on\n12 December 2012[7]\na notice of expiry of the anti-dumping measures.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the expiry of the\nmeasures on 13 December 2012, by Regulation EC No 1192/2012[8] the registration of imports of\ngas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters consigned from Vietnam,\nwhether declared as originating in Vietnam or not was therefore discontinued as\nfrom the same date (see also recital (14)). \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Request\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 17 April 2012, the\nEuropean Commission received a request pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of\nthe basic Regulation (the request) to investigate the possible circumvention of\nthe anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable\npocket flint lighters originating in the PRC and to make imports of gas-fuelled,\nnon-refillable pocket flint lighters consigned from the Socialist Republic of\nVietnam (\u2018Vietnam\u2019), whether declared as originating in Vietnam or not, subject\nto registration.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request was lodged by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nBIC, a Union producer of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request contained\nsufficient prima facie evidence that the original measures were being\ncircumvented by means of assembly operations in Vietnam.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request showed that\nfollowing the imposition of the original measures, a significant change in the\npattern of trade involving exports from the PRC and Vietnam to the Union\noccurred, for which there was insufficient due cause or economic justification\nother than the imposition of the original measures. This change in the pattern\nof trade stemmed allegedly from the assembly operations of lighters in Vietnam\nusing parts originating in the PRC.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the prima\nfacie evidence pointed to the fact that the remedial effects of the\noriginal measures were being undermined both in terms of quantity and price.\nThe evidence showed in particular that the increased imports from Vietnam were\nmade at prices below the non-injurious price established in the original\ninvestigation.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, there was also sufficient\nprima facie evidence that prices of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket\nflint lighters consigned from Vietnam were dumped in relation to the normal\nvalue established during the original investigation.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee,\nthat sufficient prima facie evidence existed for the initiation of an\ninvestigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation, the Commission\ninitiated an investigation by Commission Regulation (EU) No 548/2012[9] (\u2018the initiating Regulation\u2019). Pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5)\nof the basic Regulation, the Commission, by the initiating Regulation, also\ndirected the customs authorities to register imports of gas-fuelled,\nnon-refillable pocket flint lighters consigned from Vietnam, whether declared\nas originating in Vietnam or not.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the authorities of the PRC and Vietnam, the exporting producers in\nthose countries, the importers in the Union known to be concerned and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nBIC (the applicant), a Union producer representing more than 75% of the\nproduction of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters in the European\nUnion, of the initiation of the investigation. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Questionnaires were sent to\n70 exporting producers in the PRC and 15 exporting producers in Vietnam known\nto the Commission from the request. Questionnaires were also sent to 59 importers\nin the Union named in the request. Interested parties were given the\nopportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing\nwithin the time limit set in the initiating Regulation. All parties were informed that non-cooperation\nmight lead to the application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation and to\nfindings being based on the facts available.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eight\nout of the 15 known exporting producers in Vietnam came forward, one of which claimed\nthat it did not want to be considered as interested party as it did not produce\nthe product under investigation and did not have any exports to the Union. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nfollowing seven companies submitted replies to the questionnaires and\nverification visits were subsequently carried out at their premises:\n\u2013              \nViet Giai Thanh Co. Ltd, Ho Chi Minh City\n\u2013              \nHoa Hung Co. Ltd, Tay Ninh Province\n\u2013              \nTrung Lai Gas Lighter Manufacture Co.

Ltd,\nTay Ninh Province\n\u2013              \nHuaxing Vietnam Manufacture Co. Ltd, Tay Ninh\nProvince\n\u2013              \nTop Field Enterprises Co. Ltd, Tay Ninh Province\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 None of the known exporting\nproducers in the PRC came forward or submitted a questionnaire reply. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards importers, eight\nsubmitted a questionnaire reply whereas six companies came forward and claimed\nthat they did not want to be considered as interested parties as they did not\nimport in the Union gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters from\nVietnam (the product under investigation). The remaining known companies did\nnot come forward at all.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the initiation of\nthe ivestigation, two importers requested and were granted a hearing which was\nheld in the course of September 2012. The importers also provided their\nobservations in writing. Their observations questioned the grounds of the\ninitiation of the investigation as regards the product scope, import volumes,\neconomic justification for the changes in the pattern of trade, the motivations\nbehind the request and the financial situation of the Union prducer having made\nthe request. In the opinion of the importers, there were insufficient grounds\nto initiate an investigation. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission provided a\ndetailed reply to the observations and gave the parties an opportunity to\ncomment. The Commission outlined why it considered that the request contained\nsufficient prima facie evidence to justify the initiation of the\ninvestigation. The comments made by the two importers did not demonstrate that\nthere would not have been sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the\ninitiation of the investigation.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation period\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation period\ncovered the period from 1 January 2008 to 31 March 2012 (\u2018the IP\u2019). Data were\ncollected for the IP to investigate, inter alia, the alleged change in\nthe pattern of trade. More detailed data were collected for the reporting\nperiod from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012 (\u2018the RP\u2019) in order to examine the\npossible undermining of the remedial effect of the measures and the existence\nof dumping.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF THE\nINVESTIGATION\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General considerations\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n13(1) of the basic Regulation, the assessment of the existence of circumvention\nwas made by analysing successively whether there was a change in the pattern of\ntrade between the PRC, Vietnam and the Union; if this change stemmed from a\npractice, process or work for which there was insufficient due cause or\neconomic justification other than the imposition of the duty; if there was\nevidence of injury or that the remedial effects of the duty were being\nundermined in terms of the prices and/or quantities of the product under\ninvestigation; and whether there was evidence of dumping in relation to the\nnormal values previously established in the original investigation, if\nnecessary in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of the basic\nRegulation.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product concerned and the\nproduct under investigation\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned is as\ndefined in the original investigation: gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint\nlighters currently falling within CN code ex 9613 10 00 and originating in the\nPeople's Republic of China ('the product concerned').\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product under\ninvestigation is the same as that defined in the previous recital, but\nconsigned from Vietnam, whether declared as originating in Vietnam or not,\ncurrently falling within the same CN code as the product concerned ('the\nproduct under investigation').\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters, as defined above,\nexported from the PRC to the Union and those consigned from Vietnam to the\nUnion have the same basic physical and technical characteristics and have the\nsame uses, and are therefore to be considered as like products within the\nmeaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Degree of cooperation and\ndetermination of the trade volumes \nVietnam\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in recital (18), seven\ncompanies submitted questionnaire replies. For the RP, the total volume of lighters\nreported as sold to the Union according to these replies represented more than 100%\nof the total volume of lighters reported as imported into the Union according\nto the Eurostat Comext database. Despite the fact that the information\nregarding sales volumes in the replies was considered to be unreliable as\nexplained in recital (29) below, it is considered that this still gives an\nindication that cooperation was high and that the companies investigated are\nrepresentative.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During\nthe verification visits carried-out at the premises of the seven Vietnamese\nexporting producers, it was found that they all had submitted information which\ncould not be considered to be reliable for the purpose of establishing the\nfindings relevant to the investigation. In particular, the seven companies were\nfound to have wrongly stated their production volumes, imports of lighter parts\nand total sales. It was also found that part of the business relating to the\nproduct under investigation was not inluded in the official acounts and that\ncertain assembly operations were carried out by unofficial subcontractors.\nMoreover, quantities of imports of parts from the PRC were not declared or\nwrongly stated, and part of the sales were not accounted for in the accounts of\nthe companies. As a result, it has not been possible to reliably establish in\nparticular the total production and total sales volumes of the companies\nconcerned and to reconcile the actual sale prices of the product under\ninvestigation and the costs relating to key input materials such as gas with\nthe data provided in the questionnaire replies. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the situation\ndescribed above in recital (29), the exporting producers were informed that pursuant\nto Article 18 of the basic Regulation it was envisaged to base the findings and\nconclusions of the investigation on best facts available. Parties were given an\nopportunity to comment and were granted a hearing when requested. Each party\nreceived an individual letter outlining the specific and detailed findings which\nled to the conclusion that the data provided could not be considered to be reliable\nand was not suitable to establish the facts necessary for the investigation. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two exporting producers did\nnot provide any comments on the intention to apply Article 18 of the basic\nRegulation. The other five exporting producers, composed of two individual\ncompanies and one group of three companies, requested and were granted a\nhearing which was held in the course of November 2012. These exporting\nproducers also provided their observations in writing. They disputed the\nCommission\u2019s intention to disregard the data they provided and the possible\nconclusion of the existence of circumvention based on the application of best\nfacts available. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Four of the exporting\nproducers did not contest the fact that the information they provided was not\ncomplete or reliable and admitted the discrepancies in their accounting and the\nfact that not all operations were disclosed or recorded in their books.\nHowever, they claimed that these differences only concerned their domestic\nsales and did not have any effect on their export sales. One party claimed that\nits records had been destroyed by a fire, which explained the incompleteness of\nthe information available. They further claimed that the quantity of gas\ncontained in the lighters was wrongly estimated by the Commission and that therefore\nthe findings regarding the production volumes were not correct. One company\nclaimed that the discrepancy in gas consumption was explained by intentional\nreleases of gas during the warmer months. These parties could however not provide\nany substantiated evidence to support these claims. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The companies also stated that\nthey were fully cooperative and were not withholding any information concerning\ntheir business. They admitted to have provided deficient replies but strongly\ncontested having submitted false and misleading information. In their view,\nundisclosed and unverifiable data in itself does not consitute a proof of\ncircumvention and according to them, the Commission has not demonstrated that\ncircumvention was taking place based on positive evidence.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should nevertheless be\npointed out that although the companies have not themselves provided complete\nand accurate records of their activities, the Commission has used alternative\nmethods, such as the consumption of raw materials, to reconcile the key data\nprovided in the questionnaire replies with the information provided and\ndiscovered on spot. Such alternative methods, even if inevitably less precise\nthan actual records, showed that the data provided was not reliable. For\ninstance, the outcome concerning production volume showed that the production\nquantities declared by the companies did not match with their consumption of\nraw materials.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission considers\nthat the absence of reliable records, the withholding of information which is\nrelevant for the investigation and the submission of false or misleading\ninformation rendered the data unreliable following a verification process. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the above, findings\nin respect of imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters from\nVietnam into the Union had to be made on the basis of facts available in\naccordance with Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation. As a consequence, in\norder to ensure that the failure of the parties to provide the information does\nnot hinder the investigation, the Commission has replaced the unverifiable data\nprovided by the Vietnamese producers with other available data, such as the\nEurostat Comext database to determine the overall import volumes from Vietnam\ninto the Union, and cost data provided in the request to determine the share of\nChinese parts (see recital (50) below). \nThe People's Republic\nof China\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was no cooperation\nfrom the Chinese exporting producers. Therefore, findings in respect of imports\nof the product concerned into the Union and exports of gas-fuelled,\nnon-refillable pocket flint lighters from the PRC to Vietnam had to be made on\nthe basis of facts available in accordance with Article 18(1) of the basic\nRegulation. UN Comtrade statistics provided in the request were used for the\ndetermination of the overall exports from the PRC to Vietnam.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change in the pattern of\ntrade\nImports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable\npocket flint lighters into the Union \n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports of the product\nconcerned from PRC dropped in 1991 when the measures were first introduced. The\nimports have remained small throughout the successive modifications and\nextensions of the measures in 1995, 1999, 2001 and 2007. \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports of lighters from\nPRC between 1 January 2008 to 31 March 2012 were relatively stable in terms of\nvolume, around 50 million pieces for 2008 and 2009, 70 million pieces in 2010\nand 60 million in 2011 and the RP. They consisted however only of refillable\nmodels and electrical piezo lighters which were not subject to the measures. \n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nimports of the product under investigation from Vietnam have increased over\ntime. While in 1997 there were practically no imports into the Union of the\nproduct under investigation from Vietnam, since 2007 there was a rapid increase\nin the import volume of the product under investigation. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In RP imports from Vietnam\nrepresented 84% of all imports to the EU.\n Imports from Vietnam into the EU27 of non-refillable lighters in % of all imports \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RP \n Market share || 80% || 84% || 83% || 84% || 84% \n Source: statistics provided in the request \nExports of lighter parts from the PRC to Vietnam\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Flint lighter parts were exported\nfrom the PRC to Vietnam during the IP. Vietnam is the most important export\ndestination of flint lighter parts from PRC. According to the statistics\nprovided in the request, the exports of lighter parts from PRC to Vietnam have\nincreased significantly since 1999. In 1999, exports of lighter parts from the PRC\nto Vietnam were less than 3% of total exports, whereas in 2010 Vietnam became the\nfirst export destination of lighter parts with a share of 26%. In volumes, this\nwould correspond to an increase from less than 50 million to 200 million\nfinished lighters.\nProduction volumes of gas-fuelled,\nnon-refillable pocket flint lighters in Vietnam\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the information provided\nby the Vietnamese producers had to be disregarded, no verifiable information could\nbe obtained on the possible levels of the genuine production of gas-fuelled,\nnon-refillable pocket flint lighters. \n2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the change in\nthe pattern of trade\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The overall decrease of the\nexports from the PRC to the Union and the increase of exports from Vietnam to\nthe Union since 2007 and the significant increase of exports of lighter parts\nfrom the PRC to Vietnam since 1999 constituted a change in the pattern of trade\nbetween the above mentioned countries, on the one hand, and the Union, on the\nother.\n2.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nature of the circumvention\npractice\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 13(1) of the basic\nRegulation requires that the change in the pattern of trade stems from a\npractice, process or work for which there is insufficient due cause or economic\njustification other than the imposition of the duty. The practice, process or\nwork includes, inter alia, the assembly of parts by an assembly\noperation in a third country. For this purpose the existence of assembly\noperations is determined in accordance with Article 13(2) of the basic\nRegulation. \nAssembly operations\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned above, the\nabsence of reliable records and witholding information which was relevant for\nthe investigation has led to the application of Article 18 of the basic\nRegulation. Whether or not an assembly operation in Vietnam could be considered\nto circumvent the measures had to be based on facts available. \n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has\nrevealed that the circumvention is taking place through assembly operations\nconducted by Vietnamese companies that operate in close cooperation with\nChinese and Hong Kong registered companies. The cooperating Vietnamese\nproducers are in vast majority owned by Chinese and Hong Kong companies. Also\nthe management of the Vietnamese companies is to a large extent composed of\nChinese professionals who have previously worked for lighter producers in PRC.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Vietnamese producers\nimport their lighter parts from PRC through related companies registered in\nHong Kong. Some of the Vietnamese producers operate under processing agreements\nwith Chinese and/or Hong Kong principals. Under these agreements, the Chinese\nprincipal provides the lighter parts and plastic to the Vietnamese factory, and\nsells the finished lighters. Even in the absence of such processing agreements,\nthe lighters produced in Vietnam are typically sold to Hong Kong companies who\nare in charge of the commercial relationship with EU importers.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the unreliability of\nthe information provided by the Vietnamese producers, it has not been possible\nto determine whether the percentage thresholds set out in Article 13(2) of the basic\nRegulation are fulfilled or not. It has not been possible to verify whether the\nlighter parts originating from the PRC constitute more or less than 60% of the\ntotal value of the assembled lighters and whether or not the value added to the\nparts brought in has been greater or lesser than 25% of the manufacturing cost.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe absence of reliable information from the Vietnamese producers, the determination\nmust be made on the basis of the facts available. The information provided in\nthe request shows that the lighter parts originating from PRC represent between\n60% and 70% of the total value and that the value added to the parts brought in\ncorresponds to 12% of the manufacturing costs. These values are based on comparable\nproduction costs of a manufacturer located in the PRC. The underlying calculations\nare considered to be reasonably accurate and to reflect the division of costs\nin Vietnam, because the lighter parts and raw materials used are the same in\nboth the PRC and Vietnam. Any adjustments due to lower local costs in Vietnam\nwould result in an even larger share of Chinese value in the finished lighters.\n2.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Insufficient due cause or economic justification other\nthan the imposition of the anti-dumping duty\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation did not\nbring to light any other due cause or economic justification for the assembly\noperations than the avoidance of the original measures on the product\nconcerned. The Vietnamese producers have claimed that the cause for moving the\nproduction would be the lower labour costs in Vietnam, but the claim has not\nbeen substantiated. In any case a general labour cost difference would not\nexplain why the production in a specific sector (lighters) would move to\nVietnam, whereas PRC continues to be a producer in other sectors and of lighter\nparts for example. \n2.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injury or undermining of\nthe remedial effect of the anti-dumping duty \n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The existence of injury\nhaving been addressed in the original regulation, the scope of the current\ninvestigation included the assessment of whether the remedial effects of the\nduties in place are being undermined in terms of the prices and/or quantities\nof the like product.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To assess whether the\nimported product under investigation had, in terms of quantities and prices,\nundermined the remedial effects of the original measures on imports of the\nproduct concerned, Eurostat Comext datase was used as the best data available\nconcerning quantities and prices of imports from Vietnam. The prices so\ndetermined were compared to the injury elimination level established for Union\nproducers in recital (63) of Regulation No1006/95. \n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The increase of imports\nfrom Vietnam to the Union from 0.6% of Union imports in 1998 to 80% in 2008\n(start of the IP) and to 84% of Union imports in the RP (the end of the IP),\nsee the table in paragraph 2.4 above, was considered to be significant in terms\nof quantities. In the same period, the imports from PRC into the Union\ndecreased significantly, from 30% to 10% of share of all imports. \n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the\ninjury elimination level as established in the original investigation and the\nweighted average export price for Vietnamese declared exports showed\nsignificant underselling. It was therefore concluded that the remedial effects\nof the duty, as determined in the original regulation are being undermined in\nterms of both quantities and prices.\n2.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evidence of dumping \n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, in accordance with\nArticle 13(1) and (2) of the basic Regulation it was examined whether there was\nevidence of dumping by comparing the normal value previously established in the\noriginal investigation with the export prices from Vietnam.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the original investigation\nthe normal value was established on the basis of prices in Brazil, which in\nthat investigation was found to be an appropriate market economy analogue\ncountry for the PRC. \n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The export prices from Vietnam\nwere based on facts available, i.e. on the average export price of gas-fuelled,\nnon-refillable pocket flint lighters during the RP as reported in Eurostat Comext\ndatabase. The use of facts available was due to unreliable information from the\nVietnamese producers concerning the product under investigation. \n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe purpose of a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price,\ndue allowance, in the form of adjustments, was made for differences which\naffect prices and price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the\nbasic Regulation. Accordingly, adjustments were made for differences in\ntransport, insurance and packing costs. Given that there was no reliable\ninformation obtained from the producers in Vietnam and the PRC, the adjustments\nhad to be established on the basis of the best facts available. Thus, the\nadjustments for these allowances were based on a percentage calculated as the\nproportion of the total transport, insurance and packing costs over the value\nof the sales transactions to the Union with CIF delivery terms provided by the\ncooperating Chinese exporting producers in the original investigation. \n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation, dumping was calculated by comparing\nthe weighted average normal value as established in the original Regulation and\nthe corresponding weighted average export prices for Vietnamese declared\nexports during this investigation\u2019s RP according to the Comext database,\nexpressed as a percentage of the CIF price at the Union frontier duty unpaid.\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the\nweighted average normal value and the weighted average export price, after the\nadjustments explained in recital (59) above, showed the existence of\nsignificant dumping. \n2.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments to the disclosure\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure, a\ngroup of interested parties composed of Vietnamese producers and EU importers,\neven though admitting not being directly concerned by the measures, commented\non the findings of the investigation. They argued again that any misleading\ninformation had not been provided intentionally, that the Commission had not\nfound any positive evidence of circumvention and that there was no remedial\neffect to be achieved by retroactive imposition of the measures, also\ndemonstrated by the non-prolongation of the original measures against China.\nAccording to these parties, the non-prolongation of the original measures\nagainst China was based on findings concerning the same time-period as the\nconclusion that the circumvention practices undermine the remedial effects of\nthe original measures. Finally they also questioned the intended effect and\nwhat the Union interest would be in extending the measures which were\nterminated in December 2012. In their view the extension of the measures would\nbring no benefit to the EU industry and would only penalise EU importers.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon presentation and admittance\nof a valid request for an anti-circumvention investigation, the Commission has\na legal obligation to fully investigate the matter and take appropriate action\nif justified. In the case at hand it was found that all the conditions of Article\n13 of the basic Regulation to determine that circumvention is taking place were\nfulfilled. Consequently, the measures had to be extended in the appropriate\nmanner to imports from Vietnam.\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When assessing whether\ncircumvention practices undermine the remedial effects of the original measures,\nthe Commission must base its analysis on the developments following the\nimposition of these measures and takes into consideration the findings from the\noriginal investigation on the basis of which the remedial effects have been\ndetermined. By contrast, the assessment of the necessity to initiate an expiry\nreview is determined on the basis of the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence of dumping and injury in the future on the basis of findings relating\nto a different period of time. Therefore, contrary to what the interested\nparties have alleged, the two findings do not concern the same time period. As\nregards the claim that only EU importers would be affected and that there would\nbe no benefit to the Union industry, the Commission has to point out that the\nUnion interest for the imposition of the measures was confirmed in the original\ninvestigation. In accordance with article 13 of the basic Regulation, the\nextension of the remedial effects of the original measures against\ncircumvention is in this respect justified as long as the original measures are\nin force. The purpose of the extension of the measures is in any case not to\npenalise parties but to correct the distortive effect of the circumvented\ndumped imports from Vietnam had on the Union market by introducing a level\nplaying field in terms of prices or quantities of such imports. In any event,\nit must be noted that the alleged sole influence of the measures on importers\nis not supported by any evidence or analysis. \n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One other interested party,\nan importer, submitted comments on the investigation arguing that it had not\nbeen informed about the initiation of the circumvention investigation. It has\nto be noted in this respect that this party was not known to the Commission\nprior to the initiation of the investigation and that the initiation notice was\nmade public by means of publication in the official journal.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One further importer\nreacted by announcing that it would within six months submit evidence\ndemonstrating that their imports of lighters did not involve circumvention. The\nCommission notes that all interested parties have been invited in the\ninitiation notice to submit evidence during the investigation (see in particular recitals 10, 19 and 20 and Article 3(2)\nof the Commission Regulation (EU) No 548/2012[10]).\nThe Commission must conclude the investigation within the legal deadline of 9 months and therefore cannot await additional\nsubmissions at this stage.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MEASURES\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the above, it was concluded\nthat the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of gas-fuelled,\nnon-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the PRC was circumvented by\nassembly operations via Vietnam within the meaning of Article 13(1) and 13(2) of\nthe basic Regulation.\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nfirst sentence of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, the original measures\non imports of the product concerned, should be extended to imports of the\nproduct under investigation, i.e. the same product but consigned from Vietnam,\nwhether declared as originating in Vietnam or not.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the\nnon-cooperation in this investigation, the measures to be extended should be\nthe measures established in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1458/2007, i.e.\na definitive anti-dumping duty of EUR 0,065 per lighter.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, which provides that any extended\nmeasure should apply to imports which entered the Union under registration\nimposed by the initiating Regulation, duties should be collected on those\nregistered imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters consigned\nfrom Vietnam. Given that the original measures have expired on 13 December 2012\nand the registration has been terminated on the same day, the collection of\nduties would only apply up to that date.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The seven companies in\nVietnam submitting questionnaire replies requested an exemption from the\npossible extended measures in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic\nRegulation. \n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All\nof these seven companies were found to have provided false or misleading\ninformation. In accordance with Article 18(4) of the basic Regulation, these\ncompanies were informed of the intention to disregard the information submitted\nby them and were granted a time-limit to provide further explanations. \n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further explanations by\nthese companies were not such so as to lead to a change in the conclusion.\nTherefore in accordance with Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation, findings\nwith regard to these companies were based on facts available. \n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\nnature of the false and/or misleading information as set out above, the\nexemptions as requested by these seven companies could, in accordance with\nArticle 13(4) of the basic Regulation, not be granted. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DISCLOSURE\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All interested parties were\ninformed of the essential facts and considerations leading to the above\nconclusions and were invited to comment. The oral and written comments\nsubmitted by the parties were considered. None of the arguments presented gave\nrise to a modification of the findings. \nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1. The definitive anti-dumping duty imposed\nby Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1458/2007 on imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable\npocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China is hereby\nextended to imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters\nconsigned from Vietnam, whether declared as originating in Vietnam or not,\ncurrently falling under CN code ex 9613 10 00.\n2.
