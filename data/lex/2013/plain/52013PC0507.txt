An\nanchovy TAC needs to be set around July each year.\nBy way of Council Regulation (EC) No\n694/2012, the Council established the TAC for the fishery exploiting this stock\napplicable from 1 July 2012 until 30 June 2013. The TAC and its allocation to\nthe Member States concerned must now be fixed for the next 12 months.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nHaving regard to the objectives of the\nCommon Fisheries Policy, laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of\n20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries\nresources under the Common Fisheries Policy, fishing opportunities should be\nestablished on the basis of the available scientific advice and by taking into\naccount the biological and socio-economic aspects whilst ensuring fair\ntreatment between fishing sectors. \nFor the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay, the advice from the Scientific, Technical and\nEconomic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) of July 2013\nis based on a fishing season running from 1 July 2013 until 30 June 2014.\nThe advice from the STECF estimates the\nspawning stock biomass to be approximately 56 055 tonnes. Having regard to the\nCommission proposal of 29 July 2009 for a Regulation establishing a long-term\nplan for the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay and the fisheries exploiting\nthat stock[1]\nand considering that the impact assessment underlying that proposal provides\nfor the most recent assessment of impact of decisions on the fishing\nopportunities for this stock, Regulation EU (No) 694/2012 fixed the TAC for\nthis stock in accordance with the harvest rule set out in the proposal. \nIn 2013 the methodology and biological\nparameters used by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea\n(ICES) to assess the status of the anchovy stock was reviewed. In light of this\nnew scientific information it may be appropriate in the near future not only to\nrevise the current harvest control rule laid down in the Commission proposal of\n29 July 2009 but also to reconsider other fishing management measures. In this\ncase amendments may be proposed accordingly. Until this revision is carried out\nit is appropriate to continue applying the current harvest control rule as it\nis confirmed that it remains precautionary but also because it guarantees catch\npredictability and stability for the fishing sector. The relevant Regional\nAdvisory Council (the South Western Waters RAC) has been following these\nscientific developments and informal consultations among their members indicate\nthat this approach is agreeable to them. The RAC will be associated to\nforthcoming work to reassess the harvest control rule and any other management\nrules, such as the regulatory season, which the Commission will undertake\nthrough its scientific advisory bodies. \nConsequently,\nthe TAC for the fishing season from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 should, in\naccordance with the harvest rule set out in the aforementioned proposal, be\nestablished at 17 100 tonnes.\nThe Council is requested to adopt this\nproposal as soon as possible in order to allow fishermen to plan their\nactivities for the new fishing season.\n2013/0236 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non establishing the fishing opportunities\nfor anchovy in the Bay of Biscay for the 2013/14 fishing season\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43 (3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is incumbent upon the\nCouncil to establish fishing opportunities by fishery or group of fisheries.\nThese fishing opportunities should be distributed among Member States in such a\nway as to ensure the relative stability of each Member State's fishing\nactivities for all stocks or groups of stocks and having due regard to the\nobjectives of the common fisheries policy established by Council Regulation\n(EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable\nexploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy[2].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of\nsuitable stock management and simplification, it is appropriate that the TAC\nand Member State quotas for the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay (ICES\nsubarea VIII) are set for an annual management season running from 1 July to 30\nJune of the following year, rather than for a calendar year management period.\nNevertheless, the fishery should remain subject to the general provisions of\nRegulation (EU) No 39/2013[3]\nconcerning the conditions for the use of quotas.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Bay of Biscay anchovy\nTAC for the 2013/14 fishing season should be established on the basis of\nscientific advice available, taking into account biological and socioeconomic\naspects and ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to provide for a\nmultiannual management of the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay, on 29 July\n2009, the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation establishing a\nlong-term plan for the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay and the fisheries\nexploiting that stock. Considering that the impact assessment on which the proposal\nis based provided for the most recent assessment of the impact of management\ndecisions for the stock, it is appropriate to fix a TAC for anchovy in the Bay of Biscay accordingly. The advice issued by the Scientific, Technical and Economic\nCommittee for Fisheries (STECF) in July 2013 estimated the spawning stock\nbiomass to be approximately 56 055 tonnes. Consequently, the TAC for the\nfishing season running from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 should be established\nat 17 100 tonnes.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional\nconditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas[4], it is necessary to establish\nto what extent the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay is subject to the\nmeasures laid down in that Regulation.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the start of\nthe 2013/14 fishing season and for the purpose of the annual reporting of\ncatches, this Regulation should enter into force immediately and apply from 1\nJuly 2013,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nFishing opportunities for anchovy in the\n Bay of Biscay\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The total allowable catch\n(TAC) and its allocation between Member States for the fishing season running\nfrom 1 July 2013 until 30 June 2014 for the stock of anchovy in ICES Subarea\nVIII, as defined in Regulation (EC) No 218/2009 of the European Parliament and\nof the Council[5],\nshall be as follows (in tonnes live weight):\n Species: || Anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus || ICES Zone: || VIII (ANE/08.) \n Spain || 15 390 ||   || Analytical TAC   \n France || 1 710 ||   \n EU || 17 100 ||   \n   ||   ||   \n TAC || 17 100 ||   \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The allocation of the\nfishing opportunities as set out in paragraph 1 and the use thereof shall be\nsubject to the conditions set out in Articles 8 and 10 of Regulation\n(EU) No 39/2013.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The stock referred to in\nparagraph 1 shall be considered subject to an analytical TAC for the purposes\nof Regulation (EC) No 847/96.
