This provided an opportunity to\ncarry out a major overhaul of the customs rules in order to make them simpler\nand better structured.\nThat Regulation entered into force on 24\nJune 2008, but becomes applicable, in accordance with its Article 188(2), only once\nits implementing provisions are applicable, and on 24 June 2013 at\nthe latest.\nOn 20 February 2012, the Commission\nsubmitted to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal[2] for a Regulation laying down\nthe Union Customs Code, as a recast of Regulation (EC) No 450/2008, to repeal\nand replace it before its scheduled date of application, due to the following\nneeds:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to postpone the date of\napplication of Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 so as to give administrations and\neconomic operators adequate time to undertake the necessary investments and\nensure a phased, binding but realistic implementation of electronic processes;\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to align Regulation (EC) No\n450/2008 on the requirements of the Lisbon Treaty, as regards the empowerment\nto be given to the Commission to adopt either delegated or implementing acts,\nin accordance with Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union;\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to adjust some provisions of Regulation\n(EC) No 450/2008 that have proved difficult to implement.\nHowever, while the institutions are close\nto a political agreement on the final text of the Regulation, the ordinary\nlegislative procedure for that recast could not be completed in time for adoption\nand entry into force of the recast Regulation before the deadline of 24 June\n2013.\nIn the absence of such adoption, the main\nadverse consequences would be the following:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 450/2008\nwould become applicable on 24 June 2013 without any Commission acts in force to\nsupport that application and without the necessary IT developments to ensure\ncompliance with the principle of using electronic data-processing techniques as\nlaid down in its Article 5(1);\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 (the\nCommunity Customs Code, currently in force) would, inter alia, be repealed and that\nwould generate legal uncertainty about the customs legislation actually\napplicable and be an obstacle to maintaining a comprehensive and consistent\nUnion legal framework for customs matters pending the adoption of the proposed\nRegulation.\nFor these reasons and as a contingency plan\nto prevent serious difficulties with the Union customs legal framework, the\nCommission considers that the ultimate date of application of Regulation (EC)\nNo 450/2008, as laid down in the second subparagraph of its Article 188(2), may\nhave to be postponed to provide the legislature with adequate time to complete\nthe process of adoption of the Union Customs Code. The new date of application\nconsidered appropriate for that purpose would be 1.11.2013.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe proposal does not affect the substance\nof Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 but only aims at postponing its date of\napplication, to take into account the time strictly needed for completion by the\nEuropean Parliament and the Council of the legislative procedure to repeal and\nreplace it by a new Regulation laying down the Union Customs Code.\nTherefore, it warrants neither the involvement\nof parties other than the European Parliament and the Council nor an impact\nassessment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposal consists in amending the\nsecond subparagraph of Article 188(2) of Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 to replace\nthe date of 24 June 2013 by the date of 1.11.2013.\nIts legal bases shall be the same ones as\ngovern the amended Regulation, taking due account of the Treaty of Lisbon:\nArticles 33, 114 and 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\n(TFEU). Due to the fact that it governs the adoption of non-legislative acts,\nArticle 31 TFEU can no longer serve as a legal basis for a legislative act like\nthe proposed Regulation. Such reference is in any case not required,\nconsidering the scope and content of that Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nNone\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nNone\n2013/0104 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 450/2008\nlaying down the Community Customs Code (Modernised Customs Code) as regards the\ndate of its application\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 33, 114 and 207 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[3],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n450/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n23 April 2008 laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernised\nCustoms Code)[4]\nentered into force on 24 June 2008, but is to be applicable, in accordance with\nits Article 188(2), only once its implementing provisions are applicable, and\non 24 June 2013 at the latest. Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 is\nintended to replace Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992\nestablishing the Community Customs Code[5].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 20 February 2012, the\nCommission submitted to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal[6] for a Regulation laying down the Union\nCustoms Code, in the form of a recast of Regulation (EC) No 450/2008, to\nreplace it before its ultimate date of application. However, the ordinary\nlegislative procedure cannot be completed in time for adoption of that proposed\nRegulation and consequently its entry into force before the ultimate deadline\nof 24 June 2013. As a consequence, in the absence of any corrective\nlegislative action, Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 would apply on that date and Regulation\n(EEC) No 2913/92 would be repealed. That would generate legal uncertainty about\nthe customs legislation actually applicable and be an obstacle to maintaining a\ncomprehensive and consistent Union legal framework for customs matters pending\nthe adoption of the proposed Regulation.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To prevent such serious difficulties\nwith the customs legislation of the Union and provide the legislature with adequate\ntime to complete the process of adoption of the Union Customs Code, the\nultimate date of application of Regulation (EC) No 450/2008, as laid down in\nthe second subparagraph of its Article 188(2), should be postponed.
