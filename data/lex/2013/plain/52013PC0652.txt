The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. \n 3)      Legal elements of the proposal \n   || Summary of the proposed action On 14 May 2013, the Commission initiated a partial interim review concerning the anti-dumping duties on imports of certain iron or steel fasteners originating in the People's Republic of China as extended to imports consigned from Malaysia, whether declared as originating in Malaysia or not. The review was initiated following a substantiated request lodged by Malaysian Precision Manufacturing SDN BHD ('the applicant'). The applicant withdrew its request for review before replying to the questionnaire. It was established that the termination of the review proceeding would not be against the interest of the Union. Therefore, it is suggested that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Regulation in order to terminate the interim review investigation, which should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. \n   || Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. \n   || Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n   || Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n   || The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n   || Indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n   || Choice of instruments \n   || Proposed instrument: Regulation. \n   || Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: Other means would not be adequate because the basic Regulation does not foresee alternative options. \n 4)      Budgetary implication \n   || The proposal has no implication for the Union budget. \n   ||   \n2013/0318\r\n(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nterminating the partial interim review\r\nconcerning the anti-dumping measures on imports of certain iron or steel\r\nfasteners originating in the People's Republic of China, as extended to imports\r\nconsigned from Malaysia, whether declared as originating in Malaysia or not \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\r\ncountries not members of the European Community[1]\r\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019) and in particular Articles 11(3) and 13(4) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\r\nthe European Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) after consulting the Advisory\r\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\n1.

In addition, the applicant claimed that although it is related to\r\ncertain producers of certain iron or steel fasteners located in the People's\r\nRepublic of China, its relationships with its related companies in the People's\r\nRepublic of China have been established before the imposition of the measures in\r\nforce and that these relationships have not been used to circumvent the\r\nmeasures in force as extended.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation\r\nof a partial interim review\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined, after\r\nconsulting the Advisory Committee, that the request contained sufficent prima\r\nfacie evidence to justify the initiation of a partial interim review, on 14\r\nMay 2013 the Commission initiated a partial interim review pursuant to Articles\r\n11(3) and 13(4) of the basic Regulation limited to the examination of the\r\npossibility of granting an exemption from the measures in force as extended as\r\nfar as the applicant is concerned, by a notice published in the Official\r\nJournal of the European Union[5] ('the\r\nNotice of initiation'), \n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially informed\r\nthe applicant, the representatives of Malaysia and the People's Republic of China and the association of Union producers about the initiation of the partial interim review. Interested parties\r\nwere given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to a request\r\na hearing within the time limit set in the Notice of initiation. Only the\r\napplicant came forward. No hearing has been requested.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to obtain\r\ninformation deemed necessary for its investigation, the Commission sent a\r\nquestionnaire to the applicant, who did not provide any reply within the\r\ndeadline set for that purpose.\n2. WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST AND\r\nTERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\n18 June 2013 the applicant withdrew its request for the partial interim review\r\nof the measures in force as extended. The applicant claimed that it was not\r\nable to provide the Commission with the data requested in the questionnaire as\r\nregards its related companies. Furthermore, the applicant complained that the\r\ndeadline for submitting questionnaire reply was too short. However, no substantiated\r\nrequest for an extension of time limit for submitting the reply to the\r\nquestionnaire has been made.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view\r\nof the withdrawal, it was considered whether it would be warranted to continue\r\nthe review investigation ex officio. The Commission found no compelling\r\nreasons that termination would not be in the Union interest. On this basis, the\r\nreview investigation should be terminated. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested\r\nparties were informed of the intention to terminate the review investigation\r\nand were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis therefore concluded that the partial interim review concerning the\r\nanti-dumping measures applicable to imports of certain iron or steel fasteners\r\noriginating in the People's Republic of China, as extended to imports of\r\ncertain iron or steel fasteners consigned from Malaysia, whether declared as\r\noriginating in Malaysia or not should be terminated without amending the\r\nanti-dumping measures in force as extended,\nHAS\r\nADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThe partial interim review of the\r\nanti-dumping measures, applicable to imports of certain iron or steel fasteners\r\noriginating in the People's Republic of China, as extended to imports of\r\ncertain iron or steel fasteners consigned from Malaysia, whether declared as\r\noriginating in Malaysia or not, initiated pursuant to Articles 11(3) and 13(4)\r\nof Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 is hereby terminated without amending the\r\nanti-dumping measure in force as extended. \nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its\r\nentirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 29, 31.1.2009, p. 1.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 275, 10.10.2012, p. 1.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 194, 26.7.2011, p. 6.\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C 134, 14.5.2013, p. 34.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
