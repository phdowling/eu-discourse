The Commission is further\r\nempowered to adopt detailed requirements for application of Article 5. By means\r\nof delegated acts the Commission may also amend the list of partner countries\r\nand their designated licensing authorities as set out in Annex I; the list of\r\ntimber products set out in Annex II to which the FLEGT licensing scheme applies\r\nirrespective of the partner country as well as the list of timber products set\r\nout in Annex III to which the FLEGT licensing scheme applies only in relation\r\nof the corresponding partner country. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThere was no need for consultation of\r\ninterested parties or for impact assessment. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7      Summary of the proposed action\nIdentify the delegated powers of the\r\nCommission in Council Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 and establish the\r\ncorresponding procedure for adoption of these acts. \n\u00b7      Legal basis\nArticle 207(2) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union. \n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under exclusive\r\ncompetence of the European Union.\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe proposal is amending measures which\r\nalready exist in Council Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005, therefore no\r\nconcern on the principle of proportionality arises. \n\u00b7      Choice of instrument\nProposed instrument: Regulation of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council. \nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reason: a Regulation must be amended by a Regulation. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThis measure does not involve any\r\nadditional Union expenditure. \n2013/0010 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n2173/2005 on the establishment of a FLEGT licensing scheme for imports of\r\ntimber into the European Community\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005[3] confers powers upon the\r\nCommission in order to implement some of the provisions of that Regulation.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\r\nentry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU),\r\nthe powers conferred upon the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005\r\nneed to be aligned to Article 290 and Article 291 TFEU.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to apply some of\r\nthe provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005, the power to adopt acts in\r\naccordance with Article 290 TFEU (Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the revision of the\r\nexemption of timber products of species listed in Annexes A, B and C to Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 338/97 of 9 December 1996 on the protection of species of\r\nwild fauna and flora[4];\r\nthe adoption of detailed rules for application of Article 5 of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 2173/2005, and the amendments to Annexes I, II and III to that Regulation.\r\nIt is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate\r\nconsultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The\r\nCommission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a\r\nsimultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the\r\nEuropean Parliament and to the Council.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be\r\nconferred on the Commission to assess and approve existing schemes that\r\nguarantee the legality and reliable tracking of timber products exported from\r\npartner countries with a view to becoming the basis of a FLEGT licence.
