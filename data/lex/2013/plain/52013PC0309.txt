This same\nArticle also provides for the possibility of further extensions of this period\nupon a duly motivated request. In 2005, following a specific request from LDCs,\nthis exemption was duly extended to 1 July 2013.\nIn view of the approaching deadline, Haiti, on behalf of the LDC group, formally submitted a request on 5 November 2012 for an\nextension of the transitional period (see WTO Document IP/C/W/583). Rather than\nasking for a specific extension calculated in years, this time the LDC group\nhas asked for an exemption \u201d\u2026until they cease to be a least developed\ncountry Member.\"[1]\n\nA summary of the background to the LDC\nGroup's request is set out below.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SUMMARY\nThe TRIPS Agreement\u2019s preamble acknowledges\nLDCs' particular need for maximum flexibility in implementing laws and\nregulations domestically, the objective being to enable them to create a sound\nand viable technological base. It also allowed LDCs ten years from 1995 to\napply the bulk of TRIPS obligations. The transition period was extendable in\nresponse to a specific request and in 2005 LDCs asked for an extension by 15\nyears and ultimately obtained an extension by 7.5 years, until 1 July 2013.\nMeanwhile, the 2001 Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health had already\nextended the period for LDCs to comply with provisions on patent and data\nprotection for pharmaceuticals to 2016.\nIn the discussions leading up to the\ndecision in 2005 to extend the deadline for compliance with TRIPS obligations,\none of the questions raised was whether the extension should be given on a country\nby country basis or as a group. The final agreement gave the extension to all LDCs\nas a group. When the TRIPS Council agreed to the 2005 extension, it also set up\na process to help LDCs implement TRIPS within their national intellectual\nproperty regimes. The TRIPS Council called on LDCs to identify their priority\nneeds for technical and financial cooperation and asked developed countries to\nhelp address those identified needs. It also called for enhanced cooperation\nwith the World Intellectual Property Organisation and other relevant\ninternational organisations. The emphasis was on the individual priorities of each\nLDC and on ensuring these needs are effectively met.\nRecognising the utility of intellectual\nproperty for development, ministers at the Regional Preparatory Meeting for\nAfrica in Dar es Salaam in March 2013 ahead of the Annual\nMinisterial Review of the UN Economic and Social Council, for example declared\nthat \"Policymakers in Africa should redouble efforts to develop their\nlegal and policy frameworks, including their intellectual property legislation\nand policy, so as to release the region\u2019s untapped potential.\" Further postponements in implementing TRIPS provisions could therefore\nhinder growth possibilities for LDCs. An indefinite timeline could also remove\nsome incitation to work towards implementation at all. However, it remains the\ncase that some LDCs have progressed further than others in their\nimplementation. Bearing this in mind, a limited extension is acceptable. A\nlimited extension should be accompanied by further targeted technical\nassistance, of which the EU has been a significant provider. Moreover, a\ncomprehensive analysis of the state of implementation on the ground in each LDC\nwould be useful in order to draw a clearer picture of the situation and thus\nallow for prioritised and effective assistance.\nTo avoid the debate in the WTO from digressing\nfrom the issue at hand, a new decision to extend the exemption should follow\nthe general structure of the one taken in 2005. Notably, LDCs committed to not\nreduce the level of intellectual property protection that already existed in\ntheir country during the transition period. Furthermore, the current decision\nto be taken on the general exemption for LDCs to implement TRIPS should be kept\nseparate from the decision of the TRIPS Council of 27 June 2002 on the \"Extension\nof the Transition Period \u2026 for LDC Members for Certain Obligations with respect\nto Pharmaceutical Products\".\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RECOMMENDATION\nAs a response to the LDC group\u2019s request,\nthe Commission recommends the Council of the European Union to establish the\nfollowing Union position: LDC Members should not be required to apply the\nprovisions of the TRIPS Agreement, other than Articles 3, 4 and 5, for a period\nno longer than the duration of the extension granted previously in 2005, or\nuntil such a date on which they cease to be a least-developed country Member,\nwhichever date is earlier. During this time, proper consideration could be\ngiven to the varying states of TRIPS implementation across LDCs, and how\ntechnical assistance can be further used to help address these shortcomings,\nwith primary focus on those areas of most immediate utility. During this\nextension period, LDCs should not decrease their already existing level of IP\nprotection below the standards set by TRIPS.\n2013/0161 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the European Union position\nwithin the TRIPS Council of the World Trade Organisation on the request for an\nextension of the transition period under TRIPS Article 66.1 for least-developed\ncountries\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(4) and Article\n218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n5 November 2012 Haiti, on behalf of the LDC Group, formally requested an extension to the transition period for the\nimplementation of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Agreement\non Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), pursuant to Article 66.1 of that Agreement.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The existing transition\nperiod, as agreed in the Decision of the Council for TRIPS of 29 November 2005\n(IP/C/40), was due to expire on\n1 July, 2013.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 66.1 of the TRIPS\nAgreement provides that the Council for TRIPS \"shall,\nupon duly motivated request by a least developed country Member, accord extensions\nof this period\".\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The leveraging and\nprotection of intellectual property is a key factor in promoting socio-economic\ngrowth, as for example recognised by ministers at the Regional Preparatory\nMeeting for Africa in Dar es Salaam in March 2013 ahead of the Annual\nMinisterial Review of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, which\ncalled for a redoubling of effort to develop legal and policy framework for\ne.g. intellectual property.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Least developed country\nmembers (LDCs) have progressed at different paces and depth in their\nimplementation of the WTO TRIPS Agreement.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Valuable steps have\nalready been taken in the field of intellectual property by a number of LDCs,\nbut it remains the case that LDCs have special needs and requirements and continue\nto face economic, financial and administrative constraints, therefore they have\na need for flexibility and further time to implement the provisions of TRIPS.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, it is\nnecessary to extend the transition period for implementation of the TRIPS\nAgreement for least-developed country members of the WTO,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position to be taken\nby the European Union within the TRIPS Council of the World\nTrade Organization on the request for an extension of\nthe transition period under TRIPS Article 66.1 for least-developed country\nMembers (LDCs) is that LDCs should not be required to apply the provisions of\nthe TRIPS Agreement, other than Articles 3, 4 and 5, for a period no longer\nthan the duration of the extension granted previously in 2005, or until such a\ndate on which they cease to be a least-developed country Member, whichever date\nis earlier. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During this extension\nperiod, LDCs should not decrease their already existing level of IP protection\nbelow the standards set by TRIPS.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During this period, proper\nconsideration should be given to the varying states of TRIPS implementation\nacross LDCs, and how technical assistance and capacity building programmes can\nbe further used to help address these shortcomings, with primary focus on those\nareas of most immediate utility. \nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on\nthe day of its adoption. \nDone at Brussels,
