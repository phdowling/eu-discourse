Neither the original convention nor the 1993 protocol have entered into\nforce, as the necessary minimum requirements in terms of ratification were\nnever reached. \nA Diplomatic Conference was convened in Cape Town, South Africa by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) between 9-11\nOctober 2012 to consider and adopt an Agreement on the implementation of the\nTorremolinos Protocol in a major effort on the part of the IMO to facilitate\nthe entry into force of the 1993 Protocol. \nThe Diplomatic Conference has resulted in\nthe adoption of an Agreement amending the Torremolinos Protocol of 1993, entitled\nthe \"Cape Town Agreement of 2012 on the Implementation of the Provisions\nof the 1993 Protocol relating to the Torremolinos International Convention for\nthe Safety of Fishing Vessels, 1977\u201d (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe\nAgreement\u201d).\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EU competence and\nramifications\nIn accordance with the rules on external\ncompetence as laid down in Article 3 (2) Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union (TFEU), the amendments to the 1993 Torremolinos Protocol come\nunder exclusive Union competence, as the Protocol has been transposed into EU\nlegislation by Council Directive 97/70/EC of 11 December 1997 setting up a\nharmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over[1].\nThe European Union cannot become a party to\nthe draft Agreement, as the current draft, as approved by the International\nMaritime Organisation (IMO) Maritime Safety Committee, does not include a REIO\n(Regional Economic Integration Organisation) clause. However as the Agreement\nconcerns a matter of exclusive EU competence, Member States are not in a\nposition to decide autonomously on the signature and ratification of the\nAgreement. They can only do it, in the interest of the Union, after\nauthorization by the Council and consent of the European Parliament upon a\nproposal by the Commission. \n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Details of the Agreement \nThe Agreement foresees the entry into force\nof the Torremolinos Protocol 12 months after the date on which not less than 22\nStates the aggregate number of whose fishing vessels of 24 m in length and over\noperating on the high seas is not less than 3,600 have expressed their\nconsent to be bound by it. This is a considerable reduction in the fishing\nvessel threshold relative to the 1993 Protocol, which now has a realistic\nprospect of being met.\nThe Agreement will be open for signature at\nIMO Headquarters from 11 February 2013 to 10 February 2014 and thereafter\nremain open for accession. It is expected that, as has been supported by the EU\nMember States during the negotiations leading to the agreement, the use of the\ndatabases held by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) will provide an\nobjective basis for the estimation of the fleets flying the flag of the\nratifying parties, and hence facilitate the early entry into force of the\nAgreement.\nScope: the\nAgreement's provisions apply to new vessels, unless specifically provided for\notherwise. Certain flexibilities have been added through the Agreement to\nfacilitate wide acceptance. Administrations may, in accordance with a plan,\nprogressively implement the provisions of chapter IX (radiocommunications) over\na period of no more than 10 years; and the provisions of chapters VII\n(life-saving appliances and arrangements), VIII (emergency procedures, musters\nand drills) and X (shipborne navigational equipment and arrangements) over a\nperiod of no more than five years.\nExemptions:\nthe Agreement allows an Administration to exempt any vessel entitled to fly its\nflag from any of the regulatory requirements, if it considers such application\nto be unreasonable and impracticable in view of the type of vessel, the weather\nconditions and the absence of general navigational hazards, under the following\nconditions:\n(a) the vessel complies with safety\nrequirements which, in the opinion of that Administration, are adequate for the\nservice for which it is intended and are such as to ensure the overall safety\nof the vessel and persons on board;\n(b) the vessel is operating solely in:\n(i) a common fishing zone established in\nadjoining marine areas under the jurisdiction of neighbouring States which have\nestablished that zone, in respect of vessels entitled to fly their flags, only\nto the extent and under the conditions that those States agree, in accordance\nwith international law, to establish in this regard; or\n(ii) the exclusive economic zone of the State\nof the flag it is entitled to fly, or, if that State has not established such a\nzone, in an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea of that State\ndetermined by that State in accordance with international law and extending not\nmore than 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of its\nterritorial sea is measured; or\n(iii) the exclusive economic zone, a marine\narea under the jurisdiction of another State, or a common fishing zone, in\naccordance with an agreement between the States concerned in accordance with\ninternational law, only to the extent and under the conditions that those\nStates agree to establish in this regard; and\n(c) the Administration notifies the IMO\nSecretary-General of the terms and conditions on which the exemption is granted\nunder this paragraph.\nSurveys and Certificates: the International Fishing Vessel Safety Certificate is amended to\nstate it is issued under the provisions of the Cape Town Agreement of 2012 on\nthe Implementation of the Provisions of the Torremolinos Protocol of 1993\nrelating to the Torremolinos International Convention for the Safety of Fishing\nVessels, 1977. \nThe Survey regime is amended to\nreflect the timeframe used for cargo and passenger vessels, namely, an annual\nsurvey, a compulsory intermediate survey between years two and three and a\nrenewal survey after no more than five years. Grace periods following the\nsurvey deadline are also harmonised. Additionally within the Agreement there is\na provision for an Administration to exempt a ship from the annual survey, if its\napplication is deemed to be unreasonable or impracticable. \nOverall the new survey regime is tighter:\nthe annual and periodic surveys are more comprehensive; issues formerly to be\nchecked within the discretionary intermediate surveys are included in the\nmandatory periodic survey; additional surveys on repairs are no longer\ndiscretionary. The new maximum interval of 5, not 4 years for a renewal survey reflects\nthe fact that a 5-year gap was already an option under the current regime. The\ngrace periods following expiry of a certificate now also reflect the harmonised\nperiods for certificates issued to other vessels under SOLAS, with the main\ngrace period being reduced from 5 to 3 months. \nNeither the original Torremolinos\nConvention, the 1993 Protocol nor the 2012 Agreement exclude the formulation of\nreservations or declarations by the Parties. \n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Implications for Directive\n97/70/EC\nArticle 3(5) of the Torremolinos Protocol\nremains unchanged and permits the development of regional arrangements thus ensuring\nthe continued implementation of a uniform and coherent safety regime for all\nfishing vessels operating in EU waters. In addition, the Agreement represents a\nminimum set of safety rules, thus allowing the EU to continue to apply the\noriginal rules under the Torremolinos Protocol. \nTwo issues may require action to safeguard\ncertain current EU norms: firstly, the exclusion of the wider general exemptions\nand the annual survey exemption introduced by the Agreement; and secondly, updating\nthe referencing within the Directive and its Annexes. Articles 8 and 9 of\nDirective 97/70/EC in conjunction with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) 2099/2002[2] provide that both issues can be\nresolved by amending the Directive in accordance with a regulatory committee\nprocedure with scrutiny. \nDirective 97/70/EC applies the provisions\nof the Torremolinos Protocol not only to EU Member State flagged fishing\nvessels, but also to fishing vessels flying the flag of third states operating\nin the internal waters or territorial seas of a Member State or landing their\ncatch in a port of a Member State in accordance with the general rules of\ninternational law. The application of the Torremolinos Protocol provisions to\nall these groups of fishing vessels should continue. For that reason the\nCommission considers that EU Member States, when signing and agreeing to be\nbound by the Agreement, should issue a declaration to the effect that the\nTorremolinos Protocol provisions will continue to apply to these two groups of\nthird country vessels in accordance with Union law as currently in force.\nAs the requirements of the current\nDirective will essentially be maintained, the cost implications for EU fishing\nvessels are negligible. While surveys will be more comprehensive, they will be\ncarried out over a longer period of time. \n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\nThe adoption and entry into force of global\nsafety rules for fishing vessels is a matter of utmost importance in a sector\nplagued by a particularly high number of accidents resulting in over 24000\nfatalities every year[3].\n\nThanks to the flexibilities introduced by\nthe Agreement, the latter is expected to be instrumental in finally achieving\nthe objective of the entry into force of the 1993 Torremolinos Protocol. In\naddition, amendments to the Protocol to update its provisions can only be made\nonce it enters into force. As Directive 97/70/EC makes reference to and\nimplements the provisions of the 1993 Torremolinos Protocol, provisions that\nfor the most part have not changed substantially in 20 years, the entry into\nforce of the Agreement will then allow updating amendments for a number of requirements\nin the Protocol to be introduced within IMO, which can then be implemented\nthrough Directive 97/70/EC. \nThe Commission considers that the Agreement\nwill thus greatly facilitate the achievement of the objectives of the Treaties\nas enshrined in Directive 97/70/EC. As explained in paragraph 1.4.3 above, it is\nhowever necessary to ensure that the scope of the said Directive remains unaffected,\nby requiring the Member States to issue appropriate declarations when signing\nand agreeing to be bound by the Agreement. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nAccession to this Agreement will not result\nin a change to the technical requirements for fishing vessels under the current\nDirective.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nArticle 1\nThis article authorises Member States to be\nbound by the current Agreement on a subject of the exclusive competence of the Union due to the impossibility for the EU to become a party of such Agreement. The\nAgreement sets out different options for IMO member states to express their\nconsent to be bound and the Article reflects the different methods by which EU\nMember States may wish to do so. \nArticle 2\nThis article requires EU Member States to\nagree to be bound by the Agreement within a two year period from entry into\nforce of this Decision. Early adherence to the Agreement by all EU Member\nStates will allow the threshold concerning both the number of IMO member states\nand aggregate fleet required (22 member states and 3600 fishing vessels) to be\nmore quickly attained. Given that the Agreement will promote an improvement in\nfishing vessel safety worldwide, reducing disparities in safety levels and\nresulting potential competitive disadvantages for EU vessels, and facilitating\nfurther updates in technical requirements within the Agreement, its early entry\ninto force is highly desirable. \nArticle 3\nThis article sets a clear date for the\nentry into force of the Council Decision. \nArticle 4\nThe purpose of the Decision is to authorise\nthe Member States to be bound by the Agreement and so the Decision is addressed\nto them.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nNone\n2013/0020 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nauthorising Member States to sign, ratify\nor accede to the Cape Town Agreement of 2012 on the Implementation of the\nprovisions of the 1993 Protocol relating to the Torremolinos International\nConvention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels, 1977\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) thereof, in\nconjunction with Article 218(5), 218(6)(a)(v) and the first subparagraph of\nArticle 218(8) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\nEuropean Parliament[4],\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Action by the European\nUnion in the sector of maritime transport should aim to improve maritime safety;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Torremolinos Protocol\nrelating to the Torremolinos International Convention for the Safety of Fishing\nVessels 1977, hereinafter referred to as the 'Torremolinos Protocol' was\nadopted on 2 April 1993;\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 97/70/EC[5] setting up a harmonised safety\nregime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over has laid down safety\nstandards that are based upon the Torremolinos Protocol, taking as far as\nnecessary full account of regional and local circumstances; \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Torremolinos Protocol has\nnot entered into force, given that the necessary minimum requirements in terms\nof ratification have never been achieved;\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to establish by\ncommon accord the highest practicable standards for the safety of fishing\nvessels that can be implemented by all the states concerned, and under the\nauspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a draft Agreement,\nto be read in conjunction with the Torremolinos Protocol, was finalised at a\nDiplomatic Conference in Cape Town, South Africa held from 9 \u2013 11 October 2012;\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Agreement, adopted on\n11 October 2012, is entitled \"the Cape Town Agreement of 2012 on the\nImplementation of the provisions of the Torremolinos Protocol of 1993 relating\nto the Torremolinos International Convention for the Safety of Fishing vessels\n1977\" (hereinafter called \"the Agreement\"). The Agreement will\nbe open for signature at IMO Headquarters from 11 February 2013 to 10 February\n2014 and thereafter remain open for accession;\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of the\nAgreement fall under the exclusive competence of the Union concerning the\nsafety regime of fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over;\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union cannot\nbecome a party to the Agreement, as it does not include a REIO (Regional\nEconomic Integration Organisation) clause; \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is in the interests of\nmaritime safety and fair competition that the Agreement be now ratified or\nacceded to by the European Union Member States, to ensure the entry into force\nof the provisions of the Torremolinos Protocol. Furthermore, the entry into\nforce of the Agreement will allow the subsequent updating of a number of\nprovisions in the Protocol through submissions to IMO, which have, since the\nadoption of Directive 97/70/EC, become obsolete;\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n2(1) TFEU, the Council should therefore authorise Member States to sign and\nratify the Agreement or to accede to it in the interests of the Union. However, in order to safeguard the current safety levels provided through Council\nDirective 97/70/EC, the Member States should, when signing the Agreement and\ndepositing their instruments of ratification or accession, issue a declaration\nto the effect that the exemptions provided by the Agreement within its Regulations\n1(6) and 3(3) in relation to annual surveys and a common fishing zone or\nexclusive economic zone respectively shall be excluded from application, and\nthat third country fishing vessels of 24 meters in length and over operating in\ntheir territorial or internal waters or landing catch at their ports will be\nsubject to the safety standards laid down in the said directive.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nMember States are hereby authorised to sign,\nsign and ratify, or accede to, as appropriate, the Cape Town Agreement of 2012\non the Implementation of the provisions of the Torremolinos Protocol of 1993\nrelating to the Torremolinos International Convention for the Safety of Fishing\nVessels, 1977.\nArticle 2\nMember States shall take the necessary\nsteps to deposit their instruments of ratification of the Agreement or\naccession to it with the Secretary General of the International Maritime\nOrganization without delay, and in any case no later than two years from the\ndate of entry into force of this Decision.\nWhen Member States sign, ratify or accede\nto the Agreement, they shall also deposit the Declaration set out in the Annex\nto this Decision.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision will enter into force on the\nday following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union. \nArticle 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member\nStates.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\nANNEX \nDECLARATION\nTO BE DEPOSITED BY THE MEMBER STATES UPON SIGNATURE, RATIFICATION OR ACCESSION\nTO THE CAPE TOWN AGREEMENT OF 2012 ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF\nTHE TORREMOLINOS PROTOCOL OF 1993 RELATING TO THE TORREMOLINOS INTERNATIONAL\nCONVENTION FOR THE SAFETY OF FISHING VESSELS, 1997\nAs part of a regional arrangement,\nauthorised under Article 3(5) of the Torremolinos Protocol of 1993, [insert\nname of the Member State contracting party] is bound by relevant European Union\n(EU) legislation (Council Directive 97/70/EC of 11 December 1997) setting up a\nharmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over\nand consequently will apply the Torremolinos Protocol provisions to those third\ncountry flagged fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over that operate in\nits internal or territorial waters or which land catch in one of its ports, in\nthe terms laid down by the aforementioned EU legislation.\nUnder this regional arrangement, the exemptions\nprovided by the Cape Town Agreement within its Regulation 1(6) in relation to\nannual surveys and within its Regulation 3(3) concerning a common fishing zone\nor exclusive economic zone shall be excluded from application.\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 34, 9.2.1998, p. 1\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 324, 29.11.2002, p.1\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ILO (2001) Report on safety and health in the fishing\nindustry \n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 34, 9.2.1998, p.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
