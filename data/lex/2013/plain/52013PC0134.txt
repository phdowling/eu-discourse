The European Union and its Member States[2] are parties to the Convention[3] and the provisions of the\nConvention have been implemented in EU law by Regulation (EC) 850/2004 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic\npollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC[4]\n(the POPs Regulation).\nThe overall objective of the Stockholm\nConvention is to protect human health and the environment from POPs. Specific\nreference is made to the precautionary approach as set out in Principle 15 of\nthe 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. The principle is made\noperational in Article 8 of the Convention, which lays down the rules for\nincluding additional chemicals in the Annexes to the Convention.\nAt the sixth Conference of the Parties in\nMay 2013, a decision should be taken to add to Annex A of the Stockholm\nConvention, which lists substances to be eliminated, a new substance,\nHexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD)[5],\nnominated in 2008 by Norway. At the same meeting, a decision should be taken to\ndelete a number of specific exemptions and acceptable purposes for the\nproduction, placing on the market and use of Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)\nand its derivatives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 HBCDD\nand EU law\nHBCDD is used solely as an additive flame\nretardant in Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), Extruded Polystyrene (XPS), High\nImpact Polystyrene (HIPS) and in polymer dispersion for textiles.\nHBCDD is a persistent, bioaccumulative and\ntoxic (PBT) substance. As such, it has been identified as a Substance of Very\nHigh Concern (SVHC) under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration,\nEvaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)[6]. In 2011 HBCDD was included[7] in Annex XIV to REACH and\nthereby made subject to the authorisation procedure under that Regulation.\nTherefore, if a person wishes to place on the market and/or use HBCDD after 21\nAugust 2015 (the so-called sunset date), he must submit an application for\nauthorisation for the relevant use to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) by\n21 February 2014. After 21 August 2015, placing on the market and use of HBCDD\nwill be prohibited unless an authorisation is granted to a particular person\nfor a particular use.\nAfter 21 August 2015, EU manufacturers of\nEPS, XPS, HIPS and textiles, containing HBCDD will be able to manufacture these\nmaterials only if authorised to do so. Imported articles containing HBCDD are\noutside of the scope of authorisation under REACH.\nSubstances listed in Annexes A, B and/or C\nto the Stockholm Convention[8]\nwill need to be included in the POPs Regulation in order to ensure that the EU\nimplementation corresponds to the international commitments.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PFOS\nand EU law\nAt the fourth meeting of the Conference of\nthe Parties to the Convention on 4\u20138 May 2009, it was agreed to list, inter\nalia, PFOS and its derivatives under Annex B to the Convention, with a\nnumber of specific exemptions and acceptable purposes. The implementing EU\nlegislation is more restrictive than the Stockholm Convention as it does not\ninclude the exemptions and the acceptable purposes that were already banned in\nthe EU under REACH. This was done in order to comply with the over-arching\nprinciple of not lowering the level of environmental protection in the EU.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Procedure for Adding new POP substances and Amending the Annexes of\nthe Convention\nAccording to\nArticle 8 of the Convention, Parties may submit proposals to the Secretariat\nfor listing a chemical in Annexes A, B and/or C. The Persistent Organic\nPollutants Review Committee (POP RC) shall examine the proposal.\nIf this review concludes that the chemical\nis likely, as a result of its long-range environmental transport, to lead to\nsignificant adverse human health and/or environmental effects such that global\naction is warranted, the proposal shall proceed and a risk management\nevaluation that includes an analysis of possible control measures shall be\ndrawn up. On this basis, the POP RC recommends whether the chemical should be\nconsidered by the Conference of Parties (COP) for listing in Annexes A, B\nand/or C. The final decision is taken by the COP. \nFor the EU, amendments to the Annexes A, B\nand/or C enter into force one year from the date of the communication by the\ndepositary of their adoption by the COP.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPOP RC recommendations\nThe POP RC has decided at its eighth\nmeeting in October 2012 to recommend the listing of HBCDD in Annex A to the\nConvention with specific exemptions for production and use in EPS and XPS in\nbuildings. The POP RC recommendation is based on the existence of alternatives\nto HBCDD. However, their availability in sufficient quantities and potentially\nthe need to adapt the production system for EXP and EPS in buildings within a\nshort period of time is questionable, in particular for some developing\ncountries.\nThe POP RC also notes in the decision that\nthe end-of-life disposal of products and articles containing HBCDD will\nrepresent a long-term source of emissions into the environment, and that, if\nHBCDD is listed in Annex A to the Convention, waste management measures in\naccordance with Article 6 paragraph 1(d) of the Convention would ensure that\nproducts and articles containing HBCDD are disposed of in such a way that their\npersistent organic pollutant content is destroyed or otherwise disposed of in\nan environmentally sound manner.\nIn accordance with Article 8 paragraph 9 of\nthe Convention, the POP RC has decided to submit that recommendation to the COP\nfor its consideration at the meeting in May 2013.\nThe POP RC also adopted a number of\nrecommendations on alternatives to the use of PFOS in open applications. In its recommendations, POP RC considers that information on the\ncommercial availability and effectiveness of safer alternatives to PFOS for the\nfollowing applications has become available, and encourages parties to stop using\nPFOS for these applications: fire-fighting foams; insecticides for the control\nof red imported fire ants and termites; decorative metal plating; carpets; leather\nand apparel; textiles and upholstery. Furthermore, POP RC encourages parties to\nrestrict the use of PFOS in hard metal plating, to closed-loop systems only.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The POP RC recommendations and EU Law\nThe POP RC recommendation, if followed by\nthe COP in May 2013, will result in an international ban on manufacturing,\nplacing on the market and use of HBCDD, except for its use in EPS and XPS in\nbuilding-related applications. This specific exemption will apply for a period\nof five years, extendable, if necessary, by another five years. \nThe listing of HBCDD in Annex A to the\nConvention will require amendments to the POPs Regulation. According to Article\n14(1) of the Regulation, when substances are added to the Convention, changes\nto the Annexes of the Regulation can be made in accordance with the normal\ncommittee procedures established in Articles 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC[9], having regard to Articles 10\nand 11 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011[10].\nThe inclusion of HBCDD under the Convention should be timed so that the\nsubsequent amendment of the POPs Regulation could be applicable from the\nfinalisation of the authorisation procedure for HBCDD under REACH. This may\nrequire allowing the Parties to the Convention to postpone the transposition of\nthe relevant COP decision until February 2016.\nThe time limited exemption under the\nConvention has a similar objective to the authorisation procedure under REACH.\nBoth devices force operators to phase out problematic substances, whilst\nallowing for reasonable time to do so. In the case of HBCDD, the timing of both\ninstruments will coincide, thus they will have similar effects on the majority[11] of the EU market.\nManufacturers, traders and users of HBCDD in building-related applications of\nEPS and XPS, which are covered by the exemption, will be able to apply for and\nbenefit from authorisations under REACH. Manufacturers, traders and users of\nHBCDD in HIPS, textiles and non-building-related applications of EPS and XPS must\nswitch to alternatives. However, due to the availability of alternatives, the\nsmall size of the relevant markets and \u2013 in the case of textiles - based on the\ncurrent market trends where the use of HBCDD has significantly diminished over\nthe last years, it is unlikely that the relevant market operators would invest\nin applications for authorisations. Therefore, even without listing of HBCDD\nunder the Convention, it is expected that these uses will be phased out and\neffectively banned in the EU after 21 August 2015 under REACH.\nWhilst the effect on the EU market of both\nmeasures is largely similar, listing of HBCDD under the Convention and the\nimplementation in EU law will bring significant added value. HBCDD is a\npersistent organic pollutant capable of long-range environmental transport.\nTherefore, the REACH authorisation procedure may not be sufficient to protect\nEU citizens and the environment from adverse effects of HBCDD, as it will not\naffect manufacturing and use of HBCDD in third countries. Global action is\ntherefore necessary. Furthermore, listing of HBCDD under the Convention will\nlevel the playing field between its users in the EU and in third countries. Whilst\nthe former group is obliged under REACH to invest resources in switching to\nalternatives and/or preparing applications for authorisation, the latter group\nis currently not subjected to such pressures, as imported articles are not\nsubject to REACH authorisation. Listing HBCDD with the time-barred exemption\nunder the Convention will force third country operators to start investing in\nswitching to alternatives just like the REACH authorisation process forces EU\nusers to invest in the switch.\nOnce adopted by the COP, the POP RC\nrecommendation on HBCDD should be implemented in the EU Law in a manner which\nwould make REACH and the POPs Regulation complement rather than contradict one\nanother. This means that the exemption for building related uses, when implemented\nthrough the POPs Regulation, will be limited to those authorised under REACH.\nThis approach will be in line with the overarching principle of not lowering\nthe environmental protection in the EU. It will also protect the investment of\nthe market operators who were successful in obtaining authorisations under\nREACH. The exemption under the POPs Regulation will have to be time-barred.\nThis means that, unless extended, the exemption will expire 5 years after its\nentry into force (February 2021). However, if despite the information submitted\nby the industry, more time is needed in order to substitute HBCDD, the EU may\npropose to extend the validity of the exemption under the Convection by another\n5 years (February 2026).\nWith regards to PFOS and its derivatives, a\ndeletion of the specific exemptions listed in the decision of the POP RC will\nhave no impact on the EU law as the relevant exemptions were either not\nimplemented in the POPs Regulations or have already expired. The only exception\nto this is the exemption for the use of PFOS in hard metal plating in open\nsystems, currently exempted under the POPs Regulation for the use as wetting\nagents in controlled electroplating systems. This exemption under the POPs\nRegulation is however only allowed until 26 August 2015. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EU position\nIn view of the above, at the Sixth COP to\nthe Stockholm Convention, the European Union should support the adding of HBCDD\nto Annex A to the Convention (with the exemption for its production and use in\nEPS and XPS in buildings). Parties to the Convention should be allowed to\npostpone the transposition of listing of HBCDD until February 2016. Furthermore,\nthe European Union should support the deletion of the relevant specific\nexemptions and acceptable purposes for PFOS and its derivatives, except for the\nexemption for the use as wetting agents in controlled electroplating systems.\nThat exemption should be maintained until its expiry in 2015. The exemption\nshould not be extended beyond that date. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe relevant risks and socio economic\nconsiderations related to the use of HBCDD in the EU and in the world were\ninvestigated by ECHA in 2008 and POP RC between 2009 and 2012. Both\ninvestigations involved consultation with interested parties.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The consultation\nWhen HBCDD was\nrecommended for inclusion in Annex XIV to REACH, ECHA prepared a background\ndocument[12]\nsupporting the recommendation. The background document was based on a paper\nentitled Data on Manufacture, Import, Export, Uses and Releases of HBCDD as\nwell as Information on Potential Alternatives to its Use[13]. Both documents were subject\nto public consultation.\nThe information\npresented in those two documents on manufacture import and export, uses and\nreleases from uses is based on the Risk Assessment Report with additional data\nsupplied by the HBCD Industry User Group in October 2008. This additional data\ncomprises summary data for the total sales and consumption of HBCDD across the\nEU for each year from 2003 until 2007. The information on possible alternatives\nto HBCDD has been taken from a wide variety of sources including reviews\nundertaken by both industry and regulators that have aimed to identify\ncandidate substances/techniques.\nAt its seventh\nmeeting, the POP RC adopted the risk management evaluation (RME) for HBCDD[14]. The RME was consulted with\nthe stakeholders, including industry representatives, between 2010 \u2013 2012 POP\nRC invited the ad hoc working group on HBCDD that prepared the RME to\ncollect further information in respect of HBCDD. POP RC agreed to review the\nadditional information and to consider at its eighth meeting whether to specify\nthe annex to the Convention and possible exemptions to be considered by the COP\nin listing HBCDD. Twenty-six Parties and country observers submitted\ninformation[15].\nIn addition, seven non-governmental observers submitted information[16].\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Results of the consultation\nListing of\nHBCDD under the Convention in accordance with the POP RC recommendation and the\nsubsequent implementation in the EU through the POPs Regulation will ban the production,\nplacing on the market and use of HBCDD in, HIPS and textiles as well as\nnon-building-related applications of EPS and XPS.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 HIPS\nAccording to\nthe documents published by ECHA, HIPS with HBCDD is mainly used in video and\nstereo equipment, distribution boxes for electrical lines in the construction sector\nand refrigerator lining. Different sources estimate the HBCDD content of\nflame-retarded HIPS between 1-7% (w/w) and the EU Risk Assessment Report\nassumed as a realistic worst case, that HIPS contains 7% HBCDD. The use volume\nhas not changed in the last few years in Europe and is estimated at 210\ntonnes/year (1.81% of the total use of HBCDD in the EU).\nHBCDD is not\nwidely used in HIPS and it is reasonable to assume that alternative flame\nretardants are available for this application. The following chemicals can be\nused as alternatives to HBCDD in HIPS: Ethylenebis(tetrabromophthalimide)\n(EBTPI), (technically feasible, commercially available and used extensively);\nDecabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE) (technically feasible, commercially available\nand used extensively). DBDPE is commonly used in HIPS and textiles, with better\neffect than HBCDD and approximately equal price as HBCDD; Triphenyl phosphate\n(technically feasible, commercially available and used extensively); Bisphenol\nA bis (biphenyl phosphate) (BDP) (technically feasible, commercially available\nand used extensively); Diphenyl cresyl phosphate (technically feasible,\ncommercially available and used extensively).\nOther chemicals\nthat can be used as alternatives to HBCDD in HIPS include a variety of\nbrominated flame retardants used in conjunction with antimony trioxide (ATO).\nThese include: Tris(tribromoneopentyl)phosphate; Tetrabromobisphenol\nA-Bis(2,3-dibromopropyl ether) (TBBPA\u2011DBPE);\n2,4,6-tris(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)-1,3,5 triazine;\nEthane-1,2-bis(pentabromophenyl) and Ethylenebis(tetrabromophtalimide). \nAlternative\nmaterials to HIPS are also on the market. More specifically, in electrical\nproducts HIPS can be replaced by various alternative materials, including\nblends of polycarbonate / acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (PC/ABS), polystyrene\n/ polyphenylene ether (PS/PPE) and polyphenylene ether / high impact\npolystyrene (PPE/HIPS ) without flame retardants or with the use of\nnon-halogenated phosphorus flame retardants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Textiles\nAccording to\nthe documents published by ECHA, HBCDD is used in textile applications to\ncomply with British and German DIN flame retardant standards, mainly for upholstered\nfurniture and seating in transportation, draperies, bed mattress ticking,\ninterior and automobile textiles. A likely HBCDD concentration in the final\nproduct is estimated to be 10-15%. After a substantial reduction of this use\nduring the last few years it is estimated that only about 210 tonnes/year are\ncurrently used in textile coating (1.81% of the total use of HBCDD in the EU).\nThe relatively\nlow quantity of HBCDD used in textile coatings and the high reduction in its\nuse in the last few years was assumed to reflect the availability of equally\neffective alternatives. Flame retardant use in textiles can be avoided if the\nmaterial itself is non- flammable or has low flammability. Some natural\nmaterials such as wool may therefore be used as barrier materials in furniture.\nOther inherently flame retardant materials include rayon with a phosphorus\nadditive, polyester fibres, and aramids. Also several chemicals are available\nthat may be used as drop-in alternatives for HBCDD in textile applications. \nFor textile\nback coating, chemical alternatives to HBCDD include, Decabromodiphenylethane\n(DBDPE) (technically feasible, commercially available and used extensively);\nethylene bis(tetrabromophtalimide) (technically feasible, commercially\navailable and used extensively); chlorinated paraffins (technically feasible,\navailable and used extensively) and ammonium polyphosphates (technically\nfeasible, available and used extensively). It should nevertheless be noted\nthat, with the exception of ammonium polyphosphates, these are halogenated and\npersistent substances with the potential of being themselves classified as POPs\nat a later stage. Furthermore, short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) are\nalready restricted[17]\nunder the POPs Regulation.\nIn textiles\nfire safety may also be achieved by the use of intumescent systems.\nIntumescence is the formation of a foamed char, which acts as heat insulation.\nAn intumescent system is generally a combination of a source of carbon to build up char, an acid generating compound\nand a decomposing compound to generate blowing gases to produce foamed char.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non-building-related\napplications of EPS and XPS\nAccording to\nthe 2011 report entitled Assessment of the consumption of HBCDD in EPS and XPS\nin conjunction with national fire requirements[18],\nin the EU, 70% of EPS is used in building related applications, 25% in\npackaging (industrial and food) and 5% in other applications. Packaging\nmaterial is generally thought to be HBCDD free. The main non-building related\nuse of HBCDD containing EPS is the use in automobile cushions for children to\nmeet the needs of the FMVSS 302 standard. There do not appear to be any\nnon-building-related applications of HBCDD-containing XPS in the EU.\nDuring the two\nyear consultation period no request for a specific exemption for non-building\nrelated uses of EPS and XPS has been made by governments or industry. It is\ntherefore assumed that there are either alternative chemicals used in those\napplications or alternative materials altogether.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Building-related\napplications of EPS and XPS\nThe main use of\nHBCDD in the EU is in the production of EPS and XPS. HBCDD-containing EPS is\nmainly used in building-related applications. HBCDD-containing XPS appears to\nbe used only in building-related applications.\nAt present,\nsuitable flame retardant is available but in insufficient quantities to replace\nHBCDD in most building-related uses of XPS or EPS, as much higher levels of\nnon-halogen flame retardant (EPS and XPS contain 0.7 % and 2.5 % HBCDD\nrespectively) would be necessary. In March 2011, Great Lakes Solutions\nannounced it will scale up production of a high molecular weight brominated\nco-polymer of styrene and butadiene flame retardant (Polymeric FR) suitable for\nEPS and XPS. It is expected, however, to take several years for the industry to\nfully convert to this technology. According to the industry hazard assessment,\nit is persistent, but not bioaccumulative or toxic.\nAccording to\nthe information presented during the eighth meeting of POP RC, currently pilot\nscale quantities of Polymeric FR are being submitted to downstream users for\ntesting. Plant scale production trials have run successfully and Polymeric FR\nshould be commercially available in 2012 from Great Lakes Solutions-Chemtura\nCorporation. ICL-Industrial Products recently announced that they are aiming\nfor commercial production by 2014 (10 000 MT). Albemarle (US) will have the\nchemical commercially available in 2014. The sufficient capacity to replace\nHBCDD should therefore be reached within 3-5 years.\nConsidering the\nforegoing, the time-limited exemption for the use of HBCDD in building-related\napplications of EPS and XPS should be supported in order to allow the industry\nenough time to switch to the alternatives.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposal consists in a Council\nDecision, based on Articles 192(1) and 218(9) of the TFEU, establishing the\nposition to be adopted, on behalf of the EU, at COP6 of the Stockholm\nConvention on Persistent Organic Pollutants with regard to the proposal for an\namendment of Annexes A and B.\nArticle 218(9) TFEU is the appropriate\nlegal basis as the act that COP6 is called upon to adopt is a decision amending\nan annex to the Stockholm Convention which has legal effects.\n2013/0075 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf\nof the European Union, at the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm\nConvention on Persistent Organic Pollutants with regard to the proposal for an\namendment of Annexes A and B\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1), in\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Stockholm Convention\non Persistent Organic Pollutants (hereinafter referred to as 'the Convention')\nwas ratified by the European Union on 16 November 2004, based on the Council\nDecision 2006/507/EC of 14 October 2004 concerning the conclusion, on behalf of\nthe European Community, of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic\nPollutants[19].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union has\nimplemented the obligations from the Convention in European Union law by way of\nRegulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and the Council of 29\nApril 2004 on persistent organics pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC[20] (the POPs Regulation).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union places\nstrong emphasis on the need for the Convention to gradually expand its Annexes\nA, B and/or C with new substances which meet the criteria of being persistent\norganic pollutants (POPs), taking into account the precautionary principle,\nwith a view to meeting the objective of the Convention and the commitment of\nall governments made at the Johannesburg Summit in 2002 to minimise the adverse\neffects of chemicals by 2020.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 22 of\nthe Convention, the Conference of the Parties (COP) may adopt decisions\namending Annexes A, B and C to the Convention. Those decisions enter into force\none year from the date of communication by the depositary of an amendment, save\nfor those parties that have opted out.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following a nomination of\nHexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD)[21]\nreceived from Norway in 2008, the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review\nCommittee (POP RC) established under the Convention has concluded its work on\nHBCDD. POP RC has found that HBCDD meets the criteria of the Convention for a\nlisting in Annex A. The forthcoming Conference of the Parties to the Convention\nis expected to decide on the inclusion of HBCDD in Annex A of the Convention. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2011, HBCDD was\nincluded[22]\nin Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation,\nAuthorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)[23]. HBCDD is therefore subject to\nthe authorisation procedure under that Regulation. Placing on the market and\nuse of HBCDD will be prohibited unless an authorisation is granted to a\nparticular person for a particular use. Since HBCDD is capable of long-range\nenvironmental transport, a global phase-out of the use of this substance will\nbe more beneficial to the EU citizen than an EU-wide phase-out under REACH.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to align the\nlisting under the POPs Regulation with the relevant deadline in Annex XIV to\nREACH, the Parties to the Convention should be allowed to delay the\ntransposition of the COP decision listing HBCDD until February 2016.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 POP RC recommends the listing\nof HBCDD under the Convention with a specific time limited exemption for\nproduction and use of HBCDD in building-related applications of EPS and XPS.\nThose applications represent the vast majority of the use of HBCDD in the EU.\nThree to five years are needed in the EU in order to reach the sufficient\ncapacity to replace HBCDD in the EU. The EU should therefore support the\nproposed specific exemption during COP6.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 POP RC notes that if HBCDD\nis listed in Annex A, waste management measures in accordance with of Article 6\nparagraph 1(d) of the Convention would ensure that products and articles\ncontaining HBCDD are disposed of in such a way that their persistent organic\npollutant content is destroyed or otherwise disposed of in an environmentally\nsound manner.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wastes containing HBCDD,\nespecially EPS and XPS used in building-related applications, are currently\nrecycled in a number of countries which are Parties to the Convention. These\nParties may propose an exemption, allowing temporarily the recycling of HBCDD\ncontaining wastes in an analogous fashion to the clause which was included\nduring COP4 in Part IV to Annex A and allows the recycling of wastes containing\ntetrabromodiphenyl ether and pentabromodiphenyl ether under certain\nwell-defined conditions.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2010, Perfluorooctane\nsulfonic acid (PFOS) and its derivatives were listed[24] in Annex I to the POPs\nRegulation.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 POP RC encourages parties\nto stop using PFOS in fire-fighting foams; insecticides for the control of red\nimported fire ants and termites; decorative metal plating; carpets; leather and\napparel; textiles and upholstery. POP RC also encourage parties to restrict the\nuse of PFOS in hard metal plating, currently allowed as a specific exemption,\nto closed-loop systems only, currently allowed as an acceptable purpose under\nthe Convention.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PFOS and its derivatives\nwere listed in Annex I to the POPs Regulation only with a small number of\nexemptions provided for under the Convention. Considering POP RC decision, the\nrelevant specific exemptions and acceptable purposes for PFOS and its\nderivatives should be deleted except for the exemption for the use as wetting\nagents in controlled electroplating systems. That exemption should be\nmaintained until its expiry in 2015. The exemption should not be extended\nbeyond that date.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position to be taken by the European\nUnion at the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention shall\nbe to support\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the listing of\nhexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD)[25]\nin Annex A to the Convention\nwith a time limited exemption for production and use of HBCDD in building-related\napplications;\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the deletion of the following\nexemptions and acceptable purposes from the entry on Perfluorooctane sulfonic\nacid (PFOS) and its derivatives in Annex B to the Convention: fire-fighting\nfoams;
