It clarifies the definition of a\r\nnovel food, including new technologies which have an impact on food. \nIt introduces a faster and more proportionate safety\r\nassessment for traditional foods from third countries having a history of safe\r\nfood use.\nThe general criteria for the Novel Food\r\ndefinition remain unchanged: novel foods are foods and food ingredients which\r\nwere not consumed in the EU to a significant degree before the entry into force\r\n(15 May 1997) of the current Novel Food Regulation.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General context\nOn 14 January 2008, the Commission adopted a\r\nproposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Novel\r\nFood[1]. \nThe legislative discussions under the Ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure mainly focused on the provisions applicable to\r\nnanomaterials, the cloning of animals for food production, traditional foods\r\nfrom third countries, the criteria to be examined for the risk assessment and risk\r\nmanagement and to the procedure for the authorisation of novel foods in\r\naccordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Lisbon\r\nTreaty).\nThe discussions reached a stalemate on a\r\nlimited number of issues (in particular those linked to cloning of animals). The\r\nConciliation Committee did not reach a final agreement at its last meeting on\r\n28 March 2011 and the proposal was not adopted by the Union legislator.\nThe Commission considers that issues related to\r\ncloning of farm animals should be addressed in a separate proposal, based on an\r\nimpact assessment.\nThis proposal is therefore limited to the\r\nsafety of novel food and is based on the overall agreement achieved in\r\nConciliation. \n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Current\r\nlegislation\nAuthorisation and use of novel foods and food ingredients have been\r\nharmonised in the European Union since 1997 when Regulation (EC) No 258/97 on Novel\r\nFood and novel food ingredients[2]\r\nwas adopted. The current legislation consists of the Novel Food Regulation and\r\none Commission Regulation:\n\u2013              \r\nRegulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients\r\nlays down the general principles for authorisation of novel foods and food\r\ningredients in the European Union.\n\u2013              \r\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 1852/2001 lays\r\ndown detailed rules for making certain information available to the public and\r\nfor the protection of information submitted pursuant to European Parliament and\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 258/97[3].\nCurrently, an application for a pre-market authorisation\r\nis first assessed by a Member State food assessment body. The initial\r\nassessment report is circulated for comments and objections to all Member\r\nStates by the Commission. If no reasoned safety objections are presented, the\r\nnovel food may be placed on the market. If reasoned safety objections are\r\npresented, an authorisation decision is required by the Commission. This in\r\nmost cases includes an additional assessment which is carried out by the\r\nEuropean Food Safety Authority (EFSA).\nThe authorisation under current rules is granted\r\nto the applicant (individual authorisation). In addition, another applicant may\r\nnotify to the Commission the placing on the market of a food that is\r\nsubstantially equivalent to the authorised food. This notification has to be\r\nsubstantiated by scientific evidence showing the substantial equivalence of the\r\nnotified food to the authorised food. These rules have allowed for placing on\r\nthe market various foods such as Baobab dried fruit pulp, Chia seeds, fish (Sardinops\r\nsagax) peptide product or synthetic vitamin K2.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the\r\nUnion\nThe proposal brings together and updates the\r\nprovisions of the above mentioned texts which will be repealed at the time of\r\nentry into application of the new legislation.\nThe proposal pursues the objectives of the\r\nCommunication on Smart Regulation in the European Union[4] and of the Europe 2020\r\nStrategy[5].\r\nThe emphasis is on simplifying and streamlining the regulatory process, thus\r\nreducing the administrative burden and improving the competitiveness of the\r\nEuropean food industry, while ensuring the safety of food, maintaining a high\r\nlevel of public health protection and taking global aspects into consideration.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of interested parties\nStakeholders from food industry, consumers,\r\nthird countries and national authorities and international organisations have\r\nbeen consulted both before and after the adoption of Commission proposal of\r\nJanuary 2008. Commission representatives also participated at several meetings\r\nor seminars organised by stakeholders and dedicated to specific issues (e.g.\r\ntraditional food from third countries, assessment and authorisation procedure,\r\nnanotechnologies) and bilateral meetings with interested parties.\nDuring the first and second reading and the\r\nConciliation procedure on the 2008 legislative proposal, stakeholders also\r\nexpressed their positions.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nThe Commission carried out an Impact Assessment\r\nin 2007. For each of the measures of the 2008 proposal, several options were\r\nexamined with regard to their economic, social and environmental impact on the\r\nvarious stakeholders and Member States. It is available at\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biotechnology/novelfood/initiatives_en.htm.\r\nRegarding the current proposal, the 2008 impact assessment is still valid, as\r\nthe rationale for an in-depth revision of the current legislation (the length\r\nand cost of the current authorisation procedure, the need for a centralised\r\nrisk assessment and risk management and for an adjusted procedure for the\r\nplacing on the EU market of traditional foods from third countries) is unchanged.\nThe main changes compared to the 2008 proposal\r\nare primarily those introduced during the Ordinary legislative procedure whose\r\nimpact is unchanged as they only clarify the purpose of the measures. \nAs regards a possible exclusion of micro-enterprises\r\nfrom the scope, it appears that such an exemption would not be compatible with\r\nthe overall objective of ensuring the safety of the novel foods which are put\r\non the EU market. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nLegal basis of this\r\nproposal is Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity\r\nprinciple\nThe proposal has to comply with the subsidiarity principle since it\r\ndoes not fall under the exclusive competence of the Union.\nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\r\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States for the following reasons:\n\u2013              \r\nIndividual action by Member States could lead to\r\ndifferent levels of food safety and protection of human health and confuse\r\nconsumers. Repealing the Novel Food Regulation would do away with harmonised\r\nfood safety rules and would endanger the free movement of food in the EU. \n\u2013              \r\nEffective functioning of the internal market in\r\nrelation to novel foods while protecting the health and the interest of the\r\nEuropean consumers can best be met by action at EU level. \nThe proposal therefore complies with the\r\nsubsidiarity principle.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality\r\nprinciple for the following reasons:\n\u2013              \r\nThe proposal harmonises the regulatory framework\r\nfor novel food authorisation and thus contributes to the functioning of the\r\nfood market in the EU. \n\u2013              \r\nThe proposed measures are sufficient in terms of\r\nreaching the objectives of ensuring food safety and securing the functioning of\r\nthe internal market for food while reducing the administrative burden.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe financial and budgetary impact of the\r\nproposal is indicated in the legislative financial statement attached to this\r\nproposal.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 choice of\r\ninstruments \nThe proposed\r\ninstrument is Regulation.\nOther means\r\nwould not be adequate for the following reasons:\n\u2013              \r\nThe area of novel foods is fully harmonised in\r\nthe EU. Non-legislative action based, for example, on a code of good practice\r\nor guidelines could not give sufficient protection and would lack legal\r\ncertainty.\n\u2013              \r\nThe safe use of novel foods depends on\r\npre-market safety evaluations and often on permitted conditions of use of these\r\nsubstances, therefore recommendations or self-regulations would not guarantee\r\nthe protection of consumer's health.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OTHER ISSUES\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simplification\nThe proposal provides for the simplification of\r\nlegislation and administrative procedures for public authorities and private\r\nparties as compared to the legislation in place:\n\u2013              \r\nThere is only one centralised procedure for the\r\nassessment and authorisation of novel foods. The wording of the proposal has\r\nbeen up-dated and clarified.\n\u2013              \r\nNational administrative procedures and duplication\r\nof work are removed.\n\u2013              \r\nThe authorisation procedure is streamlined,\r\nincreasing its efficiency and reducing the administrative burden in particular\r\nfor private parties.\n\u2013              \r\nA simplified procedure for the placing on the\r\nmarket of the traditional foods from third countries is introduced.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cost for business, in particular\r\nSMEs\nThe proposed measures will reduce\r\nadministrative burden and the length and cost of the authorisation procedure\r\nfor the food industry (18 months instead of 3 years in average currently).\r\nGeneric authorisation will avoid the re-submission of new applications by other\r\ncompanies for the same novel food and are expected to benefit in particular\r\nSMEs. However, in order to maintain an incentive for developing really\r\ninnovative food products, a \"data protection\" regime with the\r\ngranting of an applicant linked authorisation for a maximum of 5 years is\r\nintroduced. The measures will also facilitate EU market access for traditional\r\nfoods from third countries by setting up a simplified and more proportionate\r\nprocedure.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European\r\nEconomic Area\nThe proposed act\r\nconcerns an European Economic Area (EEA) matter and therefore extends to the\r\nEEA.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed\r\nexplanation of the proposal\nChapter I \u2013 Subject matter, scope and\r\ndefinitions\nNovel foods shall be subject to safety\r\nevaluation and authorisation via a fully harmonised procedure. The definitions\r\nare clarified and updated. It may be determined with the examination procedure\r\nif a food falls within the scope of the Regulation. \nNanomaterials which are intended for food uses\r\nand covered by the definition of \"engineered nanomaterials\", as laid\r\ndown in Regulation (EU) n\u00b01169/2011 on Food Information to Consumers, shall be\r\nassessed and authorised under this Regulation before being placed on the EU\r\nmarket. \nChapter II \u2013 Requirements for placing\r\nnovel foods on the market within the Union\nAll novel foods and their use in food have to\r\ncomply with the following criteria: they should not present a danger to human\r\nhealth and their use should not mislead the consumer. \nFor every authorised novel food,\r\nspecifications, labelling requirements, conditions of use and, where appropriate,\r\na requirement of post-market monitoring may be laid down.\nThe current system of individual authorisations\r\nis replaced by generic authorisations. The so called current \"simplified\r\nprocedure\" based on substantial equivalence, which aims to extend an\r\nindividual authorisation to another company for the same novel food, is removed\r\nsince authorisations become directly generic.\nAlready authorised novel foods shall continue\r\nto be marketed and will be included in the Union list of novel foods.\nChapter III \u2013 Authorisation procedure\r\nfor a novel food\nIn line with the decision to switch to a\r\ncentralised EU-level procedure and to separate risk management and risk\r\nassessment, all applications for the authorisation of novel foods shall be\r\nsubmitted to the Commission. The Commission may then request a scientific\r\nopinion on risk assessment from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).\nThe inclusion of a novel food in the Union list\r\nof novel foods will be considered by the Commission on the basis of the opinion\r\nfrom EFSA. The Commission will be assisted by the Standing Committee on the\r\nFood Chain and Animal Health (SCOFCAH).\nFor traditional foods from third countries, a\r\nsafety assessment and a risk management, based on a history of safe food use, is\r\nintroduced. If a history of safe food use in a third country for at least 25\r\nyears has been demonstrated by the applicant, and if the Member States or EFSA do not present reasoned safety objections based on scientific evidence, the food\r\nmay be included in the Union list.\nHowever, in case reasoned safety objections are\r\npresented, an EFSA assessment followed by an EU authorisation procedure,\r\nsimilar to the standard authorisation procedure but with shorter deadlines, is\r\nrequired. \nThis procedure provides for a more proportionate\r\nrisk assessment and risk management of traditional foods from third countries and\r\nallows for a quicker placing on the EU market for a range of products from\r\nprimary production without compromising food safety. \nChapter IV \u2013 Additional\r\nprocedural rules and other requirements\nThe information provided by the applicant\r\nshould be kept confidential where the disclosure of such information might\r\nsignificantly harm their competitive position.\nChapter V \u2013 Data\r\nprotection\nBy way of derogation from the generic authorisation\r\nin order to support innovation in the EU food industry and only in duly\r\njustified cases, individual authorisations with data protection may be granted\r\nfor a maximum period of five years.\nChapter VI \u2013 Penalties\r\nand committee procedure\nThe Member States shall lay down rules on\r\npenalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of the proposed Regulation.\nImplementation of the measures proposed in this\r\nRegulation will mainly be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the examination\r\nprocedure laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) n\u00b0182/2011. This consists\r\nof including the conditions of use and labelling of a novel food as well as\r\nlaying down specifications and, where appropriate post-market monitoring\r\nrequirements. \nChapter VII \u2013\r\nTransitional and final provisions\nTransitional measures are necessary to ensure a\r\nsmooth transition with on-going applications and notifications, pending the\r\nentry into application of this legislation. Furthermore, due to clarification\r\nof the definition of the novel food laid down in this Regulation and to enhance\r\nlegal certainty, a food that was legally placed on the market prior to the\r\napplication of this Regulation, should be allowed to be continued to be\r\nmarketed until the risk assessment and authorisation procedures have been\r\nconcluded. \n2013/0435 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non novel foods\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\r\nEconomic and Social Committee[6],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure[7],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The free movement of safe\r\nand wholesome food is an essential aspect of the internal market and\r\ncontributes significantly to the health and well-being of citizens,\r\nas well as benefitting their social and economic interests.\r\nDifferences between national laws concerning the safety assessment and\r\nauthorisation of novel foods may hinder the free movement of such food, thereby\r\ncreating unfair conditions of competition. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A high level of protection\r\nof human health and of consumers\u2019 interests and the effective functioning of\r\nthe internal market should be assured in the pursuit of Union food policies,\r\nwhilst ensuring transparency. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's rules on novel\r\nfoods were established by Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council[8]\r\nand by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1852/2001[9].\r\nThose rules need to be updated to simplify the current authorisation procedures\r\nand to take account of recent developments in Union law. For the sake of\r\nclarity of Union legislation, Regulations (EC) No 258/97 and (EC) No 1852/2001 should\r\nbe repealed and Regulation (EC) No 258/97 should be replaced by this\r\nRegulation. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Foods which are intended\r\nto be used for technological purposes and genetically modified food should not\r\nfall within the scope of this Regulation as they are already covered by other\r\nUnion rules. Therefore, genetically modified food falling within the scope\r\nof Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council[10], enzymes falling\r\nwithin the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council[11],\r\nfood used solely as additives falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No\r\n1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council[12], flavourings falling\r\nwithin the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council[13]\r\nand extraction solvents falling within the scope of Directive 2009/32/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[14]\r\nshould be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The existing categories of\r\nnovel food laid down in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 should be\r\nclarified and updated by replacing the existing categories with a reference to\r\nthe general definition of food provided for in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No\r\n178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council[15].\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\r\ncontinuity with the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 258/97, the absence\r\nof a use for human consumption to a significant degree within the Union before\r\nthe date of entry into force of that Regulation, namely 15 May 1997, should be maintained\r\nas a criterion for a food to be considered as a novel food. A use within the\r\nUnion should also refer to a use in the Member States irrespective of the\r\ndate of accession of the various Member States to the Union.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Emerging technologies in food\r\nproduction processes may have an impact on food and thereby on food safety.\r\nTherefore, it should also be clarified that a food should be considered as a\r\nnovel food where a production process which was not previously used for food\r\nproduction in the Union is applied to that food or when foods contain or\r\nconsist of engineered nanomaterials, as defined in Article 2(2)(t) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[16].\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vitamins, minerals and\r\nother substances intended to be used in food supplements or to be added to food\r\nincluding infant formula and follow-on formulae, processed cereal-based food\r\nand baby food for infants and young children, food for special medical\r\npurposes, and total diet replacement for weight control are subject to the\r\nrules provided for in Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council[17],\r\nin Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council[18] and in Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[19]. Those substances should\r\nalso be assessed in accordance with the rules laid down in this Regulation when\r\nthey fall within the definition of novel food laid down in this Regulation. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When there is a\r\nsignificant change in the production process of a substance that has been used\r\nin accordance with Directive 2002/46/EC, Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 or Regulation\r\n(EU) No 609/2013, or a change in particle size of such a substance, for example\r\nthrough nanotechnology, it may have an impact on food and thereby on food\r\nsafety. Therefore, that substance should be considered a novel food under this\r\nRegulation and should be re-evaluated first in accordance with this Regulation\r\nand subsequently in accordance with the relevant specific legislation.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If, prior to 15 May 1997, a\r\nfood was used exclusively as, or in, a food supplement, as defined in point (a)\r\nof Article 2 of Directive 2002/46/EC, it should be allowed to be placed on the\r\nmarket within the Union after that date for the same use without being\r\nconsidered a novel food for the purposes of this Regulation. However, that use\r\nas, or in, a food supplement should not be taken into account for the\r\nassessment of whether the food was used for human consumption to a significant\r\ndegree within the Union before 15 May 1997. Therefore, uses of the food\r\nconcerned other than in, or as, a food supplement should be subject to this\r\nRegulation.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The placing on the market within\r\nthe Union of traditional foods from third countries should be facilitated, where\r\nthe history of safe food use in a third country has been demonstrated. Those foods\r\nshould have been consumed in a third country for at least 25 years as a part of\r\nthe customary diet within a large part of the population of the country. The\r\nhistory of safe food use should not include non-food uses or uses not related\r\nto normal diets.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be clarified that\r\nfoods from third countries which are regarded as novel foods in the Union should\r\nonly be considered as traditional foods from third countries when they are\r\nderived from primary production as defined in Article 3 of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 178/2002, regardless of whether or not they are processed or\r\nunprocessed foods. Therefore, where a new production process has been applied\r\nto this food or where the food contains or consists of \"engineered\r\nnanomaterials\" as defined in Article 2(2)(t) of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1169/2011, the food should not be considered to be traditional.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Food products produced from\r\nfood ingredients that do not fall within the scope of this Regulation, in\r\nparticular by changing the ingredients of the food, their composition or\r\namount, should not be considered as novel foods. However, modifications of a\r\nfood ingredient, such as selective extracts or the use of other parts of a\r\nplant, that have so far not been used for human consumption to a significant\r\ndegree within the Union, should fall within the scope of this Regulation.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[20] applies where a\r\nproduct, taking into account all its characteristics, may fall both within the\r\ndefinition of \"medicinal product\" as laid down in Article 1(2) of that\r\nDirective and within the definition of a product covered by this Regulation. In\r\nthat respect, where a Member State establishes in accordance with Directive\r\n2001/83/EC that a product is a medicinal product, it may restrict the placing\r\non the market of that product in accordance with Union law. Moreover, medicinal\r\nproducts are excluded from the definition of food as laid down in Article 2 of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 178/2002 and should therefore not fall within the scope\r\nof this Regulation.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Implementing powers should\r\nbe conferred to the Commission to decide whether a particular food falls within\r\nthe definition of a novel food and is thereby subject to rules on novel food\r\nlaid down in this Regulation.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The determination of\r\nwhether a food was used for human consumption to a significant degree within\r\nthe Union before 15 May 1997 should be based on information submitted by\r\nfood business operators and, where appropriate, supported by other information\r\navailable in the Member States. Food business operators should consult Member\r\nStates if they are unsure of the status of the food they intend to place on the\r\nmarket. When there is no information or insufficient information available on\r\nhuman consumption before 15 May 1997, a simple and transparent procedure, involving\r\nthe Commission, the Member States and food business operators, should be\r\nestablished for collecting such information. Implementing powers should be\r\nconferred on the Commission to specify the procedural steps of such\r\nconsultation process.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Novel foods should be authorised\r\nand used only if they fulfil the criteria laid down in this Regulation. Novel\r\nfoods should be safe and their use should not mislead the consumer. Therefore,\r\nwhere a novel food is intended to replace another food, it should not differ\r\nfrom that food in a way that would be nutritionally less advantageous for the\r\nconsumer.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Novel foods should not be\r\nplaced on the market or used in food for human consumption unless they are\r\nincluded in a Union list of novel foods authorised to be placed on the market\r\nwithin the Union (\u2018the Union list\u2019). Therefore, it is appropriate to establish,\r\nby means of an implementing act, a Union list of novel foods by entering novel\r\nfoods already authorised or notified in accordance with Article 4, 5 or 7 of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 258/97 in the Union list, including any existing authorisation\r\nconditions. As those novel foods have already been evaluated for their safety,\r\nhave been legally produced and marketed in the Union and have not given rise to\r\nhealth concerns in the past, the advisory procedure should be used for the\r\ninitial establishment of the Union list. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to authorise\r\na novel food by updating the Union list subject to the criteria and the\r\nprocedures laid down in this Regulation. A procedure that is efficient,\r\ntime-limited and transparent should be put in place. As regards traditional\r\nfoods from third countries having a history of safe use it is appropriate to\r\nprovide for a faster and simplified procedure to update the Union list if no\r\nreasoned safety objections are expressed. As the updating of the Union list\r\nimplies the application of criteria laid down in this Regulation, implementing\r\npowers should be conferred on the Commission in that respect.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Criteria for the evaluation\r\nof the safety risks arising from novel foods should also be laid down. In order\r\nto ensure the harmonised scientific assessment of novel foods, such assessments\r\nshould be carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (\"EFSA\").\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the possible use\r\nof nanomaterials for food use, EFSA considered in its opinion of 6 April 2011[21] on Guidance on the\r\nrisk assessment of the application of nanoscience and nanotechnologies in the\r\nfood and feed chain that limited information is available in relation to aspects\r\nof nanotoxicokinetics and toxicology of engineered nanomaterials and that\r\nexisting toxicity testing methods may need methodological modifications. In\r\norder to better assess the safety of nanomaterials for food use, the Commission\r\nis developing test methods which take into account specific characteristics of\r\nengineered nanomaterials.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When a novel food is authorised\r\nand included in the Union list, the Commission should have the power to\r\nintroduce post\u2011market monitoring requirements to monitor the use of the\r\nauthorised novel food to ensure that the use is within safe limits as\r\nestablished in the safety assessment by EFSA. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under specific\r\ncircumstances, in order to stimulate research and development within the\r\nagri-food industry, and thus innovation, it is appropriate to protect the\r\ninvestment made by innovators in gathering the information and data provided in\r\nsupport of an application for a novel food made in accordance with this\r\nRegulation. The newly developed scientific evidence and\r\nproprietary data provided in support of an application for inclusion of a novel\r\nfood in the Union list should be protected. Those data and information should,\r\nfor a limited period of time, not be used to the benefit of a subsequent\r\napplicant, without the agreement of the prior applicant. The protection of\r\nscientific data provided by one applicant should not prevent other applicants\r\nfrom seeking the inclusion in the Union list on the basis of their own\r\nscientific data or by referring to the protected data with the agreement of the\r\nprior applicant. However, the overall five year period of data protection which\r\nhas been granted to the prior applicant should not be extended due to the\r\ngranting of data protection to subsequent applicants.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Novel foods are subject to\r\nthe general labelling requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information\r\nto consumers and other relevant labelling requirements in Union food law. In\r\ncertain cases it may be necessary to provide for additional labelling\r\ninformation, in particular regarding the description of the food, its source or\r\nits conditions of use to ensure that consumers are sufficiently informed of the\r\nnature of the novel food. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For those applications which\r\nhave been submitted under Regulation (EC) No 258/97 before the date of\r\napplication of this Regulation risk assessment and authorisation procedures should\r\nbe concluded in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore, due to\r\nclarification of the definition of novel food laid down in this Regulation and\r\nto enhance legal certainty, a food that was legally placed on the market at the\r\ndate of application of this Regulation, should in principle be allowed to be\r\nplaced on the market until the risk assessment and authorisation procedures\r\nhave been concluded. Therefore, transitional rules should be laid down to\r\nensure a smooth transition to the rules of this Regulation.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member States should\r\nlay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of\r\nthis Regulation and should take all measures necessary to ensure that they are\r\nimplemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation with regard to updating\r\nthe Union list concerning the adding of a traditional food from a third country\r\nwhere no reasoned safety objections have been expressed, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The implementing powers relating\r\nto the definition of \u2018novel food\u2019, the consultation process for determination\r\nof novel food status, other updates of the Union list, the drafting and\r\npresentation of applications or notifications for the inclusion of foods in the\r\nUnion list, the arrangements for checking the validity of applications or\r\nnotifications, confidentiality treatment and transitional provisions, should be exercised in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council[22].\r\n\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nRegulation, namely laying down rules for the placing of novel foods on the\r\nmarket within the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but\r\ncan rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance\r\nwith the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\r\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that\r\nArticle, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\r\nachieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nChapter I \r\nSubject matter, scope and definitions\nArticle 1\r\nSubject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation lays down rules\r\nfor the placing of novel foods on the market within the Union in order to\r\nensure the effective functioning of the internal market while providing a high\r\nlevel of protection of human health and consumer interests.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation shall not apply\r\nto:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 genetically modified foods falling\r\nwithin the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 foods when and in so far as they are\r\nused as:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 food enzymes falling within the scope\r\nof Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008;\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 food additives falling within the\r\nscope of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008;\n(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 food flavourings falling within the\r\nscope of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008;\n(iv)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 extraction solvents used or intended\r\nto be used in the production of foodstuffs or food ingredients and falling\r\nwithin the scope of Directive 2009/32/EC;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 food falling within the scope of Council\r\nDirective XXX/XX/EU on [on the placing on the market of food from animal clones].\nArticle 2\r\nDefinitions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of this\r\nRegulation, the definitions laid down in Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 178/2002 shall apply. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nfollowing definitions shall also apply:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"novel\r\nfood\" means all food that was not used for human consumption to a\r\nsignificant degree within the Union before 15 May 1997 irrespective of the date\r\nof accession of the various Member States to the Union and includes in\r\nparticular:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 food to which a new production\r\nprocess not used for food production within the Union before 15 May 1997\r\nis applied, where that production process gives rise to significant changes in\r\nthe composition or structure of the food which affect its nutritional value, the\r\nway it is metabolised or the level of undesirable substances;\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 food containing or consisting of \"engineered\r\nnanomaterials\" as defined in Article 2(2)(t) of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1169/2011;\n(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 vitamins, minerals and other\r\nsubstances used in accordance with Directive 2002/46/EC, Regulation (EC) No\r\n1925/2006 or Regulation (EU) No 609/2013, where: \n\u2013              \r\na new production process has been applied as\r\nreferred to in point (i) of this paragraph;

The administrative burden is reduced (removal of\r\ncurrent double risk assessment). Time and related costs for getting a Novel\r\nFood authorisation are reduced. \nIndividual authorisations are becoming generic which facilitates\r\nmarket access in particular for SMEs. The introduction of the \"data\r\nprotection\" regime stimulates innovation in the food sector.\nOn operators from third countries:\r\nBetter EU market access for traditional foods from third countries through\r\nsimplified procedure (notification).\nOn EU consumers: a high level of public\r\nhealth is ensured by a systematic centralised risk assessment by EFSA followed\r\nby an EU authorisation decision. \nOn Member State authorities: The\r\nworkload for ensuring the national assessment is removed.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\r\nimpact \nSpecify the indicators for monitoring\r\nimplementation of the proposal/initiative.\n- The average length for applicants to get an authorisation\r\ndecision.\n- Number of notifications agreed per year for traditional foods from\r\nthird countries.\n- Number and ratio of authorisations with data protection regime\r\ngranted to innovative foods per year.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nThe existing regulatory framework is being criticised for being\r\nparticularly burdensome, lengthy and costly to get a Novel Food authorisation.\r\nAs a consequence most EU food businesses do not want to develop and put on the\r\nmarket new foods or food ingredients which would fall under the Novel Food\r\nscope, in particular SMEs.\nAt international level, the EU is much criticized at WTO level by third\r\ncountries which consider that the Novel Food authorisation is a barrier to\r\ntrade and prevents EU market access to foods which have a long history of safe\r\nfood use in their country of origin.\nThe present revision aims to address these weaknesses of current EU\r\nlegislation and to put in place a streamlined and adapted regulatory framework,\r\nthus ensuring a high level of public health.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement \nThe proposed revision of the existing Regulation concerning novel\r\nfoods can only be achieved at Union level.

used\r\nto estimate costs\nGeneral considerations\nRegulation (EC) No 258/97 of January 1997 lays\r\ndown detailed rules for the authorisation of novel foods and novel food\r\ningredients. These rules include an initial safety assessment by a Member\r\nState. If concerns from other Member States with respect to this assessment are\r\nraised, EFSA is asked to perform an additional risk assessment. At present\r\naround 2/3 of all novel food applications in Europe are subject to this further\r\nassessment by EFSA.\nThe revised novel food legislation foresees\r\namongst other that all novel food applications are to undergo a centralised\r\nrisk assessment by EFSA and that a simplified notification procedure for\r\ntraditional foods from third countries with the involvement of EFSA is\r\nestablished in order to allow easier market access for these types of products.\nIt is expected that EFSA will receive around\r\n15 applications for Novel Food per year. Also, the transfer from a\r\npartially decentralised to a fully centralised procedure alone will result in\r\nan increase in workload for EFSA.\nIt is also expected that EFSA will receive\r\nper year around 10 notifications for traditional foods from third countries\r\nwith a high peak to be expected immediately after the date of application of\r\nthe Regulation. This is expected to be driven by botanicals used in traditional\r\nChinese and Ayurvedic medicine which currently cannot enter the market because\r\nof their Novel Food status. \nEFSA will also be requested to revise the\r\nscientific guidelines for the risk assessment of Novel Food as well as to\r\ndevelop technical guidance and tools to assist food business operators\r\n(EU and 3rd country operators) for submitting an application or a notification.\nCurrently, the workload under the existing\r\nNovel Food Regulation (around 8 applications per year) is covered by 2 FTE (1.5\r\nscientists, 0.5 administrative support) and EFSA\u2019s risk assessment can rely on\r\npreparatory work performed by Member States. \nThe data provided under points 1 and 2 of this\r\nAnnex provides for the needs of EFSA on the basis of the increased workload\r\ncompared to the current legal framework.\nEFSA will need to carry out administrative tasks\r\nto support the increased workload, including organisation of meetings, document\r\nmanagement, and procurement as well as organisation of missions and additional\r\nfinancial transactions. EFSA will absorb those needs by internal\r\nredeployment of resources and by further gains of efficiency in the provision\r\nof administrative and support services.\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2007) 872 final.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food\r\ningredients (OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1).\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 253, 21.9.2001, p. 17.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2010) 543 final.\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2010) 2020 final.\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C [\u2026], [\u2026], p.
