The MoU was\r\nendorsed by Council by letter of 12 May 2009 as an international agreement of\r\nthe EC. \nThe MoU sets out different steps concerning\r\nthe importation of beef not treated with growth-promoting hormones into the EU,\r\nas well the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States against EU\r\nproducts as part of the WTO dispute on EC \u2013 Measures Concerning Meat and\r\nMeat Products (Hormones). These steps are grouped in three phases. \nUnder Phase 1, from August 2009 to August\r\n2012, the EU opened an autonomous erga omnes tariff quota for 20,000\r\ntons of \"High Quality Beef\",[1]\r\nand the US reduced the level of sanctions applied to EU products. \nUnder Phase 2, from 1 August 2012 to 1\r\nAugust 2013, the EU opened a larger quota for 45,000 tons of High Quality Beef,[2] and the US suspended all trade sanctions on EU products resulting from the Hormones dispute.\r\n\nThe MoU foresees that, should the Parties\r\nnot reach agreement to enter into Phase 3 by the expiry of Phase 2, the MoU\r\nwould be considered terminated; however, its core obligations of opening a\r\nquota for high quality beef and suspending all trade sanctions remain in place\r\nfor six more months. \nAt this time there is no agreement to enter\r\ninto Phase 3, but the termination of the MoU is not in the EU or US interest.\r\nThe Parties could agree to extend Phase 2 until August 2015, while they\r\ncontinue discussions on Phase 3. \nThe amendment of the MoU also clarifies the\r\nelements of Phase 3, should the Parties agree to enter into it at the end of\r\nthe extended Phase 2. The rules of the MoU concerning the management of\r\nlicenses are also amended to reflect the system of \"first come, first served\",\r\nintroduced in 2012[3].\r\n\nThe Revised MoU has been signed on [xxx]\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposal consists of a Commission\r\nproposal for a Council decision concluding the Revised Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nNone. \n2013/0324 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion of a Revised Memorandum\r\nof Understanding with the United States of America Regarding the Importation of\r\nBeef from Animals Not Treated with Certain Growth-Promoting Hormones and\r\nIncreased Duties Applied by the United States to Certain Products of the\r\nEuropean Union\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 in conjunction\r\nwith Article 218(6)(a) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Council\r\nDecision [XXX] of [4],\r\nthe Revised Memorandum of Understanding with the United States of America\r\nRegarding the Importation of Beef from Animals Not Treated with Certain\r\nGrowth-Promoting Hormones and Increased Duties Applied by the United States to Certain Products of the European Union was signed on , subject to its conclusion at\r\na later date.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The agreement should be\r\napproved on behalf of the European Union,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe Revised Memorandum\r\nof Understanding with the United States of America Regarding the Importation of\r\nBeef from Animals Not Treated with Certain Growth-Promoting Hormones and\r\nIncreased Duties Applied by the United States to Certain Products of the\r\nEuropean Union is hereby approved on behalf of the Union. \nThe text of the Agreement is attached to\r\nthis Decision.\nArticle 2\nThis\r\nDecision shall enter into force on [5].\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nANNEX \nRevised Memorandum of Understanding with\r\nthe United States of America Regarding the Importation of Beef from Animals Not\r\nTreated with Certain Growth-Promoting Hormones and Increased Duties Applied by\r\nthe United States to Certain Products of the European Union\nArticle I\r\n\u00a0Purpose and Objectives\nWith\r\nthis Understanding, the United States and the European Union intend to achieve\r\nthe following objectives:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To provide, in a first\r\nphase (\"Phase 1\"), for temporary and partial:\n(a)         \r\nExpansion by the EU of market access for High\r\nQuality Beef and\n(b)         \r\nReduction in the level of increased duties\r\napplied by the United States to certain EU products authorized by the WTO in\r\n1999 (the \"increased duties\")\nin order for the Parties to gain experience in\r\nadditional trade in High Quality Beef and facilitate a transition to long-term\r\nconditions;\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To provide the opportunity\r\nto move to a second phase (\"Phase 2\"), for:\n(a)         \r\nFurther expansion by the EU of market access for\r\nHigh Quality Beef and\n(b)         \r\nReduction to zero of the increased duties \nin order for the Parties to gain experience in\r\nadditional expanded trade in High Quality Beef and facilitate a transition to\r\nlong-term conditions;
