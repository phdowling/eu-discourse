Context of the proposal\nGrounds and objectives of the proposal\nRegulation\n(EU) No 260/2012 establishes common technical and business requirements for\ncredit transfers and direct debits in euro and as such is an important building\nblock in the realisation of a single euro payments area (SEPA). That\nRegulation\u00a0 sets 1 February 2014 as the end-date in the Eurozone for the\nmigration of domestic as well as intra-European credit transfers and direct\ndebits in euros towards SEPA credit transfers (SCT) and SEPA direct debits\n(SDD). \nAccording to the latest statistics of the European\nCentral Bank (ECB), the overall migration rate in the euro area for SEPA Credit\nTransfers (SCT) has increased from 59.87% in October 2013 to 64.1% in November,\nwhereas the overall migration rate for SEPA Direct Debits (SDD) has increased\nfrom 11.52% in October to 26% in November. Notwithstanding the Commission's\nrepeated efforts to raise awareness among Member States' competent authorities,\nand the significant campaigning efforts as regards SEPA migration undertaken by\nthe European Central Bank and in many Member States, SMEs, small public\nadministrations and local authorities continue to be the least prepared for\nactual migration. The communication efforts by the banking industry vis-\u00e0-vis\nSMEs and national information campaigns do not seem to have produced the\nexpected effects or at least not to the expected extent. \nConsidering the low migration pace in some\nMember States for SCT and in most Member States for SDD, it appears very\nunlikely that the SEPA migration will be fully completed on 1 February 2014. However,\nin view of this legal end-date, banks and other payment service providers are\nlikely to refuse from that date onwards to process legacy payments which are\nnot SEPA compliant. In the absence of full migration to SCT/SDD, payment\nincidents leading to delays in payment or market disruptions cannot be\nexcluded. These might affect all payment services users, and particularly SMEs\nand consumers. \nGiven this major legal problem and the\npotentially severe consequences for citizens and companies, the Commission\nproposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 by introducing a grandfathering\nclause allowing banks and other payment service providers to continue also\nafter 1 February 2014, for a limited period of time of 6 months, the processing\nof non-compliant payments through their legacy payments schemes alongside SCT\nand SDD. A clear communication of such amendment will provide certainty to the\npayment service users that their payments will continue to be processed after 1\nFebruary 2014, and it will allow those that have not yet migrated to do so as\nrapidly as possible. The end-date itself is not amended, and the grandfathering\nis an exceptional one-off measure. Under all circumstances, on-going\ninformation campaigns on the SEPA migration should continue. At the end of the\ngrandfathering period, the Commission will not hesitate to take the necessary\nsteps to ensure the full application of EU law by the Member States.\nParticipants of the SEPA High Level meeting\nwhich brings together high level representatives from the European Central Bank\nand board members of the central banks of the Eurosystem have been consulted on\nthis initiative on 19 December 2013.\nIn view of the above and given the very\nshort period of time left before 1 February 2014, this Regulation should be\nadopted by the European Parliament and the Council as a matter of urgency and\nenter into force without delay. The Regulation is necessary in order to avoid\nlegal uncertainty for banks and other payment service providers, as well as\nundertakings and consumers, as Regulation (EU) No. 260/2012 would oblige\npayment service providers to refuse to process after this end-date payments in\neuro that are not compliant with the SEPA requirements. Not adopting the\nproposed Regulation as a matter of urgency could result in serious legal and\ntechnical risks in payments transactions from 1 February 2014 onwards. \nGeneral context\nRegulation (EU) No 260/2012 entered into force\non 31 March 2012, giving market participants two years to adapt their payment\nprocesses to the SEPA requirements for SCT and SDD. During those two years, the\nCommission and the ECB, together with the national public authorities have\nclosely monitored the progress of SEPA migration. The ECB has regularly issued\nprogress reports on the progress of the SEPA migration. Several SEPA Council\nmeetings have taken place, in which the Commission discussed the migration\nprogress with representatives from both the supply and demand side of the payments\nmarket, insisting on the need to intensify communication towards payment\nservice providers as well as towards all categories of payment services users\n(corporates including SMEs, public administrations, consumers, etc.). On 30\nMarch 2012, the Commission organised a dedicated workshop on the interpretation\nof Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 with SEPA Council technical experts, and again\non 12 July 2013 with Member States representatives. On 17 April 2013, the\nCommission also organised a technical expert group on SEPA. The Commission has furthermore\ndiscussed the progress both in the EU SEPA Forum that takes place twice a year,\nand the Payments Committee with Member States representatives. SEPA migration\nhas regularly featured on the agenda of many technical meetings of the ECB with\nrepresentatives of national central banks, as well as in some fora with\nrepresentatives from the banking industry.\nIn view of the low migration rates\npublished by the ECB in its March 2013 report on SEPA migration, the ECOFIN\nCouncil of 14 May 2013 adopted comprehensive Council conclusions stressing the\nimportance of SEPA migration and calling on Member States and market\nparticipants to actively support and speed up the SEPA migration process by taking\nrelevant measures. Following the ECOFIN conclusions, a joint letter of the\nCommission and the ECB was sent to Ministers of Finance and Governors of\nnational central banks on 15 May 2013, also stressing the importance of SEPA\nmigration and the urgent need for action at national level.\n2. Results of consultations with\ninterested parties and impact assessments \n2.1. Transmission of this proposal to\nthe national parliaments\nDraft legislative acts, including proposals\nfrom the Commission, sent to the European Parliament and to the Council must be\nforwarded to national parliaments in accordance with the Protocol (No. 1) on\nthe role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the\nTreaties. \nAccording to Article 4 of the Protocol, an\neight-week period must elapse between a draft legislative act being made\navailable to national Parliaments and the date when it is placed on a\nprovisional agenda for the Council for its adoption or for adoption of a\nposition under a legislative procedure. \nHowever, exceptions are possible under\nArticle 4 in cases of urgency, the reasons for which must be stated in the act\nor position of the Council. The Commission invites the European Parliament and\nthe Council to consider this proposal as a case of absolute urgency for the\nreasons explained above. \n2.2. Consultation of other interested\nparties and impact assessment\nIn view of the low migration rates,\npublished by the ECB in December 2013, the Commission and the ECB have analysed\nthe likelihood that the SEPA migration would be fully completed on 1 February\n2014. It was acknowledged that this would be highly unlikely despite the fact\nthat several big payment services users, such as utility companies with bulk\npayments, have indicated that they are planning to migrate close to the end\ndate. \nAlthough it is difficult to provide an\nestimation of the number of market participants that will not be SEPA compliant\nby the legal end-date, it is clear that in particular in the area of SDD the\nmigration rates will not anywhere be close to 100%. \nBanks and other payment service providers\nare likely to refuse to process non-compliant SEPA payments as of 1 February\n2014. The largest non-migration risk is related to SMEs many of which have not\nyet migrated. In light of this risk, the ECB has analysed possible scenarios\nand their impact with possible solutions to remedy the situation. Technically,\npayment service providers would be able to continue with the processing of\nnon-compliant payments through the use of legacy schemes. In addition, market\nparticipants that are not yet SEPA compliant would need to be identified and be\ninformed adequately on how to migrate to SEPA in an efficient manner.\nEven though it may be technically feasible\nfor market participants with the support of the overseers to implement\nintermediate solutions to overcome potential migration issues after 1 February\n2014, there is a genuine risk that this unsatisfactory situation may lead to\nconfusion for both consumers and other payment service users, and legal\nuncertainty for payment service providers confronted with market participants\nthat have not (yet) implemented these intermediate solutions. Among the\nnon-compliant market participants there are many SMEs. The fact that their\nlegacy payments may not be processed by the banks after 1 February 2014 could\nalso cause reputational damage to the Euro system as a whole. It is unlikely\nthat intermediate solutions, even if technically feasible, will be implemented\nin time.\nIn order to avoid unnecessary payment\ndisruptions resulting from non-compliance with SEPA and to ensure legal\ncertainty for all market participants, the Commission considers it justified to\npropose to allow, after 1 February 2014, the co-existence of national legacy\nsystems next to SCT and SDD schemes for a limited period of time of 6 months.\nThe length of such transitional period should be proportionate. The aim would\nbe to uphold the pressure on market participants to migrate as soon as\npossible, while at the same time ensuring legal certainty and that the costs\nfor payment service providers of a continued parallel run of two payment\nsystems is limited. Those payment service providers that have already migrated\nto SCT and SDD may consider providing conversion services to market\nparticipants that have not yet migrated. During the transitional period, Member\nStates should refrain from applying penalties to payment service providers that\nprocess non-compliant payments and to payment service users that have not yet\n(fully) migrated.\nThe introduction of an exceptional and\none-off additional period during which processing of legacy payments will be\ntolerated will also allow for a gradual migration. In view of the approaching\ndeadline, several of the larger utility providers have indicated that they will\nmigrate close to the current end-date of 1 February 2014. This may create\ncertain bottlenecks, particularly at the level of the payment service providers\nand the software vendors, who may be faced with certain capacity constraints. \nConsidering the current migration figures\nand the expected pace of migration, a grandfathering period of 6 months, until\n1 August 2014, is considered appropriate. During this period, the Commission\nand the ECB, together with national authorities will continue to monitor the\nmigration process closely and will be ready to take any additional measures, as\nappropriate.\nThis proposal is not accompanied by a\nseparate Impact Assessment, as an impact assessment for Regulation (EU) No.\n260/2012 has already been undertaken. This proposal does not alter the\nRegulation on substance and does not impose new obligations on businesses. It\nonly aims at introducing a transitional period after the end-date defined in\nArticle 6(1) and (2) of the Regulation to avoid legal uncertainty for\nsupervisory authorities, payment service providers, undertakings and consumers.\n\n3. Legal elements of the proposal \nThe Commission proposes to amend Regulation\n(EU) No 260/2012 by introducing a \"grandfathering\" clause which will\nallow banks and other payment service providers to continue until 1 August 2014\nthe processing of non-compliant payments through their currently existing\nlegacy payments schemes, alongside SCT and SDD. This amendment ensures that\nmarket participants that are not ready for SEPA by 1 February 2014 can continue\nto make their payments and avoids any inconvenience for consumers. \nThe proposal provides that the amendment\napplies as of 31 January 2014. This provision also allows for a retro-active\napplication in case the proposal is not adopted by the European Parliament and\nthe Council before 1 February but just after this date. This will avoid a\nlegislative gap as of 1 February 2014 which would create legal uncertainty. \nThe introduction of this transitional\nperiod for the phasing-out of the old systems shall be considered as an\nexceptional measure which will not be extended any further. Without prejudice\nto the different exemptions set out in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No.\n260/2012, all market participants shall therefore comply with the SEPA\nrequirements by 1 August 2014. \n4. Budgetary implications \nThe regulation does not have a budgetary\nimpact for the Commission. \n2013/0449 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 260/2012 as\nregards the migration to Union-wide credit transfers and direct debits\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Central Bank[2]\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure[3],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Together with Regulation\n(EC) No 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council[4]Regulation (EU) No\n260/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[5] constitutes an\nimportant building block in the completion of a single euro payments area\n(SEPA), where no distinction between cross-border and national payments in euro\nis made. The main objective of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 is the migration\nfrom national credit transfer and direct debit schemes to harmonized SEPA\ncredit transfer (SCT) and SEPA direct debit (SDD) schemes, inter alia by\nproviding Union citizens with a unique international bank account number (IBAN)\nthat can be used for all SEPA credit transfers and direct debit transactions\ndenominated in euro. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\n260/2012 has provided for the SEPA migration to take place by 1 February 2014\nin order to allow payment service providers and payment service users\nsufficient time to adapt their processes to the technical requirements that the\nmigration to SCT and SDD entail.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the adoption of\nRegulation (EU) No 260/2012 the Commission and the European Central Bank have\nclosely monitored the progress of SEPA migration. Several meetings with Member\nStates, national public authorities and market participants were held. The\nEuropean Central Bank has regularly published progress reports on SEPA\nmigration on the basis of payment data collected by national central banks. Those\nreports indicate that a number of Member States in the euro area are well on\ntrack with migration rates for SCT currently close to 100%. The large majority\nof payment service providers reported that they are already SEPA-compliant.\nHowever, in several other Member States the migration rates are lagging behind\nexpectations. This is particularly the case for SDD. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On May 2013, the ECOFIN\nCouncil in its conclusions[6]\nagain stressed the importance of SEPA migration. It was noted that the SEPA\nmigration was far from complete and that immediate efforts would be required by\nall market participants to complete the SEPA migration in time. An action plan\nwas adopted in which merchants, corporates, SMEs and public administrations\nwere invited to immediately take the necessary concrete internal steps to adapt\ntheir processes and inform their clients of their IBAN details. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the considerable\nefforts made by the European Central Bank, Member States, their national public\nauthorities and the different market participants during the past months, the\nlatest migration statistics show that the overall migration rate in the euro\narea to SEPA Credit Transfers (SCT) has only increased from 40% in June to around\n64% in November, while the overall migration rate towards SEPA Direct Debits (SDD)\nhas only reached 26%. While the national figures show important progress in\nseveral Member States, there is still an important group of Member States\nlagging considerably behind the expected migration rates. In view of the\ncurrent low migration pace in those Member States it is therefore very unlikely\nthat all market participants will be SEPA compliant by 1 February 2014.\u00a0 \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As of 1 February 2014\nbanks and other payment service providers will have to refuse to accept\nprocessing credit transfers or direct debits that are not SEPA-compliant\nbecause of their legal obligations, although, as is currently already the case,\nthey technically could process those payments by continuing to use existing legacy\npayments schemes alongside SCT and SDD. Failing a full migration to SCT and\nSDD, incidents involving payments leading to delays in those payments cannot be\nexcluded. All payment services users and particularly SMEs and consumers could\nbe affected.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is essential to avoid\nunnecessary disruption of payments resulting from the fact that SEPA migration\nis not fully completed by 1 February 2014. Payment service providers should\ntherefore be allowed, for a limited period of time, to continue the processing\nof payments transactions through their legacy schemes alongside their SCT and\nSDD schemes, as they are doing now. A transition period should therefore be\nintroduced that allows for the continuation of such parallel processing of\npayments in different formats. Considering the current migration figures and the\nexpected pace of migration, a one-off additional transition period of 6 months\nis appropriate. This grandfathering of the non-SEPA compliant legacy systems\nshould be considered as an exceptional measure and therefore be kept as short\nas possible, as a rapid and comprehensive migration is necessary in order to\nachieve the full benefits from an integrated payments market. It is also\nimportant to limit in time the costs for the payment service providers of a\ncontinued use of the legacy payment schemes in parallel with the SEPA system. Payment\nservice providers that have already fully migrated to SEPA might consider\nproviding payment service users that not yet have migrated with conversion\nservices during this transition period. During the transitional period, Member\nStates should refrain from applying penalties to payment service providers that\nprocess non-compliant payments and to payment service users that have not yet\nmigrated. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several large users of\ndirect debit instruments have already indicated that they plan to migrate close\nto the end-date. Any postponing of those migration projects could lead to\ntemporary stress on incoming payments and cash flows, and hence on treasury\nlevels of the companies concerned. Such late migration on a large scale could also\ncreate certain bottlenecks, in particular at the level of banks and software\nvendors who may be faced with certain capacity constraints. That additional\nperiod for phasing in the new system would allow for a more gradual approach.\nMarket participants that have not yet started to implement the necessary\nadaptations for SEPA compliance are called upon to do so as soon as possible.\nMarket participants that have already started to adapt their payment processes should\nnevertheless complete the migration as rapidly as possible.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the overall\nobjective to realise a coordinated and integrated migration, it is appropriate\nthat the transitional period applies to both SCT and SDD. Different\ntransitional periods for SCT and SDD would cause confusion for consumers,\npayment service providers, SMEs as well as other payment service users. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For reasons of legal\ncertainty and in order to avoid any discontinuity to the application of\nRegulation (EU) No 260/2012 it is necessary that this Regulation enters into\nforce as a matter of urgency and that it applies from 31 January 2014.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 260/2012\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nIn Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No\n260/2012, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n\"1.Notwithstanding Article 6(1) and (2),\nPSPs may continue, until 1 August 2014, to process payment transactions in euro\nin formats that are different from those required for SEPA credit transfers and\nSEPA direct debits. \nMember States shall apply the rules on the\npenalties applicable to infringements of Article 6(1) and (2), laid down in\naccordance with Article 11, only as of 2 August 2014.\nBy way of derogation from Article 6(1) and (2),\nMember States may allow PSPs to provide PSUs, until 1 February 2016, with\nconversion services for national payment enabling PSUs that are consumers to\ncontinue using BBAN instead of the payment account identifier specified in\npoint (1)(a) of the Annex on condition that interoperability is ensured by converting\nthe payer\u2019s and the payee\u2019s BBAN technically and securely into the respective\npayment account identifier specified in point (1)(a) of the Annex.
