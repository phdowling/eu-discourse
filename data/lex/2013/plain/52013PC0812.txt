Within European manufacturing, the agri-food sector is a front-runner,\r\nproviding 13.5 % of jobs and contributing 12.9 % of total sales. It\r\nis made up of 310 000 enterprises, 99.1 % of which are SMEs[1]. Over the years, the European\r\nsector has focussed on quality and added value, offering processed products\r\nwhich are increasingly popular in Europe and worldwide. These products account for\r\nmore than two-thirds of total EU agricultural exports, but still have\r\nconsiderable development potential.\nIt is crucial that European agriculture and\r\nthe agri-food industry, which is closely dependent on the former, maintain and\r\nincrease their competitiveness and their market shares on both the internal and\r\nexport markets, while ensuring that undertakings entered into by the EU in its\r\ninternational trade relations are met. However, European agriculture is faced\r\ntoday with a much more competitive environment, largely resulting from the\r\nglobalisation of markets. This trend should continue in the coming years with\r\nthe prospect of the Doha round and various bilateral and regional agreements\r\ncurrently under negotiation being concluded. Though often feared, these\r\nagreements might also give rise to major opportunities for the sector.\nNevertheless, on the internal market only a\r\nsmall minority of European consumers are aware of the efforts undertaken by\r\nEuropean farmers to supply high-quality, healthy and safe products. Only\r\n14 % of Europeans recognise the logos of products that benefit from a\r\nprotected designation of origin (PDO) or a protected geographical indication\r\n(PGI), these being the main European quality schemes established by the Union. The same goes for exports: the effort of investing in marketing and selling on\r\ndistant markets represents a challenge for a sector essentially made up of SMEs\r\nand indeed micro-enterprises.\nThis situation is without doubt a challenge\r\nfor European farmers, but it also opens up prospects which should be given\r\neffective support, in particular using CAP instruments.  This is because\r\nthe success of European farming will depend on its ability to increase its\r\nmarket shares and to enable the highly competitive food industry to maintain\r\nits prominent position in the EU in economic and trade terms.\nThis context calls for a modern and\r\nambitious policy of promotion, one which learns from the lessons of the\r\npromotional programmes implemented to date and which represents an additional\r\nstage in the modernisation of the CAP. The objective is to support agriculture,\r\nand especially the SMEs and producer organisations which form the backbone of\r\nthis sector, so that they can make a strong and dynamic contribution to\r\nEuropean growth for the Union as a whole, and in particular for its rural\r\nareas. This requires a policy of promotion which is restructured for its\r\nbeneficiaries (producer, professional and inter-professional organisations,\r\nboth at national and European level), which is bolstered in terms of the\r\nresources available to it, and which distinguishes in terms of its approach\r\nbetween the internal market and third-country markets.\nThis proposal, which provides for a gradual\r\nbut significant increase in the budget allocated to promotion measures, will be\r\nfinanced from appropriations already earmarked for the EU's Common Agricultural\r\nPolicy for the period 2014-2020. This expenditure is estimated on the basis of\r\nthe opportunities to be seized in third countries as a result of growing\r\ndemand, e.g. in Asia where, by 2050, for ASEAN[2]\r\nmember countries alone, agricultural imports are expected to increase by over\r\n17 billion dollars[3].\nAs well as growing demand from emerging\r\nmarkets in particular, which are already very important for the EU's agri-food\r\nexports, our access to markets will improve globally with the conclusion of the\r\nnumerous trade negotiations that are currently under way. The free-trade\r\nagreements currently being negotiated represent markets with a present value of\r\naround \u20ac 35 billion per year for the European agri-food sector. The\r\nacceleration in demand and liberalisation of substantially all trade through\r\nthese negotiations will probably make it possible for this figure to be very\r\nsignificantly increased.\u00a0 For example, by 2027 an ambitious free-trade\r\nagreement with the United States could increase the EU's agricultural exports\r\nby around 15 % (over \u20ac 1.7 billion per year) and its exports of\r\nprocessed agricultural products by 45 % (over \u20ac 13.4 billion per\r\nyear)[4].\r\nAn ambitious free-trade agreement with Japan could increase agri-food exports\r\nby 137 % in the long term (over \u20ac 5.9 billion per year)[5].\nThis is therefore a strategic and pivotal\r\nopportunity for the European agri-food sector that should, given the importance\r\nof European SMEs in this sector, be seized through an ambitious and innovative\r\npolicy. These enterprises need support, expertise and encouragement to exploit\r\nthis major opportunity. This requires a far-reaching public policy, equal to\r\nthis opportunity. The amounts included in this proposal will enable this policy\r\nto be established in a credible fashion in the coming years.\nBackground\nThe Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)\r\nenables the potential of the European agricultural and agri-food sector to be\r\nreleased and exploited. A reform is under way which will ensure, after 2013,\r\nthat this policy feeds directly into the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart,\r\nsustainable and inclusive growth by promoting an agricultural sector which\r\ndelivers food security, a sustainable use of natural resources and more dynamic\r\nrural areas. In parallel, reform of the policy for information provision and\r\npromotion measures for agricultural products, one of the instruments of the\r\nCAP, is also needed. \nAs a CAP tool, the European policy for the promotion of agricultural\r\nproducts must pursue the objectives of CAP reform up to 2020, and more\r\nparticularly the objective of strengthening the competitiveness of European\r\nagriculture both on the internal market and in third countries, focussing on\r\nthe following specific goals:\n\u2013                        \r\nIncreasing the level of awareness among consumers\r\nof the merits of European agricultural products;\n\u2013                        \r\nDeveloping and opening up new markets for\r\nEuropean agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries;\n\u2013                        \r\nEnhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of\r\nthe policy.\nIn the CAP context, Union support relating\r\nto information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products has\r\nevolved. Before 2000, information provision and promotion measures were\r\norganised at sectoral level. In 2000 the sectoral measures were merged together\r\nto form a horizontal scheme. From 2000 to 2007, these activities were governed\r\nby two distinct Regulations, one relating to the internal market and the other\r\ntargeting third countries[6].\r\nSince 2008, these two approaches have been merged into a single horizontal scheme\r\n(Council Regulation (EC) No 3/2008[7]\r\nand Commission Regulation (EC) No 501/2008[8]),\r\nbut without any significant changes to their content.\nObjectives of the proposal\nThis proposal enables information provision\r\nand promotion measures necessary for the agricultural sector to be able to rise\r\nto the many challenges it faces in a context of growing competition and\r\nopening-up of markets to be implemented on the internal market and in third\r\ncountries. The success of European agriculture will depend on its ability to\r\nincrease its market shares and enable the highly competitive food industry\r\nsector to maintain an important position in the EU\u2019s trade and economy (with\r\nthe food chain accounting for 6 % of the Union's gross domestic product\r\n(GDP)).\nMeasures will follow a European information\r\nand promotion strategy which identifies priorities on markets and products or\r\nmessages to be highlighted (e.g. products with high added value), while taking\r\naccount of free trade agreement negotiations and the most profitable markets\r\nand avoiding a fragmentation and dispersion of funding. A rebalancing of\r\nmeasures targeting third countries is also expected with this proposal.\nIn order to raise the number and quality of\r\nmeasures in a manner that is consistent with the 2020 CAP reform, which\r\nencourages farmers to organise themselves, the scheme should be opened up to\r\nnew beneficiaries, such as producer organisations. \nThe best return on investment should also\r\nbe sought for these measures, and strict guidelines should be established as regards\r\nthe possibilities of mentioning the origin of products or brand names as a\r\nmeans of illustrating the main generic message highlighting the intrinsic\r\ncharacteristics of European agricultural products.\nThe programmes submitted by operators from\r\ndifferent Member States make a substantial contribution to European added\r\nvalue. They promote the diversity of European agricultural products and will be\r\nencouraged as part of the reform.\nCommission initiatives, such as high-level\r\ntrade missions or participation in international trade fairs, help open up new\r\nmarkets to European agricultural products. \nThe proposal includes the development of\r\nnew technical support services for stakeholders which favour the exchange of\r\ninformation on information provision and promotion measures or good practices\r\nand allow their expertise to be developed. \nIt also aims to simplify the management of\r\nthe information and promotion policy. It proposes that the Commission should be\r\nmore active in managing multi-country programmes, thereby making it easier for\r\nthem to be set up and implemented. The respective roles of the Member State and the Commission in terms of monitoring and control must be clarified in\r\norder to avoid duplication and lengthy procedures. It is proposed that\r\nselection should take place solely at Commission level. \nFinally, all action will be accompanied by\r\na systematic impact assessment in order to confirm that the goals set have\r\nindeed been achieved. An evaluation framework will be set up to gauge how the\r\npromotion policy is performing using a common set of indicators linked to its\r\nstrategic objectives, in keeping with the common monitoring and evaluation\r\nframework of the CAP. \nEU Added Value\nAgricultural policy is a European policy.\r\nInstead of having 28 separate agricultural policies, the Member States pool\r\ntheir resources in order to pursue a European policy with a common\r\nbudget. Agriculture is the only sector governed by a common policy with\r\ncommon rules - including on the matter of promotion - laid down by the Treaty.\r\nThe ongoing reform of the CAP must impact on all the tools making up this\r\npolicy.\nIn particular, in an internal market any\r\naction at EU level will have an important leverage effect in terms of (a)\r\nmaking it easier to set up generic information programmes which, by their very\r\nnature, are rarely implemented by the Member States or companies, particularly\r\nin the current context of economic crisis, and (b) implementing multi-country\r\nprogrammes which will give rise to an exchange of experiences between Member States\r\nand to economies of scale.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nStakeholder consultation \nInterested parties have been widely\r\nconsulted. A Green Paper launched by the Commission on 14 July 2011 initiated a\r\ndebate the results of which were announced at a Conference on the promotion of\r\nEuropean agriculture organised by the Polish Presidency in November 2011. The\r\nCouncil adopted conclusions on the Green Paper at its meeting in December 2011.\r\nOn 20 November 2012, the European Parliament adopted a resolution further\r\nto the adoption of a communication on the subject by the Commission.\r\nConsultations also took place within the Advisory Committee on Promotion and\r\nwithin a CAP simplification experts' group at meetings in March 2012. \nAssessment of the current arrangements\nAn assessment commissioned by the European\r\nCommission and carried out by an external consultant was published in January\r\n2012. It provided an overall and independent evaluation of the current scheme.\r\nIt examined the relevance and effectiveness of the EU's information and\r\npromotion policy for agricultural products in the light of the objectives set\r\nout in Council Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 and its consistency with other\r\npromotion measures applied under the CAP. The analysis covered the period\r\n2002-2010. \nImpact assessment\nBy evaluating the current policy framework\r\nand analysing future challenges and needs, the impact assessment assesses and\r\ncompares the impact of three alternative scenarios. These reform scenarios were\r\ndeveloped in line with three distinguishing factors which emerged from the\r\npublic debate and the positions adopted by the various stakeholders, i.e.\r\ntarget market(s), the existence or not of a European promotion strategy and,\r\nfinally, the rules on private brands and the origin of products. Three\r\nscenarios were formulated as food for thought in the decision-making process:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The \u2018improved status quo\u2019\r\nscenario involves a limited adjustment of the promotion policy. It recognises\r\nthe policy's added value and seeks to remedy identified weaknesses with a view\r\nto simplifying the policy and making it more accessible, enabling beneficiaries\r\nto make the most of the tools offered, and to back them up with suitable\r\ntechnical support.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The \u2018targeted\u2019 scenario, in\r\naddition to what is offered by the improved status quo, ensures better\r\ntargeting of promotion measures on the internal and external markets through\r\nthe development and implementation of a strategy. It also encourages\r\ncollaboration between operators in the various Member States (by means of\r\ndirectly managed multi-country programmes). The strategy will also allow the\r\nrange of products and themes eligible under the promotion scheme to be widened.\r\nFinally, this scenario involves better use of indications of the origin of\r\nproducts and brand names (e.g. \"banner\" brands).\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The \u2018exclusive to third\r\ncountries\u2019 scenario shares the same level of performance ambition as the\r\n\u2018targeted\u2019 scenario but concentrates solely on third countries, whereby\r\npromotion measures are managed directly by the Commission in compliance with a\r\nselection strategy. The improvements proposed by the \u2018improved status quo\u2019\r\nscenario are also included in this scenario. In addition, over and above\r\ngeneric promotion, marketing activities for individual private brands would\r\nalso be eligible under the scheme and could involve an extended list of\r\nproducts and themes.\nWhile the \u2018improved\u2019 status quo scenario\r\nappears not to be targeted sufficiently at measures with high added value for\r\nthe European Union, and the \u2018exclusive to third countries\u2019 scenario appears too\r\nrisky given the low level of awareness of agricultural products in Europe, the\r\n\u2018targeted\u2019 scenario emerges from the impact analysis as being the most balanced\r\nscenario for the purposes of defining the outline of a promotion scheme which\r\nis more targeted towards the economic growth needs of agricultural sectors and\r\nmarkets but which, at the same time, improves the level of awareness among\r\nEuropean consumers confronted with an increasingly vast array of products. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management of the scheme \nThe scheme is at present managed on the\r\nbasis of shared management (main expenditure linked to the implementation of\r\nprogrammes) and direct management (information provision and promotion measures\r\nat the Commission's initiative). The current Regulation should lead to a\r\ngeneral and significant increase in the number of measures implemented and thus\r\nto an increase in expenditure subject to shared management and direct\r\nmanagement alike, with a sizeable increase in the share of directly managed\r\nmeasures following the shift towards this type of management for multi-country\r\nprogrammes with the aim of encouraging their implementation.\nOn the basis of a cost/efficiency analysis,\r\nthe Commission is able to decide to delegate programme management in full or in\r\npart to an executive agency, subject to compliance with Article 62 of\r\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[9].\r\nIn the Commission's Communication entitled \u2018A budget for European 2020\u2019[10], the Commission proposed that\r\nit should exploit the possibility of making greater use of existing executive\r\nagencies. \nIn this context, and in accordance with\r\nArticle 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003[11] and Article 6(g) of Regulation\r\n(EU) No xxx/xxxx on the financing, management and monitoring of the common\r\nagricultural policy[12]\r\n[CAP Horizontal Regulation], the Commission intends to outsource certain tasks\r\nrelating to the direct management of information provision and promotion\r\nprogrammes, including for multi-country programmes, and the assessment of\r\nproposals for simple programmes to an existing executive agency with the aim of\r\nproviding a better-quality service and enhancing the EU's visibility in its\r\ninformation and promotion activities for agricultural products.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nLegal basis\nThe proposal is based on Articles 42 and 43\r\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. \nSubsidiarity and proportionality\r\nprinciples\n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe EU promotion and information policy\r\nusefully supplements and reinforces the schemes run by Member States by\r\nboosting the image of products in the eyes of consumers in the EU and in third\r\ncountries, in particular as regards the quality, nutritional value and safety of\r\nfoodstuffs and the methods of production. By helping to open up new markets in\r\nthird countries, such action is also likely to have a multiplier effect on\r\nnational and private initiatives.\nThe proposal falls under shared competence\r\nbetween the EU and the Member States and complies with the subsidiarity\r\nprinciple.\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle \nDue to the increasing liberalisation of\r\ntrade, including trade in agricultural and food products, the trade between EU\r\nMember States and third countries is growing in scale. In this context, and in\r\nview of the CAP's market-oriented approach, the regulation on information\r\nprovision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal\r\nmarket and in third countries is therefore a crucial instrument that is consistent\r\nwith the new framework of the WTO Agreement on agriculture.\nIt also naturally falls to the EU to\r\npromote the high quality standards of EU agricultural products and to encourage\r\njoint promotional programmes involving more than one EU country or more than\r\none agricultural sector. \nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nCompared to the present situation, the\r\nproposal gradually but significantly increases the budget allocated to\r\ninformation provision and promotion measures for agricultural products (from\r\n\u20ac 61.5 million in the 2013 budget to \u20ac 200 million in\r\n2020). Details of the proposal's financial impact can be found in the financial\r\nstatement.\nThe proposal relating to the 2014-20\r\nMultiannual Financial Framework (MFF) includes the amounts of direct payments\r\nand market-related expenditure for the first pillar of the CAP.\u00a0 As a\r\nprecaution, the Commission has taken account of the conclusions of the European\r\nCouncil of 8 February 2013 concerning the MFF. Subject to the\r\nadoption of the MMF Regulation, information provision and promotion measures\r\nwill be funded within the amounts agreed by the European Council.\n2013/0398 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non information provision and promotion\r\nmeasures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third\r\ncountries \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 42 and 43(2)\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[13], \nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[14],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 3/2008[15],\r\nthe Union may implement information provision and promotion measures on the internal\r\nmarket and in third countries for agricultural products and their production\r\nmethods and for certain food products based on agricultural products. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The aim of these measures\r\nis to enhance the competitiveness of European agriculture in both the internal market\r\nand third countries by increasing consumers' awareness of the merits of the\r\nUnion's agricultural products and food products based on agricultural products\r\nand developing and opening up new markets. They usefully complement and\r\nreinforce the measures implemented by the Member States. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the experience\r\ngained and likely trends in the agricultural sector and on markets both inside\r\nand outside the Union, the scheme established by Regulation (EC) No 3/2008\r\nshould be reviewed and made more coherent and effective. Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 3/2008 should therefore be repealed and replaced with a new regulation.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to comply with\r\nthe competition rules, measures targeting the internal market should be limited\r\nto providing information on the specific characteristics of agricultural\r\nproduction methods in the Union or on themes which are relevant to the Union,\r\nsuch as the European quality systems established by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[16].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures are also required\r\nto enhance the authenticity of Union products so as to improve consumers'\r\nawareness as to the qualities of genuine products as compared to imitations and\r\ncounterfeit products; this would contribute significantly to awareness in the\r\nUnion and third countries alike of the symbols, indications and abbreviations\r\ndemonstrating participation in the European quality schemes established by\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1151/2012.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union exports mainly final\r\nagricultural products, including agricultural products not included in Annex I\r\nto the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\u2018the Treaty\u2019). The\r\ninformation and promotion scheme should therefore be opened up to certain food\r\nproducts based on agricultural products, in line with other schemes coming\r\nunder the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), such as the European quality\r\nschemes, which already provide for mechanisms which are open to such products.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's information\r\nprovision and promotion measures relating to wine are one of the landmarks of\r\nthe aid programmes available to the wine sector under the CAP. Consequently, the eligibility\r\nof wine for the information provision and promotion measures provided for under\r\nthis scheme should be limited solely to wine which is associated with another\r\nagricultural or food product.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the period 2001-11,\r\nbarely 30 % of the budget earmarked for information provision and\r\npromotion measures under Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 was spent on measures\r\ntargeting third-country markets, even though these markets offer major growth\r\npotential. With the aim of reaching 75 % of estimated expenditure,\r\nspecific arrangements are therefore required to encourage a larger number of\r\ninformation provision and promotion measures for Union agricultural products in\r\nthird countries, in particular through increased financial support\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to guarantee the\r\nimpact of the information provision and promotion measures that are\r\nimplemented, these should be developed in the context of information and\r\npromotion programmes. Such programmes have hitherto been submitted by\r\nprofessional or inter-professional organisations. In order to increase the\r\nnumber and raise the quality of the measures proposed, the range of\r\nbeneficiaries should be widened to include producer organisations. Moreover,\r\nthe Commission must be able to supplement programmes by implementing measures\r\nat its own initiative, particularly with a view to contributing to the\r\nopening-up of new markets.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The information provision\r\nand promotion measures co-financed by the Union should endow them with a\r\nspecific European dimension. To that end, and in order to avoid a dispersion of\r\nresources and increase Europe's visibility through these information provision\r\nand promotion measures for agricultural products, it is necessary to establish\r\na work programme which defines the strategic priorities for these measures in\r\nterms of populations, products, themes or markets to be targeted and the nature\r\nof the information and promotion messages to be imparted. The Commission will\r\ntake particular account of the predominant position of small and\r\nmedium-enterprises in the agri-food sector, a sector which benefits from the\r\nexceptional measures provided for in Articles 154, 155 and 156 of Regulation\r\n(EU) XXX/20... [of the European Parliament and of the Council of ...\r\nestablishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products\r\n(Single CMO Regulation) (COM(2011)626)] and from free-trade agreements coming\r\nunder the commercial policy of the European Union for measures targeting third\r\ncountries.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\r\ninformation provision and promotion measures are implemented effectively, they\r\nshould be entrusted to duly selected implementing bodies.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over and above the\r\ninformation provision and promotion measures, the Commission needs to develop\r\nand coordinate technical and support services at European level with the aim of\r\nhelping operators take part in co-financed programmes, conduct effective\r\ncampaigns or develop their export activities.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The information provision\r\nand promotion measures for agricultural products that are co-financed by the Union shall not be oriented to commercial brands or to their specific origin. Nevertheless,\r\nthe indication of brands or origin might have a leverage effect in the context\r\nof promotion measures, particularly in third countries. While respecting\r\nspecific conditions to be established, in particular rights to the protection\r\nof intellectual property, it should therefore be possible to give greater\r\nvisibility to brands and origin and, at the same time, maintain a proper\r\nbalance with the highlighting of generic messages focussed on the intrinsic\r\ncharacteristics of the Union's agricultural products and food products based on\r\nagricultural products.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union is keen to simplify\r\nthe regulatory environment of the CAP. This approach should also be applied to\r\nthe Regulation on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural\r\nproducts. In particular, the principles of administrative management of\r\ninformation and promotion programmes should be reviewed with the aim of\r\nsimplifying them and enabling the Commission to establish the rules and\r\nprocedures applicable to the submission and selection of proposals for\r\nprogrammes.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cooperation between\r\neconomic operators in different Member States contributes greatly to increasing\r\nEuropean added value and to highlighting the diversity of European agricultural\r\nproducts. Despite the priority given to programmes developed jointly by\r\nproposing organisations in different Member States, the latter accounted in the\r\nperiod 2001-11 for only 16 % of the budget earmarked for information\r\nprovision and promotion measures under Regulation (EC) No 3/2008. New\r\narrangements should accordingly be introduced, particularly as regards the budgetary\r\nmanagement, in order to overcome existing obstacles to implementation. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financing rules should be\r\nset. As a general rule, so that interesting proposing organisations assume\r\ntheir responsibilities, the Union should cover only part of the cost of\r\nprogrammes. Certain administrative and staff costs which are not linked to\r\nimplementation of the CAP form an integral part of information provision and\r\npromotion measures and could be eligible for Union funding.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each measure should be\r\nsubject to monitoring and evaluation in order to improve its quality and\r\ndemonstrate its achievements. In this context a list of indicators should be\r\ndetermined and the impact of the promotion policy assessed in relation to its\r\nstrategic objectives. The Commission should establish a monitoring and\r\nevaluation framework for this policy which is consistent with the common\r\nmonitoring and evaluation framework of the CAP.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\r\ncoherence, effectiveness and sound management of the measures provided for in\r\nthis Regulation as well as the efficient use of Union funding, the Commission\r\nshould be delegated the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290\r\nof the Treaty as regards the specific conditions of brand visibility and the\r\nindication of product origin, the criteria for determining the eligibility of\r\nproposing organisations, the conditions governing competitive tendering between\r\nimplementing organisations and the conditions according to which the proposing\r\norganisation may be authorised to implement certain parts of the programme\r\nitself and, finally, the specific conditions determining the eligibility of the\r\ncosts of information provision and promotion measures for simple programmes. It\r\nis of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations\r\nduring its preparatory work, including using external experts.\r\nWhen preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, the Commission will ensure a\r\nsimultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the\r\nEuropean Parliament and to the Council. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate a\r\nsmooth transition from the system established by Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 3/2008 to the system established by this Regulation, the power to adopt\r\nacts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the\r\nCommission in respect of establishing transitional provisions between\r\nRegulation (EC) No 3/2008 and this Regulation. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\r\nuniform implementing conditions apply under this Regulation, the Commission\r\nshould be granted implementing powers for the purposes of adopting implementing\r\nacts concerning work programmes laying down strategic priorities, the selection\r\nof simple programmes. the implementing, monitoring and control arrangements of\r\nsimple programmes, the rules concerning the conclusion of contracts for the\r\nimplementation of simple programmes selected in accordance with this\r\nRegulation, and the common impact assessment framework for programmes. These\r\npowers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[17]. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve greater\r\nconsistency between the different promotion measures under the first pillar of\r\nthe CAP, it must be ensured that existing information provision and promotion\r\nmeasures coming under Regulation (EU) No \u2026/20\u2026 [COM(2011)626] of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council [18]\r\nare compatible with the strategic priorities to be defined at horizontal level\r\non the basis of this Regulation.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the links that exist\r\nbetween the promotion policy and the other instruments of the CAP, the\r\nobjectives of this Regulation may be more effectively achieved at Union level\r\nowing to the multiannual guarantee of Union funding and its concentration on\r\nclearly defined priorities. This Regulation is therefore consistent with the\r\nprinciple of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European\r\nUnion. Since the scope of this Regulation is limited to what is necessary in\r\norder to achieve its objectives, it also respects the principle of proportionality\r\nset out in Article 5(4) of that Treaty.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nChapter I\nGENERAL\r\nPROVISIONS\nArticle 1 \nPurpose \nInformation provision and promotion\r\nmeasures for agricultural products and certain food products based on\r\nagricultural products (hereinafter referred to as \u2018information provision and\r\npromotion measures\u2019) implemented on the internal market or in third countries\r\nmay be fully or partially financed from the Union budget under the conditions\r\nset out in this Regulation. \nArticle 2\nMeasures on the internal market\nThe eligible measures on the internal\r\nmarket are as follows: \na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 information measures aimed at\r\nstressing the specific features of agricultural productions methods in the Union, particularly in terms of food safety, authenticity, nutritional and health aspects,\r\nanimal welfare or respect for the environment;\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 information measures on the\r\nthemes referred to in Article 5(4); \nArticle 3\nMeasures in third countries\nThe eligible measures in third-countries\r\nare as follows: \na) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 information measures aimed at\r\nstressing the characteristics of agricultural and food products and on the\r\nthemes referred to in Article 5(4);\nb) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 promotion measures aimed at\r\nincreasing sales of agricultural and food products from the EU.\nArticle 4 \nCharacteristics of the measures\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information provision and\r\npromotion measures shall not be brand-oriented.

Commission's\r\nmultiannual strategic objective(s) targeted by the proposal \nThe proposal aims to promote the efficient use of resources with a\r\nview to ensuring smart, sustainable growth for EU agriculture in accordance\r\nwith the Europe 2020 strategy. \nAs a CAP tool, the European policy for the promotion of agricultural\r\nproducts pursues the objectives of CAP reform up to 2020, and more particularly\r\nthe objective of strengthening the competitiveness of the agricultural sector\r\nboth on the internal market and in third countries.\n1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific

overall\r\nstrategy allowing it to respond in a targeted and effective way to economic\r\nopportunities in third countries relating, for example, to free-trade\r\nagreements and to the need for information on the merits of European\r\nagricultural products.\nThe promotion strategy will define messages to be imparted,\r\nhighlighting the specific elements of the CAP, including its sustainable\r\nproduction methods and quality schemes.\nIn terms of jobs, the impact will be linked to the expected economic\r\nrepercussions, but this proposal should contribute to maintaining jobs in the\r\nagricultural and food sectors, especially in SMEs (by dint of the priority\r\nwhich the strategy gives to them), which account for 99 % of agri-food\r\nbusinesses and 63 % of jobs in this sector.\nAn increase in the number of programmes involving organisations from\r\ndifferent EU countries (\u2018multi-country programmes\u2019) with high European added\r\nvalue is expected as a result of the simplification of selection and management\r\nto be achieved at Commission level, without Member States being involved at an\r\nintermediate stage.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of

For example, in the period\r\n2000-12, world agricultural prices increased by 82 % while energy prices\r\nwent up by 261 % and fertiliser prices by 286 %, with the sector\r\nfacing the highest level of volatility in any of the last three decades;\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A low level of awareness of the merits of EU\r\nagricultural products, especially on the internal market. For example, the\r\nmajority of Europeans consider that the EU's main priority in terms of\r\nagricultural and rural development policy is to ensure that agricultural\r\nproducts are good-quality, healthy and safe. At the same time, only 14 %\r\nof Europeans recognise the PDO[31]/PGI[32] logos, which make up one of\r\nthe main European quality schemes established by the Union.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nThe common agricultural policy is a genuine European policy. Instead\r\nof having 28 separate agricultural policies, the Member States pool their\r\nresources in order to pursue a European policy with a common budget and common\r\nrules, including on the matter of promotion. In particular, in an internal\r\nmarket any action at EU level will have an important leverage effect in terms\r\nof (a) making it easier to set up generic information programmes which, by\r\ntheir very nature, are rarely implemented by the Member States or companies,\r\nparticularly in the current context of economic crisis, and (b) implementing\r\nmulti-country programmes which will give rise to an exchange of experiences\r\nbetween Member States and to economies of scale.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nInformation provision and promotion measures have always formed part\r\nof the CAP. Since 1999, the CAP has been specifically supporting information\r\nprovision and promotion measures within the European agricultural and\r\nagri-foods sectors on the internal market and in third countries on the basis\r\nof a horizontal scheme for providing information on and promoting agricultural\r\nproducts.\nThere are several indications that a European promotion policy plays\r\na positive role, ultimately enabling European agricultural producers to be\r\nrewarded for their efforts in complying with the high standards required by the\r\nCAP:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2009, the European Court of Auditors audited the scheme,\r\nfocussing on the effectiveness of information provision and promotion measures\r\nand on the regularity of expenditure. The Court is favourably disposed to the\r\nscheme, even if it is difficult to quantify its impact[33];\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The conclusions of the evaluation of the scheme also\r\nallowed an assessment to be made of the current scheme[34];\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although coming under a different public policy, a\r\ncost-benefit analysis of the market development programmes managed by the USDA\r\nconcluded that US agricultural exports are increased by USD 35 for each\r\nadditional dollar spent via these promotion programmes, and that cutting the\r\npublic promotion budget by 50 % would result in agricultural exports\r\nfalling by an estimated USD 9 billion. Without being able to\r\nguarantee the value of these figures, it is interesting to note their clearly\r\npositive nature in confirming the positive value of public policies of\r\nsupporting information provision and promotion measures for agricultural\r\nproducts[35].\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nWhile taking account of the specific characteristics of different\r\nsectors, the proposal sets out to enhance the synergies between this horizontal\r\npromotion scheme and the various sectoral arrangements existing under the CAP\r\nby means of the promotion strategy and the development of a common identity,\r\nincluding as regards visual elements and content, for all promotions measures.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal with a limited duration\r\n\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal in force from ... to ... \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from ... to ... \nX \u00a0Proposal of unlimited\r\nduration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period in: (See\r\n3.2.1 below)\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) planned[36] \nX Direct management by the\r\nCommission\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 By its departments, including by its staff in the Union\r\ndelegations; \n\u2013     \r\nX\u00a0 by the executive agencies \nX \u00a0Shared management with the\r\nMember States \n\u00a8 Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 international organisations and their agencies (please specify);\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial\r\nRegulation;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the\r\nextent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\r\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic\r\nact.\n\u2013       If more than one management mode is\r\nindicated, please provide details in the \"Comments\" section.\nComments \nThe scheme\r\nis at present managed on the basis of shared management (main expenditure\r\nlinked to the implementation of programmes) and centralised direct management\r\n(information provision and promotion measures at the Commission's initiative). \nThe\r\nmanagement modes involved in the proposal are those of shared management and\r\ndirect management.\nIn\r\ncompliance with Article 3(4) of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003, the Commission\r\nintends to outsource certain tasks relating to the direct management of\r\ninformation provision and promotion measures, in particular for multi-country\r\nprogrammes, to an existing executive agency with the aim of providing a more\r\nefficient service and enhancing the EU's visibility in its information\r\nprovision and promotion measures for agricultural products.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nThe rules require that programmes be\r\nassessed. At present these assessments take place each year and are\r\nsupplemented by an overall assessment at the end of the programme. A common\r\nframework for assessing the impact of measures will be established in line with\r\nthe common monitoring and evaluation framework of the CAP.\nThe assessment of information\r\nprovision and promotion measures will be supplemented with regular external\r\nassessments of the scheme.\nThe Commission intends to submit a\r\nreport on the application of the scheme to Parliament and the Council by 31\r\nDecember [2020] at the latest.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\r\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThe horizontal information provision and promotion scheme for\r\nagricultural products has existed since 2000. It is regularly checked, and\r\nadjustments are made to monitoring and checking procedures whenever this is\r\ndeemed necessary. According to the compliance audits carried out by DG AGRI and\r\nthe audits of the European Court of Auditors, the main risks which have been\r\nidentified for information provision and promotion measures are linked to the\r\nintangible nature of some expenditure and the implementation of measures\r\noutside the EU's borders.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information concerning the\r\ninternal control system set up\nIn order to limit the risks, selection, implementation, monitoring,\r\nchecking and assessment procedures will be defined.\nIn particular, the Commission will establish procedures for\r\nselecting the best programmes and will convert them into legal instruments. It\r\nwill also establish specific conditions of eligibility with regard to the costs\r\nof measures and, depending on the nature of expenditure, will be able to apply\r\nlump sums, scales of costs, etc. It will also take account of the\r\nimplementation of programmes by specialised implementing bodies, some of which\r\nwill be outside the European Union. Checking procedures will be established\r\nregarding expenditure for each budget management mode.\nIn the case of shared management, the control framework will\r\nbe based on the common checking procedures for the CAP, as reviewed as part of\r\nthe reform (COM(2011)628), in particular as regards the statement of assurance\r\nto be provided each year by the head of each paying agency.\nIn the case of direct management, the grant control framework\r\nwill be based on the rules set out in the Financial Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\r\n966/2012, in particular as regards the implementation of the Commission's\r\ninternal control standards, ex ante controls on all statements, the\r\ncertification of cost methodologies and ex post audits of a sample of\r\nstatements.\nIn the context of outsourcing the management of the promotion\r\nprogramme, the Commission will also carry out the checks required on executive\r\nagencies under Article 65 of the Financial Regulation. It will monitor and\r\ncheck that the executive agency achieves appropriate control objectives for the\r\nactions that it will be entrusted to manage. Such monitoring will be provided\r\nfor in the cooperation arrangements between the parent Directorate-General and\r\nthe agency.\nThe Commission's checks will use a risk-based approach in order to\r\nensure that its audits target the areas of highest risk.\n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimate of the costs and\r\nbenefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \nInformation provision and promotion measures will always be covered\r\nby the existing management and control system for EAGF expenditure\nAs regards the cost of controls by the Member States, an analysis\r\nwas provided in Annex 8 of the impact analysis accompanying the legislative\r\nproposals concerning CAP reform (COM(2011)626). \nAs for the costs to the Commission, they will be higher than at\r\npresent owing to an increase in expenditure (including a doubling of current\r\nexpenditure under shared management) and, in particular, expenditure linked to\r\nprogrammes under direct management. \nThe direct management of multi programmes will be a new feature of\r\nthis scheme. Only an estimate based on the costs of checking programmes of the\r\nsame type would be possible. For example, one might cite programmes for the\r\ncompetitiveness of enterprises and SMEs (COM(2011)834).\nIt is not thought that the proposal will lead to an increase in the\r\nEAGF error rate.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\r\nand irregularities \nThe legislative package for CAP reform, in particular the proposal\r\nfor a Regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the common\r\nagricultural policy, envisages maintaining and reinforcing the current detailed\r\nsystems for controls and penalties to be applied by the paying agencies, with\r\ncommon basic features and special rules tailored to the specific\r\ncharacteristics of each aid scheme. The Regulation on the financing, management\r\nand monitoring of the CAP will also apply to the future Regulation on the\r\npromotion policy.\nThe checking systems generally provide for exhaustive administrative\r\ncontrols of 100 % of aid applications, cross-checks with other databases\r\nwhere this is considered appropriate as well as pre-payment on-the-spot checks\r\nof a minimum number of transactions, depending on the risk associated with the\r\nregime in question. If these on-the-spot checks reveal a high number of\r\nirregularities, additional checks must be carried out.\nThe legislative package for CAP reform further envisages that Member\r\nStates shall prevent, detect and correct irregularities and fraud, impose\r\neffective, dissuasive and proportionate penalties as laid down in Union\r\nlegislation or national law, and recover any irregular payments plus interest.\r\nIt includes an automatic clearance mechanism for irregularity cases, which\r\nprovides that if recovery has not taken place within four years of the date of the\r\nrecovery request, or within eight years in the case of legal proceedings, the\r\namounts not recovered shall be borne by the Member State concerned. This\r\nmechanism will be a strong incentive for Member States to recover irregular\r\npayments as quickly as possible. Moreover, as regards outsourced tasks relating\r\nto the management of the future promotion policy, the executive agency will be\r\nrequired to notify potential cases of fraud and irregularities to the\r\nCommission on a case-by-case basis and in the regular reports it publishes.\nA rigorous checking procedure is all the more important given that\r\nthe implementation of promotion measures is to be entrusted to implementing\r\nbodies with which only beneficiaries have a contractual link. Since the\r\nimplementing bodies are commercial entities that are entitled to make a profit,\r\nintensive action will have to be taken to ensure that measures are implemented\r\nregularly.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      Existing budget lines \nFollowing the order of multiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of the multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Designation \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026] || Diff./Non-Diff.
