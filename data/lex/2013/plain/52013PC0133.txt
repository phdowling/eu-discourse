Maritime\nsectors offer areas for innovation, sustainable growth and employment which\nshould contribute to this objective. In October 2012, European Ministers for\nMaritime affairs adopted the \"Limassol Declaration\" to back the\nEurope 2020 Strategy[1]\nwith a strong maritime pillar. As the Commission identified in the\nCommunication on Blue Growth, Opportunities for Marine and Maritime Sustainable\nGrowth[2],\nthe present legislative proposal is an essential part of this ambition to\ndevelop Europe's Blue Economy.\nHowever, increased use of coastal and maritime\nareas as well as climate change effects, natural hazards, erosion, also put\npressure on coastal and marine resources. They require integrated and coherent\nmanagement to secure sustainable growth and preserve coastal and marine\necosystems for future generations.\nMaritime spatial planning is commonly\nunderstood as a public process for analysing and planning the spatial and\ntemporal distribution of human activities in sea areas to achieve economic,\nenvironmental and social objectives. The ultimate aim of maritime spatial planning\nis to draw up plans to identify the utilisation of maritime space for different\nsea uses. In 2008 the Commission published its \u2018Roadmap for Maritime Spatial\nPlanning: Achieving Common Principles in the EU\u2019[3],\nfollowed by a 2010 Communication \u2018Maritime Spatial Planning in the EU \u2014\nAchievements and Future Development\u2019[4],\nwhich paved the way for the present proposal.\nIntegrated coastal management is a tool for\nthe integrated management of all policy processes affecting the coastal zone,\naddressing land-sea interactions of coastal activities in a coordinated way\nwith a view to ensuring the sustainable development of coastal and marine areas.\nIt ensures that management or development decisions are taken coherently across\nsectors. A 2002 Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management defines\nthe principles of sound coastal planning and management and how to best\nimplement them. The EU is also a contracting party to the Barcelona Convention,\nwhich established a Protocol on Integrated coastal management that entered into\nforce in March 2011. This Protocol makes integrated coastal management\ncompulsory for Member States bordering the Mediterranean Sea.\nMaritime spatial planning and integrated\ncoastal management are complementary tools. Their geographical scope overlaps\nin the coastal and territorial waters of Member States, where maritime spatial\nplans will map existing human activities and identify their most effective\nfuture spatial development, while integrated coastal management strategies\nensure the integrated management of these human activities. Applied jointly,\nthey both improve sea-land interface planning and management.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for and objectives\nof the proposal\nThe main purpose of the proposed directive\nis to promote the sustainable growth of maritime and coastal activities and the\nsustainable use of coastal and marine resources by establishing a framework for\nthe effective implementation of maritime spatial planning in EU waters and integrated\ncoastal management in the coastal areas of Member States.\nThe increasing and uncoordinated use of\ncoastal and maritime areas results in competition for maritime and coastal space\nand inefficient and unsustainable use of marine and coastal resources.\nUncertainties and lack of predictability on appropriate access to the maritime\nspace has created a suboptimal business climate for investors, with potential\njob losses.\nEnsuring the optimal distribution of\nmaritime space among relevant stakeholders and the coordinated management of\ncoastal zones is essential to enable concurrent activities to achieve their full\npotential. It has been shown to lower exploratory research, transaction,\nadministrative and operating costs and to increase legal certainty particularly\nfor SME's.\nTo ensure the sustainability and\nenvironmental health of these various uses, maritime spatial planning and integrated\ncoastal management will have to employ an ecosystem-based approach that ensures\nthe protection of the natural resources that provide the basis for carrying out\nthe various activities.\nThe proposed action therefore is not\nsector-specific, but covers all policy areas of the Treaty on the Functioning\nof the European Union (TFEU) with an impact on coasts, seas and oceans. It\nsupports on-going implementation of sea-related policies in Member States through\nmore efficient coordination and increased transparency. Maritime spatial plans and integrated coastal management strategies\ncan also, at an early stage, improve the articulation of and reduce conflicts\nbetween economic objectives and environmental legislation. \nThe operational objectives of the Directive\nare procedural in nature. Member States will be required to develop and\nimplement coherent processes to plan human uses of maritime space and to ensure\nthe sustainable management of coastal areas, and to establish appropriate\ncross-border cooperation among them. A key added value of the proposal is\nsupport for land-sea connectivity by requiring coherence between maritime spatial\nplanning and integrated coastal management.\nPlanning details and the determination of\nmanagement objectives are left to Member States. The EU will not take part in\nthese processes. The proposal does not interfere with Member States\u2019\nprerogatives for town and country planning (terrestrial planning).\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with other policies\nEuropean legislators have adopted ambitious\npolicy initiatives relevant for the oceans, seas and coasts, to be implemented\nin the next 10 to 20 years. These initiatives include the Marine Strategy\nFramework Directive[5],\nthe Renewable Energy Directive[6],\nand the Motorways of the Sea initiative[7] and the Habitats Directive[8]. The EU is expected to adopt a reformed Common Fisheries Policy and,\nunder the new financial perspectives, revised structural funds (the Common Strategic\nFramework) in 2013. The main aim of this proposal is to facilitate the coherent\nand sustainable implementation of these initiatives through an integrated\nprocess or processes. The present proposal does not change or modify the acquis\nfor any policy area under the TFEU. \nIn particular, there are opportunities for\nthe Member States to improve effective implementation and reduce administrative\nburden when implementing maritime spatial plans and integrated coastal\nmanagement strategies by applying the acquis in an integrated way. \nThe assessment of environmental effects of maritime\nspatial plans and integrated coastal management strategies must be carried out\nin accordance with the provisions of Directive 2001/42/EC.[9] Such a strategic environmental\nassessment will ensure a holistic consideration of the\nimpacts, including cumulative ones, from the various human activities at an\nearly stage and therefor facilitate the implementation of future projects. If subsequently environment impact assessments become necessary for\nindividual projects, the specific assessment will be able to draw on the\nanalyses already carried out under the strategic environmental planning and\ntherefor avoiding duplication of assessments and related administrative burden.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Public consultation\nThe European Commission organised a public\nconsultation from March until May 2011 to gather input from stakeholders on the\nstatus and future of maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal\nmanagement in the European Union.\nThe results confirmed that conflicts in the\nuse of sea space are becoming more frequent, and supported a common approach\nfor implementing maritime spatial planning in EU waters, bearing in mind the\nparticularities of each region. Ensuring the appropriate coordination of MSP\nprocesses with integrated coastal management strategies was considered\nimportant. While EU action on cross-border issues was seen as particularly\nuseful, there was no clear answer as to the best choice of instrument.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nThe Impact Assessment (IA) assessed the\neffectiveness and the economic, environmental and social impacts of the\nfollowing three options: (1) guidance and development of best practice, (2) non-binding\nmeasures, and (3) legally binding measures, including a \u2018framework-type\u2019\nDirective or Regulation.\nThe IA concluded that even though\nnon-binding options offer some advantages, a legally binding approach by means\nof a Directive is the most appropriate instrument which can ensure predictability,\nstability, and transparency of maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal\nmanagement, while safeguarding proportionality and subsidiarity by leaving the\nflexibility for implementation to Member State and not interfering with Member\nState competences. A Directive is also the most appropriate option to guarantee\nthat timelines for implementation are coherent with the timeframes of other\nrelevant EU legislation and policy initiatives (e.g. Renewable Energy\nDirective, Marine Strategy Framework Directive, Europe 2020 targets, etc.) and\nto foster growth of economic activities at sea in a context of increased\ncompetition for space.\nThe IA Board delivered its final opinion on\nthe impact assessment on 30 April 2012. The Impact Assessment Report and an\nExecutive Summary are published with the present proposal along with the\nopinion of the Impact Assessment Board.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of the proposed action\nThe proposal establishes a framework for maritime\nspatial planning and integrated coastal management in the form of a systematic,\ncoordinated, inclusive and trans-boundary approach to integrated maritime\ngovernance. It obliges Member States to carry out maritime spatial planning and\nintegrated coastal management in accordance with national and international\nlaw. The aim of the action is for Member States to establish a process or\nprocesses that cover the full cycle of problem identification, information\ncollection, planning, decision-making, management, monitoring of implementation,\nand stakeholder participation. \nThe maritime spatial plans and integrated\ncoastal management strategies will not set new sectorial policy targets. They have\nthe purpose to reflect, integrate and link the objectives defined by national\nor regional sectorial policies, to identify steps to prevent or alleviate conflicts\nbetween different sectors and to contribute to the achievement of the Union's\nobjectives in marine and coastal related sectorial policies. Most importantly,\nthe proposal requires Member State action to aim for coherence of management\nacross sea basins, through trans-boundary cooperation in the same marine region\nor sub-region and related coastal zone and appropriate data collection and\nexchange.\nImplementing acts will ensure consistent\nimplementation of the Directive throughout the EU and facilitate reporting from\nthe Member States to the Commission and, where relevant, the exchange of data\nbetween Member States and with the Commission. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe proposal supports the implementation of\nthe EU\u2019s Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP), including the Marine Strategy\nFramework Directive as its environmental pillar. The objective of the IMP is to\nensure that the sectoral policies of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union (TFEU) that have a bearing on the maritime space are implemented\nin a coherent way so as to achieve multiple concurrent objectives of an economic,\nsocial and environmental nature.\nThe proposal is based on Articles 43(2),\n100(2), 192(1) and 194(2) TFEU. Activities covered by these policies compete\nfor maritime space and the use of coastal resources. The processes to be set up\nshould aim to ensure that the activities envisaged in each sector can be\nimplemented without detriment to one other so as to achieve their individual\naims while jointly contributing to the sustainable growth of maritime and\ncoastal economies and the sustainable use of marine and coastal resources. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle and\nadded value\nThe proposal is in conformity with the\nsubsidiarity principle set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union\n(TEU). Issues such as the choice of actual developments, location of\ninvestment, priority setting and determining solutions are a matter for\nnational or local decision-making. The planning process as such should be\ncarried out by authorities in the Member States in accordance with their\nnational governance and constitutional structures, national sectorial policy\npriorities and, to the greatest possible extent, build on existing mechanisms\nand policies.\nEU Action is of added value to (1) ensure\nand streamline Member State action on maritime spatial planning and integrated\ncoastal management to guarantee consistent and coherent implementation across\nthe EU and to (2). ensure a framework for co-operation between Member States on\nmaritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management that share marine\nregions and sub-regions Cross-border co-operation on maritime spatial planning\nand integrated coastal management in EU marine regions and sub-regions is\nessential as marine ecosystems, fishing grounds, marine protected areas as well\nas maritime infrastructures, such as cables, pipelines, shipping lanes, oil,\ngas and wind installations, etc. run across national borders. \n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\nThe proposal is in conformity with the\nproportionality principle set out in Article 5(4) TEU.\nThe proposal is limited to obliging Member\nStates to set up or maintain a process or processes for maritime spatial planning\nand integrated coastal management. It establishes a set of minimum requirements\nfor these processes, building on existing experience in Member States and enabling\ntheir incorporation and continuation under a common EU framework.\nReporting requirements are kept to a\nminimum necessary to assess its implementation. The Commission will ensure that\nmaximum use will be made of existing reporting requirements. The Commission will use the information reported by the Member\nStates and any other relevant information available through EU legislation\nincluding Article 19(3) of Directive 2008/56/EC, to inform the European\nParliament and the Council on progress made in implementing this Directive.\nIn accordance with the Joint Political\nDeclaration between Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents[10], the Commission has examined\nwhether explanatory documents will be necessary to carry out its task of\noverseeing the transposition of this Directive. It has hereby given due\nconsideration to the nature of the Directive, the proportionality principle and\npossible additional administrative burden. In view of the limited number of\nlegal obligations in this Directive, the Commission considers that it would\nhave no difficulty in overseeing the correct transposition of this Directive.\nThe Commission does therefore not request Member States to accompany the\nnotification of their transposition measures with documents explaining the\nrelationship between the components of the Directive and the corresponding\nparts of national transposition measures.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instrument\nThe Commission proposes a Directive requiring\nMember States to establish maritime spatial plans and integrated coastal\nmanagement strategies, while respecting Member States\u2019 prerogatives to tailor\ntheir content to their specific economic, social and environmental priorities\nand national sectorial policy objectives and legal traditions. Subsidiarity and\nproportionality considerations led to the conclusion that a Regulation would\nnot be appropriate. Also, the procedural and process-based nature of the\ninstrument is best reflected in a framework-type Directive. Conversely, a\nnon-binding instrument would not be appropriate because it would not achieve\nsome of the policy objectives, namely the requirement to have all coastal\nMember States apply maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management\nand to ensure trans-boundary cooperation. Finally, a legislative approach also\nensures that the above processes will be implemented within agreed timeframes.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed explanation of\nthe proposal\nThe proposal contains two parts, the\nDirective and its Annex.\n3.6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Directive\nArticle 1\nsets out the subject matter of the Directive.\nArticle 2 sets\nout the scope of the Directive.\nArticle 3 defines\nthe terms used in the Directive.\nArticle 4 deals\nwith the establishment of maritime spatial plans and integrated coastal\nmanagement strategies at Member State level.\nArticle 5\ndeals with the objectives for maritime spatial plans and integrated coastal\nmanagement strategies at Member State level.\nArticle 6\nspecifies the minimum common requirements for maritime spatial plans and integrated\ncoastal management strategies.\nArticle 7\nspecifies the minimum requirements for maritime spatial plans.\nArticle 8\nspecifies the minimum requirements for integrated coastal management strategies.\nArticle 9 provides\nfor public participation in the development of maritime spatial plans and integrated\ncoastal management strategies.\nArticle 10\ndeals with data collection and exchange of information in support of maritime spatial\nplans and integrated coastal management strategies.\nArticle 11 provides\nfor assessment of the environmental effects of maritime spatial plans and integrated\ncoastal management strategies.\nArticle 12\ndeals with bilateral and multilateral cooperation between Member States in\norder to ensure consistent implementation across coastal zones and marine\nregions or sub-regions.\nArticle 13 concerns\ncooperation with third countries.\nArticle 14\nsets out the provisions for the designation of competent authorities for the\nimplementation of the Directive.\nArticle 15 provides\nfor Member States to report on implementation to the Commission and for the\nCommission to report to the European Parliament and Council on the progress made\nin implementing this Directive.\nArticle 16\noutlines the operational specifications and steps for implementation of this\nDirective for which the Commission may adopt implementing acts.\nArticle 17\nestablishes the mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s\nexercise of its implementing powers.\nArticle 18\nestablishes the rules for transposition of this Directive by the Member States.\nArticle 19\nprovides that the Directive will enter into force on the twentieth day\nfollowing that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European\nUnion.\nArticle 20\nnames the Member States as addressees of the Directive.\n3.6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex\nAnnex I lists the items of information on\ncompetent authorities that Member States have to provide to the Commission.\n2013/0074 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nestablishing a framework for maritime\nspatial planning and integrated coastal management\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 43(2), 100(2),\n192(1), and 194(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[11],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[12],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The high and rapidly\nincreasing demand for maritime space for different purposes, such as renewable\nenergy installations, maritime shipping and fishing activities, ecosystem\nconservation and tourism and aquaculture installations, as well as the multiple\npressures on coastal resources require an integrated planning and management\napproach.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Such an approach to ocean\nmanagement has been developed in the Integrated Maritime Policy[13] for the European Union,\nincluding, as its environmental pillar, Directive 2008/56/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framework for\nCommunity action in the field of marine environmental policy[14]. The objective of the Integrated\nMaritime Policy is to support the sustainable development of seas and oceans\nand to develop coordinated, coherent and transparent decision-making in relation\nto the Union\u2019s sectoral policies affecting the oceans, seas, islands, coastal\nand outermost regions and maritime sectors, including through sea-basin\nstrategies or macro-regional strategies.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Integrated Maritime\nPolicy identifies maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management\nas cross-cutting policy tools for public authorities\nand stakeholders to apply a coordinated, integrated approach. The application\nof an ecosystem-based approach will contribute to promoting the sustainable\ngrowth of the maritime and coastal economies and the sustainable use of marine\nand coastal resources.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maritime spatial planning\nand integrated coastal management support and facilitate the implementation of\nthe Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth[15], endorsed by the European\nCouncil in June 2010[16],\nwhich aims to deliver high levels of employment, productivity and social\ncohesion, including promotion of a more competitive, resource efficient and\ngreener economy. The coastal and maritime sectors have a significant potential\nfor sustainable growth and are key to the implementation of the Strategy.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its recent\nCommunication on Blue Growth[17],\nOpportunities for Marine and Maritime Sustainable Growth, the Commission has\nidentified a number of ongoing EU initiatives which are intended to implement\nthe Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The\nCommunication has also identified a number of sector activities on which blue\ngrowth initiatives should focus in the future and which should be adequately\nsupported by maritime spatial plans and integrated coastal management\nstrategies.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\n1255/2011, establishing a programme to support the further development of an\nIntegrated Maritime Policy, supports and facilitates the implementation of maritime\nspatial planning and integrated coastal management. This Regulation provides\nappropriate funding for maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal\nmanagement projects for 2011-2013. Regulation (EU) No XXXX/XX of the European\nParliament and of the Council on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund\nprovides for appropriate funding for such projects for 2014-2020[18].\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) states in its preamble\nthat issues relating to the use of ocean space are closely interrelated and\nneed to be considered as a whole. Planning of ocean space is the logical\nadvancement and structuring of the use of rights granted under UNCLOS and a\npractical tool in assisting Member States to comply with their obligations.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the appropriate apportionment of maritime space among relevant uses\nand the coordinated management of coastal zones, a\nframework should be put in place that consists at least in the establishment and\nimplementation by Member States of maritime spatial plans and integrated\ncoastal management strategies.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maritime spatial planning\nand integrated coastal management will result in better coordination of\nmaritime and coastal activities, which can lead to significant economic\nbenefits by providing transparency, predictability and stability for investors\nas well as lowering coordination and transaction costs.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\nconsistency and legal clarity, the geographical scope for maritime spatial planning\nand integrated coastal management strategiesshould be defined in conformity\nwith existing legislative instruments of the Union and international maritime\nlaw.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The geographical scope of\nmarine waters and coastal zones overlaps in the coastal and territorial waters\nof Member States. The tools of maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal\nmanagement are complementary, as they respectively focus on mapping existing\nand potential human activities for the purpose of preparing maritime spatial\nplans in marine waters and on the identification of measures for integrated\nmanagement of these human activities in coastal zones. The joint coherent\napplication of Maritime Spatial Plans and Integrated Coastal Management\nStrategies will improve the land-sea interface planning and management.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While it is appropriate for\nthe Union to lay down rules on maritime spatial plans and integrated coastal\nmanagement strategies, Member States and their competent authorities remain\nresponsible for designing and determining, within their marine waters and\ncoastal zones, the content of such plans and strategies, including the apportionment\nof maritime space to the different sector activities.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So as to respect\nproportionality and subsidiarity, as well as minimise additional administrative\nburden, transposition and implementation of this Directive should to the\ngreatest extent possible build upon existing national rules and mechanisms. Integrated\ncoastal management strategies should build on the principles and elements set\nout in Council Recommendation 2002/413/EC and Council Decision 2010/631/EU.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In marine waters and\ncoastal zones, ecosystems and marine and coastal resources are subject to\nsignificant pressures. Human activities, but also climate change effects,\nnatural hazards and shoreline dynamics such as erosion and accretion, can have\nsevere impacts on coastal economic development and growth, as well as coastal\nand marine ecosystems, leading to deterioration of environmental status, loss\nof biodiversity and degradation of ecosystem services. Due regard should be\ngiven to these various pressures in the establishment of maritime spatial plans\nand integrated coastal management strategies. Moreover, healthy coastal and\nmarine ecosystems and their multiple services, if integrated in planning\ndecisions, can deliver substantial benefits in terms of food production,\nrecreation and tourism, climate change mitigation and adaptation, shoreline\ndynamics control and disaster prevention. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maritime spatial planning and\nintegrated coastal management should apply the ecosystem-based approach as\nreferred to in Article 1(3) of Directive 2008/56/EC so as to ensure that the\ncollective pressure of all activities is kept within levels compatible with the\nachievement of good environmental status and that the capacity of marine\necosystems to respond to human-induced changes is not compromised, while\nenabling the sustainable use of marine goods and services by present and future\ngenerations.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maritime spatial planning\nand integrated coastal management will contribute, inter alia, to achieving the\naims of Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the council of\n23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources[19], Council Regulation 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation\nof fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy[20], Decision 884/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No\n1692/96/EC on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European\ntransport network[21], Directive 2000/60/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for\nCommunity action in the field of water policy, Directive\n2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008\nestablishing a framework for community action in the field of marine\nenvironmental policy, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2020[22], the Roadmap towards a Resource Efficient Europe,[23] the EU Strategy on Adaptation\nto Climate Change[24]\nwell as, where appropriate, those of the EU Regional Policy, including the\nsea-basin and macro-regional strategies. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maritime and coastal\nactivities are often closely interrelated. This requires maritime spatial plans\nand integrated coastal management strategies to be coordinated or integrated in\norder to guarantee the sustainable use of maritime space and management of\ncoastal areas taking account of social, economic and environmental factors.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve the\nobjectives of this Directive, maritime spatial plans and integrated coastal\nmanagement strategies should cover the full cycle of problem identification,\ninformation collection, planning, decision-making, implementation and\nmonitoring of implementation and be based on best available scientific\nknowledge. Best use should be made of mechanisms set out in existing or future\nlegislation, including Decision 2010/477/EU on criteria and methodological\nstandards for good environmental status of marine waters or the Commission's\nMarine Knowledge 2020 initiative[25].\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main purpose of maritime\nspatial planning is to identify and manage spatial uses and conflicts in\nmaritime areas. In order to achieve that purpose, Member States need at least\nto ensure that the planning process or processes result in a comprehensive map\nidentifying the different uses of maritime space, taking into consideration\nlong term changes due to climate change. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\nconsult and coordinate their plans and strategies with the relevant Member\nState or third country authorities in the marine region or sub-region or\ncoastal zone concerned in conformity with the rights and obligations of these\nMember States and third countries under European and international law. Effective\ncross border cooperation between Member States and with neighbouring third\ncountries requires that the competent authorities in each Member State are\nidentified. Member States therefore need to designate the competent authority\nor authorities responsible for cooperation with other Member States or third\ncountries. Given the differences between various marine regions or sub-regions\nand coastal zones, it is not appropriate to prescribe in detail in this\nDirective how these cooperation mechanisms should look.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A variety of measures under\ndifferent policies apply in coastal zones. In order to achieve the objectives\nof this Directive, Member States should prepare an inventory of these measures\nand analyse the need for additional actions, such as actions to prevent erosion\nand manage accretion, adapt to the effects of climate change, combat coastal\nand marine litter, develop green infrastructure and help prevent natural\ndisasters. These should be applied in a coordinated and integrated way. In\ndoing this, Member States should consider all relevant coastal activities and\npay particular attention to cross-sectoral and land-sea interactions between\nthese activities.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The management of maritime\nand coastal areas is complex and involves different levels of authorities, economic\noperators and other stakeholders. In order to guarantee sustainable development\nin an effective manner, it is essential that stakeholders, authorities and the\npublic are consulted at an appropriate stage in the preparation of maritime spatial\nplans and integrated coastal management strategies under this Directive, in\naccordance with relevant EU legislation. A good example for public consultation\nprovisions can be found in article 2(2) of Directive 2003/35.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through maritime spatial\nplans and integrated coastal management strategies Member States can reduce\nadministrative burden and costs in support of their action to implement other\nrelevant Union legislation. The timelines for maritime spatial plans and integrated\ncoastal management strategies should therefore be coherent with the timetables\nset out in other relevant legislation, especially: Directive 2009/28/EC, which\nrequires that Member State shall ensure that the share of energy from renewable\nsources in gross final consumption of energy in 2020 is at least 20 % and which\nidentifies coordination of authorisation, certification and planning\nprocedures, including spatial planning as an important contribution to\nachievement of the EU\u2019s renewable energy targets; Directive 2008/56/EC and Annex\nA(6) to Decision 2010/477/EU, which requires that Member States shall take the\nnecessary measures to achieve or maintain good environmental status in the\nmarine environment by 2020 and which identify maritime spatial planning as a\ntool to support the ecosystem-based approach to the management of human\nactivities in order to achieve good environmental status; Decision 884/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No\n1692/96/EC on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European\ntransport network which requires that the\ntrans-European transport network shall be established by 2020 by integrating\nEurope's land, sea and air transport infrastructure networks.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Environmental assessment is\nan important and established tool for integrating environmental considerations\ninto the preparation and adoption of plans and programmes. As maritime spatial plans\nand integrated coastal management strategies are likely to have significant\neffects on the environment, they should be subject to the provisions of\nDirective 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the\nassessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment[26]. When maritime spatial plans and integrated coastal\nmanagement strategies include Natura 2000 sites, such an environmental\nassessment can be combined with the requirements of Article 6 of Directive\n92/43/EEC, to avoid duplication. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\nestablishment of maritime spatial plans and integrated coastal management strategies\nis based on reliable data and to avoid additional administrative burden, it is\nessential that Member States collect the best available data and information by\nmaking use of existing instruments and tools for data collection, such as those\ndeveloped in the context of the Marine Knowledge 2020 initiative.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should produce\nnational reports to the Commission to monitor the implementation of this\nDirective. In order to minimise administrative burden, Member States should be\nable to use reporting done under relevant legislation, including the reporting\nunder Directive 2008/56/EC. The Commission will use the\ninformation reported by the Member States and any other relevant information\navailable through EU legislation, to inform the European Parliament and the\nCouncil on progress made in implementing this Directive.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nuniform implementation of this Directive, in particular regarding data\nmanagement and operational steps for the establishment, implementation and reporting\nof maritime spatial plans and integrated coastal management strategies,\nincluding technical formats for data sharing, implementing powers should be\nconferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with\nRegulation (EU) 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16\nFebruary 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning\nmechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of\nimplementing powers[27].\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Timely transposition of the\nprovisions of this Directive is essential since the EU has adopted a number of\npolicy initiatives that are to be implemented by the year 2020 and which this Directive\naims to support. The shortest possible deadline for the transposition of this\nDirective should therefore be adopted.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL\nPROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject\nmatter\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive establishes\na framework for maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management\naiming at promoting the sustainable growth of maritime and coastal economies\nand the sustainable use of marine and coastal resources.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Within the Integrated\nMaritime Policy of the Union, this framework provides for the establishment and\nimplementation by Member States of maritime spatial plans and of integrated\ncoastal management strategies with the aim of meeting the objectives specified\nin Article 5.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of this\nDirective shall apply to marine waters and coastal zones.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive shall not\napply to activities the sole purpose of which is defence or national security.\nEach Member State shall, however, endeavour to ensure that such activities are\nconducted in a manner compatible with the objectives of this Directive.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of this\nDirective shall be without prejudice to Member States\u2019 competences for town and\ncountry planning.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the\nfollowing definitions apply:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Coastal zone\u2019 means the\ngeomorphologic area on both sides of the seashore area with as the seaward\nlimit the external limit of the territorial seas of Member States and as the landward\nlimit, the limit as defined by the Member States in their integrated coastal\nmanagement strategies.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Integrated Maritime\nPolicy\u2019 means the Union policy with the aim to foster coordinated and coherent\ndecision-making to maximise the sustainable development, economic growth and\nsocial cohesion of Member States, in particular with regard to coastal, insular\nand outermost regions in the Union, as well as maritime sectors, through\ncoherent maritime-related policies and relevant international cooperation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Marine region or\nsub-region\u2019 means the marine regions and sub-regions referred to in Article 4\nof Directive 2008/56/EC.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Marine waters\u2019 means the\nwaters, the seabed and subsoil as defined in Article 3(1) of Directive\n2008/56/EC.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Public\u2019 means involving one\nor more natural or legal persons and, in accordance with national legislation\nor practice, their associations, organisations or groups.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Sector activities\u2019 means\nthose activities falling under the Union policies referred to in Part Three of\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which have an impact on marine\nwaters and coastal zones.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Good environmental status\u2019\nmeans the environmental status referred to in Article 3(5) of Directive\n2008/56/EC.\nCHAPTER II\nMaritime spatial plans and integrated coastal management strategies\nArticle 4\nEstablishment\nand implementation of maritime spatial plans and integrated coastal management strategies\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each Member State shall\nestablish and implement a maritime spatial plan or plans and an integrated\ncoastal management strategy or strategies.

Target: establishment of a transparent, predictable and\nstable framework for the planning and management of sea uses across the EU,\nresulting in significant gains in efficiency.\nENV activity: 587-D2: support and further develop EU policy on integrated\ncoastal zone management (ICZM), in order to promote the rational and sound use\nof coastal resources and to make coastal zones more resilient to risks and\nclimate change impacts.\nResult indicator: level of implementation of national ICZM\nstrategies developed further to the EU ICZM recommendation (ICZM progress\nindicator).\nTarget: in 2012, Commission proposal for an effective long-term framework to\nsupport implementation of ICZM in the EU.\n1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected result(s) and\nimpact\nSpecify the effects\nwhich the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\nThe ultimate aim of the proposal is to secure the sustainable\neconomic growth of marine and coastal economies while enabling diverse and\nsustainable uses of marine and coastal resources by considering the economic,\nsocial and environmental pillars of sustainability in line with the eco-system\napproach.\nThis should ensure (among other things): \n- sustainable, resource-efficient and integrated development of maritime and\ncoastal activities;\n- improvement of the investment climate;\n- better adaptation to environmental risks, such as climate change,\nand prevention and/or reduction of the effects of natural hazards.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\nimpact\nSpecify the\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n- Output indicators: availability of governance framework for maritime\nspatial planning and integrated coastal management strategies; level of\ncross-border cooperation;\n- Result indicators: spatial development patterns, reduction of\nconflicts and litigation regarding infrastructure development, sustainable use\nof marine and coastal resources, coordinated maritime spatial planning and integrated\ncoastal management, and cross-border cooperation;\n- Impact indicators: maintained/restored biodiversity or ecosystem\nservice potential in coastal zones and marine waters, increased added value and\nreduced seasonality in maritime and coastal economies, improved resilience to\nclimate change, growth in key economic sectors, coexistence of economic\nactivities.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\nproposal/initiative\n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term\n- to establish an integrated planning process for maritime\nactivities and an integrated management process for coastal zones, by bringing\ntogether national authorities and stakeholders of the relevant sector policies;\n- to ensure effective trans-boundary cooperation between Member\nStates in taking measures for maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal\nmanagement;\n- to ensure coordination and integration between maritime spatial planning\nand integrated coastal management processes.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nCoastal and maritime uses and ecosystems cross national borders. The\nproposed action would add value by ensuring the coherence of measures\naddressing this aspect. In particular, EU action would avoid divergent\napproaches and different levels of progress.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nAn evaluation of Member States\u2019 progress reports on ICZM following\nthe ICZM recommendation (2002/413/EC) concluded that this approach has clear\nadded value in integrating policies across sectors in coastal zones with the\naim of ensuring the sustainable use of coastal resources. Maritime spatial planning\nis a widely recognised tool to ensure coherent planning of the maritime space.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nMSP and ICZM have both been identified as integrated management\ntools under the IMP (Blue Book 2007). They are support tools for a more\nintegrated decision-making process, coordinating potentially competing sector\npolicies. Therefore, maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal\nmanagement strategies will support the achievement and coherence of objectives\nand measures under other relevant policies, including energy, environment, maritime\ntransport andfisheries.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY\nx Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\nto YYYY\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged[31]\n\u00a8 Centralised direct management by the Commission\n\u00a8 Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[32]\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\nx Shared management with the Member States\n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries\n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\nComments\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules\nSpecify frequency\nand conditions.\nBy 31 March 2016 and every six years thereafter, Member States will provide\na national report to the Commission on the implementation of the provisions of\nthis Directive.
