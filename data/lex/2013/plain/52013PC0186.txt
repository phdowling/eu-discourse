This expression\nrefers to flat panel displays which, even though they are not solely or\nprincipally used in an ADP system, are able to display signals from ADP\nmachines with a sufficient standard of performance for the user.\nHarmonised System (HS) subheading 8528 51 comprises\nmonitors \"of a kind solely or principally used in an ADP system of heading\n8471\". The conventional duty rate for these monitors is \"free\".\nMonitors \"other than of a kind solely or principally used in an automatic\ndata-processing system of heading 8471\" are classified under HS subheading\n8528 59. The conventional duty rate for this second type of monitors is \"14\n%\".\nIn its ruling in case C-376/07 (Kamino),\nthe Court of Justice of the European Union stated that classification of\nmonitors should be made in the light of the characteristics and objective\nproperties of those monitors, both as to the degree to which they are capable\nof performing a number of functions and as to the standard of performance which\nthey achieve when performing those functions. \nThe convergence of digital technologies has\nhowever led to a situation where it has become very difficult to determine, by\nreference to mere technical and objective characteristics, whether or not a\nparticular monitor is of a kind solely or principally used in an ADP system of\nheading 8471. In particular, ensuring the correct and uniform classification of\nflat panel displays which can display, with an acceptable level of\nfunctionality, signals from both ADP systems and other sources (for example,\nDVD players, video cameras, satellite receivers), has become technically\nimpossible. \nCurrently, a significant part of the monitors\nimported to the EU are flat panel displays which can display, with an\nacceptable level of functionality, signals from both ADP systems and other\nsources. This in particular applies to the highly professional types which are\nused in specialised sectors (such as in diagnostics or research). In order to\nensure a rational development of production and an expansion of consumption\nwithin the territory of the EU and to promote trade between Member States and third countries, it is both in the interest of European consumers and\nindustry to provide duty free treatment for the above-mentioned monitors. \nThe attached proposal is considered to be a\nbalanced approach taking into account the legal context and the interests of\nEuropean consumers and industry. \nThe proposal is in line with the Union's external trade and industry policies. \nIn the light of the foregoing it is\nproposed to amend Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 accordingly.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Tariff and Statistical Nomenclature\nSection of the Customs Code Committee was consulted on 27 September 2012.\nThe Union Industry was consulted on 13\nNovember 2012.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe legal basis of this proposal is Article\n31 and 32 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe subsidiarity principle does not apply,\nas the proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union.\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle given that, as foreseen in the Treaty, it promotes\ntrade between Member States and third countries and balances the commercial\ninterest of economic operators (manufacturers in the Union and importers)\nwithout changing the EU WTO schedule.\nBy virtue of Article 31 of the Treaty on\nthe Functioning of the European Union autonomous tariff rate is fixed by the\nCouncil acting by qualified majority on the basis of a Commission proposal. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nLoss of revenue in Traditional Own\nResources in the range of 20.5 Million Euros on an annual basis (based on the\nimport statistics of 2011).\n2013/0098 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No\n2658/87 on the Tariff and Statistical Nomenclature and on the Common Customs\nTariff\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 HS subheading 8528 51 comprises\nmonitors, other than cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitors, of a kind solely or\nprincipally used in an automatic data-processing system of heading 8471. Monitors\nother than of a kind solely or principally used in an automatic data-processing\nsystem of heading 8471 are classified under HS subheading 8528 59.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with settled\ncase- law of the Court of Justice of the European Union[1], classification of monitors\nunder either HS subheading 8528 51 or 8528 59 has to be based on an overall\nassessment of the objective characteristics and properties of each particular\nmonitor. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the convergence of\ndigital technologies it has become very difficult to determine, by reference to\nmere technical characteristics, whether or not a particular monitor is of a\nkind solely or principally used in an automatic data-processing system of\nheading 8471. In particular, ensuring the correct and uniform classification of\nflat panel displays which can display, with an acceptable level of\nfunctionality, signals from both automatic data-processing systems and other\nsources has become technically impossible.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a\nrational development of production and an expansion of consumption within the\nterritory of the Union and to promote trade between Member States and third countries, it is both in the interest of Union consumers and industry to\nprovide for a duty free treatment for the above-mentioned monitors. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex I to Regulation\n(EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.

The figures were provided\nby Eurostat.\nFirstly, the total value of imports of monitors with TARIC codes\n8528 59 10 90, 8528 59 40 90 and 8528 89 80 90 during the reference year 2011\nwas multiplied by the ad valorem duty rate (14%). \nSecondly, the amount of the collection costs (25%) has been deduced\nto obtain the total revenue of Traditional Own Resources for the EU for the\nyear 2011. \nThe result of this calculation is as follows:\n- TARIC code 8528 59 10 90: (\u20ac 10 891 640 x 14%) x 75% = \u20ac 1 143 622,\n20\n- TARIC code 8528 59 40 90: (\u20ac 233 167 690 x 14%) x 75% = \u20ac 24 482\n607, 45\n- TARIC code 8528 89 80 90: no trade in 2011\nWith the adoption of this draft proposal not all products which are\nclassified under these TARIC codes will enjoy duty free treatment. The measure\nis only applicable to certain monitors (\"flat panel displays which are\nable to display signals from automatic data-processing machines with an\nacceptable level of functionality\"). \nTaken into account the intended scope of the measure and the nature\nof the products available on the EU market, it can be estimated that at least\n80 % of the products which are currently imported under the mentioned TARIC\ncodes will fall within the scope of this definition. \nThe estimated total loss of revenue in Traditional Own Resources on\nan annual basis should therefore be calculated as follows:\n(\u20ac 1 143 622, 20 + \u20ac 24 482 607, 45) * 80% = \u20ac 20 500 983, 72\nFor the year in which the proposal will enter into force the\nfinancial impact is to be calculated proportionally.\nThe loss of revenue in Traditional Own Resources shall be\ncompensated by Member States contributions based on the GNI. \n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Case\nC-376/07 Kamino [2009] ECR I-1167.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nregards traditional own resources (customs duties, sugar levies), the amounts\nindicated must be net amounts, i.e. gross amounts after deduction of 25% for collection\ncosts.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
