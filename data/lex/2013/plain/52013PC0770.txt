Under Article 13 of Annex XII to the Staff Regulations, Eurostat has submitted the report on this assessment, which determines the rate of contribution required to maintain actuarial balance of the pension scheme. \n   || Existing provisions in the area of the proposal A proposal is to be presented each year for adjusting the rate of contribution to the pension scheme. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n   || Consultation of interested parties \n 211 || Methods of consultation used, main sectors covered and general profile of respondents The elements of the proposal have been discussed with the staff representatives in accordance with the appropriate procedures. \n 212 || Summary of replies received and the way in which they have been taken into account The proposal takes account of the opinions of the parties consulted. \n   || Collection and use of expertise \n 229 || The calculation of the pension contribution rate has been validated by an actuarial expert (external consultant). \n 230 || Impact assessment The purpose of the proposal is to adjust the rate of contribution to the pension scheme of officials and other servants of the European Union in order to maintain the actuarial balance of the scheme. The legislation in force permits no alternative. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n   || Summary of the proposed action In accordance with Annex XII to the Staff Regulations, Eurostat has submitted a report on the actuarial assessment of the pension scheme. According to this assessment, the rate of contribution required to maintain actuarial balance of the pension scheme is 10.3 % of the official's basic salary. Under Article 83a(3), where it is shown that there is a gap of at least 0.25 points between the rate of contribution currently applied (11.6 %) and the rate required to maintain actuarial balance (10.3 %), the Council is to adjust the rate, in accordance with the arrangements laid down in Annex XII. The Commission is therefore proposing that the rate of contribution be adjusted to 10.3 % with effect from 1 July 2013. It should be noted that: \u2013                         the Council Decision of 19 December 2011 concerning the Commission\u2019s proposal for a Council Regulation adjusting with the effect from 1 July 2011 the remuneration and pension of the officials and other servants of the European Union and the correction coefficients applied thereto (2011/866/EU) \u2013                         the Council's failure to adopt the Commission\u2019s proposal for a Council Regulation adjusting with the effect from 1 July 2012 the remuneration and pension of the officials and other servants of the European Union and the correction coefficients applied thereto (COM(2012) 754 final) are subject to proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union. Should the Court uphold the Commission's position, the Council will have to take the necessary measures under Article 266 TFEU and modify the pension contribution rate accordingly. \n   || Legal basis Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union, and in particular Article 83a thereof and Annex XII thereto. \n   || Subsidiarity principle The proposal concerns an area that falls within the exclusive competence of the European Union. The principle of subsidiarity does not therefore apply. \n   || Proportionality principle The proposal is consistent with the principle of proportionality for the following reasons: \n   || Article 83a of the Staff Regulations provides for a Council regulation. \n   || The proposal has no financial impact on expenditure. The impact on revenue results directly from the application of the adjustment method provided for in the Staff Regulations. \n   || Choice of instruments \n   || Proposed instrument: Regulation. \n   || Other instruments would be inappropriate for the following reasons: - Article 83a of the Staff Regulations provides for a Council regulation. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\n   || The impact on revenue of the adjustment to the rate of contribution to the pension scheme is detailed in the financial statement annexed hereto. \n2013/0378 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nadjusting, from 1 July 2013, the rate of\r\ncontribution to the pension scheme of officials and other servants of the\r\nEuropean Union\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to the Staff Regulations of\r\nOfficials of the European Union and the Conditions of Employment of Other\r\nservants of the European Union laid down by Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No\r\n259/68[1],\r\nand in particular Article 83a thereof and Annex XII thereto,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n13 of Annex XII to the Staff Regulations, Eurostat submitted a report on the\r\n2013 actuarial assessment of the pension scheme updating the parameters\r\nreferred to in that Annex.
