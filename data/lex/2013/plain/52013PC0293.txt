The EU\nguarantee for the EIB's external operations is an effective means to combine EU\nbudgetary funds, through the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund for external\nactions, with EIB own resources. In addition, the EIB finances investment grade\noperations outside the Union at its own risk, as well as activities under\nspecific mandates such as in ACP countries. \nThe need for an EU budget guarantee for the\nEIB's external operations stems from the Bank's obligation under its Statute to\nensure adequate security for all its lending operations and, more broadly, from\nthe need to safeguard the creditworthiness of the EIB and not compromise its task\nof contributing to the steady development of EU Member States. The EU guarantee\nhas been the key instrument ensuring the compatibility between the EIB's\nfinancial structure, which is significantly more leveraged than other\nInternational Financial Institutions (IFIs), and the significantly higher\ninherent risk of lending to third countries, taking into account the need to\navoid a deterioration of the Bank's AAA rating whilst limiting the EIB capital\nconsumption. While the recently approved EIB capital\nincrease would allow to increase EIB lending inside EU, EIB external activity\nshould not be affected.\nThe overall scope and general conditions of\nthe EU guarantee coverage for EIB external operations are set out in decisions\nof the European Parliament and of the Council. The most recent decision\ncovering the EIB financing operations outside the Union over the period\nbeginning on 1 February 2007 and ending on 31 December 2013 was established by\nDecision No 1080/2011/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\nOctober 2011[1]\n(the \u2018current Decision\u2019). Article 16 of the current Decision requires the\nCommission to present to the European Parliament and to the Council a proposal\nfor establishing the EU guarantee under the next multiannual financial\nframework.\nIn this context, Recital 40 of the current Decision\nforesees specific requirements: \"When submitting the proposal on the EU guarantee under the next\nmultiannual financial framework, the Commission should be invited in particular\nto examine, in close cooperation with the EIB and taking into account the\nimplications of the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund, the ceilings covered by\nthe EU guarantee, the list of potentially eligible countries and the\npossibility for the EIB to provide micro-credit financing and other types of\ninstruments. The Commission and the EIB should also examine the possibilities\nof enhancing, in the future, synergy between the financing through the IPA, the\nENPI, the DCI, the EIDHR and the Instrument for Stability and the external\nmandate of the EIB\".\nThe proposed new decision will cover the EU\nguarantee for EIB external financing operations over the period beginning on 1\nJanuary 2014 and ending on 31 December 2020.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Commission carried out an Impact\nAssessment (IA)[2]\nwhich accompanies this proposal. The following policy options were considered: \n\u00b7                        \nNo new EU budget guarantee extended to any new EIB\noperations outside the Union (option 0).\n\u00b7                        \nA base line scenario with no change in the\nexisting EU guarantee which would remain applicable as such in the next mandate,\ni.e. until 31/12/2020 (option 1).\n\u00b7                        \nAdapting the current set-up of the existing\nmandate with a combination of amendments responding to the new policy context. Three\nsub-options have been defined: \n\u2013     \nSub-option 2.1 (CLOSE) amending the geographical\nscope of the mandate in order to focus the EU guarantee on closest regions\nneighbouring the Union by excluding Asia, Latin America and South Africa from\nthe geographical scope, extending the guarantee to all type of microfinance\noperations, substantially increasing the dedicated climate change envelope, and\ndrafting of annual country strategy papers.\n\u2013     \nSub-option 2.2 (MICRO) maintaining the current\ngeographical scope, creating a microfinance mandate which would benefit from an\nEU comprehensive guarantee, introducing targets for climate change financing\nwithin the regional envelopes, and updating technical operational regional\nguidelines in line with the multiannual indicative programming of EU external\nfinancial instruments. \n\u2013     \nSub-option 2.3 (FOCUS) focusing the mandate on\nless credit-worthy beneficiaries, microfinance operations continuing not to be\nexplicitly eligible, introduction of an overall signature target accompanied by\nthe introduction of a tracking system allowing to monitor absolute and relative\nGreen House Gas emission reduction of all EIB projects supported under the\nmandate, and updating technical operational regional guidelines in line with the\nmultiannual indicative programming of EU external financial instruments. \n\u00b7                        \nProvide the guarantee to other European\nFinancial Institutions which are eligible in the various blending facilities\n(option 3). \nThe following main impacts have been\nacknowledged:\nOption 0 would lead to a withdrawal of the\nEIB from a number of countries and a significant increase in funding costs for investment\nprojects located in these countries. This is deemed not to be politically\ndesirable in particular in the context of the global economic crisis which\nemphasises the significant investment needs. It seems essential to continue\npreserving an adequate investment flow to countries outside the Union. \nOption 1 would not respond\nto the new policy context.\nIt was acknowledged that sub-option 2.3 (FOCUS)\nwould bring more positive impacts and ranked better than the other sub-options MICRO\nand CLOSE analysed, in particular in terms of budgetary impact and coherence and\ncomplementarity to the Union policies and instruments.\nOption 3 would open the EU guarantee to\nother institutions and would therefore decrease the share of EIB guaranteed\nlending, which could have a negative impact on the visibility of EU action,\ngiven the EIB's EU institutional standing. Moreover, the EU budget would assume\nadditional contingent liabilities on financing operations conducted by other financial\ninstitutions which are not strictly part of the EU institutional constellation\nand do not have the same shareholders. Finally, the other institutions have\ntheir own strategies agreed by their respective governing bodies which could\nlimit the influence of the Union through its guarantee. \nThe preferred option is therefore the\nsub-option 2.3 (FOCUS).\nThe impact assessment was based on informal\nexchanges of views with key external stakeholders including representatives of\nMember States and main relevant NGOs' representatives, which were organised\nthrough meetings and seminars in June and October 2012 in order to take stock\nof the state of play of respective reflections. In particular, exchanges of\nviews were undertaken on the problems identified in this report as well as on\nthe options envisaged to address them. The IA report was also based on the widespread\nconsultations of key stakeholders (those affected by the current Decision,\nthose involved in its implementation and of the legislators) that took place in\nthe context of the revision of the mandate 2007-2013 concluded at end-2011. All\nthese consultations and informal exchanges of views provided sufficient ground\nto form a view on the position of external stakeholders.\nDetails on the main outcome of these\nconsultations are provided in the Impact Assessment report.\nFollowing a first request for resubmission,\nthe IA Board delivered a positive opinion on the draft IA report on 29 January\n2013. The IAB requested further clarifications on the status of implementation\nof the recommendations of the mid-term review and on EIB's role within EU\nfinancing for external action and in complementarity to other actors' activity,\nfurther improvements of the assessment of impacts and comparison of options\nsections, as well as more details on the stakeholders' view presentation. The\nreport was further improved accordingly. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe proposal for a decision of the European\nParliament and of the Council is based on the dual legal basis of Articles 209\nand 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In particular\nArticle 209(3), in conjunction with Article 208, provides that the EIB is to\ncontribute, under the terms laid down in its Statute, to the implementation of\nthe measures necessary to further the objectives of Union development\ncooperation policy.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle, as the EU guarantee has proved to be an efficient\nmeans of covering the political and sovereign risks relating to EIB external\noperations carried out in support of the Union external policies. The new EU\nguarantee mandate for 2014-2020 will allow the existing efficient and\neconomically sound practice to continue.\nWhere possible and relevant, the draft\nlegislative proposal incorporates the language agreed during the\ninter-institutional negotiations and reflected in Decision 1080/2011/EU. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe Guarantee Fund for external actions\n(\"Guarantee Fund\" or \"GF\"), established by Council Regulation\n(EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 of 25 May 2009 establishing a Guarantee Fund for\nexternal actions[3],\nprovides a liquidity cushion for the Union budget against losses incurred on\nEIB financing operations and other Union external action, i.e. Macro Financial\nAssistance and Euratom loans. The EIB mandate represents more than 90% of the\nportfolio covered by the GF. \nThe GF is endowed by one annual payment\nfrom the EU budget. The provisioning mechanism of the GF which aims at\nmaintaining the GF at a level of 9% of outstanding loan disbursements creates\ntherefore de facto a limit in the size of the EIB external mandate covered by\nEU budget guarantee. In 2010, an external evaluation of the functioning of the\nGuarantee Fund concluded that the 9% provisioning rate was deemed appropriate.\nThe ceiling proposed is compatible with the\nprovisioning amounts envisaged in the technical input from the European\nCommission to the negotiation of the individual programmes implementing the\nnext Multiannual Financial Framework sent by the Commission on 27 March 2013 (EUR\n1.193 billion for the 2014-2020 Financial Framework in current prices) and is based\non expected patterns of disbursements and reimbursements of guaranteed loans.\nThe proposal foresees a maximum ceiling of\nthe EIB financing operations under EU guarantee throughout the period 2014-2020\nof EUR 28 bn. This maximum ceiling shall be broken down into two parts: (i) a\nfixed ceiling of a maximum amount of EUR 25 billion; and (ii) an optional\nadditional amount of EUR 3 billion. The activation in whole or in part of this\noptional amount and its regional distribution will be decided under ordinary\nlegislative procedure following a mid-term review. \nThe more limited size of the fixed ceiling\ncompared to the current Decision is due to budgetary restraint in the amount of\nthe provisioning budget line of the Guarantee Fund under the next Multiannual\nFinancial Framework and is not linked to the current performance and\neffectiveness of the scheme or absorption capacity considerations. \nThe budgetary implications as regards the\nprovisioning of the Guarantee Fund, including the underlying assumptions, as\nwell as the human and administrative resources involved in the administration\nof the EU guarantee are set out in the legislative financial statement\naccompanying the proposal.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nOn the basis of the outcome of the impact\nassessment, the proposal aims to ensure the continuation of the EU guarantee\nfor EIB external financing for the next financial perspectives 2014-2020,\nwhilst introducing some changes:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Focus the geographical scope of\nthe mandate on less creditworthy beneficiaries where the use of the guarantee\nwould display the highest value added.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reinforce the climate change\ndimension of the mandate in order to incentivise EIB operations in this key\nsector of the Union external action through the introduction of an overall\nsignature target accompanied by the introduction of a tracking system allowing\nto monitor absolute and relative Green House Gas emission reduction of all significant\nEIB projects supported under the mandate.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Better align EIB financing with\nthe Union policies and reinforce coherence and complementarity with EU\ninstruments to more satisfactorily mirror policy developments in a timely\nmanner through the provision to update the technical operational regional\nguidelines in line with the multiannual indicative programming of EU external\nfinancial instruments.\nDetailed explanation of the key elements\nof the proposal\nArticle 1 extends the EU guarantee for the\nnext financial perspective 2014-2020, with the possibility of a six-month\nextension to ensure the continuity of EIB financing operations. The EU\nguarantee is limited to 65% of the aggregate amount of the EIB outstanding\ndisbursed amounts plus related amounts (e.g. interest, commissions, and other\npossible charges that are due by a guaranteed obligor to the EIB pursuant to a\nloan or a guarantee agreement), in line with the current Decision. It stresses\nthat the EIB uses its own rules and procedures when granting financing covered\nby the EU guarantee, but also makes the guarantee coverage conditional on the\nEIB financing being carried out in support of the Union external policy\nobjectives. Compared to the current Decision, the proposal clarifies explicitly\nthat the EU budgetary guarantee covers loans, loan guarantee and debt capital\nmarket instruments issued for the benefit of investment projects.\nArticle 2 sets out the ceilings for EIB\nfinancing under EU guarantee (fixed and optional ceilings). The regional\nceilings under the fixed ceiling are detailed in Annex I of the proposed\ndecision.\nArticle 3 sets out the general objectives and\nprinciples to be pursued by EIB financing operations covered by the EU\nguarantee. These general objectives are local private sector development (in\nparticular SMEs), development of social, environmental and economic\ninfrastructure, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Over the period\ncovered by the new decision, climate change operations should represent an\naverage of at least 25% of total EIB financing operations. The EIB shall, in\ncooperation with the Commission and following a public consultation, update its\nclimate change strategy in this regard. Regional integration will be an\nunderlying objective for all EIB financing activity. Moreover, EIB financing\nshall contribute indirectly to the Union development objectives.\nArticle 4 deals with the list of countries\nconcerned by the proposal and their potential and actual eligibility. As in the\ncurrent Decision, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to\nactivate or suspend the actual eligibility for EIB financing under the EU\nguarantee for countries listed as potentially eligible countries, while the\nmodification of the list of potentially eligible countries would require a\nseparate decision by the legislator. Article 4 also provides for the suspension\nof disbursements on existing EIB financing operations benefiting from a\nComprehensive Guarantee in case of suspension of eligibility. Compared to the current\nDecision, the eligibility of Myanmar for EIB financing under EU guarantee is\nestablished. This reflects the progress that has been made in the Union's\nrelations with this country. The more detailed justification for extending the\nEU guarantee to EIB financing in Myanmar is set out in the annex of the Impact\nAssessment accompanying this proposal. It takes into account the political\nsituation in the country and the bilateral relations with the Union, the\ndemocracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms situation as well as the\nmacro-economic situation and investment needs. \nArticle 8 outlines the nature of the EU\nguarantee which will cover risks of a political or sovereign nature for\nfinancing operations entered into by the EIB. It also requires that the EU\nguarantee, through an appropriate method, is focussed on EIB financing\noperations where the EU guarantee brings significant financial benefits. The\naim of such a method would be to ensure that the EU guarantee coverage is\nutilised to the maximum benefit of beneficiaries, e.g. in countries and for\noperations that have difficulties in obtaining finance from the capital market\non acceptable terms, while investment grade countries or borrowers may have\naccess to EIB own risk facilities.\nArticle 18 provides a mid term review of\nthe implementation of the mandate by 31 December 2017, based on an external\nevaluation.\nAnnex I sets out the regional ceilings under\nthe fixed ceiling. \nAnnex II sets out the list of potentially\neligible regions and countries.\nAnnex III sets out the list of eligible\nregions and countries.\nAnnex IV presents the regional policy\nframework in which EIB operates outside the Union.\n2013/0152 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non granting an EU guarantee to the\nEuropean Investment Bank against losses under financing operations supporting\ninvestment projects outside the Union\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 209 and 212\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to its core\nmission of financing investment in the Union, the European Investment Bank\n(EIB) undertakes financing operations outside the Union in support of the\nUnion's external policies. This allows the budget funds of the Union available\nto the external regions to be complemented by the financial strength of the EIB\nfor the benefit of the targeted third countries. In undertaking such financing\noperations, the EIB contributes to the general principles and policy objectives\nof the Union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 209(3) of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjunction with\nArticle 208 thereof, provides that the EIB is to contribute, under the terms\nlaid down in its Statute, to the implementation of the measures necessary to\nfurther the objectives of Union development cooperation policy.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to supporting\nUnion external action, and in order to enable the EIB to finance investments\noutside the Union without affecting the credit standing of the EIB, the\nmajority of its operations outside the Union have benefited from an EU\nbudgetary guarantee (\"EU guarantee\") administered by the Commission.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The latest EU guarantee\nfor EIB financing operations signed during the period from 1 February 2007 to\n31 December 2013 was established by Decision No 1080/2011/EU of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 granting an EU\nguarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans and loan\nguarantees for projects outside the Union and repealing Decision No 633/2009/EC[4]. An EU guarantee for EIB\nfinancing operations outside the Union in support of Union policies should be\nestablished for the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A list of countries\npotentially eligible for EIB financing under the EU guarantee should be\nestablished. It is also appropriate to establish a list of countries actually eligible\nfor EIB financing under the EU guarantee. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Myanmar should be added to\nboth lists following the recent developments which allowed the Union to open a\nnew chapter in its relations with Myanmar and in order to support the on-going\npolitical and economic reforms in the country.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reflect\nsignificant policy developments, the list of countries actually eligible for\nEIB financing operations under the EU guarantee should be reviewed as\nappropriate and the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU\nshould be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendments to Annex III to\nthis Decision. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out\nappropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert\nlevel. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should\nensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\ndocuments to the European Parliament and Council.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to cater for the\npotential evolution of the actual provisioning needs of the Guarantee Fund in\naccordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 of 25 May 2009\nestablishing a Guarantee Fund for external actions[5], the maximum ceiling of the EU\nguarantee should be broken down into a fixed ceiling of a maximum amount of EUR\n25 bn and an optional additional amount of EUR 3 bn. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amounts covered by the\nEU guarantee in each region should continue to represent ceilings for the EIB\nfinancing under the EU guarantee and not targets that the EIB is required to\nmeet. The ceilings should be evaluated as part of the mid-term review of this\nDecision.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to enhance the\ncoherence and the focus of the EIB external financing activity on supporting\nUnion policies, and for the maximum benefit of beneficiaries, Decision No\n1080/2011/EU set out general objectives for EIB financing operations across all\neligible regions and countries, i.e. local private sector development, in\nparticular in support of small and medium\u2011sized enterprises (SMEs), social\nand economic infrastructure and climate change mitigation and adaptation, building\non the comparative strengths of the EIB in areas where it has a well-proven\ntrack record. These objectives should be maintained in this Decision.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Improving access to\nfinancing for SMEs, including SMEs from the Union investing in the regions\ncovered by this Decision, can play an essential role in stimulating economic\ndevelopment and in combating unemployment. In order to effectively reach out to\nSMEs, the EIB should cooperate with local financial intermediary institutions\nin the eligible countries, in particular to ensure that part of the financial\nbenefits is passed on to their clients and provide added value compared to\nother sources of finance. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The coverage of the EU\nguarantee, which is limited to risks of a sovereign and political nature, is\nnot sufficient in itself to ensure a meaningful EIB activity in support of\nmicro-finance. Therefore such activity, where appropriate, should be carried\nout in connection with budgetary resources available under other instruments.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EIB should continue to finance\ninvestment projects in the areas of social, environmental and economic\ninfrastructure, and should consider increasing its activity in support of\nhealth and education infrastructure when there is clear added value in doing\nso.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EIB should also\ncontinue to finance investment projects in support of climate change mitigation\nand adaptation, to further the promotion of the Union's climate goals on a\nglobal scale.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Within the areas covered by\nthe general objectives, regional integration among countries, in particular economic\nintegration between Pre-accession countries, Neighbourhood countries and the\nUnion, should be an underlying objective for EIB financing operations. Within\nthe aforementioned areas, the EIB should be able to support partner countries\nthrough foreign direct investments by companies from the Union that contribute\nto promoting technology and knowledge transfer, providing that due\nconsideration has been made during the investment projects' due diligence to minimise\nthe risks that EIB financing operations lead to negative repercussions on\nemployment in the Union. The EIB should also be encouraged to support foreign\ndirect investment in partner countries by companies from the Union at its own\nrisk.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The practical measures for\nlinking the general objectives of the EU guarantee and their implementation are\nto be set out in regional technical operational guidelines. Such guidelines\nshould be consistent with the wider Union regional policy framework. The regional\ntechnical operational guidelines should be reviewed and further updated\nfollowing the review of this Decision in order to adapt to the developments in the\nUnion external policies and priorities. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n19 of the Statute of the EIB, applications made directly to the EIB for EIB\nfinancing operations to be carried out under this Decision are to be submitted\nto the Commission for an opinion on the conformity with relevant EU legislation\nand policies. In the event that the Commission delivers a negative opinion on an\nEIB financing operation in the framework of the Article 19 procedure, the operation\nshall not be covered by the EU guarantee.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the EIB's strength\nremains its distinctiveness as an investment bank, EIB financing operations\nshould contribute to the general principles guiding Union external action, as\nreferred to in Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), of promoting\nand consolidating democracy and the rule of law, human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms, and to the implementation of international environmental agreements\nto which the Union is a party. In particular, in relation to developing\ncountries, EIB financing operations should foster their sustainable economic,\nsocial and environmental development, particularly in the most disadvantaged\namongst them, their smooth and gradual integration into the world economy, the\ncampaign against poverty, as well as compliance with objectives approved by the\nUnion in the context of the United Nations and other competent international\norganisations. While contributing to the implementation of the measures\nnecessary to further the objectives of Union development cooperation policy in\naccordance with Article 209(3) of the Treaty, the EIB should strive to support\nindirectly the achievement of the UN's 2015 Millennium Development Goals in all\nregions where it is active.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EIB activity under this\nDecision should support the Agenda for Change proposed by the Commission and be\ncoherent with the relevant principles of the European Consensus on Development\nand the principles of aid effectiveness outlined in the Paris Declaration of\n2005, the Accra Agenda for Action of 2008 and the Busan Partnership Agreement\nof 2011. Furthermore, it should be coherent with the EU Strategic Framework and\nAction Plan on Human Rights and Democracy adopted by the Council on 25 June\n2012 and international environmental agreements including biodiversity\ncommitments. It should be implemented through a number of concrete measures, in\nparticular by reinforcing the EIB's capacity to appraise environmental, social\nand development aspects of investment projects, including human rights and\nconflict-related risks, and by promoting local consultation with public\nauthorities and civil society. In this context, the EIB should implement and\nfurther develop its Results Measurement framework (REM) which provides a\ndetailed set of performance indicators measuring the economic, environmental, social,\nand development impact of its financing operations throughout the lifecycle of\nthe underlying investment. The implementation of the REM should be evaluated as\npart of the mid-term review of this Decision. When carrying out due diligence\nin respect of an investment project, the EIB should, where appropriate and in\nline with the Union's social and environmental principles, require the investment\nproject promoter to carry out local consultations and disclose their results to\nthe public. EIB financing agreements involving public counterparts should\nexplicitly include the possibility to suspend disbursements in case of revocation\nof eligibility under this Decision of the country in which the investment project\ntakes place.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At all levels, from\nupstream strategic planning to downstream investment project development, it\nshould be ensured that EIB financing operations comply with and support Union\nexternal policies and the general objectives set out in this Decision. With a\nview to increasing the coherence of Union external action, dialogue on policy\nand strategy should be further strengthened between the Commission and the EIB,\nincluding the European External Action Service (EEAS). The Memorandum of Understanding\nto be revised in 2013 to enhance cooperation and early mutual exchange of\ninformation between the Commission and the EIB at operational level should\ncontinue to be applied. It is of particular importance to have an early\nexchange of views between the Commission and the EIB, including the EEAS, as\nappropriate, in the process of preparing programming documents in order to\nmaximise synergies between their activities. The cooperation in relation to the\nrespect of human rights and conflict prevention issues should also be\nreinforced.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union external relations\nshould be supported by new instruments from 2014, including an umbrella\nRegulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of\nthe Union's instruments for external action[6].\nWith a view to enhancing the coherence of overall Union support in the regions\nconcerned, opportunities should be seized to combine EIB financing with Union\nbudgetary resources when and as appropriate, in the form of financial\ninstruments provided for in Title VIII of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the\nfinancial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing\nCouncil Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002[7]\nand technical assistance for project preparation and implementation, through\nthe Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance II (IPA II)[8], the European Neighbourhood\nInstrument (ENI)[9],\nthe Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI)[10],\nthe Partnership Instrument for cooperation with third countries[11], the Instrument for the\npromotion of Democracy and Human Rights worldwide[12], the Instrument for Stability[13], and the Instrument for\nNuclear Safety Cooperation[14].\nFollowing Decision No 1080/2011/EU, the Commission established an EU Platform\nfor Blending in External Cooperation with a view to optimising the functioning\nof mechanisms for the blending of grants and loans outside the Union.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its financing operations\noutside the Union that fall within the scope of this Decision, the EIB should\nendeavour further to enhance coordination and cooperation with European\nFinancial Institutions and International Financial Institutions, notably those\nparticipating in the EU Platform for Blending in External Cooperation. This\ncooperation includes, where appropriate, cooperation on sector conditionality\nand mutual reliance on procedures, use of joint co-financing and participation\nin global initiatives, such as those promoting aid coordination and\neffectiveness. Such coordination and cooperation should strive to minimise\npossible duplication of costs and unnecessary overlap. The tripartite Memorandum\nof Understanding between the Commission, the EIB Group and the European Bank\nfor Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in respect of cooperation outside the\nUnion, which allows the EIB Group and the EBRD to act in a complementary way by\nrelying on their respective comparative advantages, was updated in 2012 to\ncover the extension of EBRD's geographical scope to the Mediterranean region\nand should continue to be applied. The principles set out in this Decision\nshould also be applied when EIB financing is implemented through cooperation\nagreements with other European Financial Institutions and International\nFinancial Institutions.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EIB should be\nencouraged to increase its operations and to diversify its operations outside\nthe Union without recourse to the EU guarantee so that the use of the EU guarantee\ncan be focused on countries and investment projects with poor access to the\nmarket, taking into account debt sustainability considerations, where the EU guarantee\ntherefore provides greater added value. Consequently, and always with the aim\nof supporting the objectives of the Union external policies, the EIB should be\nencouraged to lend at its own risk, including in support of Union economic\ninterests, in countries and in favour of investment projects having a sufficient\ncreditworthiness according to the assessment of the EIB and taking into account\nits own risk absorption capacity.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EIB should expand the\nrange of innovative financial instruments it offers, including by focusing more\non developing guarantee instruments. Moreover, the EIB should actively seek to\nparticipate in risk sharing instruments and debt capital market financing of\nprojects with stable and predictable cash flow generation. In particular, it\nshould consider supporting debt capital market instruments issued or granted\nfor the benefit of an investment project carried out in the eligible countries.\nIn addition, the EIB should increase its provision of loans in local currencies\nand issue bonds in local markets, provided that beneficiary countries put in\nplace the necessary structural reforms, in particular in the financial sector,\nas well as other measures to facilitate EIB activities.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EIB financing\noperations in support of Union external policies should continue to be\nconducted in accordance with the principles of sound banking practice. They should\ncontinue to be managed in accordance with the EIB's own rules and procedures, including\nappropriate control measures and compliance with the EIB's statement on social\nand environmental standards, as well as with the relevant rules and procedures\nconcerning the Court of Auditors and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). In\nits financing operations the EIB should adequately implement its policies\ntowards weakly regulated or non-cooperative jurisdictions in order to\ncontribute to the international fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and\nmoney-laundering.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EIB should take\nappropriate measures ensuring that, when financing operations subject to the EU\nguarantee, the financial interests of the European Union are protected by the\napplication of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other\nillegal activities and that OLAF is entitled to conduct on-the-spot checks and\nInspections in the premises of the beneficiaries.\nHAVE\nADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nEU guarantee\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union shall grant the\nEuropean Investment Bank (EIB) a budgetary guarantee for financing operations\ncarried out outside the Union (\"EU guarantee\").

participating in\nthe pre-accession process takes place in the framework established in the\nAccession and European Partnerships which set out the priorities for candidates\nand potential candidates with a view to making progress in moving closer to the\nUnion, and which provide a framework for Union assistance. The Stabilisation\nand Association Process is the Union policy framework for the Western Balkans.\nIt is based on progressive partnership, in which the Union offers trade\nconcessions, economic and financial assistance and contractual relationships\nthrough Stabilisation and Association Agreements. Pre-accession financial\nassistance helps the candidates and potential candidates prepare for the\nobligations and challenges of membership of the Union. This assistance supports\nthe reform process, including preparations for eventual membership. It focuses\non institution-building, alignment with the acquis of the Union,\npreparation for Union policies and instruments and promotion of measures to\nachieve economic convergence.\nEIB activity in neighbourhood countries takes\nplace in the framework of the new European Neighbourhood Policy \"A new\nresponse to a changing Neighbourhood\u2019, adopted on 25 May 2011 and the Council\nconclusions adopted on 20 June 2011, which calls notably for greater support to\npartners committed to building democratic societies and undertaking reforms, in\nline with the \u201cmore for more\u201d and \"mutual accountability\" principles,\nand provides the strategic policy framework for the EU relations with the\nneighbours. In the framework of this cooperation, EIB financing under this\nDecision will also be targeted at policies promoting inclusive growth and job\ncreation contributing to social stability in line with an incentive-based\napproach supporting Union external policy objectives, including in relation to\nmigration issues.\nIn order to achieve these objectives the\nUnion and its partners implement jointly agreed bilateral action plans defining\na set of priorities including on political and security issues, trade and\neconomic matters, environmental and social concerns and integration of\ntransport and energy networks.\nThe Union for the Mediterranean, the\nEastern Partnership, the Black Sea Synergy, the Union Strategy for the Danube\nRegion and the Union Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region are multilateral and\nregional initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation between the Union and the\nrespective group of neighbourhood partner countries facing common challenges and/or\nsharing a common geographical environment. The Union for the Mediterranean aims\nto relaunch the Euro-Mediterranean integration process by supporting mutual\neconomic, social and environmental development on both sides of the\nMediterranean and supports improved socio-economic development, solidarity, regional integration, sustainable development and\nknowledge building, underlining the need to increase financial cooperation to\nsupport regional and trans-national projects. The Union\nfor the Mediterranean supports, in particular, the creation of maritime and\nland highways, the de-pollution of the Mediterranean, the Mediterranean solar\nenergy plan, the Mediterranean Business Development Initiative, civil\nprotection initiatives and the Euro-Mediterranean university. The Union Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region\nsupports a sustainable environment and optimal economic and social development\nin the Baltic Sea region. The Union Strategy for the Danube Region supports, in\nparticular, the development of transport, energy connections and security,\nsustainable environment and socio-economic development in the Danube region. The Eastern Partnership aims to create the\nnecessary conditions to accelerate political association and further economic\nintegration between the Union and Eastern partner countries. The Russian\nFederation and the Union have a wide-ranging strategic partnership, distinct\nfrom the European Neighbourhood Policy and expressed through the Common Spaces\nand Roadmaps. These are complemented at multilateral level by the Northern\nDimension which provides a framework for cooperation between the Union, Russia,\nNorway and Iceland (Belarus, Canada and the US are observers to the Northern\nDimension).\nEIB activity in Latin America takes place\nin the framework of the Union, Latin America and the\nCaribbean Strategic Partnership. As highlighted in the\nSeptember 2009 Commission Communication \"The European Union and Latin\nAmerica: Global Players in Partnership\", the Union's priorities in the\nfield of cooperation towards Latin America are the promotion of regional\nintegration and the eradication of poverty and social inequality in order to\npromote sustainable economic and social development. These policy objectives will\nbe fostered taking into account the different level of development of Latin\nAmerican countries. Bilateral dialogue and cooperation will be pursued in\nareas of common interest for both regions, including environment, climate\nchange, disaster risk reduction and energy, science, research, higher education,\ntechnology and innovation.\nThe EIB is encouraged to be active in Asia,\nin particular in less prosperous countries. In this diverse region, the Union\nis deepening its strategic partnerships with China and India and negotiations\nare progressing on new partnership and free trade agreements with South-East\nAsian countries. At the same time, development cooperation remains high on the Union's\nagenda with Asia; the Union development strategy for the Asian region aims at\neradicating poverty by supporting broad-based sustainable economic growth,\npromoting a conducive environment and conditions for trade and integration\nwithin the region, enhancing governance, increasing political and social\nstability, and supporting the achievement of the 2015 Millennium Development\nGoals. Policies are being put in place jointly to address common challenges,\nsuch as climate change, sustainable development, security and stability,\ngovernance and human rights, as well as the\nprevention of, and response to, natural and humanitarian disasters.\nThe Union Strategy for a new partnership\nwith Central Asia adopted by the European Council in June 2007 has strengthened\nregional and bilateral dialogue and Union cooperation with Central Asian\ncountries on major issues facing the region, such as poverty reduction,\nsustainable development and stability. The implementation of the strategy has\nbrought about important advances in the fields of human rights, the rule of\nlaw, good governance and democracy, education, economic development, trade and\ninvestment, energy and transport and environmental policies.\nEIB activity in\nSouth Africa takes place in the framework of the Joint EU Country Strategy\nPaper for South Africa. The main focal areas identified in that Strategy Paper\nare employment creation and capacity development for service delivery and\nsocial cohesion. EIB activities in South Africa have taken place in high\ncomplementarity with the EU development cooperation programme, namely through\nthe EIB focus on private sector support and investments in expansion of\ninfrastructure and social services (housing, electric power, drinking water\npurification and municipal infrastructure). The mid-term review of the EU\nCountry Strategy Paper for South Africa conducted in 2009-2010 has proposed the\nstrengthening of actions in the area of climate-change through activities\nsupporting the creation of green jobs. For the period 2014-2020, EIB activity\nis expected to support in a complementary fashion EU external cooperation\npolicies, programmes and instruments by continuing to focus on key EU-South\nAfrica priorities in order to promote equitable and sustainable economic\ngrowth, contribute to employment creation and capacity development, and support\nthe sustainable provision and equitable access to basic infrastructure and\nservices \nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Title of the proposal/initiative \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Policy\narea(s) concerned in the ABM/ABB structure\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nature\nof the proposal/initiative \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objective(s)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds\nfor the proposal/initiative \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration\nand financial impact \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management\nmethod(s) envisaged \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring\nand reporting rules \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management\nand control system \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures\nto prevent fraud and irregularities \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s)\nof the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimated\nimpact on expenditure \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.2.1.

The main impacts of the proposal have been assessed in the IA report.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\nimpact \nA framework to measure the results and impacts of EIB operations has\nbeen developed by the EIB through the operational monitoring of a set of indicators.\nThe \"REsults Measurement framework (REM)[20]\nimproves the ex-ante assessment of expected project results and enhances the EIB\u2019s\nability to report on actual results achieved. The REM framework serves to show\nhow EIB loans generate outputs, which enable outcomes and, over time lead to\nimpacts, which are in line with the Bank\u2019s mandate objectives.\nIn addition, progress towards specific and operational objectives of\nthe proposal will be monitored through core indicators as indicated in 2.1. \nAs regard the financing for projects that promote climate action,\neligibility for climate change operations would be clarified against agreed\ncriteria building on - and, if needed, tightening - existing EIB definitions to\ntrack climate change expenditure (e.g. introducing benchmarks related with GHG\nemission reduction, improving if appropriate the definitions for energy\nefficiency and adaptation), which would also be used in the monitoring phase to\n'operationalise' the Rio Marker or equivalent system as proposed by the\nCommission to track the EU budget under the next MFF.\nIn parallel the EIB should keep developing methodologies to assess\nclimate risk in order to reinforce the climate resilience for all relevant\noperations, and integrate carbon pricing in economic cost benefit analysis.\nRestrictive eligibility and criteria for carbon-intensive projects should also\nbe improved in relevant sector policies.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term \nArticle 16 of Decision 1080/2011/EU states that the Commission shall\npresent to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal for establishing\nthe EU guarantee under the next multiannual financial framework (2014-2020). \nUnder the terms of Decision 1080/2011/EU of the European Parliament\nand of the Council, the EU guarantee covers EIB financing operations signed\nbetween 1 February 2007 and 31 December 2013. Therefore, a new Decision should be\nadopted under the ordinary legislative procedure before the current mandate\nexpires[21].\n\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU involvement\nEIB financing operations outside the Union represent a highly\nvisible and effective tool in support of the Union's external action. The main\nbenefits of EIB intervention in such countries, beyond the financial\ncontribution, include the passing on to project promoters of expertise and the\napplication of EU environmental, social and procurement standards to the investment\nprojects financed. In addition to the above benefits, the EIB passes on in full\nthe financial advantages resulting from the EU guarantee and the attractive\nfunding costs of the EIB to final beneficiaries in the form of competitive\ninterest rates.\nThe mandate under EU guarantee cover provides for the necessary\npolitical and financial backing by the Union for countries and investment projects\nwhich would not normally fit within EIB's standard guidelines and criteria due\nto the higher risk.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe Impact Assessment (IA) prepared for this decision draws from\nlessons learned from the implementation of the previous mandates. The new\nlegislative proposal aims at address the problems identified in the IA report.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nEIB financing operations will complement the activities carried out\nunder the external assistance instruments. In order to further increase support\nfor the Union external policies in each specific region, the linkage between\nEIB priorities and the Union policies will be strengthened. This will be\nachieved through the establishment and the mid-term update of regional\ntechnical operational guidelines which will provide a stronger framework for\ndialogue and cooperation between the EIB and the Commission. Where appropriate,\nEIB financing operations may be usefully combined with EU budget resources in\nthe form of co-financing grants, risk capital, risk sharing or technical\nassistance for project preparation and implementation or enhancement of the\nlegal and regulatory framework.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact \nx Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration \n\u2013     \nx\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from 01/01/2014\nto 31/12/2020 \nEIB financing operations can be signed by\nthe EIB from 2014 to 2020.

The Commission is\nresponsible for managing directly the EU guarantee. The EIB and the Commission\nenter into a guarantee and a recovery agreements laying down the detailed\nprovisions and procedures relating to the implementation of the proposed\nDecision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules \nEIB financing operations under EU guarantee will be managed by the\nEIB in accordance with the EIB's own rules and procedures, including\nappropriate audit, control and monitoring measures. \nFurthermore, the EIB Board of Directors, where the Commission is\nrepresented by a Director and an alternate Director, approves each EIB financing\noperation and monitors that the EIB is managed in accordance with its Statute\nand with the general directives laid down by the Board of Governors.\nThe existing tripartite agreement between the Commission, the Court\nof Auditors and the EIB of October 2003 (and agreed to be renewed for four\nyears in 2007 and again in 2011) details the rules under which the Court of\nAuditors is to carry out its audits on the EIB financing operations under EU\nguarantee.\nRegular reports are envisaged in the proposal as in Decision No 1080/2011/EU.\nThe Commission will annually report on the implementation of the mandate by the\nEIB to the European Parliament and the Council.\nReporting on results will be based on an appropriate aggregation of\nindicators across the entire portfolio where this is possible, or across a\ngiven sector. These indicators will be measured throughout the project cycle at\nappraisal level and during monitoring until the project is fully implemented as\nsoon as the first development outcomes are measurable - typically up to three\nyears after project completion. They will, to the extent possible, also be used\nfor ex-post evaluation. These indicators should cover the following areas: i)\namount signed by region, ii) amount disbursed by region, iii) progress in\nachieving a balanced distribution of activity by country, iv) breakdown of\nactivity across the various objectives, v) volume of climate change lending against\ntarget financing and impact on absolute and relative GHG emission reductions,\nvi) number of projects assessed against climate risk, vii) number and amount of\noperations blended with EU grants, and viii) number and amount of operations\nco-financed with other IFIs.\nFurthermore, the EIB shall provide the Commission with statistical,\nfinancial and accounting data on each of the financing operations covered by the\nEU guarantee as necessary to fulfil its reporting duties or requests by the\nEuropean Court of Auditors as well as an auditor\u2019s certificate on the\noutstanding of the Financing Operations covered.\nA mid-term evaluation will be carried out after three years from the\nstart of the mandate.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThe risk for the EU budget is linked to the budget guarantee\nprovided by the Union to the EIB for its operations in third countries. The\nguarantee provides a comprehensive cover for all payments not received by the\nEIB under sovereign and sub-sovereign operations and only political risk cover\nfor other operations with a sharing of risk between the Union and the EIB. In\nany case, the EU guarantee is restricted to 65 % of the aggregate amount of\ncredits disbursed and guarantees less amounts reimbursed, plus all related\namounts. \nThe budget entry (\"p.m.\") reflecting the budget guarantee\nfor the EIB loans to third countries would be activated only in the case of an\neffective call on the guarantee by the EIB which cannot be wholly covered by\nthe Guarantee Fund. Although such recourse to the budget (i.e. beyond the Guarantee\nFund amounting to EUR 2,002 mn on 31 December\n2012) is considered to be highly unlikely, the comments associated with the\nbudgetary line reflect the financing needs which could arise in the event of a payment\nrequest by the EIB relating to a default covered by the EU guarantee.\nIn 2012 and early 2013, the Guarantee Fund was called to cover\ndefaults on loans in Syria. In the yearly reports from the Commission to the EP\nand to the Council on guarantees covered by the general budget, country risk\nindicators are analysed and indicate the evolution of risk of defaults. The\nreport provides information on quantitative aspects of the risk borne by the EU\nBudget. However, the quality of the risks depends on the type of operation and\nthe standing of the borrowers. The risk assessment in the report is based on\nthe information on the economic and financial situation, ratings and other\nknown facts of the countries having received guaranteed loans. \n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control method(s) envisaged\n\nThe Commission is responsible for managing the EU guarantee. EIB financing\noperations in the context of the proposed Decision will be carried out\naccording to EIB standard rules of procedure and sound banking practice. The\nEIB and the Commission enter into an agreement laying down the detailed\nprovisions and procedures relating to the implementation of the proposed\nDecision.

In line with this Regulation, loans are provisioned\non the basis of the outstanding amount at the end of a year. The provisioning\namount is calculated at the beginning of the year \"n\" as the\ndifference between the target amount (9% of the outstanding amount) and the\nFund's net assets at the end of the year \"n-1\". This provisioning\namount is introduced in the year \"n\" to the \"n+1\"\npreliminary budget and effectively paid in one transaction at the beginning of\nthe year \"n+1\" from budget line 01 0306.\nThe Guarantee Fund also covers\nMacro-financial Assistance and Euratom loans which fall outside the scope of\nthe proposed Decision. Therefore, the estimated budgetary needs take into\naccount existing signed operations as well as potential new operations under\nthese two activities. The effective annual needs for provisioning of the\nGuarantee Fund in 2014-2020 will ultimately depend on the actual rhythm of\nsignatures, disbursements and reimbursement of the loans on the three activities,\nas well as the evolution of the Guarantee Fund assets. \nThe table below highlights the expected\nexternal action activities covered by the Guarantee Fund for the period\n2012-2020 (volume of signatures and disbursements of loans). \n External action activities covered by the Guarantee Fund and Guarantee Fund assets 2012-2020 (EUR ml) \n   || \u00a0 ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   ||   || 2012 || 2013 || 2014 || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 || 2020 \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n (A)  Indicative volume of signed EIB financing operations (New Decision 2014-2020 - Total of fixed ceiling = EUR 25,000 million) || 3 959 || 4 450 || 3 600 || 3 600 || 3 600 || 3 550 || 3 500 || 3 550 || 3 550 \n (B)  Outstanding disbursed amount of EIB operations based on estimated disbursements and amortisations (old and new Decisions) || 22 526 || 25 826 || 29 098 || 31 685 || 34 024 || 35 600 || 37 187 || 38 274 || 39 533 \n (C)  Outstanding disbursed amount of other operations based on estimated disbursements and amortisations (MFA+ Euratom) || 573 || 1 310 || 2 187 || 2 266 || 2 336 || 2 204 || 1 725 || 1 230 || 907 \n (D) = (B) + (C) || Total outstanding disbursed amount based on estimated disbursements and amortisations || 23 099 || 27 136 || 31 285 || 33 951 || 36 360 || 37 804 || 38 912 || 38 504 || 40 440 \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Notes: || (C) These figures include new possible MFA and Euratom loans. ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   \nWhile the lending volumes should be\ncompatible with the overall provisioning foreseen for the Financial Framework,\nannual needs for the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund could vary as they will\neventually be calculated on the basis of the total outstanding disbursed amount\nat the end of year n-2. Should the annual needs in a\nfuture year exceed the foreseen provisioning amount for that year, the\nadditional contribution will principally come through a reallocation from the\nfinancing instruments incorporating geographical programming, especially in\ncase of activation of the optional additional ceiling. The budgetary impact of the possible activation\nof the optional additional ceiling would have to be calculated on the basis of\nupdated forecasts on provisioning needs at the time of the mid-term review.\nThe expected needs for 2014-2020 take account of the impact of existing calls on\nSyrian defaulted loans having taken place in 2012 and early 2013, as well as further\nexpected calls during two years after the adoption of this proposal, if the\ndefault situation persists over these years. However, they do not take into\naccount the exceptional budgetary needs such as further possible defaults on\npayments by other loan beneficiaries which may occur, or adjustments of the\nvaluation of the Fund's assets. It is indeed difficult\nto estimate potential further defaults on payments. It should be recalled that,\naccording to the Guarantee Fund Regulation, the replenishment of the Fund is a\ncompulsory expenditure which would require, in case of unexpected defaults, the\nrecourse to other Heading 4 resources.\nThe semi-annual Commission reports to the\nEuropean Parliament and the Council on guarantees covered by the general budget\nallow for the factoring in of the maximum risks covered by the budget (cf. the\nreport [COM(2013)211 and the accompanying staff working document SWD(2013)130 - Situation at 30 June 2012]).\n3.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimated impact
