Bluefin tuna is the most important species in the\nInternational Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (hereinafter\n\"ICCAT\") and is currently the only one under a multi-annual recovery\nplan. This transposition relates to critical provisions in the recovery plan\nthat were extensively discussed and adopted at the ICCAT Annual Meeting in\nNovember 2012 under Recommendation 12-03. \nAt its 16th Special Meeting in 2008, ICCAT\nestablished by the Convention, adopted Recommendation 08-05 to introduce a new\nrecovery plan for Bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and in the Mediterranean, replacing the previous recovery plan adopted in 2006. In anticipation of\nRecommendation 08-05 becoming effective, Council Regulation (EC) No 302/2009[1] was adopted. \nAt its 17th Special Meeting in 2010, ICCAT\nadopted Recommendation 10-04 amending the multiannual recovery plan for Bluefin\ntuna. In order to rebuild the stock, Recommendation 10-04 provides for a\nfurther reduction of the total allowable catch, for the strengthening of\nmeasures to reduce the fishing capacity and for the reinforcement of the\ncontrol measures, in particular concerning the transfer and the caging\noperations, and foresees additional advice by the Standing Committee on\nResearch and Statistics (SCRS) in 2012 on the identification of spawning\ngrounds and on the creation of sanctuaries.\nAt its Special\nMeeting in 2012, ICCAT adopted Recommendation 12-03 amending the multiannual\nrecovery plan for Bluefin tuna. In order to better adapt the fishing seasons to\nthe activity of the fleet, Recommendation 12-03 provides for a modification of \"open\"\nfishing seasons which differs from the \"closed' fishing seasons set out in\nArticle 7 of Council Regulation 302/2009 as amended by Article 1 (6) of\nRegulation (EU) 500/2012[2].\nIn addition, the actual dates when fishing is permitted by purse seiners, bait\nboats and trolling boats have been modified. Finally, to avoid any uncertainty\nfor those gears which are not subject to any specific rules on fishing season,\nit was necessary to include a provision explicitly allowing all other gears the\npossibility to fish all year round. \nThere were however a number of objections from\nICCAT Contracting Parties to this recommendation, which have delayed its entry\ninto force until, most probably, August 2013. However, these objections were related\nto the allocation of the TACs and did not concern the fishing seasons. Moreover,\nduring a recent inter-sessional meeting held in Seville (18-20 February 2013), ICCAT\nContracting Parties indicated their intention to implement the provisions of\nRecommendation 12-03, including the new fishing season for purse seiners (26\nMay to 24 June), as laid down in paragraph 22 of the Recommendation.\nAs regards the 2013 fishing season, the\nCouncil has already established in Council Regulation\n(EU) N\u00b0 40/2013[3]\nfixing for 2013 the fishing opportunities available in EU waters and, to EU\nvessels, in certain non-EU waters for certain fish stocks and groups of fish\nstocks which are subject to international negotiations and agreements, that the\nseason for purse-seiners will be from 26 May 2013 to 24\nJune 2013, in order to allow Member States sufficient\ntime for planning. Only purse-seiners' fishing season was addressed in that\nRegulation due to its timing and level of importance of that gear given its\nhigher catching capacity and previous cases of non-compliance.\nPending a comprehensive implementation of Recommendation\n12-03 and its entry into force, in order to ensure effective conservation of\nthe bluefin tuna stock by ensuring compliance with these new fishing seasons and\nfacilitating enforcement activities, and to provide legal certainty as to the\nfishing seasons concerned, it is therefore necessary to modify the provision\nconcerning fishing seasons in Council Regulation 302/2009.\nFor these reasons, as well as to allow\nMember States to properly define their fishing, capacity and inspection plans which\nare linked to the fishing seasons and fulfil their reporting obligations, it is\nnecessary to modify that provision as soon as possible and to apply these\nmodifications with retroactive effect as from 1 January 2013. \nRegulation (EC) 302/2009 should therefore\nbe amended accordingly.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nMember States concerned by this fishery\n(CY, ES, FR, GR, IT, MT and PT) have been consulted during the Steering Group\nfor the Joint deployment Plan for the Bluefin tuna held in the Headquarters of\nthe European Fishery Control Agency in Vigo 11th December 2012 on the need to\nclarify the dates of the fishing season. All of them agree to introduce the\ndates as defined in paragraphs 21 to 26 of the ICCAT Recommendation 12-03\namending the recommendation by ICCAT to establish a multi-annual recovery plan\nfor Bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe aim of the Proposal is to transpose\ninto EU law a recommendation that has been adopted in the framework of the\nICCAT by way of an amendment to Council Regulation No 302/2009 as regards the\nfishing seasons for gears fishing bluefin tuna. The limited scope of this proposal implies that it is necessary in view\nof ensuring a rapid adoption of the Regulation before the beginning of the 2013\nfishing season.\n2013/0133 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\n302/2009 concerning a multiannual recovery plan for Bluefin tuna in the eastern\nAtlantic and Mediterranean \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43 (2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union is a Party to\nthe International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas\n(hereinafter \"the Convention\").\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its 16th Special\nMeeting in 2008, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic\nTunas (hereinafter \"ICCAT\"), established by the Convention, adopted\nRecommendation 08-05 to establish a new recovery plan for Bluefin tuna in the\neastern Atlantic and in the Mediterranean, replacing the previous recovery plan\nadopted in 2006.
