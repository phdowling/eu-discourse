These d\u00e9marches consisted inter alia of\r\nactions providing reasons of its actions, opportunity for the countries to\r\nrespond and refute, right to ask for and provide additional information,\r\nproposed actions plans to remedy the situation as well as adequate time to\r\nanswer and reasonable time to remedy the situation. \nOn XX XXXX 2013 the Commission, by\r\nCommission Implementing Decision, identified Belize, the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Republic of Guinea as third countries that the\r\nCommission considers as non-cooperating third countries pursuant to the\r\nIUU Regulation.\nThe attached proposal for a Council Implementing\r\nDecision is based on the findings which have confirmed that Belize, the Kingdom\r\nof Cambodia and the Republic of Guinea have failed to discharge the duties\r\nincumbent upon them under international law as flag, port, coastal or market\r\nStates. \nIt is therefore proposed that the Council\r\nadopts the attached proposal for a Decision.\nLegal basis\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29\r\nSeptember 2008 on establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and\r\neliminate IUU fishing.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\r\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the IUU Regulation\r\nand leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and\r\nadministrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional\r\nand local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimised and\r\nproportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: decision.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reason:\nOther means would not be adequate because\r\nthe IUU Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nUnion budget.\n2013/0406 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nestablishing a list of non-cooperating\r\nthird countries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate\r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate\r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, amending Regulations (EEC) No\r\n2847/93, (EC) No 1936/2001 and (EC) No 601/2004 and repealing Regulations (EC)\r\nNo 1093/94 and (EC) No 1447/1999[2],\r\nand in particular Article 33 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\r\nthe European Commission (the Commission), \nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 INTRODUCTION\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1005/2008 (the IUU Regulation) establishes a Union system to prevent, deter and\r\neliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VI of the IUU\r\nRegulation lays down the procedure with respect to the identification of\r\nnon-cooperating third countries, d\u00e9marches in respect of countries identified\r\nas non-cooperating third countries, the establishment of a list of\r\nnon-cooperating countries, removal from the list of non-cooperating countries,\r\npublicity of the list of non-cooperating countries and any emergency measures.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n32 of the IUU Regulation, with the Commission Decision of 15 November 2012, the\r\nCommission notified eight third countries that the Commission considered as\r\npossible of being identified as non-cooperating countries pursuant to Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter\r\nand eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Decision of 15\r\nNovember 2012 the Commission included the information concerning the essential\r\nfacts and considerations underlying such identification. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 November 2012 the Commission\r\nnotified the eight third countries with separate letters of the fact that it\r\nwas considering the possibility of identifying them as non-cooperating third\r\ncountries. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission\r\nhighlighted, in these letters, that in order to avoid being identified and\r\nproposed for formal listing as a non-cooperating third country as foreseen in\r\nArticles 31 and 33 of the IUU Regulation, the third countries concerned were\r\ninvited to establish, in close cooperation, with the Commission an action plan\r\nto rectify the shortcomings identified in the Commission Decision of 15\r\nNovember 2012. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence, the\r\nCommission invited the eight third countries concerned: (1) to take all\r\nnecessary measures to implement the actions contained in the action plans\r\nsuggested by the Commission; (2) to assess the implementation of the actions\r\ncontained in the action plans suggested by the Commission; (3) to send every\r\nsix months detailed reports to the Commission assessing the implementation of\r\neach action as regards, inter alia, their individual and/or overall\r\neffectiveness in ensuring a fully compliant fisheries control system. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The eight third countries\r\nconcerned were given the opportunity to respond in writing on issues explicitly\r\nindicated in the Commission Decision of 15 November 2012 as well as on other\r\nrelevant information, allowing them to submit evidence in order to refute or\r\ncomplete the facts invoked in the Decision of 15 November 2012 or to adopt, as\r\nappropriate, a plan of action to improve and measures taken to rectify the\r\nsituation. The eight countries were guaranteed of their right to ask for, or to\r\nprovide, additional information. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 November 2012, the\r\nCommission opened a process of dialogue with the eight third countries and\r\nhighlighted that it considers a period of 6 months as being in principle\r\nsufficient for reaching an agreement on this matter. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission continued to\r\nseek and verify all information it deemed necessary. The oral and written\r\ncomments submitted by the eight countries following the Commission Decision of\r\n15 November 2012 were considered and, taken into account. The eight countries\r\nwere kept informed either orally or in writing on the Commission's\r\nconsiderations.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Decision xx XXXX\r\n2013 identifies Belize, the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Republic of Guinea as non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing. It provides the reasons for\r\nwhich the Commission considers that these three countries fail to discharge\r\ntheir duties under international law as flag, port, coastal or market State to\r\ntake action, prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing in accordance with\r\nArticle 31 of the IUU regulation.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council Implementing Decision\r\nplacing Belize, the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Republic of Guinea on the list\r\nof non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing is thus taken in the\r\ncontext of the implementation of the IUU Regulation and is the result of\r\ninvestigation and dialogue procedures which were carried out in line with the\r\nsubstantive and procedural requirements laid out in the IUU Regulation. Those\r\ninvestigation and dialogue procedures including the correspondence exchanged\r\nand the meetings held, as well as the Commission Decision of 15 November 2012\r\nand Commission decision xx XXXX are at the basis of the present Decision and\r\nform integral part of it. This Implementing Decision placing Belize, the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Republic of Guinea on the list of non-cooperating third\r\ncountries in fighting IUU fishing should entail the consequences stated in\r\nArticle 38 of the IUU Regulation. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 34 (1)\r\nof the IUU Regulation the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal\r\nfrom the Commission, shall remove a third country from the list of\r\nnon-cooperating third countries if the third country concerned demonstrates\r\nthat the situation that warranted its listing has been rectified. A removal\r\ndecision shall also take into consideration whether the identified third\r\ncountries concerned have taken concrete measures capable of achieving a lasting\r\nimprovement of this situation. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE WITH RESPECT TO BELIZE\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 November 2012, the Commission\r\nnotified Belize with a Commission Decision pursuant to the provisions of\r\nArticle 32 of the IUU Regulation that it considered the possibility of\r\nidentifying Belize as a non-cooperating third country[3] and invited Belize to establish in close cooperation with its services an action plan to rectify the\r\nshortcomings identified in the Commission Decision. During the period from\r\nDecember 2012 to August 2013 Belize made written submissions making its views\r\nknown and met with the Commission to discuss points pertaining to the matter.\r\nThe Commission provided in writing to Belize relevant information. The\r\nCommission continued to seek and verify all information it deemed necessary.\r\nThe oral and written comments submitted by Belize following the Commission\r\nDecision of 15 November 2012 were considered and taken into account, while Belize was kept informed either orally or in writing on the Commission's considerations.\r\nThe Commission took the view that the areas of concern and shortcomings as\r\ndescribed in the Commission Decision of 15 November 2012 have not been\r\naddressed sufficiently by Belize. Moreover, the Commission concluded that the\r\nmeasures suggested in the accompanying action plan have not been fully\r\nimplemented either. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IDENTIFICATION OF BELIZE AS A NON-COOPERATING THIRD COUNTRY\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the\r\nCommission Decision of 15 November 2012 the Commission\r\nanalysed the duties of Belize and evaluated its compliance with its\r\ninternational obligations as flag, port, coastal or market State. For the\r\npurpose of this review the Commission took into account the parameters listed\r\nin Article 31(4) to (7) of the IUU Regulation.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 31(3)\r\nof the IUU Regulation the Commission reviewed the compliance of Belize with its\r\ninternational obligations as flag, port, coastal or market State in line with\r\nthe findings in the Commission Decision of 15 November 2012 and with relevant\r\ninformation provided thereon by Belize, with the proposed plan of action as\r\nwell as with the measures taken to rectify the situation. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main shortcomings\r\nidentified by the Commission in the suggested action plan were related to several\r\nfailures to implement international law obligations, linked in particular to\r\nthe adoption of an adequate legal framework, the lack of an adequate and\r\nefficient monitoring, lack of a control and inspection scheme, lack of a\r\ndeterrent sanctioning system, and of a proper implementation of the catch\r\ncertification scheme. The identified shortcomings relate, more generally to the\r\ncompliance with international obligations including Regional Fisheries\r\nManagement Organisations (RFMOs) recommendations and resolutions and conditions\r\nfor registration of vessels according to international law. Lack of compliance\r\nwith recommendations and resolutions from relevant bodies such as the\r\nInternational Plan of Action against Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated\r\nfishing of the United Nations (IPOA-UN) has also been identified. However, the\r\nlack of compliance with non-binding recommendations and resolutions has been\r\nconsidered only as supporting evidence and not as a basis for the\r\nidentification.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Commission Implementing\r\nDecision of xx XXXX 2013 the Commission identified Belize as third country\r\nconsidered as non-cooperating third country pursuant to Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate\r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to the\r\npossible constraints of Belize as developing country it is noted that the\r\ndevelopment status and overall performance of Belize with respect to fisheries\r\nare not impaired by its level of development. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the\r\nview of all the above decisions, and of the dialogue process with Belize\r\nentertained by the Commission and its outcome, it can be concluded that the actions undertaken by Belize in light of its duties as flag State\r\nare insufficient to comply with the provisions of Articles 91, 94, 117 118 of United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), Articles 18, 19, 20 of United\r\nNations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNSFA) and Article II(8) of FAO Compliance\r\nAgreement.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore,\r\n  Belize has failed to discharge its duties under international law as flag State to take action, prevent, deter and eliminate IUU\r\nfishing and should be included in the Union list of\r\nnon-cooperating third countries. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE WITH RESPECT TO THE KINGDOM OF CAMBODIA\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\n15 November 2012, the Commission notified the Kingdom of Cambodia (Cambodia) with\r\na Commission Decision pursuant to the provisions of Article 32 of the IUU\r\nRegulation that it considered the possibility of identifying Cambodia as a\r\nnon-cooperating third country[4] and\r\ninvited Cambodia to establish in close cooperation with its services an action\r\nplan to rectify the shortcomings identified in the Commission Decision. During\r\nthe period from December 2012 to June 2013 Cambodia made written submissions\r\nmaking its views known and met with the Commission to discuss points pertaining\r\nto the matter in subject. The Commission provided in writing to Cambodia relevant information. The Commission continued to seek and verify all information\r\nit deemed necessary. The oral and written comments submitted by Cambodia following the Commission Decision of 15 November 2012 were considered and taken into\r\naccount, while Cambodia was kept informed either orally or in writing on the\r\nCommission's considerations. The Commission took the view that the areas of\r\nconcern and shortcomings as described in the Commission Decision of 15 November\r\n2012 have not been addressed sufficiently by Cambodia. Moreover, the Commission\r\nconcluded that the measures suggested in the accompanying action plan have not\r\nbeen fully implemented either. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IDENTIFICATION OF CAMBODIA AS A NON-COOPERATING THIRD COUNTRY\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the\r\nCommission Decision of 15 November 2012 the Commission\r\nanalysed the duties of Cambodia and evaluated its compliance with its\r\ninternational obligations as flag, port, coastal or market State. For the\r\npurpose of this review the Commission took into account the parameters listed\r\nin Article 31(4) to (7) of the IUU Regulation.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 31(3)\r\nof the IUU Regulation the Commission reviewed the compliance of Cambodia with\r\nits international obligations as flag, port, coastal or market State in line\r\nwith the findings in the Commission Decision of 15 November 2012 and with the\r\nproposed plan of action, as further elaborated with the relevant information\r\nprovided by Cambodia.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main shortcomings\r\nidentified by the Commission in the suggested action plan were related to the\r\nfailures to implement international law obligations, linked in particular to\r\nthe adoption of an adequate legal framework, an adequate and efficient\r\nmonitoring, control and inspection scheme, a deterrent sanctioning system. The\r\nidentified shortcomings relate, more generally to the compliance with\r\ninternational obligations and conditions for registration of vessels according\r\nto international law. Lack of compliance with recommendations and resolutions\r\nfrom relevant bodies such as the IPOA \u2013UN has also been identified. However,\r\nthe lack of compliance with non-binding recommendations and resolutions has\r\nbeen considered only as supporting evidence and not as a basis for the\r\nidentification.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Commission\r\nImplementing Decision of xx XXXX 2013 the Commission identified Cambodia as third country considered as non-cooperating third country pursuant to Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter\r\nand eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to the\r\npossible constraints of Cambodia as developing country it is noted that the\r\ndevelopment status and overall performance of Cambodia with respect to\r\nfisheries are not impaired by its level of development. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The actions undertaken by Cambodia in light of its duties as flag\r\nState, are insufficient to comply with the provisions of Articles 91 and 94 of the\r\nUNCLOS. It is recalled that it is immaterial whether Cambodia has actually\r\nratified UNCLOS since the provisions of UNCLOS on the navigation in the High\r\nSeas (Articles 86 to 115 of UNCLOS) have been recognised as customary\r\ninternational law. These provisions indeed codify pre-existing rules of\r\ncustomary international law and take over almost literally the wording of the\r\nConvention on the High Seas and the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, which Cambodia has respectively ratified and acceded to. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the\r\nview of all the above decisions, and of the dialogue process with Cambodia entertained by the Commission and its outcome, it can be concluded that the actions undertaken by Cambodia in light of its duties as flag\r\nState are insufficient to comply with the provisions of Articles 91 and 94 of the\r\nUNCLOS.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore,\r\n  Cambodia has failed to discharge its duties under international law as flag State to take action, prevent, deter and eliminate IUU\r\nfishing and should be included in the Union list of\r\nnon-cooperating third countries. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE WITH RESPECT TO THE REPUBLIC OF   GUINEA\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 November 2012, the Commission\r\nnotified the Republic of Guinea (Guinea) with a Commission Decision pursuant to\r\nthe provisions of Article 32 of the IUU Regulation that it considered the\r\npossibility of identifying Guinea as a non-cooperating third country[5] and invited Guinea to establish\r\nin close cooperation with its services an action plan to rectify the\r\nshortcomings identified in the Commission Decision. During the period from\r\nDecember 2012 to July 2013 Guinea made written submissions making its views\r\nknown and met with the Commission to discuss points pertaining to the matter in\r\nsubject. The Commission provided in writing to Guinea relevant information. The\r\nCommission continued to seek and verify all information it deemed necessary.\r\nThe oral and written comments submitted by Guinea following the Commission\r\nDecision of 15 November 2012 were considered and taken into account, while Guinea was kept informed either orally or in writing on the Commission's considerations.\r\nThe Commission took the view that the areas of concern and shortcomings as\r\ndescribed in the Commission Decision of 15 November 2012 have not been\r\naddressed sufficiently by Guinea. Moreover, the Commission concluded that the\r\nmeasures suggested in the accompanying action plan have not been fully\r\nimplemented either. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IDENTIFICATION OF GUINEA AS A NON-COOPERATING THIRD COUNTRY\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the\r\nCommission Decision of 15 November 2012 the Commission\r\nanalysed the duties of Guinea and evaluated its compliance with its\r\ninternational obligations as flag, port, coastal or market State. For the\r\npurpose of this review the Commission took into account the parameters listed\r\nin Article 31(4) to (7) of the IUU Regulation.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 31(3)\r\nof the IUU Regulation the Commission reviewed the compliance of Guinea with its\r\ninternational obligations as flag, port, coastal or market State in line with\r\nthe findings in the Commission Decision of 15 November 2012 and with Guinea's\r\nrelevant information provided thereon, with the proposed plan of action as well\r\nas with the measures taken to rectify the situation. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main shortcomings\r\nidentified by the Commission in the suggested action plan were related to\r\nreforms still dues in order to ensure a sufficiently adequate and efficient\r\nmonitoring of its fishing fleet, an effective implementation of national law\r\nand regulations on fisheries, enforcement of the rules by pursuing and\r\nsanctioning the IUU fishing activities detected, reinforcement of the means for\r\ninspection and surveillance, deterrent sanctioning system, fisheries policy\r\nconsistent with administrative capacity in terms of control and surveillance.\r\nThe identified shortcomings relate, more generally to the compliance with\r\ninternational obligations including RFMOs recommendations and resolutions and\r\nconditions for registration of vessels according to international law. Lack of\r\ncompliance with recommendations and resolutions from relevant bodies such as the\r\nIPOA \u2013 UN has also been identified. However, the lack of compliance with\r\nnon-binding recommendations and resolutions has been considered only as\r\nsupporting evidence and not as a basis for the identification.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Commission\r\nImplementing Decision of xx XXXX 2013 the Commission identified Guinea as third country considered as non-cooperating third country pursuant to Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter\r\nand eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to the\r\npossible constraints of Guinea as developing country it is noted that the\r\ndevelopment status of Guinea may be impaired by its level of development.\r\nHowever, account taken of the nature of the established shortcomings of Guinea,\r\nthe assistance provided by the EU and the Member States, and the actions taken\r\nto rectify the situation, the development level of that country cannot explain\r\nthe overall performance of Guinea as flag or coastal State with respect to\r\nfisheries and the insufficiency of its action to prevent, deter and eliminate\r\nIUU fishing. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the\r\nview of all the above decisions, and of the dialogue process with Guinea\r\nentertained by the Commission and its outcome, it can be concluded that the actions undertaken by Guinea in light of its duties as flag and\r\ncoastal State are insufficient to comply with the provisions of Articles 61,\r\n62, 94, 117 and 118 of the UNCLOS and Articles 18, 19 and 20 of the UNFSA.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore,\r\n  Guinea has failed to discharge its duties under international law as flag and coastal State to take action, prevent, deter and\r\neliminate IUU fishing and should be included in the Union\r\nlist of non-cooperating third countries. \n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTABLISHMENT OF A LIST OF NON\r\nCOOPERATING THIRD COUNTRIES\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\r\nreached above with regard to Belize, Cambodia and Guinea, those countries\r\nshould be included in a list of non-cooperating third countries to be\r\nestablished containing in accordance with Article 33 of the IUU Regulation.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The action in respect of Belize, Cambodia and   Guinea in the form of measures that shall apply are listed in Article 38 of\r\nthe IUU Regulation. The prohibition of importation covers all stocks and\r\nspecies, as defined in Article 2(8) of the IUU Regulation, since the\r\nidentification is not justified by the lack of appropriate measures adopted in\r\nrelation to IUU fishing affecting a given stock or species. In line with the\r\ndefinition in Article 2(11) of the IUU Regulation importation means the\r\nintroduction of fishery products into the territory of the Union, including for\r\ntranshipment purposes at ports in its territory.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is noted that IUU\r\nfishing inter alia depletes fish stocks, destroys marine habitats,\r\nundermines the conservation and sustainable use of\r\nmarine resources, distorts competition, endangers food\r\nsecurity, puts honest fishermen at an unfair disadvantage and weakens coastal\r\ncommunities. In view of the magnitude of the problems related to IUU fishing it\r\nis considered necessary for the Union to implement expeditiously the actions in\r\nrespect to Belize, Cambodia and Guinea as non-cooperating countries. In the\r\nlight of the foregoing the present Decision should enter into force on the day\r\nfollowing that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European\r\nUnion. \n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If Belize, Cambodia and   Guinea demonstrate that the situation that warranted its listing has been\r\nrectified, the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the\r\nCommission, shall remove a third country from the list of non-cooperating third\r\ncountries in line with Article 34 (1) of the IUU Regulation. A removal decision\r\nshall also take into consideration whether the Belize, Cambodia and Guinea have taken concrete measures capable of achieving a lasting improvement of this\r\nsituation. \nDECIDES AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nThe Union list of non-cooperating third\r\ncountries is established in the Annex to this decision. \nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\nday following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European\r\nUnion. \nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nANNEX\nList of non-cooperating third countries in fighting Illegal\r\nUnreported and Unregulated (\u201cIUU\u201d) fishing\nBelize\nKingdom of Cambodia\nRepublic of Guinea\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 1.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Letter to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries\r\nof Belize of 15.11.2012. \n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Letter to the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and\r\nFisheries of the Kingdom of Cambodia of 15.11.2012. \n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Letter to the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture\r\nof Guinea of 15.11.2012. \n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
