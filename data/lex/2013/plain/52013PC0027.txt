And on 6 June\n2012, the Commission adopted the Communication on strengthening the governance\nof the single market, which likewise stresses the importance of the transport\nsector[3].\nIn the last decade, the EU railway market\nhas seen massive changes, gradually introduced by three legislative \u2018railway\npackages\u2019 (and some accompanying acts) intended to open up the national markets\nand make railways more competitive and interoperable at EU level, while\nmaintaining a high level of safety. However, despite the considerable\ndevelopment of EU laws and other measures (the \u2018EU acquis\u2019) establishing\nan internal market for rail transport services, the railways\u2019 share of intra-EU\ntransport has remained modest. The Commission has therefore come forward with a\nFourth Railway Package to enhance the quality and efficiency of rail services\nby removing the remaining market obstacles.\nThe present Regulation is a component of\nthe Fourth Railway Package focusing on the removal of remaining administrative\nand technical barriers, in particular by establishing a common approach to\nsafety and interoperability rules to increase economies of scale for railway\nundertakings active across the EU, decreasing administrative costs and\naccelerating administrative procedures, as well as avoiding disguised\ndiscrimination, through a European Union Agency for Railways. It is intended to\nreplace the original founding Regulation, and add new important tasks to the\nAgency making it a truly European Railway Authority in the field of\ninteroperability and safety.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why to replace existing Regulation\n881/2004 (as amended) with a new act?\nSince 2004, when the original founding\nRegulation was drafted, a number of developments have taken place in relation\nto the European railways and the Agency. There has been mounting evidence on\nthe functioning of the EU railway internal market, also in relation to its\ninteroperability and safety aspects. New legislation emerged which resulted in\namending the Agency Regulation (2008) or which developed the existing tasks of\nERA without changing its Regulation (e.g. Decision 2011/155/EU).\nThe impact assessment report accompanying\nthis proposal has identified a number of measures which would give new powers\nto the Agency and streamline existing processes. \nMoreover, a number of changes have to be\nintroduced to improve the functioning of the Agency in result of the evaluation\nof ERA founding Regulation and of the Agency (2009-2010) as well as the\nrecommendations of the Joint Statement of the Commission, the European\nParliament and the Council on decentralised agencies (2012), and the Position paper\nof the Administrative Board on the future of the Agency (2012). This concerns\nparticularly improvements to internal structure, governance and decision-making\nof the Agency, and its relations with stakeholders.\nA new Regulation will also help to clarify the\nstructure of the legal act (e.g. by removing and renumbering the Articles) and\nmake it more logical (e.g. by moving some Articles to more relevant Chapters,\ncreating new Chapters and deleting the obsolete ones). Finally, the\nInteroperability and Safety Directives are also being amended within this\nlegislative package and they are closely related to the tasks of ERA, therefore\nthis Regulation has to properly take this into account.\nOn the basis above, and taking into account\nthe advice of the Legal Service, the Commission intends to propose a new ERA Regulation\nreplacing original Regulation 881/2004. There is a number of changes in\nrelation to Regulation 881/2004, which can be grouped in three different\ncategories:\n\u00b7                        \nNew provisions: new\ntasks of the Agency (issuing vehicle authorisations for placing on the market, authorisations\nfor placing in service of trackside control-command and signalling sub-systems and\nsafety certificates), reinforced control over national authorities, more powers\nin relation to national rules, new source of ERA\u2019s budget (fees and charges),\nthe Board of Appeal; some new provisions \u2013 especially in the internal\norganisation part \u2013 result from the Common Approach on the EU agencies.\n\u00b7                        \nClarification/simplification of existing\nprovisions: especially in relation to working\nmethods, the ERTMS, railway staff, registers, other tasks.\n\u00b7                        \nUpdates due to\nthe evolution of the legislative and political framework: provisions concerning\ninternal structure and operation, as well as references to comitology\nprocedures and delegated acts.\n\u00b7                        \nEditorial changes\nin relation to the original Regulation.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Links between this\nRegulation and the Interoperability and Safety Directives\nDirective 2008/57/EC (Railway\nInteroperability Directive) and Directive 2004/49/EC (Railway Safety Directive)\nare closely linked with original Regulation 881/2004. In the 4th\nrailway package, these Directives are proposed to be recast; they will,\nnevertheless, remain closely linked with the present Regulation. This\npredominantly stems from the fact that the Agency acts in the fields of railway\ninteroperability and safety for which those directives provide the legal basis.\nIn the present Regulation, the links concern\nin particular:\n\u2013                        \ntechnical specifications for interoperability\n(TSIs; Interoperability Directive), common safety targets (CSTs; Safety\nDirective) and common safety methods (CSMs; Safety Directive): the Agency is\nresponsible for drawing up recommendations for them to be adopted by the\nCommission, and for issuing opinions to the Commission regarding\nnon-application of TSIs;\n\u2013                        \nsafety certificates: the Agency is responsible\nfor issuing them, while the full procedure is provided in the Safety Directive;\n\u2013                        \nregisters: the Agency is responsible for issuing\nrecommendations to the Commission regarding specification for registers\n(referred to in the Interoperability Directive) and their revision, and\nensuring there are accessible to the public;\n\u2013                        \nauthorisations for placing on the market for\nrailway vehicles and types of vehicles and authorisation for placing in service\nof trackside control-command and signalling sub-systems: the Agency is\nresponsible for issuing them, while the full procedure for applying for them is\nprovided in the Interoperability Directive;\n\u2013                        \ntelematics applications and European Rail\nTraffic Management System (ERTMS): these are specific areas governed by\nrelevant TSIs adopted under the Interoperability Directive where the Agency has\nan important role to play being a system authority;\n\u2013                        \nnotified conformity assessment bodies: the\nAgency is responsible for supporting and monitoring their activities while they\nare created and given tasks by the Interoperability Directive;\n\u2013                        \nnational safety authorities: the Agency is\nresponsible for supporting and monitoring their activities while they are\ncreated and given tasks by the Safety Directive;\n\u2013                        \nnational railway rules: the Agency is\nresponsible for their examination with a view to their reduction while the\nprocedure for their notification is provided for in the Safety and Interoperability\nDirectives. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Commission services have discussed the\ndevelopments of the Single European Railway Area with sector representatives on\nan on-going basis. In 2010-2011 it conducted an ex post evaluation of\nRegulation 881/2004 and the functioning of the European Union Agency for\nRailways[4]. This evaluation, together\nwith the general evaluation of the EU Agencies in 2009, showed the added value\nprovided by the Agency and in general a positive opinion of stakeholders in\nrelation to ERA and its outputs. The results of the evaluation have been used\nas an important input and preparatory work to the subsequent process of impact\nassessment linked with the revision of the Regulation.\nThe European Commission carried out a\nthorough impact assessment to support legislative proposals on improving the efficiency\nand competitiveness of the Single European Railway Area in the field of\ninteroperability and safety. An Impact Assessment Steering Group (IASG) was\ncreated in June 2011 to which all DGs were invited by DG MOVE to participate.\nAn external consultant drafted an impact\nassessment support study and conducted a targeted consultation of stakeholders.\nThe targeted consultation started on 18 November 2011 with an internet survey\nthat finished on 30 December 2011. It was followed by interviews with the most\nsignificant stakeholders and a stakeholder workshop at the end of February\n2012.\nSince then, DG MOVE has engaged in\nbilateral meetings with the sector to gauge their views on what should be done\nin the Fourth Package in the area of interoperability and safety.\nGiven the technical nature of the\ninitiative, no public consultation was carried out. However, the Commission took\ncare that all interested parties were consulted in due time and discussions\ncovered all the key elements of the initiative.\nImpact Assessment Board:\nOn 5 September 2012 the Impact Assessment\nBoard met and subsequently gave a positive opinion. The Board\u2019s main recommendations\nwere incorporated in the impact assessment report:\n\u2013                        \nmore statistics and information on stakeholders\u2019\nconsultation were added;\n\u2013                        \nexpected synergies with other elements of the Fourth\nRailway Package were added and indirect impacts clarified;\n\u2013                        \nthe core measures common to options 2-5 were\ndescribed in more detail and clarified regarding their differentiation;\n\u2013                        \nthe methods used to assess impact were clarified\nand better explained; the logic was brought out by better cross-referencing;\n\u2013                        \nadministrative costs for economic actors\n(railway operators) and the cost to public administrations (national\nauthorities, ERA and the Commission) were distinguished more clearly.\nOptions identified:\nBased on the screening of individual\nmeasures, the Commission has identified five policy options (options 2-6),\nbesides the baseline scenario. By construction, options 2-5 concern primarily\nthe level of interaction between the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA or\nthe Agency) and national authorities and are all capable of tackling the three\noperational objectives. Option 6 is a set of horizontal measures which are\nmostly independent of the interactions between ERA and national authorities and\ncan be applied on top of any of the option 2-5, with expected reinforcement of\nthe overall final impact.\nOption 1: Baseline scenario (do nothing) \u2014\ncontinuing on the path that is currently set out for the sector\nOption 2: Greater coordination role for the\nAgency in ensuring a consistent approach to certification of railway\nundertakings and vehicle authorisation\nOption 3: ERA as a one-stop-shop, where the\nfinal decision on certification and authorisation remains with the NSAs but ERA\nperforms entry and exit checks of applications and of the decisions\nOption 4: ERA and NSAs share competencies,\nwhere the final decision on certification and authorisation is taken by the\nAgency\nOption 5: ERA takes over activities of NSAs\nin relation to certification of railway undertakings and vehicle authorisation\nOption 6: Horizontal measures, includes\nother legislative and soft measures (beyond sharing the responsibilities\nbetween national authorities and ERA) that could be implemented to improve the\ncompetitiveness of the rail sector, like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 enhancing the role of ERA in the\ndissemination of railway-related information and training or migrating from\nnational technical and safety rules to a system of EU rules (through the\nidentification of unnecessary rules by ERA and NSAs and then the requirement\nfor national authorities to remove those rules, as well as limiting the\npossibility of adopting new rules).\nImpacts of the options: The environmental\nimpact of all the options was assessed as positive, though low. The social\nimpact of all the options was assessed as low/marginal.\nThe table below presents the economic benefits\n(efficiency) and number of objectives met (effectiveness) for combined options:\n Option || Efficiency (Total Net Benefit \u20ac m) || Effectiveness (number of operational objectives met) \n Option 2+6: Further ERA \u2018Coordination\u2019 + horizontal measures || 411 || 1 \n Option 3+6: ERA as One-Stop-Shop+ horizontal measures || 461 || 2 \n Option 4+6: ERA and NSAs share competencies + horizontal measures || 497 || 3 \n Option 5+6: ERA takes over activities of NSAs regarding authorisation & certification+ horizontal measures || 476 || 3 \nIt was concluded that Option 4 (combined\nwith option 6) was the preferred option as it provides the best balance of\noutcomes in relation to:\n\u2013                        \nthe industry, in terms of reduced costs and\ntimescales for safety certification and vehicle and other sub-system\nauthorisation;\n\u2013                        \ncost implications for the EU budget;\n\u2013                        \nthe cost impacts on national institutions;\n\u2013                        \naccordance with the subsidiarity and\nproportionality principles;\n\u2013                        \naddressing the problems identified, and\n\u2013                        \nmeeting the objectives.\nMore information on the impact assessment\nand the results of the stakeholder consultation is provided in the Commission\nstaff working document accompanying legislative proposals to eliminate\nremaining administrative and technical barriers in the field of\ninteroperability and safety on the EU railway market. It will be published on\nthe website of the Secretariat-General of the Commission following the adoption\nof this legal act.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThis section comments on and explains the main\nprovisions of the new ERA Regulation, when necessary in relation to amendments\nto the original text of Regulation 881/2004. \nCHAPTER 1 PRINCIPLES:\nArticle 1: the objectives have been revised\nto reflect new tasks of the Agency and moved to the recitals; instead, a\n\"subject matter and scope\" is given, for clarity.\nArticle 2: legal status moved here as more\nappropriate (previously original Article 22).\nArticle 3: amended to properly reflect new\ntypes of acts of the Agency.\nCHAPTER 2\nWORKING METHODS:\nNew chapter added to cover issues which\nwere originally in other chapters but which in fact relate to the methods by which\nERA attains its objectives.\nArticle 4: \"working parties\"\narticle rewritten for legal clarity, in particular: the reference to AEIF is obsolete\nnow and can be deleted; original Article 24(4) was moved here instead of the\narticle on ERA staff; rules of procedure to be adopted by the Board.\nArticle 7: \"impact assessment\"; the\noriginal text limited cost-benefit analysis to safety only (Article 6(4)); this\ntask should not be part of any particular Agency activity, hence the need to\nmove the paragraphs into a general section, make it generally applicable and\nprovide clear tasks; this is in accordance with the Position paper of the Board\non the future of ERA and the principles of activity-based budgeting and management.\nArticle 8: \"studies\"; previously\nArticle 20 \u2014 moved as studies are means of achieving the objectives and not\ntasks as such.\nArticle 9: \"opinions\"; formerly\nArticle 10 on Technical Opinions; the word \u2018technical\u2019 is deleted, in line with\nthe directives; paragraph 2a(b) removed as obsolete; paragraph 3 (original paragraph\n2b) amended to broaden its scope (previously limited to TSIs only, without a\nclear rationale).\nArticle 10: \"visits to Member\nStates\"; previously Article 33 \u2014 moved to this section as the visits are\nmeans of achieving the Agency\u2019s objectives.\nCHAPTER 3 TASKS\nRELATING TO RAILWAY SAFETY:\nArticle 11: \"technical support \u2013\nsafety\"; minor changes clarifying the Agency\u2019s tasks.\nArticle 12: \"safety\ncertificates\"; new role of ERA (issuing of safety certificates), as\nproposed in the IA report, in line with the revised Safety Directive.\nArticle 13: \"maintenance of vehicles\";\nnew article \u2014 left over from original Chapter 3a, simplified and moved to the\nsafety part as being the most relevant.\nArticle 14: \"transport of dangerous\ngoods by rail\"; new article, formalising what ERA is actually doing\nalready in the field of transport of dangerous goods by rail.\nCHAPTER 4 TASKS\nRELATING TO INTEROPERABILITY:\nArticle 15: \"technical support \u2013 interoperability\";\namended slightly to reflect changes in the Interoperability Directive (points b\nand c) and to clarify the existing tasks of ERA.\nArticle 16: \"vehicle authorisations\";\nnew article \u2014 covering ERA\u2019s new role in issuing vehicle authorisations for\nplacing on the market, as proposed in the IA report, in line with the amended\nInteroperability Directive.\nArticle 17: \"authorisations for type\nof vehicles\"; new article \u2014 covering ERA\u2019s new role in issuing authorisations\nfor placing on the market for types of vehicles, in line with the amended\nInteroperability Directive.\nArticle 18: \"authorisation for placing\nin service of trackside control-command and signalling sub-systems\"; new\narticle \u2014 covering ERA\u2019s new role regarding authorisation of track-side control-command\nand signalling equipment; linked with ERA\u2019s role as the system authority and\nthe consequences of the new task of issuing of vehicle authorisations for\nplacing on the market for the ERTMS (in order to ensure that the authorisations\nfor placing on the market issued for vehicles with ERTMS equipment on board are\nconsistent with track-side systems).\nArticle 19: \"telematics\napplications\"; new article added to formalise the existing role ERA plays\nalready, according to TAP/TAF TSI, and in line with the IA report. \nArticle 20: \"support for the notified\nconformity assessment bodies\"; amended \u2014 provisions on Commission\nmonitoring of notified bodies have been moved to the new section on monitoring;\nthe remainder is support for notified bodies (the Commission assigned tasks\nrelating to the Technical Secretariat of the NB Rail to the Agency as of 20\nApril 2011 and this activity is already on-going; this needs to be properly\nreflected in the legislation).\nCHAPTER 5 TASKS\nRELATING TO NATIONAL RULES (moved after the chapter on interoperability):\nArticles 21, 22 and 23: \"national\nrules\"; new articles which incorporate original Articles 9a and 9b, amended\nto align procedures with the Interoperability and Safety Directives and take\ninto account the extended powers of ERA in relation to national rules resulting\nfrom the IA report and draft report of the Task Force on National Safety Rules;\nmanagement of the IT database given clearly to ERA, in order to clarify\nprevious mixed responsibilities (Commission and ERA) and to overcome current\ntechnical, coordination and ownership problems.\nCHAPTER 6 TASKS\nRELATING TO ERTMS: the ERTMS section deserves a separate new chapter.\nArticles 24-28: \"ERTMS tasks\" these\nincorporate the original Article 21a, amended to clarify the responsibilities\nof the Agency and other actors in relation to the ERTMS, to improve ERTMS deployment,\nand to reflect what ERA is already currently doing in this field; Article 13e amended\nin line with preliminary Commission evaluation of four years of technical\nfollow-up.\nCHAPTER 7 TASKS\nRELATING TO MONITORING SINGLE EUROPEAN RAILWAY AREA: new chapter \u2014 various\ntasks related to monitoring are now combined together in one chapter for better\nvisibility and clarity.\nArticle 29: \"monitoring of national\nsafety authorities\"; new article \u2014 new ERA task: control over NSAs, as\nproposed in the IA report (and in the evaluation of the ERA Regulation).\nArticle 30: \"monitoring of notified\nbodies\"; new article \u2014 new ERA task: control over notified bodies, as\nproposed in the IA report.\nArticle 31: \"monitoring progress of\ninteroperability and safety\"; partly based on original Article 9 (new\nparagraphs 1 and 2, with ERA\u2019s tasks in relation to safety monitoring now\nclarified), on original Article 14 (new paragraphs 3 and 4, with two separate\nreports on interoperability and safety now merged into one); paragraph 5 \u2014 based\non Article 21b (2a), in accordance with the IA report and the evaluation of the\nERA Regulation.\nCHAPTER 8 OTHER\nTASKS \u2013 new chapter combining previous chapters on registers, railway staff and\nother tasks:\nArticle 32: \"railway staff\";\ncombines original Articles 16b, 16c and 17 to simplify: some tasks are\nobsolete, others are described in Directive 2007/59; amended to avoid legal\nambiguity and repetition.\nArticle 33: \"registers\"; this\narticle combines original Articles 18 and 19, updated and aligned with\nlegislation.\nArticle 34: \"networks of national\nsafety authorities, investigating bodies and representative bodies\"; previously\npartly in original Article 6(5) and Article 9; the network of representative\nbodies has been added (paragraph 2) to improve and structure coordination of\nstakeholders at Agency level; paragraph 3 has been added to improve and\nstructure consultation of all stakeholders, and ultimately to obtain higher\nquality outputs from the Agency (in line with the evaluation of ERA Regulation\nand Position paper on the future of ERA).\nArticle 35: \"communication and\ndissemination\"; new article, formalising partly the existing activities of\nERA and stemming from IA report, the evaluation of the ERA Regulation and the\nPosition paper on the future of the Agency.\nArticle 36: \"research and promotion of\ninnovation\"; original article with research added, formalising what ERA is\nalready doing to a large extent; in line with the Position paper of the Board\non the Future of ERA.\nArticle 37: \"assistance to the\nCommission\"; amended slightly.\nArticle 38: \"assistance with the\nassessment of rail projects\"; originally Article 15, scope was extended to\ncover safety.\nArticle 39: \"assistance to MS and\nstakeholders\"; new article, following the IA report (measure from Option\n6) and the results of the evaluation of the ERA Regulation.\nArticle 40: \"international relations\";\nnew article formalising what ERA is already doing to a large extent; in line\nwith the IA report and the Position paper of the Board on the Future of ERA.\nArticle 41: \"spare parts\"; new\narticle \u2014 new task in line with the IA report.\nCHAPTER 9 ORGANISATION\nOF THE AGENCY: drafted largely to follow the Joint Statement of the Commission,\nthe European Parliament and the Council on decentralised agencies and the\nCommon Approach (2012), in particular in relation to: extended competences of\nthe Management Board (previously Administrative); creation of Executive Board;\nmulti-annual work programme; other standard provisions regarding HR and\nbudgetary issues. \nOther important changes:\nArticle 48: \"annual and multi-annual\nwork programmes\"; new, separate article on work programmes deemed useful\nfor clarity; in accordance with the Joint Statement and recommendations of the CoA,\nEP, the evaluation of the ERA Regulation and the Position paper of the ERA\nBoard on the Future of the Agency (multi-annual perspective, ABB and ABM,\nrelations with stakeholders).\nArticles 51-57: \"Board of\nAppeal\"; new articles \u2014 Board of Appeal necessary following extension of\nERA competences (issuing of vehicle authorisations for placing on the market\nand safety certificates); IA report provides for the creation of an independent\nAppeal Body outside the Agency, however, it seems that the solution already in\nplace at the EASA is more appropriate; based on the relevant provisions of the\nEASA Regulation.\nCHAPTER 10\nFINANCIAL PROVISIONS:\nArticle 58(2): new point (c) \u2014 new sources\nof ERA income added (external fees and charges for issuing vehicle authorisations\nfor placing on the market and safety certificates (new tasks)); new point (e) \u2014\nto bring it into line with the EASA regulation\nCHAPTER 11 STAFF:\nnew chapter, following largely standard provisions resulting from the Common\nApproach on agencies (Articles 62 and 63).\nArticle 61: \"staff \u2013 general\nprovisions\"; originally Article 24, amended in accordance with the Joint\nStatement on agencies, the evaluation of the ERA Regulation and the Position paper\nof the ERA Board on the Future of the Agency; previous limitations of maximum\ncontract deleted.\nCHAPTER 12 GENERAL\nPROVISIONS: \nArticles 64, 66-68, 70-72: moved from other\nparts of the original Regulation, amended if necessary following Joint\nStatement on agencies.\nArticle 65: \"headquarters agreement\nand operating conditions\"; new article, following the Joint Statement on\ndecentralised agencies (2012).\nArticle 69: \"cooperation with national\nauthorities and bodies\"; new articles resulting from new powers of ERA to\nissue certificates and authorisations; cooperation with national bodies and\nauthorities in some cases deemed necessary due to their expertise; possibility\nof (sub)contract part of ERA's tasks.\nCHAPTER 13 FINAL\nPROVISIONS: new chapter\nArticle 73 and 74: \"delegated\nacts\"; new articles \u2014 following ERA\u2019s new powers (to issue safety\ncertificates and vehicle authorisations for placing on the market, own\nresources) there is a need to adopt delegated measures; this is similar to the\ncase of EASA.\nArticle 75: \"committee procedure\";\nnew article, made in order not to refer to other acts (Interoperability\nDirective).\nArticle 76: \"evaluation and\nreview\"; original article amended in accordance with the Joint Statement\non agencies.\nARTICLES WHICH STAYED THE SAME AS IN\nREGULATION 881/2004: 5, 6, 58, 59, 60.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis new Regulation provides a legislative\nbasis for budgetary and staff commitments in relation to the European Union\nAgency for Railways. The detailed calculations are provided in the Annex, in\nthe Legislative Financial Statement.\nIt is important to point out that, as far\nas ERA staffing is concerned, the present act incorporates:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 resources calculations\nfrom two previous Financial Legislative Statements attached to the original\nRegulation 881/2004 and the 2008 amendment to it (Regulation 1335/2008), which\nprovided for 104 temporary staff for ERA;\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 budgetary procedures for 2005-2013\nby which the Budgetary Authority granted ERA an extra 39 posts to cover\nadditional tasks not reflected in the founding Regulation, resulting in total\n143 temporary staff posts in 2013;\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the estimated resources\nimplications of the new tasks and enhanced powers of ERA envisaged in the\ncurrent new Regulation, set at 43 persons.\nRegarding point 2, note that the\nnumber of posts has gradually increased since ERA was set up in 2005. This\nchange has been subject to detailed annual scrutiny and has been adopted by the\nbudgetary authority every year in accordance with the number of posts proposed\nby the Commission. The main explanation for the difference between point 1 and\n2 is that a number of functions and activities such as legal affairs, Data\nProtection Officer, Secretariat for the Administrative Board, internal audit,\nquality and business planning, economic evaluation (impact assessment),\nprocurement, facilities management, and a Head of Administration were not provided\nfor in the founding Regulation \u2014 or at least not planned to be carried out by\ndedicated staff. For some areas of activity, including HR, IT and Finance,\nresource needs were considerably underestimated.\nConcerning economic evaluation, this\nactivity follows from the fact that ERA was set up to contribute to an\nintegrated and competitive railway area. It has been an integral part of the\nAgency\u2019s activities from the beginning \u2014 even if no dedicated staff were\nprovided for in the financial statement. The need for this activity is\nunquestionable and has recently grown in line with the Activity-Based Budgeting\napproach; this is reflected in the fact that a new Article is proposed for\ninclusion in the new Agency Regulation.\nIn addition to these developments, various\nCommission acts have given the Agency additional tasks with resource\nimplications, without being properly reflected in the financial statement. For\nexample, Commission Decision 2011/155/EU on the publication and management of\nthe reference document referred to in Article 27(4) of Directive 2008/57/EC put\nadditional tasks on the Agency in relation to making transparent and\nsimplifying the processes and rules used for authorising railway vehicles and\nsubsystems. More specifically, ERA\u2019s role concerns documentation of\nauthorisation processes in Member States, documentation of national rules\napplied to the authorisation of railway vehicles and checking of data\nconsistencies, support to National Safety Authorities and management and\nmaintenance of data.\nRegarding point 3, the budgetary and\nstaff implications of new and extended tasks stem principally from the impact\nassessment calculations, implementation of the recommendations in the Joint\nStatement by the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council on\ndecentralised agencies, Court of Auditors and Internal Audit Service\nrecommendations, and the evaluation of the ERA Regulation. All the changes in\nlegislation are substantially explained in part 3 of this Memorandum. The total\nof 70 persons is estimated to be needed to deal with these new and extended\ntasks, with 43 additional staff in relation to the current level of staffing of\nthe Agency. These 43 new persons will be dealing with issuing authorisations\nand certificates and will be covered by external fees and charges while the remaining\nneeds of 27 persons will be covered by internal redeployment of existing staff\nof the Agency. Therefore, there will be no additional impact on the EU budget\n(except for years 2015 and 2016, when external fees and charges will not be\navailable yet).\nThe planned additional personnel of 43 would\ncover the following categories:\n\u00b7                        \nTechnical experts (41 persons), to deal with\nissuing of authorisations for placing on the market of vehicles and vehicles\ntypes (30), authorisations for placing in service of trackside control-command\nand signalling sub-systems (6) and safety certificates (5);\n\u00b7                        \nLinked administrative staff (2), including an accountant\nto deal with management of a planned system of external fees and charges,\nincluding cooperation with national authorities.\nThe external fees and charges would also\ncover linked overhead costs, mainly:\n\u00b7                        \nTranslation of decisions issued by ERA into\nnational languages;\n\u00b7                        \nIT system needed for accountancy purposes\n(external fees and charges).\nThe remaining 27 persons, to be covered by\ninternal redeployment of existing staff of the Agency, would deal with:\n\u00b7                        \nMonitoring of national safety authorities and\nnotified bodies, and implementation\nof national safety and interoperability legislation ;\n\u00b7                        \nReduction of number of national rules ;\n\u00b7                        \nAdvice and support to Member States and\nstakeholders, dissemination of railway-related information and training and\ncoordination of potential spare parts to be standardised .\nThe overall budgetary implication of ERA for\nthe EU budget in 2015-2020 is estimated at \u20ac 157.113 M. The cost to the EU\nbudget of new tasks amounts to \u20ac 0.4113 M as from 2017 onwards they will be\ncovered by fees and charges paid by the industry.\nThere is also impact on Commission resources (in\nthe DG MOVE). With regard to this, the present Regulation incorporates:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 resources calculations\nfrom two previous Legislative Financial Statements attached to the original\nRegulation 881/2004 and the 2008 amendment to it (Regulation 1335/2008), which\nprovided for two officials/temporary staff for the Commission;\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 changes for 2005-2013, with\nthree extra Commission staff dealing with ERA-related issues, to cover\nadditional tasks not reflected in the founding Regulation;\nThe overall total for the Commission linked\nto the current initiative will be 5 persons, with no new staff requested.\n2013/0014 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the European Union Agency for Railways \nand repealing Regulation (EC) No\n881/2004\n(Text with EEA relevance) \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91(1)\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from\nthe European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[6],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The progressive\nestablishment of a European railway area without frontiers requires Union\naction in the field of the technical regulations applicable to railways with\nregard to the technical aspects (interoperability) and the safety aspects, the\ntwo being inextricably linked and both requiring higher level of harmonisation\nat the Union level. Relevant railway legislation, in particular three railway\npackages, was adopted in the last two decades, with Directive 2004/49/EC of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on safety on the\nCommunity\u2019s railways and Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 17 June 2008 on the interoperability of the rail system within\nthe Community being the most relevant. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simultaneous pursuit of\nthe goals of railway safety and interoperability requires substantial technical\nwork which must be led by a specialised body. That is why it was necessary, as\npart of the Second Railway Package in 2004, to create within the existing\ninstitutional framework, and with respect for the balance of power in the Union,\na European agency responsible for railway safety and interoperability\n(hereinafter referred to as the Agency). \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Railway\nAgency was originally established by Regulation (EC) 881/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n29 April 2004[7]\n, in order to promote the establishment of a European railway area without\nborders and to help revitalise the railway sector while reinforcing its\nessential advantages in terms of safety. Regulation 881/2004 has to be replaced by a new act due to\nsubstantial amount of changes to the tasks of the Agency and its internal\norganisation. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nFourth Railway Package proposes important changes to improve the functioning of\nthe Single European railway area through amendments by way of recast to Directive 2004/49/EC and Directive\n2008/57/EC, both directly linked to the tasks of the Agency. Those Directives,\ntogether with this Regulation, provide in particular for performing tasks\nrelated to issuing vehicle authorisations and safety certificates at the Union\nlevel. It implies a greater role of the Agency. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agency should\ncontribute to the creation and effective functioning of a Single European\nrailway area without frontiers and guaranteeing a high level of safety while\nimproving the competitive position of the railway sector. That should be\nattained by contributing, on technical matters, to the implementation of\nEuropean Union legislation by enhancing the level of interoperability of railway\nsystems and to developing a common approach to safety on the European railway\nsystem. The Agency should also perform the role of European authority\nresponsible for issuing authorisations for placing on the market for railway\nvehicles and for types of vehicles, safety certificates for railway\nundertakings and authorisations for placing in service of trackside\ncontrol-command and signalling sub-systems. Moreover, it should monitor national\nrailway rules and the performance of national authorities acting in the railway\ninteroperability and safety fields.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In pursuing its\nobjectives, the Agency should take full account of the process of enlargement\nof the Union and of the specific constraints relating to rail links with third\ncountries. The Agency should have sole responsibility for the functions and\npowers assigned to it.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agency, while\nperforming its tasks, and particularly in relation to drafting recommendations,\nshould take upmost account of external railway expertise. This expertise should\npredominantly consist of professionals from the railway sector and the relevant\nnational authorities. They should form competent and representative working\nparties of the Agency.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to provide\ninsight into the economic effects on the railway sector and its impact on\nsociety, to allow others to make informed decisions, and to manage the work\npriorities and resource allocation more effectively within the Agency, the\nAgency should further develop its engagement in the impact assessment activity.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agency should provide\nindependent and objective technical support, predominantly to the Commission. Directive\n\u2026. [Railway Interoperability] provides the basis for drafting and revising Technical\nSpecifications for Interoperability (TSIs) while Directive \u2026 [Railway Safety] provides\nthe basis for drafting and revising Common Safety Methods (CSMs) and Common\nSafety Targets (CSTs). The continuity of the work and the development of the\nTSIs, CSMs and CSTs over time require a permanent technical framework and a dedicated\nstaff of a specialised body. To this end, the Agency should be responsible for\nproviding the Commission with recommendations in relation to drafting and\nrevising the TSIs, CSMs and CSTs. The national safety organisations and\nregulatory bodies should be equally able to request an independent technical\nopinion from the Agency.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Railway undertakings have\nbeen faced with various problems when applying for safety certificates to\ncompetent national authorities, ranging from protracting procedures and\nexcessive costs to unfair treatment, especially of new entrants. The\ncertificates issued in one Member State have not been unconditionally\nrecognised in other Member States, with a detriment to the Single European rail\narea. In order to make the procedures for issuing safety certificates to\nrailway undertakings more efficient and impartial, it is essential to migrate\ntowards a single safety certificate valid throughout the Union and issued by\nthe Agency. The revised Directive \u2026 [Railway Safety Directive] provides a basis\nfor this. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Currently Directive 2008/57/EC\nprovides, in the case of rail vehicles, an authorisation of placing in service\nin each Member State, except in specific cases. The Task Force on vehicle\nauthorisation set up by the Commission in 2011 discussed several cases where\nmanufacturers and railway undertakings have suffered from excessive duration\nand cost of the authorisation process and proposed a number of improvements. As\nsome problems are due to the complexity of the current vehicle authorisation process,\nit should be simplified. Each rail vehicle should only receive one\nauthorisation and this authorisation for placing on the market for vehicles and\nfor types of vehicles should be issued by the Agency. This would bring tangible\nbenefits for the sector by reducing the costs and time of the procedure, and\nwould diminish the risk of potential discrimination, especially of new\ncompanies wishing to enter a railway market. The revised Directive \u2026 [Railway Interoperability]\nprovides a basis for this. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to further pursue\nthe development of Single European rail area, in particular with relation to\nproviding appropriate information to freight customers and passengers, and\ntaking into account current involvement of the Agency, it is necessary to give\nit a strengthened role in the field of telematics applications. This would\nensure their consistent development and swift deployment.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the importance of the\nEuropean Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) for the smooth development of\nthe Single European railway area and its safety, and taking into account its\nfragmented development to date, it is necessary to strengthen its s overall\ncoordination at the Union level. Therefore the Agency, as the most competent\nUnion body, should be given a more prominent role in this field to ensure\nconsistent development of the ERTMS, to contribute to ensuring that ERTMS\nequipment complies with the specifications in force and to ensure that\nERTMS-related European research programmes are coordinated with the development\nof ERTMS technical specifications. Moreover, in order to make the procedures\nfor issuing authorisations for placing in service of trackside control-command\nand signalling sub-systems more efficient and impartial, it is essential to migrate\ntowards a single authorisation valid in the Union and issued by the Agency. The\nrevised Directive \u2026 [Railway Interoperability Directive] provides a basis for\nthis.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competent national\nauthorities have been normally charging for issuing vehicle authorisations and safety\ncertificates. With the transfer competence to the Union level, the Agency\nshould be entitled to charge the applicants for issuing the certificates and\nauthorisations mentioned in the preceding recitals. The level of those charges\nshould be equal to or lower than the current average in the Union and should be\ndetermined in a delegated act to be adopted by the Commission. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is a general objective\nthat the transfer of functions and tasks from the Member States to the Agency\nshould be done efficiently, without any reduction in the current high levels of\nsafety. The Agency should have sufficient resources for its new tasks, and the\ntiming of the allocation of these resources should be based on clearly defined\nneeds. Taking into account the know-how of national authorities, in particular\nthe National Safety Authorities, the Agency should be allowed to make\nappropriate use of that expertise when granting the relevant authorisations and\ncertificates. To this end, secondment of national experts to the Agency should\nbe encouraged. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive \u2026 [Railway\nSafety] and Directive \u2026 [Railway Interoperability] provide for examination\nof national measures from the point of view of safety and interoperability, and\ncompatibility with competition rules. They also limit the possibility for\nMember States to adopt new national rules. The current system in which a large\nnumber of national rules continue to exist leads to possible conflicts with Union\nrules and creates a risk of insufficient transparency and disguised\ndiscrimination of foreign operators, especially the smaller and new ones. In\norder to migrate towards a system of truly, transparent and impartial railway rules\nat Union level, gradual reduction of national rules needs to be reinforced. An\nopinion based on independent and neutral expertise is essential at Union level.\nTo this end, the role of the Agency needs to be strengthened. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Performance, organisation\nand decision-making procedures in the field of railway interoperability and\nsafety vary substantially among the national safety authorities and notified conformity\nassessment bodies, with a detrimental effect to smooth operation of the Single\nEuropean rail area. In particular, small and medium companies wishing to enter\nthe railway market in another Member State can be negatively affected.\nTherefore, a strengthened coordination with a view to greater harmonisation at\nthe Union level is essential. To this end, the Agency should monitor the\nnational safety authorities and notified conformity assessment bodies through\naudits and inspections. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the field of safety, it\nis important to ensure the greatest possible transparency and an effective flow\nof information. An analysis of performance, based on common indicators and\nlinking all parties in the sector, is important and should be carried out. As\nregards statistics, close collaboration with Eurostat is necessary.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to monitor\nprogress with the railway interoperability and safety, the Agency should be\nresponsible for publishing a relevant report every two years. Given its\ntechnical expertise and impartiality, the Agency should also assist the\nCommission with monitoring the implementation of Union railway safety and\ninteroperability legislation. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The interoperability of the\nTrans-European network should be enhanced and the new investment projects\nchosen for support by the Union should be in line with the objective of\ninteroperability set in Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the\ndevelopment of the Trans-European transport network[8].\nThe Agency is the right institution to contribute to these objectives. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rolling stock maintenance\nis an important part of the safety system. There has been no genuine European\nmarket for the maintenance of rail equipment owing to the lack of a system for\ncertification of maintenance workshops. This situation has been adding to the\ncosts for the sector and results in journeys without loads. A European\ncertification system for maintenance workshops should therefore gradually be\ndeveloped and updated, with the Agency being the most appropriate body to\npropose adequate solutions to the Commission.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The vocational qualifications\nrequired for train drivers are a major factor in both safety and\ninteroperability in the Union. They are also a precondition for the free\nmovement of workers in the railway industry. This question should be tackled\nwith respect to the existing framework for social dialogue. The Agency should provide\nthe technical support necessary in order to take account of this aspect at Union\nlevel.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agency should organise\nand facilitate cooperation between the national safety authorities, the national\ninvestigating bodies and representative bodies from the railway sector acting\non at European level, in order to promote good practices, exchange of relevant\ninformation, collection of railway-related data and monitor the overall safety\nperformance of the railway system. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the greatest\npossible transparency and equal access for all parties to relevant information,\nthe documents envisaged for the railway interoperability and safety processes\nshould be accessible to the public. The same applies to licences, safety\ncertificates and other relevant railway documents. The Agency should provide an\nefficient means of exchanging and publishing this information.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Promotion of innovation and\nresearch in the railway field is an important task which the Agency should\nencourage, given its reputation and position. Any financial assistance provided\nwithin the framework of the Agency\u2019s activities in this respect should not lead\nto any distortion in the relevant market.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to increase the\nefficiency of the Union financial support, its quality and compatibility with\nrelevant technical regulations, the Agency, as the only Union body with\nreputable competence in the railway field, should play an active role in the assessment\nof rail projects.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Railway interoperability\nand safety legislation, implementation guides or recommendations of the Agency\nmay sometimes pose interpretation and other problems to the stakeholders.\nProper and uniform understanding of those acts is a precondition for effective\nimplementation of the railway acquis and the functioning of the railway market.\nTherefore, the Agency should actively engage in training and explanatory\nactivities in that regard.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to perform its\ntasks properly, the Agency should have legal personality and an autonomous\nbudget funded mainly through a contribution by the Union and through fees and\ncharges paid by applicants. In order to ensure independence in its daily\nmanagement and in the opinions, recommendations and decisions which it issues,\nthe Agency\u2019s organisation should be transparent, the Executive Director should\nhave full responsibility. The Agency\u2019s staff should be independent and should represent\nan appropriate balance of short-term and long-term contracts, in order to\nmaintain its organisational knowledge and business continuity while keeping\nnecessary and on-going exchange of expertise with the railway sector.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\neffectively the accomplishment of the functions of the Agency, the Member\nStates and the Commission should be represented on a Management Board vested\nwith the necessary powers, including to establish the budget and approve the annual\nand multi-annual work programmes.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to guarantee the\ntransparency of the Management Board\u2019s decisions, representatives of the\nsectors concerned should attend its meetings, but without the right to vote,\nthat right being reserved for the representatives of public authorities who are\naccountable to the democratic control authorities. The representatives of the\nsector should be appointed by the Commission on the basis of their\nrepresentativeness at Union level of railway undertakings, infrastructure\nmanagers, railway industry, workers unions, passengers and freight customers.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to properly\nprepare the meetings of the Management Board and to advice it in relation to\nthe decisions to be taken, an advisory Executive Board should be created.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to ensure\nthat parties affected by decisions made by the Agency enjoy the necessary\nremedies in an independent and impartial manner. An appropriate appeal\nmechanism should be set up so that decisions of the Executive Director can be\nsubject to appeal to a specialised Board of Appeal, whose decisions are, in\nturn, open to action before the Court of Justice. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A broader strategic\nperspective in relation to the activities of the Agency would help to plan and\nmanage its resources more effectively and would contribute to higher quality of\nits outputs. Therefore, a multi-annual work programme should be adopted and\nupdated regularly by the Management Board, after proper consultation of the\nrelevant stakeholders.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agency\u2019s work should be\ntransparent. Effective control by the European Parliament should be ensured\nand, to this end, the European Parliament should have the possibility of\nhearing the Executive Director of the Agency and being consulted on the\nmulti-annual work programme. The Agency should also apply the relevant Union legislation\nconcerning public access to documents.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the past years, as\nmore decentralised agencies have been created, the budgetary authority has\nlooked to improve transparency and control over the management of the Union funding\nallocated to them, in particular concerning the budgetisation of fees,\nfinancial control, power of discharge, pension scheme contributions and the\ninternal budgetary procedure (code of conduct). In a similar way, Regulation\n(EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May\n1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office\n(OLAF)[9] should apply without\nrestriction to the Agency, which should accede to the Inter-institutional\nAgreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of\nthe European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning\ninternal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office[10].\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of the\naction proposed, namely to establish a specialised body to formulate common\nsolutions on matters concerning railway safety and interoperability, cannot be\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States by reason of the joint nature of the\nwork to be done, and can therefore be better achieved at Union level, the Union\nmay adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out\nin Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of\nproportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond\nwhat is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to properly\ndetermine the level of fees and charges which the Agency is entitled to levy, the\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in\nrespect of articles dealing with issuing and renewal of authorisations for\nplacing in service of trackside control-command and signalling subsystems,\nauthorisations for placing on the market for vehicles and for types of vehicles,\nand safety certificates.

Moreover, Directive 2004/49/EC,\nDirective 2008/57/EC and Directive 2007/59/EC have directly and indirectly\ngiven other tasks to the Agency. In a similar manner, numerous secondary\nlegislation adopted by the Commission under the above-mentioned directives, in\nparticular the TSIs, CSMs and CSTs, have had an impact of the activities and\nwork of ERA. The current Regulation aims to combine all existing tasks of the\nAgency in one legal act, and extend the role of ERA to areas where is it\njustified.\nIn line with the Transport White Paper of 2011 (Roadmap to a Single\nEuropean Transport Area \u2014 Towards a competitive and resource efficient\ntransport system) and the results of the impact assessment accompanying current\ninitiative, this proposal will provide further EU added value by eliminating\nexisting technical and administrative barriers in the railway sector, notably\nby:\n- making railway vehicle authorisation and safety certification of\nrailway undertakings more efficient (cheaper and faster) and impartial, by\nmoving them to the EU level;\n- increasing the coherence and application of EU railway acquis\nby allowing the Agency to monitor the functioning of national authorities\nactive in railway interoperability and safety fields;\n- facilitating faster progress towards truly common EU railway\nstandards by increasing ERA\u2019s action in reducing national railway rules;\n- improving spending of EU funds for the railways (TEN, Cohesion\nFund, Structural Funds, research programmes, etc.).\nEU involvement through ERA allows for high added value thanks to:\n- the use of a dedicated structure and qualified staff, some of whom\nare already available;\n- positive experience with tried and tested methods (for example,\nusing the established and operational network of national safety authorities);\n- its objectivity and impartiality, highly appreciated by\nstakeholders.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nEvaluation of the ERA Regulation and functioning of the Agency\n(2009-2010) and the general evaluation of the EU Agencies in 2009 both showed\nthe added value provided by the Agency.\nThis initiative seeks to apply (by revising the ERA Regulation) the\nrecommendations from the ERA evaluation exercise, of the Court of Auditors,\nInternal Audit Service and the Joint Statement of the Commission, the European\nParliament and the Council on decentralised agencies, particularly with regard\nto internal structure, governance and functioning.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nThe proposal is in line with the Transport White\nPaper of 2011, in particular with its initiatives 1 and 19:\n- \"Achieve a single vehicle type\nauthorisation and a single railway undertaking safety certification by\nreinforcing the role of the European Railway Agency (ERA)\";\n- \"Enhance the role of ERA in the field of\nrail safety, in particular its supervision on national safety measures taken by\nNational Safety Authorities and their progressive harmonisation\".\nThe proposal is consistent with the EU railway\ninteroperability and safety policy and legislation, in particular Directives\n2004/49 (Railway Safety Directive) and 2008/57 (Railway Interoperability\nDirective) which will also be amended as part of this initiative. All three\nrevised acts are interlinked and aim at removing remaining administrative and\ntechnical barriers, in particular by establishing a common approach to safety\nand interoperability rules to increase economies of scale for railway\nundertakings active across the EU, decreasing administrative costs and\naccelerating administrative procedures, as well as to avoiding disguised\ndiscrimination.\nMoreover, this initiative is a part of a broader Fourth Railway\nPackage which will aim \u2014 besides the objective described above \u2014 to open up the\ndomestic rail passenger market and optimise the governance of infrastructure\nmanagement; synergies are expected especially with regard to reducing\ndiscrimination in relation to access to infrastructure, thus lowering the\naccess barriers for new entrants.\nThere is also an important synergy between the revised tasks of ERA\nand the TEN-T Executive Agency in relation to the evaluation of railway\nprojects, in relation to increased value for money and efficiency of projects\nfunded from the EU funds.\nBesides, this initiative is consistent with and implements\nrecommendations of the Court of Auditors, Internal Audit Service and the Joint\nStatement of the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council on\ndecentralised agencies, as well as with the evaluation of ERA.\nFinally, this initiative seeks to include in the ERA Regulation a\nnumber of tasks and activities that were assigned to the Agency by other acts,\nparticularly Directive 2007/59/EC, Commission Decisions on Technical\nSpecifications on Interoperability (TSIs) and Common Safety Methods (CSMs).\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact\nx Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from 2015\nto 2020,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged[24]\n\u00a8 Centralised direct management by the Commission\nx Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies\n\u2013     \nx bodies set up by the Communities[25]\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States\n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries\n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules\nSpecify frequency\nand conditions.\nAll EU agencies work under a strict monitoring system involving\ninternal audit capability, the Internal Audit Service of the Commission, the\nAdministrative Board, the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Budgetary\nAuthority.

There was a large variation in the\nfees paid, and also a substantial difference between the fees paid in EU15\nMember States (about \u20ac20,000 for safety certificates and \u20ac28,000 for\nauthorisations) and the fees paid in EU12 Member States (about \u20ac3,000 for\nsafety certificates and \u20ac17,000 for authorisations). In determining the future\nvalue of these fees it was assumed that, given: the cost of staff in the\nAgency, the more streamlined processes of dealing with the applications, a\nvalue close to the mid-point of the low average and the high average would be\nthe most appropriate going forward. \nIt is important to note that the calculations set out for the fees\nare average across all types of safety certificates and vehicle authorisations;\n4 types of safety certificates and 20 types of vehicle authorisations were\nidentified in the IA support study. Although the \u201ccentralisation\u201d process with\nERA will lead to the number of types of certificates and authorisations\nfalling, there will still be multiple categories. For example, there will still\nbe a different process for the authorisation of a locomotive and a wagon. As\nsuch the fees will need to be differentiated for these two categories. In\nparticular, the fees for wagon authorisation will be lower than the average and\nthe fees for locomotives and multiple units will be higher.\nThe number (price per authorisation/certificate) that was calculated\nin the impact assessment report is meant to be an average, it would be up to\nthe Agency to define the exact fees for the different categories with the aim\nof ensuring that the average of the fees collected was equal, or greater than\nthis average. However, the aim of the calculation is to provide a realistic but\nconservative estimation of revenues for the Agency, and it is not excluded that\nthe fees to be charged can actually lead to a higher average value, if\nnecessary and justified.\nIn terms of the number of authorisations and certificates, these\nwere calculated starting from the current level of authorisations and\ncertifications. For future years, in relation to safety certificates, it was\nassumed that the number of new entrants into the market would lead to an\nincrease in the number of safety certificates issued over time while the fact\nthat there may be a change in the types of safety certificates could decrease\nthat number. Therefore, as a conservative estimate it was assumed that there is\nno change in the total annual number of safety certificates. \nFor vehicle authorisations the approach was slightly different: the\nmodel starts from existing authorisation levels as provided by stakeholders and\nvarious studies. However, while there are likely to be more new entrants and\ntherefore in absolute terms more vehicles to authorise, new entrants are more\nlikely to stick with proven technology and as such with the rolling stock that\nhas already been certified. Furthermore, as the industry standardises, in\nfuture there are likely to be fewer types of vehicles to authorise, leading to\na slight fall in the number of authorisations.
