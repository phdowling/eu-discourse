However, Article 15(7) provides for the possibility of reviewing\r\nthis provision by mutual agreement.\nOn 22 July 2012 Jordan sent a written\r\nrequest asking for an extension of the period of application of this provision.\nIn accordance with Article 39 of Protocol\r\nNo 3, the provisions of the Protocol may be amended by decision of the\r\nAssociation Council.\nThe text of the decision will amend the\r\nexisting provision laid down in Article 15(7). \nThe parties have agreed to extend by three\r\nyears the application period of Article 15(7), with effect from 1 January 2013,\r\nin order to provide clarity, long-term economic predictability and legal\r\ncertainty for economic operators.\nPending formal adoption of the present\r\ndecision, it was agreed, in the context of the Pan\u2011Euro-Med working\r\ngroup, that this decision will apply from 1 January 2013.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe parties concerned have been consulted\r\nin the Pan-Euro-Med working group and the Customs Code Committee's Origin\r\nSection.\nNo recourse to external expertise has been\r\nnecessary.\nIt has not been necessary to conduct an\r\nimpact assessment, since the proposed amendments are technical in nature and do\r\nnot affect the substance of the protocol on rules of origin currently in\r\neffect.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe amended provision on drawback of duties\r\nshould apply retroactively from 1 January 2013.\nThe legal basis for the amendment of this\r\nprovision is the first subparagraph of Article 207(4) in conjunction with\r\nArticle 218(9) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union.
