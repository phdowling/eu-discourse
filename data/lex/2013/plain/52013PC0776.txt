This became necessary as Council\r\nRegulation (EU) 1344/2011 of 19 December 2011 has been amended four times and fishery\r\nproducts are no longer covered by that Regulation. Therefore, in the interests\r\nof transparency, it is proposed to repeal the said Regulation and replace it by\r\nthe current proposal. \nThe production in the Union of the products\r\nspecified in this regulation does not exist or is inadequate and, therefore, by\r\nallowing enterprises to obtain supplies at a lower cost for a certain period,\r\nit would become possible to stimulate economic activity within the Union, to\r\nimprove the competitive capacity of these enterprises and, in particular, to\r\nenable the latter to maintain or create employment, modernise their structures,\r\netc.\nIn this context, it should be pointed out\r\nthat goods imported under the tariff suspension arrangements enjoy freedom of\r\nmovement throughout the Union; consequently, once a tarif suspension is\r\ngranted, any operator in any Member State is eligible to benefit from it.\nSince autonomous tariff suspensions\r\nconstitute an exception to the general rule represented by the Common Customs\r\nTariff, they must, like all derogations, be surveilled and reviewed systematically\r\non a regular basis (at least every five years). This\r\nshould not exclude the termination of certain measures earlier if it is no longer in the Union's interest to maintain suspension of\r\nautonomous Common Customs Tariff duties or because of technical product\r\ndevelopments and economic trends on the market justify it or due to changed\r\ncircumstances. Where the Commission considers, on the basis of the review, that\r\na suspension for a certain product is to be changed or terminated, it will\r\nsubmit to the Council a proposal to amend the list set out in Annex I\r\naccordingly.\nAnnex 1 of the attached proposal contains\r\nproducts for which duties were already suspended by virtue of Council\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1344/2011 as last amended by Regulation (EU) No 626/2013 as\r\nwell as a number of agricultural and industrial products which were reviewed since\r\nthis last amendment.\nIt was also considered necessary to provide\r\nthat not only the weight in kg or tonnes but also the relevant supplementary\r\nunits for the imports of certain products are entered in the declaration for\r\nrelease for free circulation. Thus, Annex II of the attached proposal contains\r\nthe list of product codes with the corresponding supplementary units.\nThe Commission assisted by the Economic Tariff\r\nQuestions Group (ETQG), has reviewed all the new requests for temporary\r\nsuspension of autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties presented to it by the\r\nMember States. These new requests for suspension were examined in the light of\r\nthe criteria set out in the Communication from the Commission concerning\r\nautonomous tariff suspensions and quotas (see OJ C 363, 13.12.2011, p. 6).\nThe proposal is in line\r\nwith the trade, entreprise, development and external relations policies. Especially\r\nthis proposal is not at the expense of countries enjoying a preferential\r\ntrading agreement with the EU (e.g. GSP, ACP regime, candidate countries and\r\npotential candidates).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe ETQG, in which the competent\r\nauthorities of all Member State are represented, was consulted. All listed\r\nsuspensions correspond to agreements or compromises reached in the discussions\r\nof the group.\nThere was no mention of potentially serious\r\nrisks with irreversible consequences.\nThis proposal has been subject to an\r\ninter-service consultation procedure and will be published in the Official\r\nJournal of the European Union after its adoption by the Council.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis of this regulation proposal\r\nis Article 31 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union.\nThe proposal complies with the principle of\r\nproportionality as this set of measures is in line with the principles set out\r\nto simplify the procedures for the operators engaged in foreign trade and in\r\naccordance with the Commission communication concerning autonomous tariff\r\nsuspensions and quotas (OJ C 363, 13.12.2011, p. 6).\nBy virtue of Article 31 of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas\r\nare approved by the Council acting by qualified majority on the basis of a\r\nCommission proposal, therefore a regulation is the appropriate instrument. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nUncollected customs duties of a total\r\namount of approximately 86 Mio \u20ac/year. The effect on the traditional own\r\nresources of the budget is -64,5 Mio \u20ac/year (75% x 86 Mio \u20ac/year).\n2013/0384 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nsuspending the autonomous Common Customs\r\nTariff duties on certain agricultural and industrial products and repealing\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1344/2011\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The production in the\r\nUnion of the agricultural and industrial products set out in Annex I is currently\r\ninadequate or non-existent and thus, the needs of user industries in the Union\r\ncannot be met.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore in the\r\ninterest of the Union to suspend partially or totally the autonomous Common\r\nCustoms Tariff duties for those products.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EU) No\r\n1344/2011[1]\r\nhas been amended many times. In addition, in the amendment by Council\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1220/2012[2],\r\nfishery products were removed from the scope. In the interest of transparency\r\nit should, therefore, be replaced in its entirety. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulations suspending the\r\nautonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain industrial and agricultural\r\nproducts have largely renewed previous measures. Therefore, in the interests of\r\nrationalising implementation of the measures concerned, it is appropriate not\r\nto limit the period of validity of this Regulation as its scope can be adapted\r\nand products added to or removed from the Annex to this Regulation by means of\r\na Council regulation. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of their temporary\r\nnature, the suspensions listed in Annex 1 to this Regulation should be reviewed\r\nsystematically, at the latest five years after their application or renewal.\r\nMoreover, closure of certain suspensions should be warranted at any time, as a\r\nresult of a proposal of the Commission on the basis of a review carried out on its\r\nown initiative or at the request of one or more Member States if the\r\nsuspensions are no longer in the Union's interest to be maintained or due to\r\ntechnical product developments, to changed circumstances or to economic trends\r\non the market.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Statistics for certain\r\nproducts listed in Annex I to this Regulation are frequently expressed in pieces,\r\nsquare meters (m2) or measurement units other than weight. However,\r\nthere are no such supplementary units in the Combined Nomenclature laid down in\r\nAnnex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87[3]. It is,\r\ntherefore, necessary to provide that not only the weight in kg or tonnes but\r\nalso the relevant supplementary units for the imports of the products concerned\r\nare entered in the declaration for release for free circulation.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since it is necessary that\r\nthe suspensions laid down in this Regulation have to take effect on 1 January\r\n2014, this Regulation should apply from that date and should enter into force\r\nimmediately upon its publication in the Official Journal of the European\r\nUnion.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nprinciple of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the\r\nachievement of the basic objectives of improving the competitive capacity of\r\nthe Union industry, thereby enabling that industry to maintain or create\r\nemployment and modernise its structures, to lay down rules on the suspension of\r\nthe Common Customs Tariff duties for the products set out in Annex I. In\r\naccordance with Article 5(4) of the Treaty of the European Union, this Regulation\r\ndoes not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives pursued,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThe autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties\r\nfor the agricultural and industrial products listed in Annex I shall be\r\nsuspended.\nArticle 2\n1. The Commission may at any time review the\r\nsuspensions for the products listed in the Annex in the following cases:\n(a) at its own initiative;\n(b) at the request of Member States.\n2. The Commission shall review the\r\nsuspensions in the year set out in Annex I. \nArticle 3\nWhere a declaration for release for free circulation\r\nis presented, in respect of the products falling under the CN codes or TARIC\r\ncodes listed in Annex II, the supplementary unit provided in that Annex shall\r\nbe entered in the relevant field of that declaration. \nArticle 4\nRegulation (EU) No 1344/2011 is repealed.\nArticle 5\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\r\nFOR PROPOSALS HAVING A BUDGETARY IMPACT EXCLUSIVELY LIMITED TO THE REVENUE SIDE\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:\nProposal for a Council Regulation suspending\r\nthe autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain agricultural and\r\nindustrial products\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGET LINES:\nChapter and Article: Chapter 12, Article 120\nAmount budgeted for the year 2014: 18.086.400.000\r\n\u20ac (DB 2014)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FINANCIAL IMPACT:\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial implications\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial impact on\r\nexpenditure but has a financial impact on revenue; the effect is as follows:\n Budget line || Revenue[4] ||   || [Year: 2014 \u2013 2018] \n Article 120 || Impact on own resources ||   || - 64 500 000 (per year) \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES\nChecks on the end-use of some of the products\r\ncovered by this Council Regulation will be carried out in accordance with\r\nArticles 291 to 300 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 laying down\r\nprovisions for the implementation of the Community Customs Code.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OTHER REMARKS \nThis Regulation replaces existing Council\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1344/2011. The Annex of the existing Regulation has 1792\r\nproduct lines and results in estimated amount of uncollected customs duties of a\r\ntotal amount of 1040 Mio \u20ac for the year 2013, based on the actual figures for\r\n2013/S1. This figure is obtained on the basis of Eurostat Comext data\r\nconcerning the total value of imports of products falling under autonomous\r\ntariff suspensions in 2013, multiplied by the respective ad valorem duty\r\nrate of the common Customs Tariff for the specific tariff lines. The total\r\namount above already excludes the uncollected duties for products which will no\r\nlonger be suspended after the entry into force of this Regulation and the\r\nabrogation of Regulation (EU) No 1344/2011.\nIn addition to the aforementiond suspended\r\nproducts lines, this proposal contains 130 new product lines to be suspended. The\r\nuncollected duties corresponding to these suspensions, calculated on the basis\r\nof requesting Member State projections, amount to 48 Mio \u20ac/year. On the\r\nbasis of the existing statistics for preceding years, it would appear, however,\r\nnecessary to increase this amount by an average factor, estimated at 1,8 to\r\ntake account of imports into other Member States using the same suspensions.\r\nThis means uncollected duties of some 86 Mio \u20ac /year.\nThus, the uncollected duties corresponding to\r\nthe suspensions listed in the Annex of this proposal, calculated on the basis\r\nof expected imports into the requesting Member State for 2014 until 2018, are\r\nin total 1 126 Mio \u20ac/year.\nEstimated cost of this operation\nThe impact on the loss of revenue in\r\ntraditional own resources resulting from this Regulation may be estimated (after\r\ndeduction of the collection costs) at 86 x 75% = 64,5 MEUR/year for the\r\nperiod 01.01.2014 - 31.12.2018.\nThe loss of revenue in traditional own\r\nresources should be compensated by Member States' contributions based on the\r\nGNI.\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EU) No 1344/2011 of 19 December\r\n2011 temporarily suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on\r\ncertain agricultural, fishery and industrial products (OJ L 349, 31.12.2011,\r\np.1).\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EU) No 1220/2012 of 3 December\r\n2012 on trade related measures to guarantee the supply of certain fishery\r\nproducts to Union processors from 2013 to 2015, amending Regulations (EC) No\r\n104/2000 and (EU) No 1344/2011 (OJ L 349, 19.12.2012, p.4).\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EEC) No\r\n2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the\r\nCommon Customs Tariff (OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p.1).\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding traditional own resources (agricultural\r\nduties, sugar levies, customs duties) the amounts indicated must be net\r\namounts, i.e. gross amounts after deduction of 25 % of collection costs\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
