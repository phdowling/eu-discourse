The WSR's ban on exports of\nhazardous waste outside the OECD implements the UN Basel Convention's export\nban from 1995. Non-hazardous waste can be exported for recovery outside the\nOECD provided the waste will be managed in an environmentally sound manner, i.e.\nin a way which is broadly equivalent to rules applied in the EU[2]. \nWithin the EU, all shipments of waste for\nrecovery shall be entitled to free movement.[3]\nFor non-hazardous waste, such shipments are not subject to any prior\nnotification and only have to fulfil general information provisions (Titles\nII-IV of the WSR). Shipments of hazardous waste for recovery and shipments of\nwaste for disposal are both subject to prior written notification and consent.\nHowever, as regards shipments of waste for recovery, the competent authorities\nmay only oppose a shipment based on the environmental grounds set out by the\nWSR (Article 12). \nSpecific obligations are laid down\nconcerning a duty to take back waste shipments which are found to be illegal or\nwhich cannot be completed as envisaged (Articles 22-25 of the WSR). \nArticle 50 of the WSR contains a general\nprovision on enforcement stipulating that Member States shall provide for\ninspections of establishments and undertakings in accordance with the\ninspection requirements in Directive 2008/98/EC (Waste Framework Directive),\nand that Member States may check transports by road, in ports etc. or at a\nlater stage when the waste has already arrived at a recovery or disposal\nfacility. Controls are otherwise left to Member States' discretion. The WSR\ndoes not contain any specific provisions on how inspections shall be carried\nout: it only stipulates that \"Checks on shipments shall include the\ninspection of documents, the confirmation of identity and, where appropriate,\nphysical checking of the waste.\" \nAs a result of this general formulation of\ninspection requirements in the WSR, there are large differences between Member\nStates. Some have developed thorough, well-functioning inspection systems\ntargeting either waste shipments in ports or at the sites of waste producers\nand collectors, while others have significant problems with enforcement and\nlack adequate structures and resources to control waste streams and carry out\ninspections. This situation leads to 'port hopping', i.e. exporters of illegal\nwaste choose to send their waste through Member States with the least controls.\nIf enforcement in one Member State is stepped up, illegal exporters move their\nexports to another Member State. Effectively preventing illegal waste shipments\ncan therefore only be achieved if sufficient controls are carried out in all\nMember States. \nThe most problematic illegal waste\nshipments are those concerning hazardous waste and waste which is illegally\nsent for dumping or sub-standard treatment. The dumping or substandard\ntreatment of waste often has severe impacts on the environment and human health\nfor populations surrounding the disposal/treatment area. Leaks from discarded\nwaste also harm soils and water streams, and produce air pollution, through emissions\nof e.g. heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. If recycling standards and capacity in the countries\nof destination are not adequate, potential environmental and health hazards are\nsimply being exported to other parts of the world. This\nalso contributes\nto global warming and ozone depletion. \nThis legislative proposal will support and\nsteer Member States\u2019 inspections in order to target the problematic and\nhigh-risk waste streams described above. Risk assessments shall be carried out by\nMember States, covering specific waste streams and sources of illegal\nshipments, and considering intelligence\u2013based data, such as police\ninvestigations and analyses of criminal activities. Every year priorities for\ninspections shall be selected based on these risk assessments and published in\nthe annual inspection plans. These plans shall be made available to the public.\nInspectors shall take the inspection plans into account and require evidence\nfrom suspected illegal waste exporters according to the relevant provisions in\nthe proposal. \nIllegal waste shipments are a serious and\nfrequent problem. The export bans for hazardous waste and waste for disposal under\nthe WSR are often circumvented. Exports of hazardous waste are often labelled\nas second-hand goods and waste for disposal as waste going to recovery. This is\nconfirmed by the joint inspections carried out by the \"network for the\nimplementation and enforcement of environmental law, trans-frontier shipments\nof waste-cluster\" (IMPEL-tfs) and supported by the Commission; this revealed\nvery high rates of non-compliance with the WSR due to illegal waste shipments.\nAs part of the joint inspections during the period October 2008-November 2010, 22\nMember States checked and reported on transports by road and in ports (over\n20,000 transport inspections and over a hundred company inspections).[4] Taking into account the total\nnumber of inspected waste shipments from and within the EU during the period\n(3,454) and the number of violations (863), the overall non-compliance rate can\nbe estimated to be 25%. \nIn 2011 a study estimated the tonnage of\nillegal shipments as a proportion of the total amount of waste shipments within\nand out of the EU.[5]\nThe study concluded that if only 1% of all waste shipments were illegal, the\ntotal tonnage of illegal waste shipments would amount to 2,8 million tonnes per\nyear.\nIllegal waste shipments out of the EU frequently\nstem from uncontrolled collection, storage and sorting facilities, where\nillegal operators get hold of the waste and ship it illegally to developing\ncountries. A 2011 Europol study[6]\nconcluded that intermediate storage sites are often used to disguise the\nultimate destinations of waste and to frustrate law enforcement efforts to\nidentify source companies. \nThe ports in the north-western part of the EU\n(Antwerp, Hamburg, Le Havre and Rotterdam) play an important role in the export\nof waste (e-waste, end-of-life vehicles, plastics, paper and various types of\nhazardous waste) to countries in Africa and Asia. As many of these ports see large\ntonnages of waste (both lawfully and illegally) shipped out of the EU, they\nhave more frequent controls and, for this reason, probably detect more illegal\nwaste shipments. \nEffective enforcement and inspections of\nwaste shipments would not only help prevent the serious environmental and\nhealth impacts stemming from illegal waste shipments, but also save high costs\nand result in direct economic benefits for Member States and industry.\nFinancial benefits stemming from better enforcement include avoided clean-up\nand repatriation costs. For instance, a recent study showed that stricter\nenforcement in the port of Rotterdam resulted in increased quality and quantity\nof waste recycled, as waste was routed via legal channels to facilities with\nbetter treatment techniques. Reinforced inspections in the port of Rotterdam also led to the creation of 22 jobs \u2013 in customs, inspections and waste\ntreatment plants[7].\n\nCouncil conclusions of 3 June 2010 invited\nthe Commission, inter alia, to consider strengthening EU requirements on\ninspections and spot checks carried out under the WSR. In response to this, the\nCommission has assessed the issue in more detail and has prepared an ex ante impact\nassessment, in line with its guidelines on impact assessments. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nOn 25 January 2011, the Commission launched\nan on-line stakeholder consultation via its EUROPA website in line with the\nminimum standards for consultation. The consultation was open to all stakeholders\nfor eleven weeks, accessible via the single access point on the internet.[8] During the consultation, 65\ncontributions were received from 18 Member State authorities, one EEA country\nauthority, 25 industry organisations, five private companies, two public\norganisations, three NGOs and 11 individuals[9].\nThe stakeholders expressed wide support in favour of EU legislative\nrequirements on waste shipment inspections (90% of respondents). \nDuring a 2012 public consultation on\nburdensome legislative acts for SMEs, a concern was raised that the WSR has not\nled to the creation of a common market for waste utilisation and recycling due\nto differences in implementation and interpretation across Member State, and\nthat more should be done to ensure uniform implementation of the WSR with more\nfocus on hazardous waste and less on unproblematic waste. Another concern\nraised was that there should be further simplification of procedures to move\nwaste between Member States, leaving the inspection and evaluation of waste\ntreatment facilities to the authorities of the receiving Member State. \nThis legislative proposal on waste shipment\ninspections aims to help ensure more uniform implementation of the WSR through\nestablishing minimum inspection requirements throughout the EU with a focus on\nproblematic waste streams.[10]\nUnder the WSR, there already is a simplified procedure\nfor shipments of waste for recovery compared to shipments of waste for\ndisposal. However, the lack of harmonised inspection procedures undermines a\nproper functioning of the internal market with respect to waste shipments. A\nproper functioning of the internal market requires that inspections of waste\nshipments are carried out effectively throughout the EU. The current lack of a\nlevel playing field due to wide disparities in enforcement practices puts\nlaw-abiding businesses at an economic disadvantage. The high rates of illegal\nwaste shipments undermine the legitimate waste treatment and disposal\nindustries. If the WSR was applied properly throughout the EU, this would\nreinforce confidence and trust in the waste shipment system among economic\noperators. Companies in the recycling and waste management sector would find\nincentives to invest and create new jobs. \nThe inspection of waste treatment\nfacilities is a task for the authorities in the Member State where they are\nlocated. However, it is necessary for the competent authority in the Member State of dispatch to be able to evaluate how the waste will be managed by the\nfacility in the receiving Member State. For example, the dispatch authority may\nafter having examined the nature of the waste conclude that it cannot be\nmanaged in accordance with Articles 11-12 of the WSR by the facility in the\nreceiving Member State. This evaluation has to be made before the shipment\nleaves the dispatch country, otherwise illegal shipments cannot be prevented.\nIf the shipment is illegal, the dispatch country may have to pay the bill for, inter\nalia, taking the waste back. The evaluation of waste treatment\nfacilities cannot therefore be left solely to the authorities of the receiving Member State. \nThe Commission's ex ante impact assessment on\nthis legislative proposal examined several options to strengthen inspections\nand enforcement of the WSR. The EU \"network for the implementation and\nenforcement of environmental law, trans-frontier shipments of\nwaste-cluster\" (IMPEL-tfs), authorities in Member States and various\ngroups of stakeholders were closely involved in the preparation of studies that\nwere conducted to support the assessment.\nThe assessment concluded that a combination\nof EU legislative requirements and guidance would be the most effective option\nto address the problems related to illegal waste shipments. This option would\nalso have the lowest net costs and the most positive economic, social and\nenvironmental impacts. It would result in significant cost savings for clean-up\nand repatriation as well as indirect cost savings for Member States where waste\ntransits. Industry would also benefit from harmonisation of legislation. Higher\nquantities of waste routed through legal channels would lead to optimised\nprocesses, better sorting techniques and better waste quality. A legal\nrequirement to reinforce inspections could also create new jobs and avoid\nrelocation of jobs outside the EU. \nCosts for Member States that lack adequate\ninspection systems (e.g. for hiring staff, and upgrading infrastructure and\ninspections) have been estimated as part of the impact assessment. These costs would be around \u20ac4 million/year for\nthe whole EU, but could be\noutweighed by the economic and social benefits and/or financed\nby collected fines. According to the impact assessment, the additional\ninspections required would break even if less than 1%\nof all the yearly inspections would result in average fines.\nThe impact assessment found that inspection\nplanning is the most important of the proposed legislative measures. The second\nmost important contributor to solving the problem would be the possibility for\ncompetent authorities in Member States to require evidence from suspected\nillegal waste exporters in order to check the legality of shipments, and then\nin descending order, controls of upstream facilities and training for\nauthorities.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 1(3)(b) of this proposal amends Article 50 of the WSR by\nintroducing requirements for inspection planning for waste shipments. \nArticle 1(3)(c) introduces in Article 50, the possibility for the\ncompetent authorities in Member States to require evidence from suspected\nillegal waste exporters in order to check the legality of shipments. Such\nevidence may concern whether the substance or object is \"waste\" or\nnot, whether the shipment is destined for recovery or disposal, or the nature\nof the specific waste treatment methods and standards applied by the facility in\nthe country of destination, with a view to assessing compliance with Article 49\nof the WSR. \nArticle 1(2) and 1(4) align the WSR with Article 290 of the Treaty\non the Functioning of the European Union in line with the Commission's\ncommitment to review provisions attached to the regulatory procedure in each\ninstrument it intends to modify.\nArticle 2 of this proposal stipulates that the Regulation shall enter\ninto force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal and apply from [1 January xxxx or 1 July xxxx which ever date occurs first provided\nthis date is at least six months from the entry into force of the Regulation].\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nNot applicable.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nNot applicable.\n2013/0239 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 on\nshipments of waste \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192 (1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[11],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[12],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on\nshipments of waste[13]\nlays down requirements for shipments of waste both within the Union and between\nthe Member States and third countries, in order to protect the environment.\nHowever, gaps have been identified in the enforcement and inspections carried\nout by the competent authorities in Member States due to, inter alia, a\nlack of clear provisions in the Regulation on these matters. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adequate planning of waste\nshipment inspections is necessary to establish the capacity needed for waste\nshipment inspections and effectively prevent illegal shipments. The provisions\non enforcement and inspections in Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 should\ntherefore be strengthened with a view to ensuring regular and consistent planning\nof inspections. Planning should include a number of key elements, including\nrisk assessments, strategies, objectives, priorities, numbers and types of\nplanned inspections, assignment of tasks, means of cooperation between\nauthorities and provisions on training of inspectors. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diverging\nrules exist throughout the Union as regards the\npossibility for competent authorities in Member States to require evidence from\nwaste exporters in order to check the legality of shipments. Such evidence may\nconcern whether the substance or object is \"waste\"\nwithin the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 or whether\nthe waste will be shipped to environmentally sound facilities according to\nArticle 49 of the Regulation. Article 50 of the Regulation should therefore provide\nthe possibility for competent authorities in Member\nStates to require evidence from suspected illegal waste exporters in order to\ncheck the legality of shipments. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Illegal waste shipments\nfrequently stem from uncontrolled collection, storage and sorting facilities. Inspection\nrequirements should therefore be introduced for such waste sites.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\nentry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers\nconferred on the Commission under Regulation (EC) 1013/2006 should be aligned to\nArticle 290 of the Treaty. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be\ndelegated to the Commission with the objective to adopt technical and\norganisational requirements for the practical implementation of electronic data\ninterchange. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out\nappropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert\nlevel. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a\nsimultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the\nEuropean Parliament and Council. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission may adopt guidelines for the application of Article 12(1)(g) of the\nRegulation; guidelines on the application of Article 15 of the Regulation;\nguidelines for the cooperation of competent authorities with regard to illegal\nshipments; further guidance concerning the use of languages; further\nclarification of the procedural requirements of Title II of the Regulation as\nregards their application to exports, imports and transit of waste from, to and\nthrough the Community. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\n(EC) No 1013/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should\napply from 1 January [xxxx] or 1 July [xxxx]\nwhich ever date occurs first provided this date is at least six months from the\nentry into force of the Regulation, in order to allow sufficient time for Member States and businesses to prepare for the application of the\nmeasures required under Article 50 of the Regulation. \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 1013/2006 is amended as\nfollows:\n(1) in Article 2, the following\nparagraph 36 is added:\n'36.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 're-use' means\nany operation by which products or components that are not waste are used again\nfor the same purpose for which they were conceived. \n(2) in Article 26, the following\nparagraph 5 is added\n'5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission\nshall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in\naccordance with Article 59 concerning technical and organisational requirements for the practical\nimplementation of electronic data interchange for the submission of documents\nand information.'\n(3) Article 50 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 2 is replaced by the\nfollowing:\n'2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States shall, by way of\nmeasures for the enforcement of this Regulation, provide, inter alia,\nfor inspections of establishments and undertakings in accordance with Article\n34 of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19\nNovember 2008 on waste[14],\nand for spot checks on shipments of waste or on the related recovery or\ndisposal.'\n(b) the following paragraph 2a is inserted:\n'2a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States shall ensure that their\ncompetent authorities establish plans for inspections aimed at checking\ncompliance with this Regulation. The plans shall cover the entire geographical\narea of the Member State concerned and shall apply to all waste shipment inspections\ncarried out pursuant to paragraph 2, including inspections of establishments\nand undertakings, road- and railway transports and consignments in ports. Those\nplans shall include the following:\n(a)          \nstrategy and objectives for waste shipment\ninspections referring to the necessary human, financial and other resources;\n(b)         \na risk assessment covering specific waste\nstreams and sources of illegal shipments, and considering intelligence-based\ndata, such as police investigations and analyses of criminal activities; \n(c)          \npriorities and a description of how these priorities\nhave been selected based on the strategies, objectives and risk assessment;\n(d)         \ninformation on the numbers and types of planned\ninspections concerning waste sites, road and railway transports and consignments\nin ports;\n(e)          \nan assignment of tasks to each authority\ninvolved in waste shipment inspections;\n(f)           \nmeans of cooperation between different\nauthorities involved in inspections; and\n(g)          \nan assessment of the need for training of\ninspectors on technical or legal matters relating to waste management and waste\nshipments and provisions on regular training programmes. \nThe plans shall be reviewed at least\nannually and, where appropriate, updated. The review shall evaluate to which\nextent the objectives and other elements of the plans have been implemented.\nThe plans shall be made publicly available\nby the competent authority in accordance with Directive 2003/4/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to\nenvironmental information[15]'.'\n\n(c) the following\nparagraphs 4a and 4b are inserted: \n'4a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ascertain that a shipment\ndoes not contain waste within the meaning of Article 2(1), the competent\nauthority may:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 verify that appropriate protection of\nthe shipment against damage during transportation, loading and unloading has\nbeen foreseen; and \n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in cases of a suspected illegal shipment,\nrequire the person in charge of the shipment to submit a copy of the invoice\nand contract relating to the sale or transfer of ownership of the substance or\nobject, which states that it is destined for re-use within the meaning of\nArticle 2(36) and to prove that it is fully functional.\n4b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ascertain that a shipment\nis destined for recovery operations which are in accordance with Article 49,\nthe competent authority may in cases of a suspected illegal shipment require\nthe person in charge of the shipment to submit a contract, letter or other\ndocument signed by the recovery facility specifying the waste treatment\nmethods, technologies and standards applied by the recovery facility in the\ncountry of destination.'\n(4) Articles 59\nand 59a are replaced by the following:\nArticle 59\nExercise\nof the delegation\n1.     \nThe power to adopt delegated acts is conferred\non the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\n2.     \nThe delegation of power referred to in Article\n26(5) shall be conferred on the Commission for an indeterminate period of time\nfrom the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n3.     \nThe delegation of power referred to in Article\n26(5) may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council.\nA decision of revocation shall put an end to the delegation of the power\nspecified in that decision.
