This forms part of a set of EU legal acts\nfor ensuring the deployment of the 112-based eCall service by 1 October 2015.\nThe other main legislative acts linked to this eCall initiative are:\n\u00b7                        \nCommission Recommendation 2011/750/EU of 8\nSeptember 2011 on support for an EU-wide eCall service in electronic\ncommunication networks for the transmission of in-vehicle emergency calls based\non 112 (\u2018eCalls\u2019)[1]\n\u00b7                        \nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 305/2013\nof 26.11.2012 supplementing Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and\nof the Council with regards to the harmonised provision for an interoperable\nEU-wide eCall[2]\n\u00b7                        \nProposal for Decision (EU) No\u2026/.. of xx.xx.20xx of the European Parliament and of the Council on the\ndeployment of the interoperable EU-wide eCall[3]\nThese different texts are complementary and\ntogether will allow for the 112 eCall service to be fully operational by 1\nOctober 2015.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultations with the\ninterested parties\nThis proposal is the result of extensive\nconsultations with major stakeholders:\nThe stakeholders, and notably the CARS21\nHigh Level Group, were consulted during the process that led to the adoption of\nthe \u201cCARS 2020: action plan for a competitive and sustainable European car\nindustry\u201d. More precisely, this proposal constitutes a delivery of the action:\n\u201cfurther promote the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS),\nincluding cooperative systems, in particular the EU-wide in-vehicle emergency\ncall system eCall\". \nThis proposal also takes into consideration\nall the consultations made in the eCall Impact Assessment. These consultations\ninclude, in particular, extensive contributions from stakeholders involved in\nseveral fora such as the European eCall Implementation Platform (EeIP), the\neCall Public Service Answering Points (\u201cPSAPs\u201d) expert Group and the eCall\nDriving Group within the eSafety/i-Mobility Forum, and a public consultation on\nthe implementation of eCall that was open from 19 July to 19 September 2010.\nFinally, this proposal takes into\nconsideration the opinion of the European ITS Advisory Group, composed of 25\nhigh level representatives from ITS service providers, associations of users,\ntransport and facilities operators, manufacturing industry, social partners,\nprofessional associations, local authorities and other relevant fora. \n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment and\ncost-benefit analysis\nAn extensive cost-benefit analysis was\nconducted as part of the eCall Impact Assessment for the three proposed\noptions, including the preferred option on regulatory measures.\nAs far as the cost-benefit analysis of the\nchosen option (option 3) is concerned, each of the three planned eCall\nregulatory measures (in-vehicle, telecommunication, PSAP) is inseparable from\nthe other two.\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis of main benefits\nThe benefits identified through the impact\nassessment and several studies, including national ones, include:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reduction of fatalities (with all\nvehicles eCall-equipped, between 1% and 10% depending on country population\ndensity, road and emergency response infrastructure); \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reduction of seriousness of the\ninjuries (between 2% and 15%); \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reduction of congestion costs\ncaused by traffic accidents. This is due to the improvement of accident\nmanagement, as the accident is immediately notified to the PSAPs and can therefore\nbe transferred to the appropriate Traffic Management Control, which can\nimmediately inform other road users, and help reduce secondary accidents;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Facilitation of rescue services\nand increased security of rescue team (e.g. fire-fighters) when extracting\ntrapped occupants, as the Minimum Set of Data (\u201cMSD\u201d) in the eCall message will,\namong others, provide information on the fuel type;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reduced SOS roadside\ninfrastructure, as each road user would be able to trigger an emergency call\nfrom their vehicle.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cost\u2013benefit ratio\nBenefits have also been quantified in\nmonetary values and a cost-benefit analysis drawn for the different options as\nwell for types of affected categories. The estimations are calculated up to\nyear 2033 as this is the expected year of full penetration of the eCall service\nin case of the preferred policy option. \n   || Policy option 1 No EU action || Policy Option 2 Voluntary approach || Policy Option 3 Regulatory measures \n Benefit-Cost Ratio || 0.29 || 0.68 || 1.74 \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe legal basis is article 114 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\nproportionality\nAccording to the principle of subsidiarity\n(Article 5.3 Treaty on the European Union), action at Union level should be\ntaken only when the aims envisaged cannot be achieved sufficiently by Member\nStates alone and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the\nproposed action, be better achieved by the Union.\nRoad safety is an issue of major concern\nacross the entire European Union and for all of its citizens. The purpose of\nthe interoperable EU-wide eCall initiative is ultimately to introduce in all\nvehicles in the EU the minimum functionalities needed to ensure adequate\nhandling of the emergency calls by the emergency response services. Currently,\nroad journeys exceed 100 million annually across the various Member States and\nthey are increasing due to further consolidation of the European Union (through\nthe free movement of goods, persons and services). Action is needed at EU level\nin order to guarantee interoperability and continuity of the service throughout\n Europe, which cannot be satisfactorily achieved by individual Member States\nalone. Moreover, taking action at EU level using common European eCall standards\napproved by the European Standardisation Organisations (CEN and ETSI) will\nensure the efficient provision of the emergency response service across Europe,\nfor example in the case of vehicles travelling abroad, and also help to avoid\nmarket fragmentation.\nThe EU-wide eCall has been designed in such\na way as to minimise the impact on all the stakeholders in the value chain\n(automotive industry, mobile network operators, Member States - PSAPs), and to\ndistribute this impact fairly.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed explanation of\nthe proposal\nArticles 2, 4 and 5:\nThe proposal requires new types of\npassenger cars and light commercial vehicles to be constructed as to ensure\nthat in the event of a severe accident an emergency call (eCall) to the 112 is\ntriggered automatically. It must also be possible to trigger manually emergency\ncalls (eCalls) to the 112.\nArticle 6:\nDue to the nature of the information being\nprovided by this service, rules for privacy and data protection are provided.\nArticles 5, 6 and 8:\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt\ndelegated acts relating to:\n\u00b7                        \nDetailed technical requirements and tests for\nthe type-approval of the eCall in-vehicle systems, which will be based on the\nstandards referred to in Article 5; \n\u00b7                        \nprivacy and data protection;\n\u00b7                        \nexemptions for special purpose vehicles and for\nother justified cases. The exemptions will be limited in number.\nArticle 12:\nThe Regulation will apply from 1 October\n2015.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThere are no budgetary implications for the\nEU budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nThe proposed act concerns an EEA matter and\nshould therefore extend to the European Economic area.\n2013/0165 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nconcerning type-approval requirements for\nthe deployment of the eCall in-vehicle system and amending Directive 2007/46/EC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal of the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A comprehensive Union\ntype-approval system for motor vehicles has been established by Directive\n2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 on\nestablishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers,\nand of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such\nvehicles (Framework Directive)[5].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The technical requirements\nfor the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to numerous safety and\nenvironmental elements have been harmonised at Union level in order to ensure a\nhigh level of road safety throughout the Union. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to further\nimprove road safety, the Communication \"eCall: Time for Deployment\"[6] proposes new measures to\naccelerate the deployment of an in-vehicle emergency call service in the Union. One of the suggested measures is to make mandatory the fitting of eCall in-vehicle systems\nin all new vehicles starting with M1 and N1 vehicle categories as defined in Annex\nII to Directive 2007/46/EC.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n3 July 2012, the European Parliament approved the Report on eCall: a new 112 service for citizens[7] urging the Commission to submit a proposal within the framework of\nDirective 2007/46/EC in order to ensure the mandatory deployment of a public,\n112-based eCall system by 2015. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union eCall system is\nexpected to reduce the number of fatalities in the Union as well as the\nseverity of injuries caused by road accidents. The mandatory introduction of the\neCall system would make the service available to all citizens and thus\ncontribute to reduce human suffering and healthcare and other costs.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provision of accurate\nand reliable positioning information is an essential element of the effective operation\nof the eCall in-vehicle system. Therefore, it is appropriate to require its\ncompatibility with the services provided by satellite navigation programmes,\nincluding the systems established under the Galileo and EGNOS programmes set\nout in Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 9 July 2008 on the further implementation of the European satellite\nnavigation programmes (EGNOS and Galileo)[8].\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mandatory equipping of\nvehicles with the eCall in-vehicle system should initially apply only to new\npassenger cars and light commercial vehicles (categories M1 and N1) for which\nan appropriate triggering mechanism already exists. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mandatory equipping of\nvehicles with the eCall in-vehicle system should be without prejudice to the\nright of all stakeholders such as car manufacturers and independent operators\nto offer additional emergency and/or added value services, in parallel with or\nbuilding on the 112-based eCall in-vehicle system. However, these additional\nservices should be designed not to increase driver distraction.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure open\nchoice for customers and fair competition, as well as encourage innovation and\nboost the competitiveness of the Union\u2019s information technology industry on the\nglobal market, the eCall in-vehicle system should be accessible free of charge\nand without discrimination to all independent operators and based on an\ninteroperable and open-access platform for possible future in-vehicle\napplications or services.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to maintain the\nintegrity of the type-approval system, only those eCall in-vehicle systems\nwhich can be fully tested should be accepted for the purposes of this\nRegulation. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Small series vehicles are\nexcluded under Directive 2007/46/EC from the requirements on the protection of\noccupants in the case of frontal impact and side impact. Therefore, those small\nseries vehicles should be excluded from the obligation to comply with the eCall\nrequirements.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Special purpose vehicles\nshould be subject to compliance with the eCall requirements set out in this\nRegulation, unless type-approval authorities consider, on a case by case basis,\nthat the vehicle cannot meet those requirements due to its special purpose.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the recommendations\nmade by the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party and contained in the\n'Working document on data protection and privacy implications in eCall\ninitiative', adopted on 26 September 2006[9],\nany processing of personal data through the eCall in-vehicle system should\ncomply with the personal data\nprotection rules provided for in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with\nregard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[10] and in Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning\nthe processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic\ncommunications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications)[11],\nin particular to guarantee that vehicles equipped with\neCall in-vehicle systems, in their normal operational status related to 112\neCall, are not traceable and are not subject to any constant tracking and that\nthe minimum set of data sent by the in-vehicle eCall system includes the\nminimum information required for the appropriate handling of emergency calls.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European\nStandardisation Organisations, ETSI and CEN, have developed common standards\nfor the deployment of a pan-European eCall service, which should apply for the\npurposes of this Regulation, as this will facilitate the technological\nevolution of the in-vehicle eCall service, ensure the interoperability and\ncontinuity of the service throughout the Union, and reduce the costs of\nimplementation for the Union as a whole.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\napplication of common technical requirements regarding the eCall in-vehicle system,\nthe power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in\nrespect of the detailed rules on the application of the relevant standards, on\ntesting, on personal data and privacy protection and on exemptions for certain\nvehicles or classes of vehicles of categories M1 and N1. It is of particular\nimportance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its\npreparatory work, including at expert level.
