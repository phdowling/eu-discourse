In\nline with this strategy, the White Paper \u201cRoadmap to a Single European\nTransport Area \u2013 Towards a Competitive and Resource Efficient Transport System\u201d[2] called for breaking the oil\ndependence of transport and set a target of 60% greenhouse gas emissions\nreduction from transport by 2050. It announces that the Commission will develop\n\u201ca sustainable alternative fuels strategy including also the appropriate\ninfrastructure\u201d (Initiative 24) and issue \u201cguidelines and standards for\nrefuelling infrastructures\u201d (Initiative 26).\nThe Commission Communication on a European\nalternative fuels strategy[3]\nevaluates the main alternative fuel options available to substitute oil whilst\ncontributing to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport, and\nsuggests a comprehensive list of measures to promote the market development of\nalternative fuels in Europe, complementing other policies for reducing oil\nconsumption and GHG emissions from transport.\nThe main alternative fuel options are\nelectricity, hydrogen, biofuels, natural gas (in the forms of Compressed\nNatural Gas (CNG), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), or Gas-To-Liquid (GTL)) , and\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).\nLack of alternative fuel infrastructure and of\nthe common technical specifications for the vehicle-infrastructure interface is\nconsidered a major obstacle to the market introduction of alternative fuels and\nconsumer acceptance.\nThis proposal for a Directive aims at ensuring\nthe build-up of alternative fuel infrastructure and the implementation of\ncommon technical specifications for this infrastructure in the Union. Its objective is to facilitate the work of market forces and contribute with this\ninitiative to economic growth in Europe. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of interested parties and\nimpact assessment\nThe Commission carried out extensive\npreparatory work and consultations with industry and civil society through the\nEuropean Expert Group on Future Transport Fuels in 2010-2011 and a targeted\nconsultation in November-December 2011, experts from the Member States through\nthe Joint Expert Group Transport & Environment in 2011, automotive experts\nfrom Member States, industry and civil society in the CARS 21 High Level Group\nin 2010-2012, and the general public through an on-line public consultation\nbetween August and October 2011 as well as a conference on \u201cFuture Transport\nFuels\u201d in the frame of the 2011 \u201cEuropean Union Sustainable Energy Week\u201d.\nThe reports prepared by the two Expert Groups\nand the CARS 21 High Level Group, summaries of the public conference, and of\nthe contributions received in the public and targeted stakeholder consultations\nhave been published on the Commission website[4].\nVarious studies have been undertaken. The\n\u201cStudy on Clean Transport Systems\u201d explored possible contributions of\nalternative fuels to achieve the 60% greenhouse gas emissions reduction target\nof the White Paper on Transport. The \u201cCTS Implementation Study on Alternative\nFuels Infrastructure\u201d assessed different options to develop an EU-wide\nalternative fuels infrastructure[5].\nThe \"EU Transport GHG: Routes to 2050\" study[6] specifically addressed\ndecarbonisation issues of relevance to this initiative and its findings\nunderlined the critical role that continued technical vehicle efficiency\nimprovements must play in parallel to alternative fuels to ensure\ncost-effectiveness of the overall policy package. \nThe Impact Assessment, which is presented\ntogether with this proposal, investigated the situation with infrastructure for\nthe main alternative fuel options. It assessed different policy options for the\nnecessary build-up of alternative fuel infrastructure and the implementation of\ncommon technical specifications. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal elements of the proposal\nThis proposal for a Directive sets out\nrequirements on establishing national policy frameworks for the market\ndevelopment of alternative fuels and on a minimum infrastructure build-up for\nalternative fuels, including the implementation of common technical\nspecifications. \nMinimum infrastructure coverage is proposed to\nbe mandatory for electricity, hydrogen, and natural gas (CNG and LNG), which is\nkey for acceptance for these alternative fuels by the consumers (market uptake)\nand further development and deployment of the technology by industry.\nThis proposal requires establishing a minimum\nnumber of recharging points for electric vehicles by each Member State, with 10% of them being publicly accessible. It defines minimum numbers per Member States,\nbased on the national targets for electric vehicles already set in many Member States, and an extrapolation to the total number to be expected for the whole Union. A larger number of electric vehicles can be expected in Member States with a higher rate\nof urbanisation, as electric vehicles will be deployed predominantly in urban\nagglomerations, due to range limitations, and the large benficial impact on\nreducing pollutant emissions and noise. Electric vehicles further need to have\nat least two recharging points per vehicles available for full recharging, and\na certain number of publicly accessible recharging points for intermittent topping-up\nrecharging to overcome range anxiety.\nThe implementation of common technical specifications\nis required for the interfaces between recharging points and vehicles, and also\nfor shore-side electricity supply to waterborne vessels.\nExisting hydrogen refuelling points, built up\nso far in the frame of hydrogen vehicle demonstration projects, shall be\ncomplemented to allow area covering circulation of hydrogen vehicles within the\nnational territory. This would allow hydrogen vehicles to circulate Union-wide.\nThis can serve as the basis for a possible later build-up of a Europe-wide network.\nImplementation of common technical specifications is required for the hydrogen\nrefuelling points.\nLNG refuelling points shall be built in all\nmaritime and inland waterway ports, and along motorways within maximum\ndistances, of the Trans-European Transport (TEN-T) Core Network. Implementation\nof common technical specifications is required for the LNG refuelling points,\nand also for CNG refuelling points for motor vehicles.\nCNG refuelling points shall be built up to the\nextent required to allow circulation of CNG vehicles Union-wide.\nClear and simple information on the\ncompatibility between the fuels and the vehicles existing in the market is\nrequired for the sake of consumer information to be placed at the pumps in all\nrefuelling points, in vehicle manuals, and on the vehicles.\nRevisions of the portfolio of alternative\nfuels, the infrastructure coverage and adoption of technical specifications for\nthe fuels and their infrastructure shall be enabled through delegated acts.\nDefinition of the means of consumer information\non fuels and their compatibility with vehicles shall be enabled through\nimplementing acts. \nAll essential elements required for the\ntransposition of this Directive are included in the Articles, annexes, and\nrecitals of this proposal. Explanatory documents are therefore not needed. \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis \u2013 Form of the\nlegal act\nThis proposal for a Directive aims at contributing\nto sustainable transport on the long term through support for the build-up of\nalternative fuel infrastructure. This action is based on Article 91 lit d) of\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Quantified obligations set\nin this proposal ensure a predictable framework for industry and customers.\nMember States are required to put into place national policy frameworks, for\nwhich a minimum set of elements is given in this proposal for the Directive.\nBut the Member States keep the choice of the transposition methods to achieve\nthe objectives set out. Flexibility in the transposition of the Directive\nallows Member States to use the instruments they consider most cost-efficient\nin attaining the targets defined by the Directive. \n3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Content of the proposal\nArticle 1\ndefines the scope of the Directive, requiring the implementation of common technical\nspecifications and the build-up of minimum infrastructure for electricity,\nnatural gas (LNG and CNG) and hydrogen as alternative fuels for transport.\nArticle 2\ncontains the definitions of terms for the purpose of this Directive. \nArticle 3\nrequires Member States to establish national policy frameworks for the market\ndevelopment of alternative fuels and their infrastructure. It contains also\nprovisions on cooperation between Member States and provisions on the reporting\nobligation to the Commission and the subsequent evaluation of those national\npolicy frameworks by the Commission. \nArticle 4 sets\nrequirements on a minimum number of electric vehicle recharging points by each Member State and common technical specifications to be met by this infrastructure.\nArticle 5\nrequires that on the territory of Member States where hydrogen refuelling\npoints already exist, a sufficient number of hydrogen refuelling points are\nprovided to allow the circulation of hydrogen vehicles within the entire\nnational territory. It also defines common technical specifications to be met\nby this infrastructure.\nArticle 6\nrequires that all maritime and inland ports and roads of the TEN-T Core Network\nare equipped with LNG refuelling points, and defines common technical specifications\nto be met by this infrastructure. It also requires providing a sufficient\nnumber of CNG refuelling points, within maximum distances, to allow Union-wide\ncirculation of CNG vehicles and defines common technical specifications to be\nmet by CNG refuelling points\nArticle 7 defines\ncommon elements of consumer information on fuels and compatibility with\nvehicles to be made available at the pump in the refuelling points, in vehicle manuals,\nand on the vehicles.\nArticles 8\nspecifies the procedure for delegated acts.\nArticle 9 specifies\nthe Committee procedure for implementing acts.\nArticle 10\noutlines schedule and content of reports from the Member States and from the\nCommission.\nArticle 11\ndefines the time limit for the transposition of this Directive and the\nnotification procedure of the national transposition measures.\nArticle 12\nspecifies the date of entry into force of this Directive.\nAnnex I defines\nthe minimum number of elements to be contained in the national policy\nframeworks. \nAnnex II sets\nthe minimum number of electric vehicle recharging points to be established in\neach Member State. \nAnnex III\ndefines the technical specifications for electric vehicle recharging points,\nshore-side electricity supply for ships, hydrogen refuelling points, natural\ngas (LNG and CNG) refuelling points,\nand the fuel standards to be used for the consumer information to be provided\non transport fuels. \nSubsidiarity Principle\nThe right for the Union to act in the field of\ntransport is set out in Articles 90 and 91 of the TFEU, in Title VI on the Common\nTransport Policy. \nA Union initiative in this field is necessary\nsince Member States do not have the necessary legal instruments to achieve\npan-European coordination in terms of build-up and technical specifications of\ninfrastructure for the alternative fuels. \nThe value added by European action in this\nfield derives from the trans-national nature of the identified problem of a\nlack of alternative fuel infrastructure. Vehicle, vessel, and equipment\nmanufacturers need to produce on a large scale for a single Union market. They also\nneed to be able to rely on consistent developments across Member States.\nSimilarly, consumers and transport users expect pan-European mobility for\nalternative fuel vehicles and vessels. European action can provide the\nrequested coordination at the level of the entire Union market and the\nimplementation of common technical specifications EU-wide.\nProportionality Principle\nTo comply with the principle of\nproportionality, the proposed action only addresses the alternative fuels of electricity,\nhydrogen, and natural gas (LNG and CNG) for which market failures require\npublic intervention, and two modes of transport (by road and waterborne) for\nwhich the development of a minimum necessary network cannot be achieved without\nUnion support. These sectors represent more than 80% of freight and passenger\ntransport volumes. In these sectors, the use of alternative fuels is essential for\nbreaking the oil dependence, improving the competitiveness of Europe, and reducing\ngreenhouse gas and pollutant emissions. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary implication\nOnly limited costs related to the follow-up on\nthe implementation of the Directive will arise for the EU budget. \n2013/0012 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the deployment of alternative fuels\ninfrastructure\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\nCommission[7],\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[8],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[9],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)                   \nIn its Communication \"Europe 2020: A\nstrategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth\"[10] the Commission aims at\nenhancing competitiveness and energy security by more efficient use of\nresources and energy. \n(2)                   \nThe White Paper \u201cRoadmap\nto a Single European Transport Area \u2013 Towards a Competitive and Resource\nEfficient Transport System\"[11]\ncalled for breaking the oil dependence of transport. In consequence the\nCommission undertook to develop a sustainable alternative fuels strategy as\nwell as the appropriate infrastructure. The White Paper also set a target of\n60% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction from transport by 2050.\n(3)                   \nDirective 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 23/04/2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from\nrenewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC\nand 2003/30/EC[12] set a target of 10% market share of renewables in transport fuels. \n(4)                   \nBased on the consultation of stakeholders and\nnational experts, as well as expertise[13]\nelectricity, hydrogen, biofuels, natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)\nwere identified as the main alternative fuels with a potential for long-term\noil substitution and decarbonisation.\n(5)                   \nThe CARS 21 High Level Group report of 6 June\n2012[14]\nstates that the lack of a Union-wide harmonised alternative fuel\ninfrastructure hampers the market introduction of vehicles using alternative\nfuels and delays their environmental benefits. The Commission Communication on\na CARS 2020 Action Plan for the automotive industry in Europe takes up the main\nrecommendations of CARS 21 High Level Group report and presents an Action Plan\nbased on them[15].\nThis Directive on alternative fuels infrastructure is one of the key actions\nannounced by the Commission.\n(6)                   \nFragmentation of the internal market through\nuncoordinated market introduction of alternative fuels should be avoided.\nCoordinated policy frameworks of all Member States should therefore provide the\nlong-term security required for private and public investement into vehicle and\nfuel technology, and infrastructure build-up. Member States should therefore\nestablish national policy frameworks outlining their objectives, targets, and\nsupporting actions on the market development of alternative fuels, including\nthe necessary infrastructure to be put into place. Member States should\ncooperate with other neighbouring Member States on the regional or\nmacro-regional level, through consultation or joint policy frameworks, in\nparticular where continuity of alternative fuel infrastructure coverage across\nnational borders or construction of new infrastructure in the proximity of\nnational borders is required. A coordination of these national policy\nframeworks and their coherence at EU level should be ensured by the Commission,\nfollowing a periodic evaluation thereof.\n(7)                   \nOnly fuels included in the national policy\nframeworks should be eligible for Union and national support measures for\nalternative fuels infrastructure in order to focus public support on a\nco-ordinated internal market development towards Union-wide mobility using\nalternative fuels vehicles and vessels.\n(8)                   \nSupport measures for alternative fuels\ninfrastructure shall be implemented in compliance with the State aid rules\ncontained in TFEU.\n(9)                   \nBiofuels are fuels produced from biomass, as\ndefined in the Directive 2009/28/EC[16].\nBiofuels are currently the most important type of alternative fuels, accounting\nfor 4.4% in EU transport. They can contribute to a substantial reduction in\noverall CO2 emissions, if they are produced sustainably and do not cause\nindirect lands use change. They could provide clean power to all modes of\ntransport. However, supply constraints and sustainability considerations may\nlimit their use. \n(10)               \nThe lack of harmonised development of\nalternative fuels infrastructure across the Union prevents the development of\neconomies of scale on the supply side and EU-wide mobility on the demand side.\nNew infrastructure networks need to be built up, in particular for electricity,\nhydrogen, and natural gas (LNG and CNG).\n(11)               \nElectricity is a clean fuel particularly\nattractive for deployment of electric vehicles and electric two-wheelers in\nurban agglomerations which can contribute to improving air quality and reducing\nnoise. Member States should ensure that recharging points for electric vehicles\nare built up with sufficient coverage, at least twice the number of vehicles,\nand 10% of them publicly accessible, focussing in particular on urban\nagglomerations. Private owners of electric vehicles depend to a large extent on\naccess to recharging points in collective parking lots, such as in appartment\nblocks, office and business locations. Regulatory provisions should be set up\nby public authorities, assisting citizens by ensuring that the appropriate\ninfrastructure with sufficient electric vehicle recharging points is provided\nby the site developers and managers.\n(12)               \nWhen developing infrastructure for electric\nvehicles the interaction of that infrastructure with the electricity system, as\nwell as the electricity policy of the Union, needs to be taken into account. The\nestablishment and operation of recharging points for electric vehicles should\nbe developed as a competitive market with open access to all parties interested\nin rolling out or operating recharging infrastructures. \n(13)               \nElectric vehicles could contribute to the stability\nof the electricity system by recharging their batteries from the grid at times\nof low general electricity demand and feeding power from the batteries back\ninto the grid at times of high general electricity demand. Therefore recharging\npoints should use intelligent metering systems, and the price for electricity\nat a recharging point should be market based, so that flexible consumption (and\nstorage) of electricity is promoted through dynamic pricing.\n(14)               \nWith respect to recharging points for electric\nvehicles which are not publicly accessible, Member States should ensure\nconsistency and aim to maximise synergies with intelligent meter roll-out plans\nfollowing the obligation under Annex I.2 of Directive 2009/72/EC of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules\nfor the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC[17]. Publicly accessible recharging points are currently not\npart of the regulated activities of a distribution system operator as defined\nin Chapter VI of Directive 2009/72/EC.\n(15)               \nThe Commission delivered in 2010 a Mandate (M468)\nto the European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs) in order to issue new\nstandards or review the existing ones with the aim of ensuring the\ninteroperability and connectivity between the electricity supply point and the\ncharger of electric vehicles. CEN/CENELEC set up a Focus Group which published\na report in October 2011. Whereas the report contains a number of\nrecommendations, no consensus was found to select one standard interface.\nTherefore, further policy action is needed in order to provide a\nnon-proprietary solution ensuring interoperability across the EU.\n(16)               \nShore-side electricity facilities can serve maritime\nand inland waterway transport as clean power supply, in particular in maritime\nand inland navigation ports where air quality or noise levels are poor.\n(17)               \nHydrogen vehicles, including hydrogen powered\ntwo-wheelers, have at present very low market penetration rates but a build-up of sufficient hydrogen refuelling infrastructure is\nessential to enable larger-scale hydrogen vehicle deployment.\n(18)               \nMember States should ensure that publicly\naccessible infrastructure for the supply of hydrogen to motor vehicles is built\nup, with distances between refuelling points for motor vehicles allowing area\ncovering circulation of hydrogen vehicles within the national territory, as\nwell as a certain number of refuelling points located in urban agglomerations.\nThis would allow hydrogen vehicles to circulate Union-wide.\n(19)               \nAs far as natural gas vehicles are concerned, around\n3,000 refuelling points are in operation in the Union. Additional refuelling\npoints could easily be put in place and supplied from the existing well developed\narea covering natural gas distribution network in the Union, provided that the\nquality of the gas is sufficient for use in current and advanced technology gas\nvehicles.\n(20)               \nMember States should ensure that publicly\naccessible infrastructure for the supply of gaseous Compressed Natural Gas\n(CNG) to motor vehicles is built up, with distances between refuelling points allowing\narea covering circulation of CNG vehicles across the Union, as well as a\ncertain number of refuelling points located in urban agglomerations. \n(21)               \nLiquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is an attractive\nfuel alternative for vessels to meet the requirements for decreasing the\nsulphur content in maritime fuels in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas,\naffecting half of the ships sailing in European Short Sea Shipping, as provided\nfor by Directive 2012/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21\nNovember 2012 amending Council Directive 1999/32/EC as regards the sulphur\ncontent of marine fuels[18].\nA core network of LNG refuelling points for maritime and inland waterway vessels\nshould be available at least by the end of 2020. The initial focus on the core\nnetwork should not rule out that in the longer perspective LNG is also made\navailable at ports outside the core network, in particular those ports that are\nimportant for vessels not engaged in transport operations (fishing vessels,\noffshore service vessels etc.).\n(22)               \nLNG might also offer a cost-efficient technology\nfor heavy duty vehicles to meet the stringent pollutant emission limits of Euro\nVI standards[19].\n(23)               \nThe core network established in the Regulation\nof the European Parliament and of the Council on Union guidelines for the\ndevelopment of the trans-European transport network[20] should be the basis for the\ndeployment of LNG infrastructure as it covers the main traffic flows and allows\nfor network benefits. \n(24)               \nWith the increasing diversity in the type of\nfuels for motorized vehicles coupled with on-going growth in the road mobility\nof citizens across the Union, it is necessary to provide the consumers with a clear\nand easy to understand information on the compatibility of their vehicle with\ndifferent fuels offered in the transport fuels market of the Union, without\nprejudice to Directive 2009/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 23 April 2009 amending Directive 98/70/EC as regards the specification of\npetrol, diesel and gas-oil and introducing a mechanism to monitor and reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions and amending Council Directive 1999/32/EC as regards\nthe specification of fuel used by inland waterway vessels and repealing\nDirective 93/12/EEC[21].\n\n(25)               \nIn order to ensure adaptation of the provisions\nof this Directive to market development and technical progress, the power to\nadopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of\nthe European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the portfolio\nof alternative fuels, the infrastructure characteristics and the adequate coverage\nas well as the standards for the fuels. It is of particular importance that the\nCommission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work,\nincluding at expert level.\n(26)               \nTechnical specifications for interoperability of\nrecharging and refuelling points should be specified in European standards\nwhich are fully compatible with relevant international standards. Lack of\nEuropean standards prevents giving detailed references to some required\nspecifications. Thus the Commission should ask European standardisation\norganisations to publish such European standards in accordance with Article 10\nof Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\non European Standardisation, amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and\n93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC, 95/16/EC 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC,\n2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council and repealing Decision 87/95/EEC and Decision No\n1673/2006/EC[22],\nand those standards should be based on current international standards or\non-going international standardisation work, where applicable. Where international standards are already available, technical\nspecifications contained in them should be used as an intermediate solution,\npending the adoption of European standards. For\nstandards not yet published, the work will be based on: (i) \"Configuration\nFF, IEC 62196-3:CDV 2012\" for fast DC electric recharging points for motor\nvehicles, (ii) ISO TC67/WG10 for LNG refuelling points for waterborne vessels\niii) the work of ISO/TC 252 for CNG and L-CNG refuelling for motor vehicles.\nThe Commission should be empowered to adapt the references to technical\nspecifications given in European standards through delegated acts.\n(27)               \nIn the application of\nthe Directive the Commission should consult relevant expert groups, such as the\nEuropean Expert Group on Future Transport Fuels, consisting of experts from\nindustry and civil society, as well as the Joint Expert Group Transport &Environment\nregrouping experts from the Member States.\n(28)               \nThe Commission, when preparing and drawing-up\ndelegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and the Council.\n(29)               \nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the\nimplementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on\nthe Commission to lay down common procedures and specifications.
