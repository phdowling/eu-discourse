The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n Summary of the proposed action The attached proposal for a Council Implementing Regulation is based on the findings of the investigation, which has confirmed that transhipment of bicycles from the PRC and assembly of bicycles using Chinese parts in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia is taking place and that all criteria for the establishment of circumvention as set out in Article 13(1) and (2) of the basic Regulation were met. Therefore the anti-dumping measures in force on bicycles originating in the PRC should be extended to imports of the same product consigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia. It is therefore proposed that the Council adopt the attached proposal to extend the anti-dumping measures on bicycles originating in the PRC to imports of the same product consigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia. The duty corresponds to the country-wide duty on imports of bicycles from the PRC (48.5%). The duty shall be levied from the date of initiation of the investigation. The relevant Council Regulation should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union no later than 5 June 2013. \n Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community and in particular Article 13 thereof. \n Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n Indication of how the financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimised and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n Choice of instruments \n Proposed instruments: Regulation. \n Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The above-mentioned basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the\nUnion budget.\n2013/0135 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nextending the definitive anti-dumping duty\nimposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 990/2011 on imports of\nbicycles originating in the People's Republic of China by imports of bicycles\nconsigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, whether declared as\noriginating in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia or not \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[1]\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Article 13 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\nthe European Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) after having consulted the Advisory\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing measures\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\nRegulation (EEC) no 2474/93[2] the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 30.6% on\nimports of bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China ('the PRC'). Following an anti-circumvention investigation in accordance with Article 13 of\nthe basic Regulation, this duty was extended by Council Regulation (EC) No\n71/97[3] to imports of certain bicycles parts originating in the People's\nRepublic of China. In addition, it was decided to create an 'exemption scheme'\non the basis of Article 13(2) of the anti-dumping basic Regulation. The details\nof the scheme were provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 88/97[4]. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following an expiry review\npursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the Council, by Regulation\n(EC) No 1524/2000[5],\ndecided that the above mentioned measures should be maintained.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nan interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, the\nCouncil, by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2005[6],\nincreased the anti-dumping duty in force to 48,5%. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In October 2011 following\nan expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the\nCouncil, by Regulation (EU) No 990/2011[7],\ndecided that the above mentioned measures should be maintained ('the existing\nmeasures').\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In March 2012 the\nCommission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union[8]\nthe initiation of an interim review of the anti-dumping measures concerning\nimports into the Union of bicycles originating in the PRC pursuant to Article\n11(3) and 13(4) of the anti-dumping basic Regulation. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In May 2013 the Council,\nby Regulation (EU) No XXX/2013[9][to be filled in during\nwritten procedure by the Council Secretariat], amended Council\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 990/2011 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty\non imports of bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China following\nan interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nApril 2012 the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official\nJournal of the European Union[10] the\ninitiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding with regard to imports into the Union\nof bicycles originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China pursuant to Article\n10 of the Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009[11].\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In November 2012 the\nCommission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union[12]\nthat the findings in the present investigation may be used in the anti-subsidy\ninvestigation mentioned in recital (7) above.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In May 2013 the Commission\nby Regulation (EU) No xxx/2013[13][to be filled in during written procedure by the Council Secretariat],\nterminated the anti-subsidy proceeding mentioned in recital (7) above without\nimposing measures.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Request\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 14 August 2012 the\nCommission received a request pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic\nRegulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the anti-dumping\nmeasures imposed on imports of bicycles originating in the PRC and to make\nimports of bicycles consigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia,\nwhether declared as originating in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia\nor not, subject to registration. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request was lodged by\nthe European Bicycle Manufacturers Association (EBMA) on behalf of In Cycles \u2013\nMontagem e Comercio de Bicicletas, Ldo, SC. EUROSPORT DHS S.A. and MAXCOM Ltd, three Union producers of bicycles.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined, after\nconsulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient prima facie evidence\nexisted for the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Articles 13(3) and\n14(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission decided to investigate the\npossible circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of\nbicycles originating in the PRC and to make imports of bicycles consigned from\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, whether declared as originating in\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia or not, subject to registration.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation was initiated on 25 September 2012 by Commission Regulation (EU)\nNo 875/2012[14] (\u2018the initiating Regulation\u2019).\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The prima facie\nevidence at the Commission's disposal showed a significant change in the\npattern of trade involving exports from the PRC, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka\nand Tunisia to the Union following the increase of the anti-dumping duty on\nimports of the product concerned by Council Regulation (EC) 1095/2005 mentioned\nin recital (3) above. The change in the pattern of trade appeared to have\noccurred without sufficient due cause or justification other than the increase\nof the duty.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This change appeared to\nstem from the transhipment of bicycles originating in the PRC via Indonesia, Malaysia,  Sri Lanka and Tunisia to the Union and from assembly operations in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the evidence\npointed to the fact that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping\nmeasures on the product concerned are being undermined both in terms of\nquantity and price. Significant volumes of imports of the product under investigation\nappeared to have replaced imports of the product concerned originating in the\nPRC. In addition, there was sufficient evidence that imports of the product\nunder investigation were made at prices below the non-injurious price\nestablished in the investigation that led to the existing measures.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, there was evidence\nthat the prices of the product under investigation were dumped in relation to\nthe normal value previously established for the product concerned.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the authorities of the PRC, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, the producers/exporters in those countries, the importers in the Union known to be concerned and the Union industry of the initiation of the investigation.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exemption\nforms were sent to the producers/exporters in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia known to the Commission or through the Missions of Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia to the European Union. Questionnaires were sent to the producers/exporters\nin the PRC known to the Commission or through the Mission of the PRC to the\nEuropean Union. Questionnaires were also sent to the known unrelated importers\nin the Union.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties were\ngiven the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a\nhearing within the time limit set in the initiating Regulation. All parties were informed that non-cooperation\nmight lead to the application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation and to\nfindings being based on the facts available.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Four producers/exporters in Indonesia, one in Malaysia, six in Sri Lanka and two in Tunisia submitted replies to the exemption forms. There was no cooperation from the Chinese producers/exporters.\nThree unrelated importers in the Union submitted a questionnaire reply.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission carried out the verification visits at the premises of the following\ncompanies:\n\u2013              \nP.T.

Data were\ncollected for the IP to investigate, inter alia, the alleged change in\nthe pattern of trade following the increase of the anti-dumping duty in 2005.\nMore detailed data were collected for the reporting period from 1 September\n2011 to 31 August 2012 (\u2018the RP\u2019) in order to examine the possible undermining\nof the remedial effect of the measures in force and existence of dumping. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF THE\nINVESTIGATION\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General considerations\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n13(1) of the basic Regulation, the assessment of the existence of circumvention\nwas made by analysing successively whether there was a change in the pattern of\ntrade between the PRC, the four countries concerned and the Union; if this\nchange stemmed from a practice, process or work for which there was\ninsufficient due cause or economic justification other than the imposition of\nthe duty; if there was evidence of injury or that the remedial effects of the\nduty were being undermined in terms of the prices and/or quantities of the\nproduct under investigation; and whether there was evidence of dumping in relation\nto the normal values previously established, if necessary in accordance with\nthe provisions of Article 2 of the basic Regulation.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product concerned and\nproduct under investigation\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned is\nbicycles and other cycles (including delivery tricycles, but excluding\nunicycles), not motorised, originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China,\ncurrently falling within CN codes 8712 00 30 and ex 8712 00 70 (\u2018the product\nconcerned\u2019).\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product under\ninvestigation is the same as that defined above but consigned from Indonesia,\nMalaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, whether declared as originating in Indonesia,\nMalaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia or not, currently falling within the same CN\ncodes as the product concerned ('the product under investigation\u2019).\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat bicycles, as defined above, exported from the PRC to the Union and those\nconsigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia to the Union have the\nsame basic physical and technical characteristics and have the same uses, and\nare therefore to be considered as like products within the meaning of Article\n1(4) of the basic Regulation.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Degree of cooperation and\ndetermination of the trade volumes\n2.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indonesia\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The four Indonesian\ncompanies that submitted a request for exemption in accordance with Article\n13(4) of the basic Regulation represented 91% of the total imports from Indonesia to the Union during the RP. The overall import volumes from Indonesia were established on\nthe basis of the data from Comext[15].\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ndata submitted by one company was unverifiable as the company claimed that it\nkept no working sheets used to fill in the exemption form. Therefore, the\ncompany was unable to explain and demonstrate how the reported figures were\nobtained. Moreover, the data submitted by the company proved to be unreliable\nas the reported figures that were tested and recalculated on the basis of the\nbookkeeping available at the company's premises were found inaccurate (e.g.\npurchases, production volume). The investigation revealed furthermore that the\nsales manager of the company was in fact in the same time employed by a Chinese\nproducer of bicycles which was the main supplier of the raw material (bicycle\nparts) of the Indonesian company. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, in accordance\nwith Article 18(4) of the basic Regulation, the company was informed of the\nintention to disregard the information submitted by it and was granted a time\nlimit to provide its comments.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ncompany stated that it was very cooperative by providing all the documents\nrequested apart from the working sheets which allegedly were not requested\nbefore. However, the working sheets were requested in the pre-verification\nletter sent to the company prior to the on-spot verification. Moreover, the company\nclaimed that the calculation of the production and purchases values was\naffected by wrong explanations from a worker and that the checking of the\nexport transactions was accurate. In this regards, it should be pointed out\nthat in spite of several explanations from the workers, in the end it was not\npossible to reconcile the numbers provided on-spot with the numbers submitted\nin the exemption form. As concerns the value of the export sales, the\nreconciliation was indeed accurate. Furthermore, during the verification visit\nthe workers that participated at the verification were not able to explain the\nsource of the numbers stated in the exemption form neither how the numbers have\nbeen compiled. Moreover, the company confirmed that the sales manager was in parallel\nworking for a Chinese producer of bicycles. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the information\nprovided by the company in question had to be disregarded. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Findings\nwith regard to this company were therefore based on facts available in\ncompliance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation.\nThe other three companies were considered cooperating.\n2.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Malaysia\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sole Malaysian company that submitted a request for\nexemption in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation represented\nbetween 20% and 30% of the total imports from Malaysia to the Union during the RP. Total\nimports of bicycles from Malaysia into the Union were established on the basis\nof the data from Comext. The company was considered\ncooperating.\n2.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sri Lanka\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsix Sri Lankan companies that submitted a request for exemption in accordance\nwith Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation represented 69% of the total imports from Sri Lanka to the Union during the RP. The\noverall import volumes from Sri Lanka were established on the basis of the data\nfrom Comext. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\nof the companies withdrew its request for exemption during the investigation on\nthe grounds that it had stopped the production of bicycles in Sri Lanka. Therefore, data with regard to this\ncompany were disregarded. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ncooperation of the second company was found to be insufficient. The data\nsubmitted was unverifiable as the value and volume of parts of Chinese origin\npurchased by the company could not be reliably determined. Moreover, the value\nand volume of the parts used in the manufacturing process could not be verified\nas they were purchased by a third party and only consigned to the company for\nassembly.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, in accordance\nwith Article 18(4) of the basic Regulation, the company was informed of the intention\nto disregard the information submitted by it and was granted a time limit to\nprovide its comments. The company did not provide any comments.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ncooperation of another company was also considered insufficient. The\ninformation provided could not be verified on-spot as the company withheld\nessential information. More specifically, it failed to prepare information\nexplicitly requested prior to the on-spot verification, such as the working\nsheets or the list of its related companies, thus impeding the verification\nprocess. On the other hand, the purchase value of parts of local origin as\nreported by the company was found unreliable, notably as the investigation\nrevealed at least some links between the company and its local supplier of\nbicycle parts that were going beyond a normal buyers and sellers relationship\nand which could not be clarified by the company. \n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naccordance with Article 18(4) of the basic Regulation, the company was informed\nof the intention to disregard the information submitted by it and was granted a\ntime limit to provide its comments. In response, the company contested the\nfindings and submitted further evidence and explanations. None of the newly\nsubmitted evidence could have been accepted. Firstly, because it could not have\nbeen verified anymore since provided after the on-spot visit, In most cases the\nnewly submitted evidence was found to be inconsistent with the explanations and\nevidence gathered on spot. As regards the newly submitted explanations, these were\nfound to be insufficient as they did not address the main outstanding issues,\nin particular, the missing clarifications regarding related companies. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore the information\nprovided by the company in question had to be disregarded. \n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Findings\nwith regard to this company were therefore based on facts available in\ncompliance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation.\n2.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tunisia\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two Tunisian companies\nthat submitted a request for exemption in accordance with Article 13(4) of the\nbasic Regulation represented all imports from Tunisia to the Union during the\nRP as reported in Comext. They were considered cooperating. \n2.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The People\u2019s Republic of China\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital\n(21) above, there was no cooperation from any of the Chinese producers/exporters.\nTherefore, findings in respect of imports of the product concerned into the\nUnion, on the one hand, and exports of bicycles from the PRC to Indonesia, Malaysia,  Sri Lanka and Tunisia, on the other hand, were based on facts available in\naccordance with Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation. With regards to imports\nto the Union import data recorded in Comext were used. Chinese national\nstatistics were used as regards the determination of export volumes from the\nPRC to Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change in the pattern of\ntrade\n2.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports into the Union from the PRC, Indonesia, Malaysia,  Sri Lanka and Tunisia\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports of the product\nconcerned from the PRC into the Union decreased by 38.2% since 2005, i.e. after\nthe increase of the anti-dumping measures in July 2005, and continued\ndecreasing in the following years. In total, imports from the PRC decreased by\nover 80% in the IP.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time, imports\nof the product under investigation from Indonesia into the Union increased from\n2005 onwards and more than doubled in 2006 as compared to 2004. Imports\ncontinued increasing, with the exception of 2009, albeit remaining at levels\nwell above those of 2004. Since 2009, imports increased again continuously up\nto the RP. In the RP imports from Indonesia increased by 157% as compared to\n2004.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As concerns the imports of\nthe product under investigation from Malaysia into the Union, they were\nnegligible before the increase of the anti-dumping duty in July 2005. In 2005,\nthey increased significantly (more than two hundred fold) but decreased in 2009\nby 46%, followed by another increase of 38% in 2010. Although imports from\nMalaysia decreased again in 2011 and during the RP, the import level from\nMalaysia during the RP still exceeded by far the import level from 2004 before\nthe increase of the anti-dumping measures, i.e. 185 158 bicycles as compared to\n10 749 pieces in 2004 or by 1 623%. \n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The imports of the product\nunder investigation from Sri Lanka into the Union increased significantly after\nthe increase of the anti-dumping duties in 2005 and continued increasing in the\nfollowing years by almost 500% reaching a peak in 2010. In 2011 and during the\nRP the imports from Sri Lanka of the product under investigation decreased, albeit\nstill exceeding by far the import levels from 2004 before the increase of the\nanti-dumping measures, i.e. overall imports from Sri Lanka increased by 282%\nbetween 2004 and the RP.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, imports of the\nproduct concerned from Tunisia into the Union increased by almost 30% in 2005,\ni.e. after the increase of the anti-dumping duties, and by more than 20% in\n2006. They more than doubled between 2006 and 2007 reaching a peak in 2007.\nImports during 2008 and 2010 were decreasing, increasing again in 2011 and\nfinally decreasing slightly during the RP.

The practice, process or\nwork includes, inter alia, the consignment of the product subject to the\nexisting measures via third countries and the assembly of parts by an assembly\noperation in the Union or a third country. The existence of assembly operations\nis determined in accordance with Article 13(2) of the basic Regulation.\n2.6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indonesia\nTranshipment\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exports of the four\ninitially cooperating Indonesian companies amounted to 91% of the total\nIndonesian exports to the Union in the RP. \n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthree out of the four initially cooperating companies, the investigation did\nnot reveal any transhipment practices.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nconcerns the fourth company, as stated in recitals (29) to (33) above, application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation was\nwarranted. The investigation revealed that the company did not own sufficient\nequipment to justify the volumes of exports into the Union in the RP and, in\nthe absence of any other justification, it can be concluded that the company\nwas involved in circumvention practices via transhipment.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the remaining exports\nto the Union there was no cooperation as described in recitals (29) to (33) above.\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, in light of the\nchange of the pattern of trade concluded in recital (58)above between Indonesia\nand the Union within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, the\nfindings of one Indonesian company as stated in recital (61) above, and the\nfact that not all Indonesian producers/exporters came forward and cooperated\nthe existence of transhipment of Chinese-origin products via Indonesia is\nconfirmed.\nAssembly operation\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsources of raw materials (bicycle parts) and the cost of production were\nanalysed for each cooperating company to establish whether any assembly\noperation in Indonesia is\ncircumventing the existing measures according to the criteria of Article 13(2)\nof the basic Regulation. For three out of the four companies that initially\ncooperated the Chinese-origin raw materials (bicycle parts) did not constitute\n60% or more of the total value of the parts of the assembled product. It was\nnot necessary, therefore, to examine whether or not the value added to the\nparts brought in, during the assembly operation, was greater than 25% of the\nmanufacturing cost. Consequently, assembly operations were not established with\nregard to these three companies. \n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the fourth company,\nArticle 18(1) of the basic Regulation was applied as mentioned in recitals (29) to (33) above. Since the company could not provide reliable data, it\ncould not be established whether it was involved in assembly operations.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the existence of\nassembly operations within the meaning of Article 13(2) of the basic Regulation\nwas not established.\n2.6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Malaysia\nTranshipment\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exports of the sole\ncooperating Malaysian company amounted to between 20% and 30% of the total\nMalaysian exports to the Union in the RP. This company started to produce and\nexport to the Union the product concerned only at the end of 2011. No\ntranshipment practices were found with regard to this company. For the\nremaining exports to the Union there was no cooperation as made clear in\nrecital (34) above. \n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, in light of the\nchange of the pattern of trade concluded in recital (58)between Malaysia and\nthe Union within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation and the\nfact that not all Malaysian producers/exporters came forward and cooperated it\ncan be concluded that the remaining volumes of exports which are not coming\nfrom this company can be attributed to transhipment practices.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The existence of\ntranshipment of Chinese-origin products via Malaysia is therefore confirmed.\nAssembly operation\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In case of Malaysia the scope of the investigation was extended to cover other circumvention practices\nthat were identified in the course of the investigation, i.e. assembly\noperations, as provided for in recital (12) to the initiating Regulation.\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The criteria of Article 13(2) of the basic Regulation were\nanalysed for the sole cooperating company to establish whether any assembly\noperation in Malaysia is\ncircumventing the existing measures. The investigation led to the following\nfindings.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ncompany started operating in 2010 and therefore after the anti-dumping measures\nagainst the PRC were increased. The company was found to be export oriented\ntargeting the Union market, as only negligible sales were made on the domestic\nmarket or other third countries. Also, the parts used in production were found\nto be sourced primarily from the PRC. The criteria of Article 13(2)(a) of the\nbasic Regulation were therefore considered to be met.\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, this company\npurchased completely knocked down bicycle kits from the PRC, except for three\ntypes of parts. In this case, the Chinese-origin raw material (bicycle parts)\nconstituted more than 60% of the total value of the parts of the final product.\nFurthermore, the value added to the parts brought in during the assembly operation\nwas not found to be greater than 25% of the manufacturing cost of this company. The criteria of Article 13(2)(b) were therefore met.\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also,\nin accordance with Articles 2(11) and (12) of the basic Regulation, a\ncomparison of the normal value, as previously established (see recital (98) below),\nand the export prices of the company to the Union during the RP, expressed as a\npercentage of the CIF price at the Union frontier duty unpaid, showed significant\ndumping by the company in question with regard to the imports of the product under\ninvestigation. The comparison was carried out per each type of the product under\ninvestigation exported to the Union in the RP. In addition, it was found that the export prices of this\ncompany were well below the injury elimination level established for the Union\nindustry in the original investigation. The calculation was done by main\nproduct categories, based on the information available. Thus, the remedial\neffects of the duty in force are found undermined in terms of prices. On these\ngrounds, it was concluded that the criteria of Article 13(2)(c) of the basic\nRegulation were met.\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthis basis the company was found involved in an assembly operation. Therefore,\nthe existence of assembly operations within the meaning of Article 13(2) of the\nbasic Regulation in Malaysia is confirmed. \n2.6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sri Lanka\nTranshipment\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exports of the\ninitially cooperating Sri Lankan companies amounted to 69% of the total Sri\nLankan exports to the Union in the RP. For three out of the six initially\ncooperating companies, the investigation did not reveal any transhipment\npractices. For the remaining exports there was no cooperation as explained in\nrecitals (35) to (42) above.\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, in light of the\nchange of the pattern of trade concluded in recital (58) between Sri Lanka and\nthe Union within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation and the\nfact that not all Sri Lankan producers/exporters came forward and/or cooperated\nit can be concluded that the exports of those producers/exporters can be\nattributed to transhipment practices. \n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The existence of\ntranshipment of Chinese-origin products via Sri Lanka is therefore confirmed.\nAssembly operation\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsources of raw materials (bicycle parts) and the cost of production were\nanalysed for each cooperating company to establish whether any assembly\noperation in Sri Lanka is\ncircumventing the existing measures according to the criteria of Article 13(2)\nof the basic Regulation.\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthree out of the six companies that initially cooperated the Chinese-origin raw\nmaterials (bicycle parts) did not constitute 60% or more of the total value of\nthe parts of the assembled product. It was not necessary, therefore, to examine\nwhether or not the value added to the parts brought in, during the assembly\noperation, was greater than 25% of the manufacturing cost. Consequently,\nassembly operations were not established with regard to these three companies.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 18(1) of the basic\nRegulation was applied to two other companies as explained in recitals (37) to (42) above, while one other company withdrew its cooperation\nduring the on-spot verification as mentioned in recital (36) above. Therefore, the\nexistence of assembly operations within the meaning of Article 13(2) of the\nbasic Regulation was not established.\n2.6.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tunisia\nTranshipment\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nexports of the cooperating Tunisian companies covered the total imports from Tunisia to the Union in the RP. \n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The verification of the two\ncooperating companies did not reveal any transhipment of Chinese-origin\nproducts via Tunisia.\nAssembly operation\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sources of raw\nmaterials (bicycle parts) and the cost of production were analysed for each\ncooperating company to establish whether any assembly operation in Tunisia is circumventing the existing measures according to the criteria of Article 13(2)\nof the basic Regulation. For one cooperating company the Chinese-origin raw\nmaterial (bicycle parts) constituted more than 60% of the total value of the\nparts of the assembled product. However, the investigation showed that the\nvalue added to the parts brought in during the assembly operation exceeded 25%\nof the manufacturing cost of this company. On this basis the company was found\nnot to be involved in an assembly operation.\n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The criteria of Article\n13(2) of the basic Regulation were analysed for the other Tunisian company. The\ninvestigation led to the following findings.\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The company started\noperating as of 2006 and therefore after the anti-dumping measures against the\nPRC were increased. The company was found to be export oriented and targeting\nthe Union market, as only negligible sales were made on the domestic market or\nother third countries. Also, the parts used in production were found to be\nsourced primarily from the PRC. Therefore, it is considered that the criteria\nof Article 13(2)(a) of the basic Regulation were met.\n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also, the company in\nquestion was found to have a Chinese manufacturer of bicycles as its majority\nshareholder. \n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the company\npurchased all parts from the PRC and therefore the Chinese-origin raw material\n(bicycle parts) constituted more than 60% of the total value of the parts of\nthe final product. Furthermore, the investigation revealed that the sole\nsupplier of the services and of the Chinese parts was related to the Chinese\nmajority shareholder of the company in question. The added value of the parts\nbrought in during the assembly operations of the company did not exceed 25% of\nthe manufacturing cost of this company either. On this\nbasis the criteria of Article 13(2)(b) of the basic Regulation were\ntherefore considered to be met.\n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the verification\nrevealed a large number of mistakes in the list of exports to the Union in the RP and, therefore, a new file was constructed based on the sampled sales\ninvoices covering around 25% of the total exports to the Union market.\nConsequently, as provided by Article 2(11) and (12) of the basic Regulation, in\nthe absence of detailed information regarding the exports transactions of the\nrespective company to the Union, the comparison between the normal value and\nthe export price was made on the basis of the weighted average normal value previously\nestablished (see recital (98) below) to a weighted average export price of this\ncompany to the Union. The dumping margin expressed as a percentage of the CIF\nUnion frontier value was found to be significant. In addition, it was found\nthat the export prices of this company were on average well below injury\nelimination level established for the Union industry in the original\ninvestigation. The calculation was done on a weighted average basis. Thus, the\nremedial effects of the duty in force are found undermined in terms of prices. Therefore,\nit was concluded that the criteria of Article 13(2)(c) of the basic Regulation were\nmet. On this basis the company was found involved in an assembly operation.\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the existence of\nassembly operations in Tunisia within the meaning of Article 13(2) of the basic\nRegulation is confirmed.\n2.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Insufficient due cause or\neconomic justification other than the imposition of the anti-dumping duty \n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation did not\nbring to light any due cause or economic justification for the transhipment and\nassembly operations other than the avoidance of the existing measures on the\nproduct concerned. No elements were found, other than the duty, which could be\nconsidered as a compensation for the costs of transhipment and assembly\noperations in particular regarding transport and reloading of bicycles\noriginating in the PRC via Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia.\n2.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Undermining of the remedial\neffect of the anti-dumping duty\n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the assessment of\nwhether the imported products had, in terms of quantities and prices,\nundermined the remedial effects of the existing measures on imports of the\nproduct concerned from the PRC, Comext data was used as the best available data\nconcerning quantities and prices of exports by the initially cooperating producers/exporters\nwhere Article 18 of the basic Regulation was applied and by non-cooperating\ncompanies. Where applicable, for the cooperating companies found to be involved\nin circumvention practices, their reported quantities and prices of exports\nwere used. The export prices so determined were compared to the injury\nelimination level for Union producers last established, i.e. in the interim\nreview concluded in 2005, mentioned in recital (3) above.\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the\ninjury elimination level as established in the interim review in 2005 and the\nweighted average export price during the RP of the current investigation showed\nsignificant underselling for each of the four countries concerned.\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The increase of imports\nfrom Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia to the Union was considered\nsignificant in terms of quantities as discussed in section 2.4.1 above.\n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was therefore concluded\nthat the existing measures are being undermined in terms of quantities and\nprices.\n2.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evidence of dumping\n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, in accordance with\nArticle 13(1) of the basic Regulation it was examined whether there was\nevidence of dumping in relation to the normal value previously established for\nthe product concerned.\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe interim review concluded in 2005, mentioned in recital (3) above, normal\nvalue was established on the basis of prices in Mexico, which in that\ninvestigation was found to be an appropriate market economy analogue country\nfor the PRC ('normal value previously established').\n2.9.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indonesia\n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A significant part of\nIndonesian exports were found to be genuine Indonesian production exported by\nthree Indonesian companies that were found not to be involved in circumventing\npractices as stated in recitals (61) and (65)\nabove. For this reason, in order to establish the export prices from Indonesia which are affected by circumvention practices, only the exports of the\nnon-cooperating producers/exporters were considered. To this end, resort was\nmade to the best facts available and export prices were established on the\nbasis of the average export price of bicycles from Indonesia to the Union during the RP as reported in Comext. \n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of a fair\ncomparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance, in the\nform of adjustments, was made for differences which affect prices and price\ncomparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.\nAccordingly, adjustments were made for differences in transport, insurance and\npacking costs submitted by the Union industry in its request for the current\ninvestigation.\n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation, dumping was calculated by comparing\nthe weighted average normal value as previously established and the\ncorresponding weighted average export prices of Indonesia during the RP,\nexpressed as a percentage of the CIF price at the Union frontier duty unpaid.\n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the\nweighted average normal value and the weighted average export price as\nestablished showed dumping.\n2.9.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Malaysia\n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the low cooperation\nby the producers of the product under investigation in Malaysia, the export\nprice from Malaysia had to be based on facts available, i.e. on the\naverage export price of bicycles during the RP as reported in Comext.\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of a fair\ncomparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance, in the\nform of adjustments, was made for differences which affect prices and price\ncomparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.\nAccordingly, adjustments were made for differences in transport, insurance and\npacking costs. Given that the cooperation was low, the relevant adjustments\nwere based on the information submitted by the Union industry in its request\nfor the current investigation. \n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation, dumping was calculated by comparing\nthe weighted average normal value as previously established and the\ncorresponding weighted average export prices of Malaysia during the RP,\nexpressed as a percentage of the CIF price at the Union frontier duty unpaid.\n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the\nweighted average normal value and the weighted average export price as\nestablished showed dumping.\n2.9.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sri Lanka\n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 Since the cooperation from\nSri Lanka was low, the export price was established on the basis of facts\navailable, i.e. on the average export price of bicycles during the RP as\nreported in Comext which was cross checked with the available export data from\nthe companies not involved in circumvention practices.\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of a fair\ncomparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance, in the\nform of adjustments, was made for differences which affect prices and price\ncomparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.\nAccordingly, and given the absence of any other information available,\nadjustments were made for differences in transport, insurance and packing costs\nbased on the information submitted by the Union industry in its request for the\ncurrent investigation.\n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation, dumping was calculated by comparing\nthe weighted average normal value as previously established and the\ncorresponding weighted average export prices of Sri Lanka during the RP,\nexpressed as a percentage of the CIF price at the Union frontier duty unpaid.\n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the\nweighted average normal value and the weighted average export price as\nestablished showed dumping.\n2.9.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tunisia\n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 The export price was\nestablished on the basis of the average export price of bicycles during the RP\nas reported in Comext which was cross checked with the export data from the\ncompany not involved in circumvention practices. \n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of a fair\ncomparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance, in the\nform of adjustments, was made for differences which affect prices and price\ncomparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.\nAccordingly, adjustments were made for differences in transport, insurance and\npacking costs based on information submitted by the Union industry in its\nrequest for the current investigation. \n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation, dumping was calculated by comparing\nthe weighted average normal value as previously established and the\ncorresponding weighted average export prices of Tunisia during the RP,\nexpressed as a percentage of the CIF price at the Union frontier duty unpaid.\n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the\nweighted average normal value and the weighted average export price as\nestablished showed dumping.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MEASURES\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the above, it can be\nconcluded that the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of bicycles\noriginating in the PRC was circumvented by transhipment via Indonesia,\nMalaysia, Sri Lanka and assembly operations via Malaysia and Tunisia within the\nmeaning of Article 13 of the basic Regulation.\n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the first\nsentence of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, the existing measures on\nimports of the product concerned originating in the PRC, should therefore be\nextended to imports of the same product consigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri\nLanka and Tunisia whether declared as originating in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri\nLanka and Tunisia or not.\n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 The measures to be extended\nshould be the ones currently established in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No\n990/2011, which are a definitive anti-dumping duty of 48.5% applicable to the\nnet, free-at-Union-frontier price, before customs duty.\n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, which provides that any extended\nmeasure should apply to imports which entered the Union under registration\nimposed by the initiating Regulation, duties should be collected on those\nregistered imports of bicycles consigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka\nand Tunisia.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indonesia\n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 The four companies in Indonesia that requested an exemption from the possible extended measures in accordance\nwith Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation submitted a reply to the exemption\nform. \n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nstated in recitals (29) to (33)\nabove, application of Art 18 was warranted for one company. Therefore, in view\nof the findings with regard to the change in the pattern of trade and\ntranshipment as set out in recital (58) above, the exemption cannot be granted\nto this company.\n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 The other three cooperating\ncompanies in Indonesia that requested an exemption from the possible extended\nmeasures in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation were not\nfound to be engaged in the circumvention practices subject to this\ninvestigation as stated in recital (65) above. Furthermore, these producers\ncould demonstrate that they are not related to any of the producers/exporters\nengaged in circumvention practices nor to any of the Chinese\nproducers/exporters of bicycles. Therefore, an exemption from the extended\nmeasures could be granted to these three companies.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Malaysia\n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 One company in Malaysia that\nrequested an exemption from the possible extended measures in accordance with\nArticle 13(4) of the basic Regulation submitted a reply to the exemption form.\n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in recital (72) to\n(76) above, the company was found to be\ninvolved in circumvention practices. Therefore, in view of the findings with\nregard to the change in the pattern of trade and transhipment as set out in\nrecital (58) above, an exemption cannot be granted to this company.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sri Lanka\n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 The six companies in Sri Lanka\nthat requested an exemption from the possible extended measures in accordance\nwith Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation submitted replies to the exemption\nform.\n(125)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nstated in recital (36) above, one\nof the companies withdrew its request for exemption during the investigation\nand therefore, in view of the findings with regard to the change in the pattern\nof trade and transhipment as set out in recital (58) above, an exemption cannot\nbe granted to this company. \n(126)\u00a0\u00a0 For\nother two companies application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation was\nwarranted as stated in recitals (36) to (42) above and therefore, in view of\nthe findings with regard to the change in the pattern of trade and transhipment\nas set out in recital (58) above, an exemption cannot be granted to these\ncompanies.\n(127)\u00a0\u00a0 The other three cooperating companies in Sri Lanka requesting an\nexemption from the possible extended measures in accordance with Article 13(4)\nof the basic Regulation were found not to be engaged in the circumvention\npractices subject to this investigation as stated in recitals (80) and (81) above.\nFurthermore, these producers could demonstrate that they are not related to any\nof the companies found to circumvent nor to any of the Chinese\nproducers/exporters of bicycles. Therefore, an exemption from the extended\nmeasures could be granted to these companies.\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tunisia\n(128)\u00a0\u00a0 The two companies in Tunisia\nthat requested an exemption from the possible extended measures in accordance\nwith Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation submitted replies to the exemption\nform.\n(129)\u00a0\u00a0 One company was found not to\nbe engaged in the circumvention practices subject to this investigation.\nFurthermore, this producer could demonstrate that it is not related to any of\nthe companies found to circumvent nor to any of the Chinese producers/exporters\nof bicycles. Therefore, an exemption from the extended measures could be\ngranted to this company.\n(130)\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in recital (89) above,\nthe second company was found to be involved in circumvention practices. Therefore,\nin view of the findings with regard to the change in the pattern of trade and\ntranshipment as set out in recital (58) above, an exemption cannot be granted. \n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Special measures\n(131)\u00a0\u00a0 It is considered that\nspecial measures are needed in this case in order to ensure the proper\napplication of such exemptions. These special measures are the requirement of\nthe presentation to the customs authorities of the Member States of a valid\ncommercial invoice, which shall conform to the requirements set out in the\nAnnex to this Regulation. Imports not accompanied by such an invoice shall be\nmade subject to the extended anti-dumping duty.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Newcomers\n(132)\u00a0\u00a0 Without prejudice to Article\n11(3) of the basic Regulation, other producers/exporters in Indonesia,\nMalaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia which did not come forward in this proceeding\nand did not export the product under investigation to the Union in the RP and\nwhich consider lodging a request for an exemption from the extended\nanti-dumping duty pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic Regulation\nwill be required to complete a questionnaire in order to enable the Commission\nto determine whether an exemption may be warranted. Such an exemption may be\ngranted after the assessment of the market situation of the product under\ninvestigation, production capacity and capacity utilisation, procurement and\nsales and the likelihood of a continuation of practices for which there is\ninsufficient due cause or economic justification and the evidence of dumping.\nThe Commission would normally also carry out an on-spot verification visit. The\nrequest should be addressed to the Commission forthwith, with all relevant\ninformation, in particular any modification in the company\u2019s activities linked\nto the production and sales.\n(133)\u00a0\u00a0 Where an exemption is\nwarranted, the extended measures in force shall be amended accordingly.\nSubsequently, any exemption granted will be monitored to ensure compliance with\nthe conditions set therein.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DISCLOSURE\n(134)\u00a0\u00a0 All interested parties were\ninformed of the essential facts and considerations leading to the above\nconclusions and were invited to comment. \n(135)\u00a0\u00a0 One Indonesian company reiterated\nits claims mentioned in recital (31) above without bringing any new substantiated\nevidence. In this regard, as mentioned in recital (29) above, the data\nsubmitted by the company was unverifiable as no working files substantiating\nthe figures provided in the exemption form were kept by the company. Moreover,\nthe reported figures that were tested and recalculated on the basis of the\nbookkeeping available at the company's premises i.e. purchases and production\nvolume, were found inaccurate. Therefore, these claims are rejected.\n(136)\u00a0\u00a0 One Malaysian company argued\nthat the fact that the weight of the Chinese origin parts in the manufacturing\ncost of the bicycles was only slightly above the 60% threshold should not lead\nthe Commission to reject its exemption request. In addition, the company\nsubmitted certain invoices for purchasing of parts which allegedly were wrongly\nreported as originating from the PRC when in fact they were from Indonesia. \n(137)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect it should be\nnoted that the thresholds set in Article (13)(2)(b) of the basic Regulation are\nvery clear and, therefore, it is not relevant by how much the weight of the\nChinese origin parts in the manufacturing cost of the bicycles exceeds the 60%\nthreshold but that the Chinese origin parts should represent less than 60% in\nthe manufacturing cost of the bicycles. Moreover, these invoices could not be\ntraced back in the list of purchases provided by the company and, in addition,\nthe value of the invoices submitted were not material as to change the original\nassessment of the Commission. Therefore, these claims are rejected.\n(138)\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the company in\nquestion argued that there is no sufficient legal basis for the denial of the\ncompany's request for exemption as the conclusions reached are based on calculations\nwithout taking due account of the individual situation of the company in question.\nIn response to this claim the company received further explanations reflecting\nthe analysis in recitals (72) to (75) above.\n(139)\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the company\nclaimed that the increase of imports of the product under investigation by the\ncompany in question coincides with the relaxation of the Generalised System of\nPreferences for Malaysia and therefore the increase in company's exports into\nthe Union in 2010 had no economic justification in the increase of the\nanti-dumping measures imposed against the PRC. In response to this argument it\nwas considered that while the relaxation of the Generalised System of\nPreferences rules could have contributed to the company's motivation to export\nto the Union, it does not contradict the finding that the company started its\noperation after the anti-dumping duties against the PRC were increased and that\nit sourced the parts mainly from the PRC (see recital (73) above). Therefore,\nthe argument of the party was rejected.\n(140)\u00a0\u00a0 The same company also\nclaimed that the reported data concerning the values of purchased and consumed\nbicycle parts were not duly verified as no distinction between purchased and\nconsumed parts was made. In this respect it is noted that based on the figures\nreported by the company, the values of purchased and consumed parts were found\nto be identical. In addition, the reported values of purchased parts in 2011\ncorresponded to the value of consumed parts reported in the annual report of\nthe company for 2011. The figures concerning purchased and consumed parts\nreported for RP and 2010 were accepted as declared by the company. Therefore,\nthe argument was rejected. \n(141)\u00a0\u00a0 The company in question\nsubmitted further cost breakdowns per product model demonstrating its alleged\ncompliance with the requirement that the parts sourced from the PRC shall not\nexceed 60% of the total value of the parts of the assembled product. This\ninformation contradicted the cost breakdowns per model collected and verified\nfor selected models on spot for which the failure of the company to comply with\nthe 60% threshold was confirmed. The new information submitted by the company\nin this respect was not backed up by any evidence and, in essence, contradicted\nverified information. For this reason the information was disregarded. \n(142)\u00a0\u00a0 Further, the company claimed\nthat it acted in good faith as relying on its alleged compliance with\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 1063/2010[16]\nlaying down the applicable rules of origin. In this context it is noted that the\npurpose of the anti-circumvention investigation is not to verify the compliance\nwith the applicable rules of origin. Such verification was not carried out in\nthe context of the current anti-circumvention investigation and therefore the\nalleged compliance with the rules of origin cannot be in this case confirmed. For\nthis reasons, the alleged compliance with the rules of origin in this case does\nnot exclude in any way the possibility of circumvention as defined in Article\n13(2) of the basic Regulation[17].\nAgainst this background, the argument is therefore rejected. \n(143)\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, the company claimed\nthat the dumping margin calculation should have been carried out based on the\ncompany specific data. This request was accepted as reflected in recital (75)\nabove and the company was informed accordingly. \n(144)\u00a0\u00a0 A company from Sri Lanka disputed the relevance of the documents requested during the verification visit and\ntherefore argued that its exemption request should not be rejected. In this\nrespect it should be noted that the documents showing the origin of the parts\nused in the assembly of the bicycles exported to the Union have significant\nimportance for the assessment of compliance with the conditions of Article\n13(2)(b). Also, as mentioned in recital (37) above, the data submitted by the\ncompany was unverifiable. In addition, the company admitted on spot that the\nparts purchased from the PRC were actually not recorded in its accounts and\nconsequently the compliance with the criteria set out in Article 13(2) of the\nbasic Regulation could not have been determined. Therefore, the claims are\nrejected.\n(145)\u00a0\u00a0 Another company from Sri\nLanka claimed that had it known that the exports to the Union from Sri Lanka\ncould be subject to the anti-dumping duty as extended to Sri Lanka as from the\ninitiation of the investigation, it would have not withdrawn its request for\nexemption. However, it is underlined that, at the time of the withdrawal of its\nrequest for exemption, the company is considered aware of the possible\napplication of the anti-dumping duty as extended as from the date of the\nregistration of imports from Sri Lanka to the Union, i.e. the initiation of the\nanti-circumvention investigation. The company has been informed of this\nconsequence in three instances, through recital (20) of the initiating Regulation,\nduring a hearing at the beginning of the investigation and during the on-spot\nvisit. Therefore, the claim could not be accepted. \n(146)\u00a0\u00a0 Another company from Sri\nLanka submitted new information that it should have submitted before the\nverification visit and due to the advanced stage of the investigation that information\ncould not be verified anymore. Furthermore, the company argued that it had\nsubmitted all the information required.\n(147)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recitals (39)\nand (40) the company did not submit all the information requested in order to\nbe verified on-spot. In particular, the purchase value of parts of local origin\nas reported by the company was found unreliable. As a result, the compliance\nwith the criteria set out in Article 13(2) of the basic Regulation could not\nhave been determined.\n(148)\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the company\nclaimed irregularities concerning the on-spot visit in respect of its length\nand language issues. In this regard, it should be noted that the company was\nrecently set up and therefore only one day of verification was scheduled. The\nverification was carried out during a full working day. At the end of the\nverification, the company did not ask to submit any additional information that\nwas not able to provide during the verification. \n(149)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, before the on-spot\nverification the company was informed that the verification will be carried out\nin English and the party has not raised any objections. Moreover, the\nCommission was accompanied by an interpreter during the on-spot verification to\nfacilitate language communication problems, if any. In addition, it is\nhighlighted that most of the documents submitted by the company during the\nverification visit were actually in English, including the accounting related\ndocuments.\n(150)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, all the\nclaims of the company are rejected. \nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the purpose of\nthis Regulation, the definitive anti-dumping duty applicable to \u2018all other\ncompanies\u2019 imposed by Article 1(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 990/2011\non imports of bicycles and other cycles (including delivery tricycles, but\nexcluding unicycles), not motorised, originating in the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina, is hereby extended to imports of bicycles and other cycles (including\ndelivery tricycles, but excluding unicycles), not motorised, consigned from\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia whether declared as originating in\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia or not, currently falling within CN\ncodes ex 8712 00 30 and ex 8712 00 70 (TARIC code 8712 00 30 10 and 8712 00 70\n91) with the exception of those produced by the companies listed below:\n Country || Company || TARIC additional code \n Indonesia || P.T.
