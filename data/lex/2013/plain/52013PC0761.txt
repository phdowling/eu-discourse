It is estimated that in 2010 every EU\r\ncitizen used 198 plastic carrier bags, some 90% of which were estimated to be lightweight\r\nbags; these are less frequently re-used than thicker bags and more prone to\r\nlittering. In a business-as-usual scenario the consumption of plastic bags is\r\nexpected to increase further. \nEstimates also suggest that in 2010, over 8\r\nbillion plastic carrier bags were littered in the EU. They escape waste\r\nmanagement streams and accumulate in our environment, especially in the form of\r\nmarine litter, which is increasingly recognized to be a major global challenge.\r\nThere also is documented evidence indicating large debris accumulation in\r\nEuropean seas. The problem of plastic bag waste in water ecosystems does not\r\naffect only countries with a marine coastline, as a considerable amount of the\r\nwaste from land reaches the sea through rivers. Once discarded, plastic carrier\r\nbags can last for hundreds of years, mostly in fragmented form. The very high\r\nand still increasing consumption of such bags is also sub-optimal from a\r\nresource efficiency perspective. \nIn the EU, plastic carrier bags are considered\r\nas packaging under the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (Directive\r\n94/62/EC). However, there is no EU legislation or policy specifically targeting\r\nplastic carrier bags. Some Member States have already developed policies to\r\nreduce their use, for instance by means of pricing measures, agreements with\r\nthe retail sector or awareness campaigns, with variable results. Following\r\nattempts by some Member States to ban plastic carrier bags, the Environment\r\nCouncil of 14 March 2011 discussed the issue and invited the Commission to\r\nanalyse possible EU action against plastic bag consumption.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds\r\nfor and objectives of the proposal\nThe general objective of this proposal on\r\nplastic carrier bags is to limit negative impacts on the environment, in\r\nparticular in terms of littering, to encourage waste prevention and a more\r\nefficient use of resources, while limiting negative socio-economic impacts.\r\nMore specifically, the proposal aims at reducing the consumption of plastic\r\ncarrier bags with a thickness of below 50 microns (0.05 milimeters) in the\r\nEuropean Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation\r\nand expertise\n2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Studies\nA study on the production and consumption\r\npatterns of plastic carrier bags, their impacts and the impacts of different\r\npolicy options to reduce their use was performed in 2011[1]. An additional study to assess\r\nthe socio-economic impacts of different policy options in more detail was\r\ncarried out in 2012.[2]\r\n\n2.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Internal consultation\nAn Interservice Steering Group (ISG) with\r\nrepresentatives of DGs ENV, ENTR, SG, SJ and SANCO was created in June 2011.\r\nThis ISG followed the preparation of the Impact Assessment.\n2.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 External consultation\nA public consultation took place between 17 May\r\nand 9 August 2011, in line with existing minimum standards for consultation.\n15,538 responses were submitted, reflecting high\r\npublic concern about the unsustainable consumption of plastic carrier bags and\r\nhigh expectations for EU action in this area. \n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact\r\nassessment\nAn impact assessment report and an executive summary\r\nare published together with the present proposal. The impact assessment\r\nevaluates the main environmental, social and economic impacts of various policy\r\noptions to reduce the consumption of plastic carrier bags. Various levels of\r\nambition are assessed and compared to a \"baseline scenario\" in order\r\nto identify the most appropriate instruments minimizing costs while maximizing\r\nbenefits. \nThe Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment Board\r\ndelivered a positive opinion on the impact assessment on 15 March 2013, while\r\nmaking a number of recommendations to fine-tune the report. Commenting on the\r\noption to establish a common, EU-wide target to reduce the consumption of plastic\r\nbags, the Board requested to assess to what extent the plastic bags littering\r\nproblem could be addressed by action at Member State level. \nFurther consideration of the policy options\r\navailable has led to the conclusion that it would be difficult to design and\r\nimplement an EU-wide reduction target applying to all Member States. Instead of\r\nestablishing a common EU target, it is therefore preferable to introduce in\r\nDirective 94/62/EC the obligation for all Member States to reduce the consumption\r\nof lightweight plastic carrier bags, while allowing them to set their own national\r\nreduction targets and to choose the measures to reach those targets. At a later\r\nstage the establishment of an EU-wide reduction target could however be\r\nconsidered. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of the proposed action\nThe proposal amends article 4 (prevention) of\r\nDirective 94/62/EC by requiring Member States to take measures to reduce the\r\nconsumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags. It stipulates that these\r\nmeasures may include the use of economic instruments as well as marketing\r\nrestrictions in derogation of Article 18 of the Directive. The latter provision\r\nthus broadens the range of instruments available to Member States to address\r\nthe unsustainable consumption of plastic bags. \nFor the purpose of this Directive a definition of\r\n\"lightweight plastic carrier bags\" is introduced in Article 3 (definitions).\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal\r\nbasis and right to act\nThe proposal takes the same legal basis as\r\nDirective 94/62/EC (article 100a, now article 114 TFEU). \nThe EU's right to act stems from the fact that\r\nthe high consumption rates of plastic carrier bags represent both a common and\r\na trans-boundary challenge, and an EU-wide initiative is necessary to tackle\r\nthe problem in a more coherent and effective way. At present, the measures\r\ntaken by individual Member States to address the issue lack coherence with\r\nrespect to the objectives pursued. Also, unilateral measures entailing marketing\r\nrestrictions raise questions in terms of their compatibility with Directive\r\n94/62/EC in its current form. At the same time, the positive experiences made in\r\na number of Member States demonstrate that it is indeed possible to reduce\r\nplastic bag consumption considerably. \nEU action to reduce the use of plastic carrier\r\nbags is fully in line with the objectives of Directive 94/62/EC on Packaging\r\nand Packaging Waste, in particular that of preventing and reducing the\r\nenvironmental impacts of packaging and packaging waste. \nGiven its specific nature and background, the\r\npresent proposal is submitted as a self-standing initiative, ahead of the more\r\ngeneral review of EU waste policy that the Commission will present in the\r\nspring of 2014.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity\r\nand proportionality principle\nThe proposal is in conformity with the\r\nsubsidiarity and proportionality principle set out in Article 5 of the Treaty\r\non the European Union. It is limited to amending Directive 94/62/EC by\r\nproviding a framework establishing shared objectives,\r\nwhile leaving Member States free to decide about precise implementation methods.\r\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal will not have an impact on the\r\nEuropean Union budget and is therefore not accompanied by the financial\r\nstatement provided for under Article 31 of the Financial Regulation (Regulation\r\n(EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\r\nOctober 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the\r\nUnion and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002).\n2013/0371 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Directive 94/62/EC on packaging\r\nand packaging waste to reduce the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier\r\nbags\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission[3],\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],\nAfter consulting the Committee of the\r\nRegions[5],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 94/62/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[6]\r\nwas adopted in order to prevent or reduce the impact of packaging and packaging\r\nwaste on the environment. Although plastic carrier bags constitute packaging\r\nwithin the meaning of that Directive, its provisions do not contain specific\r\nmeasures relating to the consumption of such bags.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumption\r\nof plastic carrier bags results in high levels of littering and an inefficient\r\nuse of resources and is expected to increase if no\r\naction is taken. Littering of plastic carrier bags\r\ncontributes to the problem of marine litter that threatens marine eco-systems worldwide.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Plastic carrier bags with\r\na thickness below 50 microns, which represent the vast majority of the total\r\nnumber of plastic carrier bags consumed in the Union, are less frequently\r\nre-used than thicker plastic carrier bags and more prone to littering.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumption\r\nlevels of plastic carrier bags vary considerably across the Union due to\r\ndifferences in consumption habits, environmental awareness, as well as the effectiveness\r\nof policy measures taken by Member States. Some Member States have managed to\r\nreduce consumption levels of plastic carrier bags significantly, with the\r\naverage consumption level in the seven best performing Member States amounting\r\nto only 20% of the EU average consumption. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To\r\npromote similar reductions of the average consumption level of lightweight\r\nplastic carrier bags, Member States should take measures to reduce the\r\nconsumption of plastic carrier bags with a thickness below 50 microns in line with the overall\r\nobjectives of the Union\u2019s waste policy and the Union's waste hierarchy as provided for in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives[7]. Such reduction measures should\r\ntake account of current consumption levels of plastic carrier bags in\r\nindividual Member States, with higher levels requiring more ambitious efforts. To\r\nmonitor progress in reducing the use of lightweight plastic carrier bags national\r\nauthorities will provide data on their use under article 17 of Directive 94/62/EC.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures\r\nto be taken by Member States may involve the use of economic instruments such\r\nas taxes and levies, which have proved particularly effective to reduce the use\r\nof plastic carrier bags, as well as marketing restrictions such as bans in\r\nderogation of Article 18 of Directive 94/62/EC, subject to the requirements\r\nlaid down in Articles 34 to 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures\r\nto reduce the consumption of plastic carrier bags should not lead to an overall\r\nincrease in the generation of packaging.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures provided for\r\nby this Directive are consistent with the Communication from the Commission to\r\nthe European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the\r\nCommittee of the Regions on the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe[8] and should contribute to\r\nactions against littering undertaken in accordance with Directive 2008/56/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a\r\nframework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy (Marine\r\nStrategy Framework Directive[9]).\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 94/62/EC should\r\ntherefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nDirective 94/62/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n(1)                   \r\nIn Article 3, a new point 2a is inserted:\n'2a. \"lightweight plastic carrier bags\u201d shall\r\nmean bags made of plastic materials as defined in Article 3(1) of Commission\r\nRegulation (EU) No 10/2011* with a wall thickness below 50 microns and which\r\nare supplied to consumers at the point of sale of goods or products.\n_______________________\n* OJ L 12, 15.01.2011, p. 1.'\n(2)                   \r\nIn Article 4, the following paragraph 1a is inserted:\n'1a Member States shall take\r\nmeasures to achieve a reduction in the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier\r\nbags on their territory within two years of entry into force of this Directive.\r\n\nThese measures may include the use of national\r\nreduction targets, economic instruments as well as marketing restrictions in\r\nderogation from Article 18 of this Directive.\nMember States shall report on the effects of these\r\nmeasures on the overall formation of packaging waste when reporting to the\r\nCommission in accordance with Article 17 of this Directive.'\nArticle 2\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States shall bring\r\ninto force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to\r\ncomply with this Directive by twelve months after the entry into force of this\r\nDirective.
