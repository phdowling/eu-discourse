The Council is hereby requested to grant authorisation to\r\nthe Commission to request an extension of the WTO waiver on autonomous trade\r\npreferences granted by the European Union to Moldova and thus allow the\r\nEuropean Union to join a consensus on this waiver request in accordance with Article\r\nIX of the WTO Agreement.\nOn 21 January 2008, the Council adopted the\r\nRegulation (EC) No 55/2008 introducing Autonomous Trade Preferences for the Republic of   Moldova. With this Regulation, the EU fulfilled its commitment in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy\r\nAction Plan (ENP Action Plan) for Moldova. The Plan, agreed in 2005, called on\r\nthe EU to consider granting Moldova improved access to the EU market which\r\nwould support the development of Moldovan economy through increased export\r\nperformance, provided that Moldova substantially improves its system of\r\ncontrols and certification of origin of goods.\nTo permit the EU to provide preferential\r\ntreatment for imports originating in the Republic of Moldova without being\r\nrequired to extend the same preferential treatment to the like products of any\r\nother WTO Member, a waiver was granted by the WTO General Council to the\r\nEuropean Union, temporarily suspending certain WTO commitments to the extent\r\nnecessary to fulfil the above objective. \nOn 15 May\r\n2008, in accordance with the Decision-Making Procedures under Articles IX and\r\nXII of the WTO Agreement, the WTO General Council decided, in document\r\nWT/L/722 to waive the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article I and the provisions\r\nof Article XIII of the GATT 1994 from 1 March 2008 until\r\n31 December 2013 to the extent necessary to permit the European Union\r\nto accord duty-free or preferential treatment to products originating in\r\nMoldova, including certain agricultural products for which limited concessions\r\nare given as defined in the Annex to this Decision, without being required to\r\nextend the same duty-free or preferential treatment to like products of any\r\nother WTO Member.\nThe Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 was amended by the Regulation (EU) No 581/2011\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council extending the application of the\r\nautonomous trade preferences granted to the Republic of Moldova until 31\r\nDecember 2015. Such an extension proved necessary as an advanced preferential\r\ntrade relationship between the EU and Moldova in the context of the European\r\nPartnership has not yet been effectively established. Considering the above,\r\nthe Commission requests the Council\u2019s authorisation to submit to the WTO, on\r\nbehalf of the European Union, a request to extend the current waiver until 31\r\nDecember 2015.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 218(9) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European\r\nUnion (TFEU) provides that, when a decision having legal effect needs to be\r\ntaken in a body set up by an international agreement, the Council, on a\r\nproposal from the Commission, should adopt a Decision establishing the position\r\nto be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf. The granting of a waiver on additional\r\nautonomous trade preferences granted by the European Union to the Republic of\r\nMoldova falls under this provision as the decision is taken in a body set up by\r\nan international agreement (the WTO General Council or Ministerial Conference)\r\naffecting the rights and obligations of the EU.\n2013/0276 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be taken by\r\nthe European Union within the General Council of the World Trade Organization\r\non the request for extending the WTO waiver on additional autonomous trade\r\npreferences granted by the European Union to the Republic of Moldova\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(4), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article IX of the\r\nMarrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation (the \u201cWTO\u201d\r\nAgreement\u201d) sets out the procedures for the granting of waivers concerning the\r\nMultilateral Trade Agreements in WTO Agreement Annexes 1A or 1B or 1C and their\r\nannexes.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 55/2008 of 21 January 2008 introducing autonomous trade\r\npreferences for the Republic of Moldova[1]\r\nwas amended by the Regulation (EU) 581/2011 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council inter alia to extend the autonomous trade preferences\r\ngranted to the Republic of Moldova until 31 December 2015[2]. The Regulation provides free\r\naccess to the Union market of all products originating in the Republic of Moldova, except certain agricultural products listed in Annex I of the Regulation.\r\nThe products listed in Annex I of the Regulation benefit from limited\r\nconcessions in the form of exemption from customs duties within the limit of\r\ntariff quotas or reduction of customs duties. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe absence of a waiver from the European Union's\r\nobligations under paragraph 1 of Article I of the General Agreement on Tariffs\r\nand Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) and Article XIII GATT 1994, to the extent necessary,\r\nthe treatment provided by the autonomous trade preferences would need to be\r\nextended to all other Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is in the interest of\r\nthe European Union to request an extension of the WTO waiver on autonomous\r\ntrade preferences granted by the European Union to the Republic of Moldova pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article IX of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World\r\nTrade Organization.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union will submit\r\nsuch a request to the WTO.
