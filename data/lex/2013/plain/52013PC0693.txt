The objective of this draft regulation is to establish a set of\r\nrequirements for the approval of those devices, which ensures an acceptable\r\nlevel of environmental performance and correct operation during its lifetime.\nThe present proposal aims at defining the\r\nUnion position with regard to the draft UNECE regulation concerning the\r\napproval of REC and consequently to provide for the Union, represented by the\r\nCommission, to vote in favour of this draft.\n\u00b7                        \r\nGeneral context\nTechnical requirements on type-approval of\r\nretrofit equipment intended for the reduction of emissions are currently\r\naddressed at national level. With the adoption of the draft UNECE Regulation on\r\napproval of REC, an important step forward will be taken in terms of market\r\nharmonisation and removal of eventual trade barriers regarding REC equipment,\r\nsince MS within the EU may take the text over as reference when setting up\r\ntheir national legislations.\nHence it is now envisaged for the Union to\r\nvote in favour of the related draft UNECE Regulation on approval of REC in\r\norder to have common harmonised requirements at international level which will\r\nfacilitate international trade. This will enable European companies to follow\r\none set of requirements recognised worldwide, i.e. in the countries Contracting\r\nParties to the Revised 1958 UNECE Agreement.\n\u00b7                        \r\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nThe technical requirements in the area of\r\nthe proposal are currently addressed at national level, and thus so far there\r\nis neither EU legislation nor UNECE legislation.\n\u00b7                        \r\nConsistency with the other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThe proposal is in line with the objectives\r\nof Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 on type-approval of motor vehicles and engines\r\nwith respect to emissions from heavy duty vehicles (Euro VI), and Directive 97/68/EC\r\non the approximation of the laws of Member States relating to measures against\r\nthe emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion\r\nengines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery, being therefore consistent\r\nwith the EU objective of providing for a high level of environmental protection\r\nthroughout the territory of the Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n \u00b7                         Consultation of interested parties \n In developing the proposal, the European Commission has participated in the UNECE Informal Group on REC, where representatives of stakeholders as well as MS have met. In addition, in the course of the drafting of the document, key aspects of the text were discussed in the meeting of the Technical Committee- Motor Vehicles of 10 July 2012. \u00b7                         Impact assessment The provisions on retrofit emission control devices can be considered as complementary to UNECE and EU emissions legislation on type-approval of heavy-duty engines and vehicles (Euro VI) and non-road mobile machinery. In the case of the former, an impact assessment has been carried out where several policy options have been assessed. Regarding non-road mobile machinery, an impact assessment is currently being elaborated, and therefore no separate impact assessment is considered to be needed for the purposes of adopting the draft UNECE Regulation. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \r\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal will enable the Union,\r\nrepresented by the Commission, to vote in favour of the draft UNECE Regulation on\r\nuniform provisions concerning the approval of Retrofit Emission Control Devices\r\n(REC) for heavy duty vehicles, agricultural and forestry tractors and non-road\r\nmobile machinery equipped with compression ignition engines.\n\u00b7                        \r\nLegal basis\nTaking into consideration the object and\r\ncontent of the Council Decision, the legal bases are Articles 114 and 218(9)\r\nTFEU. The procedure to be followed for the adoption of the Council Decision is\r\nthe one laid down in Article 4(2) of Council Decision 97/836/EC.\n\u00b7                        \r\nSubsidiarity principle\nDirective 2008/50/EC sets out air quality\r\nobjectives with respect to the different pollutants, and leaves to the\r\njudgement of MS the decision on the precise measures to be undertaken in order\r\nto comply with the abovementioned objectives. In this respect, retrofit\r\nemission control devices may play a fundamental role, since its fitting into\r\nvehicles already placed in the market is an element often addressed at national\r\nlevel as part of the necessary actions to improve the air quality.\nGiven the background above, and according\r\nto the subsidiarity principle, it is appropriate for the EU to acceed to the\r\nUNECE Regulation on approval of REC, while respecting the capacity of MS to\r\ndecide whether the Regulation should be applied, at their respective national\r\nlevels, for the purposes of mandatory type-approval of REC equipment, or other\r\ndifferent purposes. However, and without prejudice of the faculty of MS to\r\ndecide within the scope of their competences, the basic rules of the 1958\r\nAgreement shall apply to the whole of the EU and in the same manner to all MS. \nThe proposal therefore complies with the\r\nsubsidiarity principle.\n\u00b7                        \r\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle as it does not go beyond what is necessary in order\r\nto achieve the objectives of ensuring the proper functioning of the Internal\r\nMarket while at the same time providing for a high level of environmental protection.\n\u00b7                        \r\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: Council Decision.\nThe use of a Council Decision is considered\r\nto be appropriate as in line with the requirements of Article 218(9) TFEU.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nUnion budget.\n2013/0333 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be taken by the Union\r\nwithin the Administrative Committee of the United Nations Economic Commission\r\nfor Europe regarding the draft Regulation on uniform provisions concerning the\r\napproval of Retrofit Emission Control Devices (REC) for heavy duty vehicles,\r\nagricultural and forestry tractors and non-road mobile machinery equipped with\r\ncompression ignition engines\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114, in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision\r\n97/836/EC[1],\r\nthe Union acceded to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission\r\nfor Europe (UNECE) concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions\r\nfor wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used\r\non wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals\r\ngranted on the basis of these prescriptions (\u2018Revised 1958 Agreement\u2019).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The standardised\r\nrequirements of the draft UNECE Regulation on uniform provisions concerning the\r\napproval of Retrofit Emission Control Devices (REC) for heavy duty vehicles,\r\nagricultural and forestry tractors and non-road mobile machinery equipped with\r\ncompression ignition engines[2]\r\nare intended to remove technical barriers to the trade of REC devices between\r\nthe Contracting Parties to the Revised 1958 Agreement and to ensure that such\r\nsystems offer a high level of performance and environmental protection.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to establish\r\nthe position to be taken on the Union's behalf in the Administrative Committee\r\nof the Revised 1958 Agreement concerning the adoption of that draft UNECE Regulation,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION : \nSole Article \nThe position to be taken by the Union,\r\nrepresented by the Commission, within the Administrative Committee of the\r\nRevised 1958 Agreement shall be to vote in favour of the draft UNECE Regulation\r\non uniform provisions concerning the approval of Retrofit Emission Control\r\nDevices (REC) for heavy duty vehicles, agricultural and forestry tractors and\r\nnon-road mobile machinery equipped with compression ignition engines, as\r\ncontained in document ECE TRANS/ WP.29/ /2013/119.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 346, 17.12.1997, p. 78.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UNECE\r\nDocument ECE TRANS/WP.29/GRPE/2013/6.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
