The aim of these measures\nis to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through a privileged access to\nthe EU market. In turn, economic development is to foster political stability\nin the entire region.\nThese trade preferences are granted for a\nperiod ending on 31 December 2015, and currently apply to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Albania, the Republic of Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of\n Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo*.\nStabilisation and Association Agreements\nand Interim Agreements grant in some instances a tariff quota for wine, sugar and\nbaby beef. An additional global tariff quota for wine, of 50.000 hl, is\nprovided in Council Regulation (EC) N\u00b0 1215/2009, open to all the beneficiaries\nsubject to exhaustion of their specific quota available under the respective Stabilisation\nand Association Agreements or the Interim Agreements.\nKosovo has no Stabilisation and Association\nAgreement, and can only benefit of the general tariff quota. When this tariff\nquota is exhausted by other countries, Kosovan exporters have no preferential\naccess to the EU market.\nKosovo has demonstrated the potential to\nexport wine to the EU, and exporters need a stable and reliable framework.\nTherefore, it is proposed to allocate a\nspecific tariff quota of 20.000 hl to Kosovo, which is deducted from the global\nquota of 50.000 hl provided for in Council Regulation (EC) N\u00b0 1215/2009, hence reduced\nto 30.000 hl. This is achieved by closing the current tariff quota and\nestablishing two new ones for the said amounts.\nA mechanism is foreseen which eliminates\nthe legal uncertainties deriving from the fact that the quotas are allocated on\na first come \u2013 first served basis, and that the date of entry into force of\nthis regulation can't be anticipated. In order to avoid expanding the overall\nvolume of concessions, the quota reserved for Kosovo is applied on a pro-rata\nbasis.\nThis reallocation does not affect the global\nvolume of concession to the countries in the Western Balkans, and maintains\nstable wine market conditions in the EU. Specific tariff quotas established in Stabilisation\nand Association Agreements or Interim Agreements are not affected.\nThe proposed amendment does not incur costs\ncharged to the EU budget. Its application would also not entail any losses of\ncustoms revenue compared to the current situation.\nIn the view of the above the present\nproposal aims to amending Annex 1 of Council Regulation (EC) N\u00b0 1215/2009, by\nestablishing a specific quota of 20.000 hl for wine originating in Kosovo and\nreducing proportionately the global quota.\nIn order not to disrupt trade, this\nRegulation has to be adopted and published in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union before 31 December 2013.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNA\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nHaving regards to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Art 207 (2) thereof, and Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1215/2009 of 30 November 2009.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nNA\n2013/0099 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non amending Council Regulation (EC) No\n1215/2009 in relation to tariff quotas for wine\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since 2000 the Union grants unlimited duty free access to the Union market for almost all products\noriginating in the Western Balkans. Currently, this system is provided for in\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 of 30 November 2009 introducing\nexceptional trade measures for countries participating in or linked to the\nEuropean Union\u2019s Stabilisation and Association process[1].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All the Western Balkans\ncountries benefit from preferential trade arrangements, including individual\ntariff quotas, under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements or Interim\nAgreements on trade and trade-related matters concluded with these countries,\nwith the exception of Kosovo*.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n1215/2009, made available a general quota of 50.000 hl for wine, on a\nfirst-come first-served basis to all the beneficiaries, subject to the\nexhaustion of their specific quotas available under the Stabilisation and\nAssociation Agreements or Interim Agreements.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A stable access to the\nmarket of the Union is necessary for the socio-economic development of Kosovo,\nwhich has demonstrated the capacity to export wine. In the absence of an individual\ntariff quota, Kosovan producers lack the necessary predictability for their\nexports.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\nallocate a specific annual tariff quota of 20 000 hl for wine exports from\nKosovo to the EU, and to reduce proportionately the general annual tariff quota\nfor wine available to all the beneficiaries from 50 000 hl to 30 000 hl.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The allocation of a\nspecific tariff quota is achieved by closing the existing global tariff quota\nand opening two new ones, whose total volume is equivalent to the volume of the\ntariff quota closed.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also appropriate to\nintroduce a mechanism which avoids legal uncertainties as regards the tariff\nquotas available on the day of entry into force of this regulation, and to\nprevent that the overall volume of the concession exceeds 50 000 hl.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the total volume of the\nconcessions is not modified, this regulation does not affect the wine sector of\nthe Union. The specific concessions provided for in the Stabilisation and Association Agreements or the Interim Agreements\nare also not affected by this Regulation.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This regulation does not\naffect obligations of the Union in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and does\nnot need to receive a WTO waiver.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) N\u00b0\n1215/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 is\nreplaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\nArticle 2\nThe following transitional measures shall apply\non the year of entry into force of this Regulation:\n(1)                   \nThe new tariff quotas under the order numbers 09.1530\nand 09.1560 shall inherit proportionally the balance of the tariff quota\n09.1515 at the date of the entry into force of this regulation, with the\nfollowing modalities:\n(a)         \nThe initial amount of the tariff quota 09.1530 shall\nbe calculated using the following formula:\n0.6 x balance of the tariff quota 09.1515[2] on the day of entry into force\nof this Regulation.\n(b)         \nThe initial amount of the tariff quota 09.1560\nshall be calculated using the following formula:\n0.4 x balance of the tariff quota 09.1515 on\nthe day of entry into force of this Regulation.\n(c)         \nBoth initial amounts shall be rounded to the\nwhole unit (hectoliter).\n(2)                   \nThe pending (not allocated) tariff quota\nrequests for the tariff quota 09.1515 shall be transferred to the tariff quotas\n09.1530 and 09.1560 respectively, according to the origin of the wine.\nArticle 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\nthe third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of\nthe European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, \nFor the European Parliament\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\nThe President\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\nANNEX \n\"ANNEX\nI\nTARIFF QUOTAS\nREFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 3(1) of Council Regulation (EC) 1215/2009.\nNotwithstanding the rules for the\ninterpretation of the Combined Nomenclature (CN), the wording for the\ndescription of the products is to be considered as having no more than an\nindicative value, the preferential scheme being determined, within the context\nof this Annex, by the coverage of the CN codes.
