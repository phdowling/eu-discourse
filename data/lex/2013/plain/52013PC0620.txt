It has been estimated that of the\r\nover 12 000 alien species that are found in the European environment,\r\n10-15 % have reproduced and spread, causing environmental, economic and\r\nsocial damage.\nThe impact of IAS on biodiversity is\r\nsignificant. IAS are one of the major, and growing, causes of biodiversity loss\r\nand species extinction. When it comes to social and economic impacts, IAS can\r\nbe vectors of diseases or directly cause health problems (e.g. asthma,\r\ndermatitis and allergies). They can damage infrastructure and recreational\r\nfacilities, hamper forestry or cause agricultural losses, to mention but a few.\r\nIAS are estimated to cost the Union at least \u20ac 12 billion per year and\r\ndamage costs are continuing to rise.\nWith the 2020 Biodiversity Strategy, the\r\nUnion undertook to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2020, in line with the\r\ninternational commitments adopted by the parties to the Convention for Biological\r\nDiversity in 2010 in Nagoya, Japan. Indeed, the problem of IAS is not limited\r\nto Europe, but found throughout the world. Unlike some of its trading partners,\r\nthe European Union currently lacks a comprehensive framework to address the\r\nthreats posed by IAS..\nRegulatory framework \nThere is currently no EU framework for\r\ntackling IAS comprehensively. Few IAS are addressed by\r\nEU legislation. Disease agents and pests of animals and plants and their\r\nproducts are covered respectively by the animal health regime (various\r\nregulations and directives) and by the plant health regime (2000/29/EC). The\r\nWildlife Trade Regulation (338/97) restricts imports of endangered species,\r\nincluding imports of seven IAS. The Regulation on the use of alien and locally\r\nabsent species in aquaculture (708/2007) addresses the release of alien species\r\nfor aquaculture purposes. The regulations on plant protection products\r\n(1107/2009) and on biocides (528/2012) address the intentional release of\r\nmicro-organisms as plant protection products or biocide respectively. Finally,\r\nthe Birds Directive (2009/147/EC) and the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), the\r\nWater Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and the Marine Strategy Framework\r\nDirective (2008/56/EC) require the restoration of ecological conditions and\r\nrefer to the need to take IAS into consideration. Nevertheless, existing Union\r\naction leaves most IAS unaddressed. \nMember States are taking a number of\r\nmeasures to tackle IAS, but such action remains predominantly reactive, seeking\r\nto minimise the damage already being caused without paying sufficient attention\r\nto prevention or to detecting and responding to new threats. Efforts are\r\nfragmented, with substantial gaps in species coverage, and are often poorly\r\ncoordinated. IAS do not respect borders and can easily spread from one Member State to another. Thus, action taken at national level will be insufficient to\r\nprotect the Union from the threat of certain IAS. Moreover, this fragmented\r\napproach can lead to action in one Member State being undermined by a lack of\r\naction in neighbouring Member States. Furthermore, different\r\nrestrictions on the commercialisation of IAS between Member States are\r\nhighly ineffective, as species can easily be transported or spread across\r\nborders throughout the Union. Moreover, such differentiated bans are hampering\r\nthe free circulation of goods in the internal market and disrupting the level\r\nplaying field for sectors which use or trade in alien species.\nProblem\r\nanalysis\nIAS are being introduced into the Union\r\nthrough two channels: 1) some alien species are desirable and are brought into\r\nthe Union intentionally (e.g. commercial interests, ornamental purposes,\r\ncompanion animals, biological control); 2) some alien species are introduced\r\nunintentionally as contaminants of goods (trade in other commodities), as\r\nhitchhikers or stowaways in transport vectors, or can be transported\r\nunwittingly by travellers. Some IAS can also travel through transport\r\ninfrastructure (e.g. Danube-Main canal).\nIAS affect businesses, citizens, public\r\nauthorities and the environment. In the case of small and micro\r\nenterprises in particular, IAS often affects primary producers in\r\nagriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, aquaculture and forestry, suffering\r\nconsiderable economic damage as a result. Businesses linked to tourism and\r\nrecreational activities, which rely on pristine landscapes, clean water bodies\r\nand healthy ecosystems, are often also affected. However, other small and micro\r\nenterprises, e.g. traders in companion animals and horticultural species, draw\r\nbenefits from IAS as they focus mainly on trade in alien species. IAS also affect society at large, causing a loss of\r\nbiodiversity and compromising the ability of ecosystems to provide ecosystem\r\nservices. Moreover, they may transmit diseases, damage property and affect\r\ncultural heritage.\nAll the Member States are facing problems\r\ncaused by IAS. While some IAS affect most Member States, others are only a\r\nproblem in certain regions, or under certain ecological or climatic conditions.\r\nNevertheless, all the Member States do have IAS on their territory. IAS impacts\r\nare relevant to the whole of the Union and all the Member States will be\r\nequally affected by IAS, albeit at different times and by different species.\r\nCoordinated action to tackle IAS would thus benefit all the Member States,\r\nwhile clearly requiring efforts from all of them.\nIf no action is taken to tackle the\r\nproblem, it will get worse as new IAS establish themselves and those already\r\nestablished spread further. This will result in an increase in damage costs and\r\nmanagement costs. \nObjectives of the proposal\nThis proposal aims to tackle the issues\r\nhighlighted above by establishing a framework for action to prevent, minimise\r\nand mitigate the adverse impacts of IAS on biodiversity and ecosystem services.\r\nFurthermore, it will seek to limit social and economic damage. This will be\r\nachieved through measures to ensure coordinated action, focusing resources on\r\npriority species and on increasing preventive measures, in accordance with the\r\nConvention of Biological Diversity approach and with the Union\u2019s plant and\r\nanimal health regimes. In practical terms, the proposal seeks to attain these\r\nobjectives through measures addressing the intentional introduction of IAS into\r\nthe Union and their intentional release into the environment, the unintentional\r\nintroduction and release of IAS, the need to set up an early warning and rapid\r\nresponse system, and the need to manage the IAS spread throughout the Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation process\nIn 2008 the European Commission published a Communication\r\n\u2018Towards an EU Strategy on Invasive Species (2008)\u2019 setting out the case\r\nfor tackling IAS. The 2010 Communication \u2018Our\r\nlife insurance, our natural capital: an EU biodiversity strategy to 2020\u2019 proposes action on IAS. Both Communications were preceded and\r\nfollowed by thorough consultations.\nA series of intensive rounds of\r\nstakeholder consultations took place between 2008 and 2012, which\r\nattracted the whole spectrum of interested parties,\r\nfrom nature conservation organisations to operators in the private sector,\r\nincluding organisations representing Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)\r\nrelying on alien species for their business. An online\r\npublic consultation was held in 2008 and a second one in 2012. A working group composed of Commission departments, Member States,\r\nstakeholders and academics was convened in 2008 and produced a discussion paper[1] bringing together the latest information and summarising opinions\r\non key issues. This Working Group was then reconvened and reorganised into\r\nthree working groups in 2010-2011, which drew up possible policy options to\r\naddress prevention, early warning/rapid response and the management of\r\nestablished species respectively. Finally a stakeholder consultation meeting\r\nwas held in September 2010.\nThe Commission\u2019s work on IAS has also been supported by several\r\nexternal studies and research[2].\r\nFurthermore, all of the analysis set out in the impact assessment was based on\r\nscientifically robust data, mostly retrieved from peer-reviewed scientific\r\narticles. Information on damage cost, spread of species and the costs of\r\nmeasures in place were also provided or checked by Member States. Special\r\nefforts were made to contact directly the stakeholders involved in this issue,\r\nincluding those sectors that might be negatively impacted by the introduction\r\nof measures to tackle the IAS problem. Finally, the analysis also benefited\r\nfrom the input of the world\u2019s top experts on IAS within and beyond the Union.\nImpact assessment\nVarious options were identified for addressing the IAS issue, and in\r\nparticular for addressing all aspects of the problem that were identified, but\r\nwith a different level of ambition.\nBased on feedback\r\nfrom the consultation, a number of levels of ambition and intervention were\r\nidentified for each of the operational objectives pinpointed through the\r\nanalysis of the problem, resulting in different sub-options for the design of\r\nthe legislative instrument. An initial screening led to\r\nthe discarding of sub-options that were not feasible, or simply not as\r\neffective as others. For each option identified, each\r\nof the operational objectives was addressed systematically, proposing practical\r\nmeasures to tackle IAS.\nIn addition to the baseline option (option\r\n0), which would maintain the status quo, the following options were identified:\nOption 1 \u2014 Enhancing\r\ncooperation and supporting voluntary action: This would include the development of guidelines, sectoral codes of\r\nconduct and other awareness-raising and educational campaigns. This option\r\nwould also seek to encourage cooperation between Member States in setting up an\r\nearly warning and rapid response system. The Commission could promote existing\r\ninitiatives in this area through communication campaigns.\nOption 2.1 \u2014 Basic legislative instrument: This involves a series of legal obligations banning the import, keeping, sale, purchase and exchange of certain\r\nIAS listed as IAS of Union concern. Further obligations would be linked to\r\nrelease into the environment of IAS of Union concern, rapid response to newly\r\nestablishing IAS of Union concern and management of widely spread IAS of Union\r\nconcern.\nOption 2.2 \u2014\r\nBasic legislative instrument + permits for release of IAS of Member State\r\nconcern: This option would go beyond the list of\r\nIAS of Union concern for the release into the environment, by requiring permits\r\nfor IAS deemed of concern by Member States.\nOption 2.3 \u2014\r\nBasic legislative instrument + a strict general\r\nban on the release of alien species, unless found to be safe: This option would go beyond the list of\r\nIAS of Union concern for release into the environment by prohibiting the\r\nrelease of any alien species unless they are included in a Union list of alien\r\nspecies approved for release.\nOption 2.4 \u2014\r\nBasic legislative instrument + an obligation for the rapid eradication of newly\r\nestablishing IAS of Union concern: With this\r\noption, when it comes to rapid response, Member States\r\nwould not have a choice, but rather an obligation to eradicate quickly any\r\nnewly establishing IAS of Union concern and share information. Derogations are\r\npossible if approved by the Commission.\nOption 2.4 was retained and informs the\r\npresent proposal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis of this proposal is Article\r\n192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, implementing the\r\nEU objectives of preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the\r\nenvironment, protecting human health, ensuring prudent and rational utilisation\r\nof natural resources, and promoting measures dealing with regional or worldwide\r\nenvironmental problems.\nSubsidiarity\nUnion-level action is necessary as IAS problems are increasing and are cross-border by nature. In view of\r\nthe lack of Union-level action, Member States are putting measures in place to\r\ncope with the problem at national level. They are investing resources and\r\nefforts in eradicating harmful IAS but such efforts can be undermined by a lack\r\nof action in a neighbouring Member State where the species is also present.\r\nEqually, there is no coordinated Union action to ensure\r\nthat when IAS first enter the Union, Member States take prompt measures for the\r\nbenefit of other Member States not yet affected. Furthermore, the protection of\r\nthe internal market \u2014 and the free circulation of goods \u2014 have to be taken into\r\nconsideration. A coordinated approach will ensure legal clarity and a level\r\nplaying field for those sectors using or trading alien species while avoiding a\r\nfragmentation of the internal market due to different restrictions on the\r\ncommercialisation of IAS between Member States.\nCurrent efforts are\r\nhighly fragmented and inconsistent, leaving considerable policy gaps. These\r\nlead to ineffectiveness and do not solve the IAS\r\nproblem. A mixture of Union and national, regional and\r\nlocal measures will be needed, in line with the principle of subsidiarity.\r\nHowever, a coherent approach at Union level will\r\nincrease the effectiveness of the measures.\nGuiding principles\nThis proposal puts forward measures based\r\non the following guiding principles:\nPrioritisation \u2014 There are over 12,000 alien species in the EU out of which 10 to 15% are causing damage (which means 1200 to 1800\r\ninvasive alien species) and new ones keep arriving.\r\nThere is ample scope for a prioritised and proportionate approach, building\r\nupon existing efforts and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of\r\ncurrent action.\nShift towards prevention \u2014 Prevention is\r\ninternationally recognised as the most effective way of avoiding the IAS\r\nproblem. Measures focusing on prevention need to be accompanied by an effective\r\nearly warning system to take prompt action on species eluding the prevention\r\nmeasures.\nBuilding upon existing systems \u2014 Valuable\r\nwork is already being done in the Union both at national level and at Union level.\r\nThis proposal intends to maximise the efficiency of the system and to make full\r\nuse of what already exists.\nGradual and phased-in approach \u2014 Member\r\nStates need legal certainty and reassurance regarding the extent and costs of\r\nthe actions they will be expected to take. Therefore, this proposal includes a\r\nprioritisation of invasive alien species based on very stringent listing\r\ncriteria, as well as an initial capping of the number of priority species to\r\nthe top 3% of some 1500 invasive alien species in Europe. Further, a review\r\nclause will allow to develop the system progressively\r\nand build upon the experience gained. Any extension of\r\nthe list of species of EU concern will only take place following this review. \nStructure of the proposal\nChapter I \u2014 General provisions. This section sets outs the subject matter, the scope and the basic\r\nobligation of the proposal. It also provides the tools for prioritising IAS of\r\nUnion concern to enable Union resources to be prioritised on the basis of risk\r\nand scientific evidence.\nChapter II \u2014 Prevention. This section sets out the measures necessary to prevent the\r\nintroduction into the Union and the introduction or release into the\r\nenvironment of IAS.\nChapter III \u2014 Early detection and rapid\r\neradication. This section sets out the tools to\r\nensure that IAS of Union concern can be detected early in the environment and\r\nat the Union borders and describes the measures that are triggered when these\r\nIAS are detected.\nChapter IV \u2014 Management of IAS that are\r\nwidely spread. This section sets out the\r\nobligations necessary to tackle IAS of Union concern that are already present\r\nin the Union or new ones that have eluded the prevention measures and early\r\ndetection measures and managed to spread widely.\nChapter V \u2014 Final provisions. This section sets out reporting obligations and the legal tools\r\nneeded to ensure implementation, enforcement and review of the proposed\r\nmeasures.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThere will be only some limited financial\r\nimplication to be financed under Heading 5 of the Multi-annual Financing Framework\r\n2014-2020 for the Committee under Article 22. See Financial Fiche attached.\n2013/0307 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the prevention and management of the\r\nintroduction and spread of invasive alien species\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\r\nEconomic and Social Committee[3]\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[4],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appearance of alien species,\r\nwhether animals, plants, fungi or micro-organisms, in new locations is not always\r\na cause for concern. However, a significant subset of alien species can become\r\ninvasive and have serious adverse impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem\r\nservices, as well as other economic and social impacts, which should be\r\nprevented. Some 12 000 species in the environment in the Union and other\r\nEuropean countries are alien, of which roughly 10 to 15 % are estimated to\r\nbe invasive.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Invasive alien species\r\nrepresent one of the primary threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services,\r\nespecially in geographically and evolutionary isolated ecosystems, such as\r\nsmall islands, and the risks such species pose may be greater due to increased\r\nglobal trade, transport, tourism and climate change.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The threat to biodiversity\r\nand ecosystem services that invasive alien species pose can take different\r\nforms such as impacting severely on native species and ecosystem structure and\r\nfunction through alteration of habitat, predation, competition, transmission of\r\ndiseases, replacement of native species throughout a significant proportion of\r\nrange and genetic effects by hybridisation. Furthermore, invasive alien species\r\ncan also have a significant negative impact on human health and the economy. It\r\nis only live specimens, or parts that can reproduce, that represent a threat to\r\nbiodiversity and ecosystem services, human health or the economy. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union, as a party to\r\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity, approved by Council Decision 93/626/EEC[5], is bound by the provisions of\r\nArticle 8(h) therein, according to which the Parties shall, as far as possible\r\nand as appropriate, 'prevent the introduction of, control or eradicate those\r\nalien species which threaten ecosystems, habitats or species'.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union, as a party to\r\nthe Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats\r\n(the Bern Convention), approved by Council Decision 82/72/EEC[6], has undertaken to take all\r\nappropriate measures to ensure the conservation of the habitats of the wild\r\nflora and fauna species.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To support the achievement\r\nof the objectives of Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds[7], Council Directive 92/43/EEC of\r\n21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora[8], Directive 2008/56/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framework\r\nfor community action in the field of marine environmental policy (Marine\r\nStrategy Framework Directive)[9]\r\nand Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23\r\nOctober 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water\r\npolicy[10],\r\nthe primary objective of this Regulation should be to prevent, minimise and\r\nmitigate the adverse effects of invasive alien species on biodiversity and\r\necosystem services, as well as to reduce their economic and social impact.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some species migrate\r\nnaturally in response to environmental changes. Therefore they should not be\r\nconsidered as alien species in their new environment and are thus excluded from\r\nthe scope of the new rules on invasive alien species.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At Union level, the\r\nproposal for a new Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on\r\nAnimal Health[11]\r\ninclude provisions on animal diseases, and the new Regulation of the European\r\nParliament and the Council on protective measures against pests of plants [12]\r\nprovides rules for pests of plants, and Directive 2001/18/EC of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into\r\nthe environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council\r\nDirective 90/220/EEC[13] sets out the regime applicable to genetically modified organisms.\r\nTherefore, the new rules on invasive alien species should align and not overlap\r\nwith those Union acts and shall not apply to the organisms targeted by those acts.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n708/2007 of 11 June 2007 concerning use of alien and locally absent species in\r\naquaculture[14],\r\nRegulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22\r\nMay 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal\r\nproducts[15]\r\nand Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\r\nof 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the\r\nmarket and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC[16] provide for rules concerning\r\nthe authorisation for the use of certain alien species for particular purposes.\r\nThe use of certain species has already been authorised under those regimes at\r\nthe time of entry into force of these new rules as they do not pose\r\nunacceptable risks to the environment, human health and the economy. In order\r\nto ensure a coherent legal framework, those species should thus be excluded\r\nfrom the new rules. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As invasive alien species\r\nare numerous, it is important to ensure that priority is afforded to addressing\r\nthe subset of invasive alien species considered to be of Union concern. A list\r\nof such invasive alien species considered to be of Union concern should\r\ntherefore be drawn up. An invasive alien species should be considered of Union\r\nconcern if the damage it is causing in the affected Member States is so\r\nsignificant that it justifies the adoption of dedicated measures the scope of\r\nwhich extends across the Union, including in the Member States that are not yet\r\naffected or even unlikely to be affected. In order to ensure that the subset of\r\ninvasive alien species of Union concern remains proportionate, the list should be\r\ndeveloped in line with a gradual and phased-in approach including an initial capping of the number of invasive alien species of Union\r\nconcern to the top 3% of some 1500 invasive alien species in Europe and be\r\nfocused on those species that cause or are likely to cause significant economic\r\ndamage, including that deriving from biodiversity loss.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The criteria to list invasive\r\nalien species considered to be of Union concern is the core instrument to apply\r\nthese new rules. The Commission will do its utmost to submit a proposal for a\r\nlist based on those criteria within one year of the entry into force of this\r\nlegislation to the Committee. The criteria should include a risk assessment pursuant\r\nto the applicable provisions under the Agreements of the World Trade\r\nOrganisation on placing trade restriction on species. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\r\ncompliance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation and ensure the\r\ncoherent application of these new rules common criteria should be established\r\nto perform the risk assessment. Those criteria should use when appropriate\r\nexisting national and international standards and should encompass different\r\naspects of the characteristics of the species, the risk and modes of entry into\r\nthe Union, the negative economic, social and biodiversity impacts of the\r\nspecies, the potential benefits of uses and the costs of mitigation to weight\r\nthem against the negative impacts, as well as a quantified forecast of the\r\nenvironmental, economic and social damage costs at Union level demonstrating\r\nthe significance for the Union, so as to further justify action. In order to\r\ndevelop the system progressively and build upon the experience gained, the\r\noverall approach should be evaluated after five years.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some invasive alien animals\r\nare included in Annex B to Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 of 9 December 1996\r\non the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade\r\ntherein[17],\r\nand their import into the Union is prohibited because their invasive character\r\nhas been recognised and their introduction into the Union has a negative impact\r\non native species. These species are: Callosciurus erythraeus, Sciurus\r\ncarolinensis, Oxyura jamaicensis, Lithobates (Rana) catesbeianus, Sciurus\r\n  niger, Chrysemys picta, Trachemys scripta elegans. To ensure a coherent\r\nlegal framework and uniform rules at Union level on invasive alien species, those\r\ninvasive alien animals should be considered as a matter of priority for listing\r\nas invasive alien species of Union concern. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prevention is generally\r\nmore environmentally desirable and cost-effective than reaction after the fact\r\nand should be prioritised, and as new species can be introduced continuously\r\ninto the Union and alien species present are spreading and expanding their\r\nrange, it is necessary to ensure that the list of invasive alien species of\r\nUnion concern is constantly revised and kept up-to-date. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some of the species that\r\nare invasive in the Union may be native in some of the Union's Outermost\r\nRegions and vice versa. In the Communication from the Commission on \"The\r\noutermost regions: an asset for Europe\"[18]\r\nit was recognised that the remarkable biodiversity of the outermost regions\r\ncalls for the development and implementation of measures to prevent and manage\r\ninvasive alien species in those regions as defined by the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union taking into account European Council\r\nDecisions 2010/718/EU of 29 October 2010 amending the status with regard to the\r\nEuropean Union of the island of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy[19] and 2012/419/EU of 11 July\r\n2012 amending the status of Mayotte with regard to the European Union[20]. Therefore all the provisions\r\nof these new rules should apply to the Union's Outermost Regions except for\r\nprovisions relating to invasive alien species of Union concern which are native\r\nto those regions. In addition, to allow for the necessary protection of the\r\nbiodiversity in such regions, it is necessary that the concerned Member States\r\ndraw up, as a complement to the list of invasive alien species of Union\r\nconcern, specific lists of invasive alien species for their Outermost Regions\r\nto which these new rules should also apply.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The risks and concerns\r\nassociated with invasive alien species represent a cross-border challenge affecting\r\nthe whole of the Union. It is therefore essential to adopt at Union level a ban\r\non intentionally bringing into the Union, reproducing, growing, transporting,\r\nbuying, selling, using, exchanging, keeping and releasing invasive alien\r\nspecies of Union concern, to ensure that consistent action is taken across the\r\nUnion so as to avoid distortions of the internal market and to prevent\r\nsituations where action taken in one Member State is undermined by inaction in\r\nanother Member State. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to enabling scientific\r\nresearch and ex-situ conservation activities, it is necessary to provide specific\r\nrules for the invasive alien species of Union concern subject to those\r\nactivities. Those activities should be carried out in closed facilities where\r\nthe organisms are in contained holding and with all the necessary measures taken\r\nto avoid the escape or unlawful release of invasive alien species of Union\r\nconcern. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There may be cases where alien\r\nspecies not yet recognised as invasive alien species of Union concern appear at\r\nthe Union borders or are detected in the Union territory. Member States should therefore\r\nbe granted the possibility to adopt on the basis of available scientific\r\nevidence certain emergency measures. Such emergency measures would allow immediate\r\nreaction against species which may pose risks related to their introduction,\r\nestablishment and spread in those countries, while Member States assess the\r\neffective risks posed by them, in line with the applicable provisions of the Agreements\r\nof the World Trade Organisation, in particular with a view to having those\r\nspecies recognised as invasive alien species of Union concern. There is a need\r\nto couple national emergency measures with the possibility of adopting\r\nemergency measures at Union level in order to comply with the provisions of the\r\nagreements of the World Trade Organisation. Furthermore, Union level emergency\r\nmeasures would equip the Union with a mechanism to act swiftly in case of\r\npresence or imminent danger of entry of a new invasive alien species in\r\naccordance with the precautionary principle. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should be\r\nable to adopt more stringent measures to tackle invasive alien species and to take\r\nmeasures proactively in respect of any species that are not listed as invasive\r\nalien species of Union concern. In order to adopt a more proactive stance on\r\nunlisted species, it should therefore be required that to release invasive\r\nalien species into the environment that are not listed as invasive alien\r\nspecies of Union concern, but for which Member States have found evidence that\r\nthey pose a risk, an authorisation for release should be issued. Detailed rules\r\nfor the authorisation of alien species to be used in aquaculture have already\r\nbeen established by Regulation (EC) No 708/2007 and should be taken into\r\naccount by Member States in this context.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A large proportion of\r\ninvasive alien species are introduced unintentionally into the Union. It is therefore crucial to manage the pathways of unintentional introduction. Action\r\nin this area would need to be gradual, given the relatively limited experience\r\nin this field. Action should include voluntary measures, such as the actions\r\nproposed by the International Maritime Organisation's Guidelines for the\r\nControl and Management of Ships' Biofouling, and mandatory measures and should\r\nbuild on the experience gained in the Union and in Member States in managing\r\ncertain pathways, including measures established through the International\r\nConvention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to develop an\r\nadequate knowledge base to address the problems raised by invasive alien\r\nspecies, it is important that Member States undertake research, monitoring and\r\nsurveillance of such species. As surveillance systems offer the most\r\nappropriate means for early detection of new invasive alien species and for the\r\ndetermination of the distribution of already established species, they should\r\ninclude both targeted and general surveys and benefit from the involvement of\r\ndifferent sectors and stakeholders, including local communities. Surveillance\r\nsystems should imply paying continuous attention to any new invasive alien\r\nspecies anywhere in the Union. In the interest of efficiency and\r\ncost-effectiveness, existing systems of border control, surveillance and\r\nmonitoring already established in Union legislation should be applied, in\r\nparticular those set out Directives 2009/147/EC, 92/43/EEC, 2008/56/EC and\r\n2000/60/EC. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Official controls on\r\nanimals and plants should be carried out in order to prevent the intentional\r\nintroduction of invasive alien species. Live animals and plants should enter\r\nthe Union through border control posts designated by Member States in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No XXX/XXXX [on official controls\r\nCOM(2013)265]. In order to ensure efficiency gains and avoid creating parallel\r\nsystems of border controls, the verification whether these species are invasive\r\nalien species of Union concern should also be carried out at the first Border\r\nControl Post of arrival. Animal and plants, not falling under the scope of\r\nRegulation (EU) No XXX/XXXX [on official controls COM(2013)265] or exempted\r\nfrom official controls at border control posts, shall enter the customs\r\nterritory of the Community through other entry points and subject to checks\r\ntherein.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the introduction of\r\nan invasive alien species, early detection and rapid eradication measures are\r\ncrucial to prevent their establishment and spread. The most effective and cost\r\nefficient response is often to eradicate the population, as soon as possible\r\nwhile the number of specimens is still limited. In the event that eradication\r\nis not feasible or the costs of eradication outweigh in the long term the\r\nenvironmental, economic and social benefits, containment and control measures\r\nshould be applied. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eradicating and managing\r\nsome invasive alien species, while necessary, may induce pain, distress, fear\r\nor other forms of suffering to the animals even when using the best available\r\ntechnical means. For that reason, Member States and any operator involved in\r\nthe eradication, control or containment of invasive alien species should take\r\nthe necessary measures to minimise pain, distress and suffering of animals\r\nduring the process, taking into account in so far as possible the best\r\npractices in the field, for example the Guiding Principles on Animal Welfare\r\ndeveloped by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Invasive alien species\r\ngenerally cause damage to ecosystems and reduce their resilience. Therefore\r\nrestoration measures are required to strengthen the ecosystems' resilience\r\ntowards invasions, to repair the damage caused and to enhance the conservation\r\nstatus of species and their habitats in accordance with Article 4 of Directive\r\n2009/147/EC and Article 6 of Directive 92/43/EEC, the ecological status of\r\ninland surface waters, transitional waters, coastal waters and groundwater in\r\naccordance with Article 11 of Directive 2000/60/EC, and the environmental\r\nstatus of marine waters in accordance with Article 13 of Directive 2008/56/EC. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A system to address\r\ninvasive alien species should be underpinned by a centralised information\r\nsystem collating the existing information on alien species in the Union and\r\nallowing access to information on presence of species, their spread, their\r\necology, invasion history and all other information necessary to underpin\r\npolicy and management decisions. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2003/35/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 providing for public\r\nparticipation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes\r\nrelating to the environment[21]\r\nestablishes a framework for public consultation in environment related\r\ndecisions. In defining action in the field of invasive alien species, effective\r\npublic participation should enable the public to express, and the\r\ndecision-maker to take account of, opinions and concerns which may be relevant\r\nto those decisions, thereby increasing the accountability and transparency of\r\nthe decision-making process and contributing to public awareness of\r\nenvironmental issues and support for the decisions taken. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the application of this Regulation, for adopting and updating\r\nthe list of invasive alien species of Union concern, for granting derogations\r\nfrom the obligation of rapid eradication and for the adoption of Union\r\nemergency measures, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.\r\nThose powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down\r\nthe rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the\r\nMember States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers[22]. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take into\r\naccount the latest scientific developments in the environmental field, the\r\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in\r\nrespect of determining how to conclude that invasive alien species are capable\r\nof establishing viable populations and of spreading, as well as for setting out\r\nthe common elements for the development of risk assessments. It is of\r\nparticular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during\r\nits preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing\r\nand drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and\r\nappropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and\r\nto the Council.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to guarantee\r\ncompliance with this Regulation, it is important that Member States impose\r\ndissuasive, effective and proportionate sanctions for infringements taking into\r\naccount the nature and gravity of the infringement. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to enable non-commercial\r\nowners to continue keeping their companion animals that belong to species\r\nlisted as invasive alien species of Union concern until the animal's natural\r\ndeath, it is necessary to provide transitional measures, on the condition that\r\nall measures are put in place to avoid escape or reproduction. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to enable\r\ncommercial operators, who may have legitimate expectations, for instance those\r\nwho have received an authorisation in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 708/2007,\r\nto exhaust their stock of invasive alien species of Union concern when these new\r\nrules enter into force, it is justified to allow them two years to slaughter,\r\nsell or hand over the specimens to research or ex-situ conservation\r\nestablishments.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of the\r\nproposed action, namely the prevention and management of invasive alien species,\r\ncannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by\r\nreason of the scale and effects of the measures, be better achieved at Union\r\nlevel, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of\r\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In\r\naccordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article,\r\nthis act does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that\r\nobjective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\r\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\r\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation sets out rules to prevent,\r\nminimise and mitigate the adverse impacts of the introduction and spread, both\r\nintentional and unintentional, of invasive alien species on biodiversity and\r\necosystem services. \nArticle 2\r\nScope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation applies to\r\nall invasive alien species in the Union as defined in Article 3(2).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation does not\r\napply to: \n(a)          \r\nspecies changing their natural range without\r\nhuman intervention, in response to changing ecological conditions and climate\r\nchange;

TFEU\nDescription and grounds:\nInvasive alien species (IAS) are species that are transported across\r\necological boundaries, intentionally or unintentionally by human action,\r\noutside of their natural distribution and that establish and spread in their\r\nnew location to an extent that they have a negative impact on biodiversity, but\r\nalso on human health and the economy. IAS are a major cause of biodiversity\r\nloss, besides causing social and economic damage, and tackling them is crucial\r\nto meet the EU target of halting the loss of biodiversity by 2020. Furthermore,\r\nit has been estimated that IAS are costing \u20ac12 billion/year to the EU in terms\r\nof damage and control costs. The purpose of this draft Regulation is thus to\r\nestablish an EU framework to prevent, minimise and mitigate the adverse impacts\r\nof IAS on biodiversity and ecosystem services and to seek to mitigate social\r\nand economic damage. Member States are already taking measures to tackle some\r\nIAS, but action is predominantly reactive, seeking to minimise the damage\r\nalready being caused without sufficient attention to prevention or to detect\r\nand respond to new threats. Efforts are fragmented, not covering the entire EU\r\nand often poorly co-ordinated, which means that their overall effectiveness is\r\nreduced. Currently a comprehensive legal framework to tackle IAS at EU level\r\ndoes not exist. This draft Regulation aims to address this policy gap, in line\r\nalso with its international commitments under the Convention of Biological\r\nDiversity.\nDuration and estimated financial\r\nimpact:\nPeriod of application:\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal\r\nwith a limited duration: in force from [date] to [date]\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal with an indefinite duration:\r\nin force from [forecasted 2015 tbc]\nEstimated budgetary impact:\nThe draft proposal entails:\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 savings\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 additional costs (if so, specify the heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework concerned): Heading 5 of the MFF 2014-2020\nThird-party contributions to the\r\nfinancing of the draft proposal:\nThe proposal does not provide for\r\nco-financing by third parties \nExplanation of figures:\nImplementation of aspects of this draft Regulation will require the\r\nrunning of a Committee.

The main tasks of the\r\nassigned officials will be: the management of the Committee, the management of\r\nthe interaction with the Member States, to coordinate with the Joint Research\r\nCentre (JRC) and in general support the correct implementation of this draft\r\nRegulation. \nThe system is designed to pool resources\r\nand expertise from different services of the Commission, which will allow to\r\nrun the system with limited dedicated staff resources: in particular, the IAS\r\npolicy will benefit from the contribution of JRC staff involved in the EASIN\r\nproject[25],\r\nas well as from the expertise of other Commission services and agencies working\r\nin areas of relevance to IAS policy (in particular, the European Environment\r\nAgency has dedicated staff working on IAS who will be mobilised in support of\r\nimplementation work). If necessary, staff will be redeployed on the basis of\r\nthe allocations which may be granted to the managing DG under the annual\r\nallocation procedure in the light of existing budgetary constraints.\nESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT (savings or\r\nadditional costs) FOR APPROPRIATIONS OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE NATURE OR FOR HUMAN\r\nRESOURCES\n FTE in persons/year || Year || Year || Year || Year || Year || Year || Year || Total \n 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 || 2020 || 2021 \n Heading 5 || FTE || approp. || FTE || approp. || FTE || approp. || FTE || approp. || FTE || approp. || FTE || approp. || FTE || approp. ||   ||   \n Establishment plan posts (officials and/or temporary staff) \n 07 01 01 01 (Headquarters and Commission\u2019s Representation Offices) ||   || 0.199* ||   || 0.199 ||   || 0.199 ||   || 0.199 ||   || 0.199 ||   || 0.199 ||   || 0.199 ||   || 1.393 \n 07 01 01 02 (Delegations) ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n External staff ||   \n 07 01 02 01 (\u2018Global envelope\u2019) ||   || 0.002**  ||   || 0.002  ||   || 0.002  ||   || 0.002  ||   || 0.002  ||   || 0.002  ||   || 0.002  ||   || 0.014 \n 07 01 02 02 (Delegations) ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Other budget lines (specify) ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Subtotal \u2013 Heading 5 ||   || 0.201  ||   ||  0.201 ||   ||  0.201 ||   ||  0.201 ||   ||  0.201 ||   ||  0.201 ||   ||  0.201 ||   || 1.407 \n Outside Heading 5 ||   \n Establishment plan posts (officials and/or temporary staff) \n 07 01 05 01 (Indirect research) ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n 10 01 05 01 (Direct research) ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n External staff \n 07 01 04 yy ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n -
