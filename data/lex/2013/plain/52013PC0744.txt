In this framework, the EU has recognized\nthe importance of enhanced people-to-people contacts. During the Prague Eastern\nPartnership Summit in May 2009, the EU reaffirmed its political support towards\nfull liberalization of the visa regime in a secure environment, and towards\npromoting mobility by concluding visa facilitation and readmission agreements\nwith EaP countries. According to the common approach for the development of EU\npolicy on visa facilitation agreed at the level of\nCOREPER by the Member States in December 2005, a visa facilitation agreement\nwould not be concluded without a readmission agreement being in place.\nOn 19 December 2011, the Council formally\nauthorised the Commission to negotiate a readmission agreement between the\nEuropean Union and Azerbaijan. \nIn February 2012 the Commission transmitted\na draft text to the authorities of Azerbaijan following which the first round\nof formal negotiations was held in Baku on 1-2 March 2012. Three further formal\nrounds of negotiations took place, lastly in Brussels on 12-13 March 2013. The\nagreed text was subsequently initialled on 29 July 2013 in Brussels.\nMember States have been regularly informed\nand consulted at all (informal and formal) stages of the readmission\nnegotiations.\nOn the part of the Union, the legal basis\nfor the Agreement is Article 79(3), in conjunction with Article 218 of TFEU. \nThe attached proposal constitutes the legal\ninstrument for the conclusion of the readmission agreement. The Council will\ndecide by qualified majority. The European Parliament's consent will be required\nfor the conclusion of the Agreement, in accordance with Art. 218(6)(a) of TFEU.\nThe proposed\ndecision concerning the conclusion sets out the necessary internal arrangements\nfor the practical application of the Agreement. In particular, it\nspecifies that the Commission, assisted by experts from Member States,\nrepresents the Union within the Joint Readmission Committee set up by Article\n19 of the Agreement. Under Article 19(5), the readmission committee shall adopt\nits own rules of procedure. As in the case for the other readmission agreements\nso far concluded by the Union, the Union position in this regard shall be\nestablished by the Commission in consultation with a special committee\ndesignated by the Council. As regards other decisions to be taken by the Joint\nCommittee, the Union position shall be established in accordance with the\napplicable provisions of the Treaty. \nII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Outcome of the\nnegotiations \nThe Commission considers that the\nobjectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and\nthat the draft Readmission Agreement is acceptable to the Union.\nThe final content of this Agreement can be\nsummarised as follows:\n\u2013                        \nThe Agreement is divided into 8 sections with 25\narticles altogether. The Agreement also contains 8 annexes, which form an\nintegral part of it, and 6 joint declarations.\n\u2013                        \nThe agreement contains an opening clause,\nreaffirming that the agreement shall be applied so as to ensure respect for\nhuman rights, and for the obligations and responsibilities of the Requested\nState and Requesting State under relevant international instruments applicable\nto them, and reiterating that the Requested State shall in particular ensure\nthe protection of the rights of persons readmitted to its territory in\ncompliance with those international instruments. The same clause confirms that\nthe Requesting State should give preference to voluntary return over forced\nreturn.\n\u2013                        \nThe readmission obligations set out in the\nAgreement (Articles 3 - 6) are drawn up in a fully reciprocal manner,\ncomprising own nationals (Articles 3 and 5) as well as third country nationals\nand stateless persons (Articles 4 and 6). \n\u2013                        \nThe obligation to readmit own nationals includes\nalso former own nationals who have renounced their nationality without\nacquiring the nationality of another State.\n\u2013                        \nThe readmission obligation with regard to own\nnationals covers also family members (i.e. spouses and minor unmarried\nchildren) regardless of their nationality and who do not have an independent\nright of residence in the Requesting State. \n\u2013                        \nThe obligation to readmit third country\nnationals and stateless persons (Articles 4 and 6) is linked to the following\nprerequisites: (a) the person concerned holds, at the time of submission of the\nreadmission application, a valid visa or residence permit issued by the\nRequested State or (b) the person concerned illegally and directly entered the\nterritory of the Requesting State after having stayed on, or transited through,\nthe territory of the Requested State. Exempted from these obligations are\npersons in airside transit and persons who enjoy visafree access to the\nterritory of the Member State. \n\u2013                        \nFor own nationals, in case of expiry of the\nspecified delay, and for third country nationals or stateless persons\nAzerbaijan accepts the use of the EU's standard travel document for expulsion\npurposes (Articles 3(5) and 4(3)). The equivalent standard document of the Republic of   Azerbaijan is included in Annex 8.\n\u2013                        \nSection III of the Agreement (Articles 7 to 13\nin conj. with annexes 1 to 5) contains the necessary technical provisions\nregarding the readmission procedure (readmission application, means of\nevidence, time limits, transfer modalities and modes of transportation) and\n'readmission in error' (Article 13). Procedural flexibility is provided by the\nfact that no readmission application will be needed in cases where the person\nto be readmitted is in possession of a valid travel document (Article 7(2)). \n\u2013                        \nIn Article 7(3), the Agreement sets out the\nso-called accelerated procedure, which has been agreed upon for persons\napprehended in an area which extends up to 15 kilometres from and including the\nterritories of seaports and international airports, including custom zones, of\nthe Member States or Azerbaijan. Under the accelerated procedure, readmission\napplications have to be submitted within 2 days and replies have to be given\nwithin 2 working days, whereas under the normal procedure the time limit for\nreplies is 15 calendar days (Article 11(2)).\n\u2013                        \nThe Agreement contains a section on transit\noperations (Articles 14 and 15 in conj. with annex 6).\n\u2013                        \nArticles 16, 17 and 18 contain the necessary\nrules on costs, data protection and the relation to other international\nobligations.\n\u2013                        \nThe Joint Readmission Committee will be\ncomposed, and have the tasks and powers, as set out in Article 19.\n\u2013                        \nIn order to facilitate the implementation of\nthis Agreement, Article 20 creates the possibility for Azerbaijan and individual Member States to conclude bilateral implementing Protocols. The relation\nbetween the bilateral implementing Protocols and this Agreement is clarified by\nArticle 21.\n\u2013                        \nThe final provisions (Art. 22 to 25) contain the\nnecessary rules on entry into force, duration, possible amendments, suspension,\ntermination and the legal status of the annexes to the agreement. \n\u2013                        \nThe specific situation of Denmark is reflected in the preamble, Article 1(c) and Article 22(2), and in a relevant\njoint declaration. The close association of Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen\nAcquis has been taken into account, and is reflected in relevant joint\ndeclarations to the Agreement.\nIII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusions\nIn the light of the above-mentioned\nresults, the Commission proposes that the Council\n\u2013                        \napprove, after having received consent from the\nEuropean Parliament, the attached Agreement between the European Union and Azerbaijan on readmission of persons residing without authorisation.\n2013/0358 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nconcerning the conclusion of the Agreement\nbetween the European Union \nand the Republic of Azerbaijan on the readmission of persons residing without\nauthorisation\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European\nUnion,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 79(3), in\nconjunction with Article 218 (6)(a), thereof\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nCommission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\nEuropean Parliament[1],\nWhereas:\n(1) In accordance with Council Decision\nXXXX/XXX of [...][2], the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Azerbaijan\non readmission of persons residing without authorisation was signed by the\nCommission on [ ], subject to its conclusion at a later date. \n(2) The Agreement should be concluded.\n(3) The Agreement establishes a Joint\nReadmission Committee which may adopt its rules of procedure.
