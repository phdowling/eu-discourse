The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\napply.\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality\nprinciple for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and administrative\nburden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local\nauthorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to\nthe objective of the proposal is not applicable.\n\u00b7      Choice of instruments\nProposed instruments: regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason:\nThe basic Regulation does not provide for\nalternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union\nbudget.\n2013/0095 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\namending Implementing Regulation (EU) No\n1008/2011 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of hand pallet\ntrucks and their essential parts originating in the People's Republic of China\nfollowing a partial interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC)\nNo 1225/2009\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[1]\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Articles 9(4) and 11(3), (5) and\n(6) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\nthe European Commission ('the Commission') after consulting the Advisory\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\nA.\nPROCEDURE\n1.                      \nPrevious investigations and existing\nanti-dumping measures\n(1)              \nIn July 2005, by Regulation (EC) No 1174/2005[2], the Council imposed a\ndefinitive anti-dumping duty on imports of hand pallet trucks and their\nessential parts originating in the People's Republic of China ('the PRC'). The\nmeasures consisted of an ad valorem anti-dumping duty ranging between\n7,6% and 46,7%.\n(2)              \nIn July 2008, by Regulation (EC) No 684/2008[3], the Council, following a\nproduct scope interim review, clarified the product scope of the original\ninvestigation.\n(3)              \nIn June 2009, by Regulation (EC) No 499/2009[4], the Council, following an\nanti-circumvention investigation, extended the definitive anti-dumping duty\napplicable to 'all other companies' imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1174/2005 to\nhand pallet trucks and their essential parts consigned from Thailand whether\ndeclared as originating in Thailand or not. \n(4)              \nIn October 2011, by Implementing Regulation (EU)\nNo 1008/2011[5],\nthe Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of hand pallet\ntrucks and their essential parts originating in the PRC following an expiry\nreview pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation. The extended duty as\nmentioned in recital (3) above was also maintained by Implementing Regulation\n(EU) No 1008/2011.\n2.                      \nInitiation of a partial interim review\n(5)              \nDuring the expiry review the Commission noticed\na change in the competition landscape on the Union market as of the imposition\nof the measures. Indeed, the Chinese exporting producer with the lowest duty\nrate \u2013 who was granted market economy treatment ('MET') in the original\ninvestigation \u2013 was able to virtually take over a very big part of the Union\nmarket and increased significantly its share of imports in the EU. The\nCommission also had doubts with regard to the original MET determination in\nview of prima facie evidence of distortions on the steel market in the PRC. In\nthis context, the circumstances on the basis of which the existing measures\nwere established were considered to have changed and these changes seemed to be\nof a lasting nature.\n(6)              \nHaving determined, after consulting the Advisory\nCommittee, that sufficient evidence existed to justify the initiation of a\npartial interim review, the Commission announced by a notice published on 14\nFebruary 2012 in the Official Journal of the European Union[6] ('the Notice of\ninitiation') the ex officio initiation of a partial interim review in\naccordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation limited in scope to the\nexamination of dumping in respect of Chinese exporting producers.\n3.                      \nReview investigation period\n(7)              \nThe investigation of the level of dumping\ncovered the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011 ('the review\ninvestigation period' or 'the RIP').\n4.                      \nParties concerned\n(8)              \nThe Commission officially advised exporting\nproducers, unrelated importers known to be concerned, the authorities of the\nexporting country and the Union industry of the initiation of the partial\ninterim review. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their\nviews known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out\nin the Notice of initiation.\n(9)              \nAll interested parties, who so requested and\nshowed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard, were\ngranted a hearing.\n(10)          \nIn view of the potentially large number of\nexporting producers and unrelated importers, it was considered appropriate, in\naccordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation, to examine whether sampling\nshould be used. In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling would\nbe necessary and, if so, to select a sample, the above parties were requested,\npursuant to Article 17 of the basic Regulation, to make themselves known within\n15 days of the initiation of the review and to provide the Commission with\ninformation requested in the Notice of initiation. Two exporting producers and\neight unrelated importers came forward to cooperate. Sampling was therefore not\nnecessary for both exporting producers and unrelated importers.\n(11)          \nThe Commission sent questionnaires and MET claim\nforms to all parties known to be concerned and to those who make themselves\nknown within the deadlines set in the Notice of initiation. Replies were\nreceived from one Chinese exporting producer, Zhejiang Noblelift Equipment\nJoint Stock Co. Ltd ('Noblelift'), and from three unrelated importers.\n(12)          \nThe Commission sought and verified all\ninformation it deemed necessary for the determination of dumping. A\nverification visit was carried out at the premises of:\n\u2013              \nZhejiang Noblelift Equipment Joint Stock Co.\nLtd, Changxing, the PRC.\n(13)          \nIn light of the need to establish a normal value\nfor the exporting producer in the PRC to which MET was not granted, a\nverification at the premises of the following producer in Brazil, which was\nused as an analogue country, took place:\n\u2013              \nPaletrans Equipamentos Ltda, Cravinhos, Sao Paulo.\nB. PRODUCT\nCONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT\n1.                      \nProduct concerned\n(14)          \nThe product concerned by this review is the same\nas the one in the original investigation and clarified by the product scope\ninterim review, namely hand pallet trucks and their essential parts, i.e.\nchassis and hydraulics, originating in the PRC, currently falling within CN\ncodes ex 8427 90 00 and ex 8431 20 00. For the purpose\nof this Regulation, hand pallet trucks shall be trucks with wheels supporting\nlifting fork arms for handling pallets, designed to be manually pushed, pulled\nand steered, on smooth, level, hard surfaces, by a pedestrian operator using an\narticulated tiller. The hand pallet trucks are only designed to raise a load,\nby pumping the tiller, to a height sufficient for transporting and do not have\nany other additional functions or uses such as for example (i) to move and to\nlift the loads in order to place them higher or assist in storage of loads\n(highlifters), (ii) to stack one pallet above the other (stackers), (iii) to\nlift the load to a working level (scissorlifts) or (iv) to lift and to weigh\nthe loads (weighing trucks).\n2.                      \nLike product\n(15)          \nThe investigation confirmed that, the product concerned and the product manufactured and sold on the\ndomestic market in the PRC, the product manufactured and sold in the analogue\ncountry, Brazil, and the product manufactured and sold in the Union by the\nUnion producers have the same basic physical and technical characteristics as\nwell as the same uses. \n(16)          \nThese products are therefore considered to be\nalike within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.\nC.\nDUMPING \n(a) Market economy treatment (\u2018MET\u2019)\n(17)          \nPursuant to Article 2(7)(b) of the basic\nRegulation, in anti-dumping investigations concerning imports originating in\nthe PRC normal value shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 6\nof the said Article for those producers which were found to meet the criteria\nlaid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, i.e. where it is shown\nthat market economy conditions prevail in respect of the manufacture and sale\nof the like product. For ease of reference only, these criteria are set out in\na summarised form as follows:\n\u2013              \nBusiness decisions and costs are made in\nresponse to market signals and without significant State interference; and\ncosts of major inputs substantially reflect market values;\n\u2013              \nFirms have one clear set of basic accounting\nrecords which are independently audited in line with international accounting\nstandards and are applied for all purposes;\n\u2013              \nThere are no significant distortions carried over\nfrom the former non-market economy system;\n\u2013              \nBankruptcy and property laws guarantee legal\ncertainty and stability;\n\u2013              \nExchange rate conversions are carried out at\nmarket rates.\n(18)          \nOne Chinese producer, Noblelift, requested MET\npursuant to Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation and replied to the MET\nclaim form within the given deadlines.\n(19)          \nThe Commission sought all information deemed\nnecessary and verified all information submitted in the MET application at the\npremises of the company in question. \n(20)          \nThe investigation established that the prices\npaid by Noblelift in the RIP for Chinese hot-rolled carbon steel, a main raw\nmaterial accounting for about 25% of the cost of a finished product, were\nsignificantly distorted as they stood approximately between 24% and 31% below\ninternational prices over the same period. The international prices were based on\nstatistics for the EU and North American markets from the Steel Business\nBriefing[7] as well as from COMEXT import\nprices. On this basis it was found that Chinese steel prices clearly did not\nreflect market values. Moreover, there is an established practice of State\ninterference in the market of raw materials. The China 12th\nfive-year plan (2011-2015) for the Iron and Steel sector contains a series of\nmeasures which demonstrate that steel companies have no possibility other than\nto act in line with the Chinese Government instructions due to the firm control\nthe Chinese State has. It is thus concluded that Noblelift does not fulfil the\nrequirements of the first criterion of MET.\n(21)          \nFurthermore, in the financial year 2010, a\nrelated company has given Noblelift a bank guarantee for two loans representing\na significant proportion of that related company's and Noblelift's total\nassets. The guarantees were disclosed neither in Noblelift's financial\nstatements nor in the related company's accounts. This is not in line with IAS\n24 (Related Party Disclosures) and the auditor had no reservation on this\npractice. The disclosure of related party transactions in the financial\nstatements is important because it draws attention to possible effects on the\nfinancial position of a company. In this case, the non-disclosure of\nsignificant commitments such as the guarantees in question does not allow a\nproper assessment of the company\u2019s operations and in particular the risks and\nopportunities the company is facing. Therefore, it is considered that the\ncompany's accounting records have not been properly audited in line with\ninternational accounting standards and, thus, it does not fulfil the\nrequirements of the second criterion.\n(22)          \nFinally, Noblelift received State benefits in\nthe form of preferential income tax as well as grants which distort its\nfinancial situation and, thus, it does not fulfil the requirements of the third\ncriterion.\n(23)          \nThe exporting producer concerned and the Union\nindustry were given an opportunity to comment on the above findings.\n(24)          \nFollowing the disclosure of the MET findings, Noblelift\nrequested more details with regards to the calculation of international market\nprice for steel. The company argued that distortions in raw material prices\nshould be dealt with by adjusting the normal value in the dumping calculation\nrather than denying MET. However, the prescription of Article 2(7)(c) of the\nbasic Regulation is very clear and requires that \u2018costs of major inputs\nsubstantially reflect market values\u2019. Hence, any adjustment in the dumping\ncalculations in order to address the distorted input costs would render Article\n2(7)(c) largely meaningless. The comments could therefore not alter the above\nfindings.\n(25)          \nFollowing the disclosure of the final findings,\nNoblelift reiterated its arguments. It stated firstly that the Commission\nfailed to disclose the details, i.e. all the data used for the calculation of\ndifferences in raw material prices. \n(26)          \nIn this respect, it is noted first and foremost\nthat the sources of data for the comparisons of steel prices have been\nindicated by the Commission on several occasions. The Commission repeated the\nexplanations provided earlier in the proceeding that, the prices based on the\nSteel Business Briefing were copyright protected as the service is available on\nsubscription. Consequently, the Commission is legally prevented from publicly\ndisclosing these data directly but the database is otherwise available and can\nbe accessed with payment of the appropriate fee. Nevertheless, in order to\nensure a balance between the protection of intellectual property rights and the\nprotection of the rights of defence, the data used was verified by the Hearing\nOfficer of the Directorate-General for External Trade, who confirmed the calculation\nof the price difference and communicated the result of his verification to\nNoblelift. \n(27)          \nIt is further noted that the Steel Business\nBriefing describes exactly the methodology used (dimensions, thickness, width,\npoint in transport). Those parameters are general and are a guide which is also\nindicative of the level of detail in price comparisons of raw materials which\naim at establishing whether costs of major inputs substantially reflect market\nvalues. The Commission has used European and North American prices as\nreference.\n(28)          \nNoblelift further claimed that in the original\ninvestigation, differences between domestic steel prices in the PRC and\ninternational steel prices were not considered as a factor preventing the\ncompany from meeting the first MET criterion. As stated in recital (22) to the\nCommission Regulation imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty in the framework\nof the original investigation, \"For all four companies, it was\nestablished (\u2026) that costs and prices reflected market values\".[8] Indeed, the original\ninvestigation did not establish a substantial price difference between raw\nmaterials procured locally in the PRC and those purchased at international\nprices. However, this conclusion cannot prevent the institutions from finding a\nprice difference in a later investigation should the circumstances be different\nand there is a price difference. As indicated in recital (76) below the\ncircumstances have significantly changed since 2004 (time of the original\ninvestigation) and 2011 (the IP of the review at hand), i.e. in a period of seven\nyears. In this regard, and in particular during the expiry review investigation\nin 2010, prima facie evidence of price distortions in the steel market\nin the PRC, due to State interference, were collected. This constituted also\none of the reasons which led to the ex-officio initiation of the current\nreview and indeed was confirmed in the current investigation (see recital (20)\nabove). \n(29)          \nNext, Noblelift reiterated its comments\nconcerning non-material impact of loan guarantees or negligible impact of state\nbenefits. In this respect, it is noted that the prescription of Article 2(7)(c)\nof the basic Regulation is clear and does not refer to material impact on\nfinancial results (\u201cfirms have one set of basic accounting records which are\nindependently audited in line with international accounting standards and are\napplied for all purposes\u201d). In any case, as stated above in recital (21), the\nnon-disclosure of significant commitments such as the loan guarantees in\nquestion does not allow a proper assessment of the company\u2019s operations and in particular\nthe risks and opportunities the company is facing. As far as state benefits are\nconcerned, the Commission has already replied to the party in the course of the\ninvestigation that those benefits represented amounts exceeding 10 million RMB.\nThe claims could not be thus accepted.\n(30)         \nFinally, Noblelift argued that the investigation\nshould have been terminated due to violation of the 3-month deadline for the\nMET determination as specified in Article 2 (7)(c) the basic Regulation. In\nthis respect, reference is made to amendment introduced by the Regulation (EU)\nNo 1168/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012\namending Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on protection against dumped\nimports from countries not members of the European Community and retroactive\neffects thereof.[9]\nFurther, it is noted that the MET determination was made more than 3 months\nafter the beginning of the investigation due to the procedural aspects and time\nconstraints of the investigation. Indeed, the increased complexity of issues\nraised in the context of MET assessments has shown that the 3-month deadline\nwas virtually impossible to adhere to. It is noted however that the timing of\nthe determination did not have an impact on the outcome. \n(31)          \nConsequently, it is concluded that the comments\nsuggesting that MET should be granted are not justified.\n(32)          \nIn view of the above and pursuant to Article\n2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, it is determined not to grant MET to\nNoblelift.\n(b) Normal value \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analogue country\n(33)          \nAccording to Article 2(7)(a) of the basic\nRegulation, for non-market economy countries and, to the extent that MET could\nnot be granted, for countries in transition, normal value has to be established\non the basis of the price or constructed value in an analogue country.\n(34)          \nIn the original investigation, Canada served as\nan analogue country for the purposes of establishing a normal value. Given that\nproduction in Canada had ceased, Brazil was envisaged as an analogue country in\nthe Notice of initiation of the present review.\n(35)          \nTwo exporting producers and an importer objected\nto the proposal to use Brazil as an analogue country. The arguments against the\nchoice of Brazil were that there was a low degree of competition on the\nBrazilian market for hand pallet trucks due to the very small number of\ndomestic producers and, thus, sales prices, profits as well as production costs\nin Brazil are inflated. The exporting producers in question suggested India,\nMalaysia or Taiwan as appropriate analogue countries.\n(36)          \nFollowing these comments, the Commission\ncontacted 38 Indian, three Taiwanese, two Malaysian and two Brazilian known\nproducers of hand pallet trucks by sending them the relevant questionnaire.\nCooperation could be obtained from only one producer in Brazil: Paletrans Equipamentos\nLtda, Cravinhos, Sao Paulo ('Paletrans').\n(37)          \nFollowing the disclosure of the final findings\nand the Commission\u2019s proposal, parties reitrated their comments that Brazil was not an appropriate choice of analogue country due to the\nlack of competition on the Brazilian market. Parties alleged that the\ncooperating analogue country producer enjoyed a monopolistic position on the\nBrazilian market reinforced by high import duties. Other comments related to\ndeficiencies in the non-confidential questionnaire reply of the analogue\ncountry producer. Finally, it was claimed that adjustments should be made to\naccount for differences between analogue country producer and the exporting\nproducer in the country concerned.\n(38)          \nAs concerns the suitability of Brazil as an analogue\ncountry, it has to be pointed out that while the analogue country producer is\nthe main producer on the Brazilian market, it does not monopolise that market. There\nis competition with at least two local producers and a significant level of\nimports, and the profit margin of the analogue country producer has been found\nto be consistent with an open market.\n(39)          \nAs stated in recital (36) above following\ncomments at the early stage of the proceeding against the use of Brazil as an\nanalogue country, the Commission contacted 45 producers in four different\ncountries, including the companies suggested by Noblelift. Despite repeated\ncontacts by telephone and e-mail with these companies, only one producer from\nBrazil submitted the requested information and cooperated with the\ninvestigation. \n(40)          \nWith regard to the alleged deficiencies it has\nto be noted that only one producer in the analogue\ncountry cooperated with the investigation. Such situation is not uncommon but\nposes difficulties with regard to disclosure of data. Given frequent\ndifficulties in obtaining cooperation from analogue country producers, the\nCommission has to guarantee spot-on protection of confidential information. In\nthe current case presentation of non-confidential data created some\nmisunderstandings concerning alleged deficiencies but they were clarified with\nparties. In particular, one party claimed that deficiencies in the reply of the\nanalogue country producer should disqualify Brazil as an analogue country and\nthe investigation should be terminated since the Commission cannot establish\nthe normal value. In this respect it is noted that in the current investigation\nthe Commission did have all the necessary information to perform a dumping\ncalculation. \n(41)          \nConsequently, the claims concerning the\nsuitability of Brazil as an analogue country could not be accepted. \n(42)          \nWith regard to the claims for adjustments, it is\nnoted that the level of trade differences between the Brazilian producer and\nthe Chinese exporting producer has been accounted for by means of a level of\ntrade adjustment (see recital (59) below).\n(43)          \nFinally, one party claimed that an adjustment\nshould be made to account for an allegedly distorting effect of the 14% import\nduty in the analogue country. This claim cannot be accepted as no link can be\nestablished between an import duty as such and the price level on the domestic\nmarket. \n(44)          \nConsequently, Brazil is considered an\nappropriate analogue country since there is sufficient competition with at\nleast two producers and a significant level of imports.\nDetermination of normal value\n(45)          \nIn accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic\nRegulation, the Commission first examined whether Paletrans's domestic sales of\nthe like product to independent customers were representative. In this respect,\nit was found that the total volume of such sales was equal to at least 5% of\nthe total volume of Noblelift's export sales to the Union.\n(46)          \nThe Commission subsequently examined whether\nthere are types of the like product sold domestically by Paletrans that were\nsufficiently comparable in terms of functions and materials used to the types\nsold by Noblelift for export to the Union. The investigation established that a number of types sold domestically\nby Paletrans were sufficiently comparable with the types exported by Noblelift\nto the Union.\n(47)          \nThe Commission subsequently examined for the\nanalogue country producer whether each comparable type of the like product sold\ndomestically could be considered as being sold in the ordinary course of trade.\nThis was done by establishing for each product type the proportion of\nprofitable sales to independent customers on the domestic market during the\nRIP.\n(48)          \nWhere the sales volume of a product type, sold\nat a net sales price equal to or above the calculated cost of production,\nrepresented more than 80% of the total sales volume of that type, and where the\nweighted average sales price of that type was equal to or higher than the cost\nof production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price. This was\nthe case for all comparable types and the normal value was calculated as a\nweighted average of the prices of all domestic sales of each comparable type\nmade during the RIP.\n(49)          \nFor non-comparable types the normal value could\nbe constructed in accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation by\nadding to the manufacturing cost, adjusted where necessary, a reasonable\npercentage for domestic selling, general and administrative expenses and a\nreasonable margin for domestic profit. The selling, general and administrative expenses and the profit were based on actual data pertaining to\nproduction and sales, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product, by\nthe producer in the analogue country. It should be noted that the price\nconstructed on that basis was subject to the adjustments described in recital (59), in particular to take account of the\ndifference in level of trade between export sales by Noblelift and the domestic\nsales of the analogue country producer.\n(50)          \nThe sole cooperating exporting producer claimed\nthat the Commission performed dumping calculations on the basis of \u201ctruncated\nPCNs\u201d and that no explanations were provided concerning the parameters used for\nconducting the comparison. \n(51)          \nAccording to Article 2(11) of the basic\nRegulation the dumping margin is normally established on the basis of a\ncomparison of a weighted average normal value with a weighted average of prices\nof all export transactions subject to the relevant provisions governing fair\ncomparison. \n(52)          \nWith regard to the fair comparison, it has to be\nnoted that the product control number is a tool used in the investigation in\norder to structure and organise the substantial amounts of very detailed data\nsubmitted by the companies. It is an aid to conduct a more detailed analysis of\ndifferent product characteristics within the category of the product concerned\nand the like product.\n(53)          \nThe Commission has collected information in\nrelation to a number of parameters (chassis material, chassis painted, lift\ncapacity, type of hydraulic system, working length, fork, width over forks,\nsteering wheel material, load wheel material, load wheel type, brake type) but\nin order to take into consideration all export transactions it was considered reasonable\nand it was found possible to base the comparison in this case on certain of\nthose parameters that constitute the most pertinent characteristics (chassis\nmaterial, chassis painted, steering wheel material, load wheel material, load\nwheel type).\n(54)          \nTherefore, the comparison was based on the most\npertinent characteristics in order to increase the matching and to ensure a\nfair comparison. It has to be stressed that the Commission did not disregard\nany information. However, it is not uncommon that certain parameters used in\nthe product control number have a lesser weight and that specific parameters\nmore than others form a better basis for fair comparison. No products have been\ndisregarded from the comparison on the basis of physical differences or for any\nother reasons, nor have any new product types been created. On the contrary,\nall sales were included in the comparison. While it was acknowledged that other\nparameters had some impact on prices, it was found more appropriate, that the\ncalculations should be based on the five most relevant parameters as this led\nto the highest level of matching.\n(55)          \nAs far as the procedural angle of the issue of\ncomparison is concerned, it has to be noted that the exporting producer was\nprovided with full opportunity to comment on the calculations performed in this\ncase. Full details of the calculations have been disclosed and re-disclosed. \n(56)          \nConsequently, the foregoing claims had to be\nrejected.\n(c) Export price\n\n(57)          \nAll export sales to the Union of the Chinese\nexporting producer were made directly to independent customers in the Union.\nTherefore, the export price was established on the basis of the prices actually\npaid or payable for the product concerned in accordance with Article 2(8) of\nthe basic Regulation.\n(58)          \nOne party claimed that the export sales of chassis and hydraulics should have been included in\nthe calculation. This claim has been accepted.\n(d) Comparison \n(59)          \nThe comparison between the weighted average\nnormal value and the weighted average export price was made on an ex-works\nbasis and at the same level of trade. In order to ensure a fair comparison\nbetween normal value and the export price, account was taken, in accordance\nwith Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, of differences in factors which\naffected prices and price comparability. For this purpose, due allowance in the\nform of adjustments was made, where applicable and justified, for differences\nin level of trade (estimated price difference for sales to different type of\ncustomers in the domestic market of the analogue country), transport (comprising\ninland freight cost in the exporting country and ocean freight for\ntransportation to the Union), insurance (ocean insurance cost), handling,\nloading and ancillary costs, commissions (paid for export sales), bank charges (paid\nfor export sales), credit costs (based on the agreed payment terms and the\nprevaling interest rate) and packing costs (cost of packing materials used). \n(60)          \nFollowing a claim from the sole cooperating\nexporting producer, an adjustment for the differences\nin thickness of steel used by the producer in the analogue country and the exporting\nproducer in the country concerned was made to the normal value as it was found\nreasonable. The adjustment was based on the difference in thickness in\nproportion to the contribution of steel to the price of the like product sold\nin Brazil by the analogue country producer. This led to a change in the dumping\nmargin (see recital (73) below). Following an\nadditional disclosure (inviting comments on the steel thickness adjustment),\none party contested that adjustment as lacking factual basis. It also pointed out\nthat the exporting producer\u2019s non-confidential submissions seeking the\nadjustment were deficient thereby violating other parties\u2019 rights of defence.\nThe Commission verified the data on file on which the steel thickness\nadjustment was based and confirmed that it was warranted.\n(61)          \nThe sole cooperating exporter presented claims\nfor several other adjustments due to differences in efficiency and productivity,\nclaiming inter alia that the producer in the analogue country was less\nproductive (has a lower output per worker) and had higher consumption of raw\nmaterials per unit.\n(62)          \nIt has to be noted at the outset that while\ndifferences in efficiency or productivity might exist between companies, the\nguiding principle is to ensure comparability between export prices and normal\nvalue, which does not require that the circumstances of an analogue country\nproducer and an exporting producer in a non-market economy country are\ncompletely aligned. Indeed, only differences for factors affecting prices and\nprice comparability between an analogue country producer and an exporting\nproducer in a non-market economy country warrant an adjustment.\n(63)          \nNevertheless, it is to be pointed that the\ninvestigation did not reveal any circumstances which would suggest that the\nproducer in the analogue country did not have a reasonably efficient production\nprocess. \n(64)          \nAs far as cost factors are concerned (e.g.\nproductivity), those should not be picked and assessed individually. Rather, a\ncomprehensive analysis would be needed to assess whether advantages in relation\nto one cost factor (e.g. productivity) are possibly compensated by\ndisadvantages in others. Indeed, a lower use of labour is often the result of a\nhigher level of automation, which in turn leads to higher costs in other areas\n(depreciation, capital, financing, manufacturing overheads). Only a\ncomprehensive analysis could reveal all differences in cost factors and\ndemonstrate whether prices and price comparability are affected, thereby\njustifying an adjustment. The claims cannot therefore be accepted.\n(65)          \nIn addition to the foregoing, the claims for\nadjustment for a per unit energy difference and for a per unit depreciation and\nmanufacturing overheads difference were unsubstantiated. In particular, in\nrelation to energy efficiency it was not explained what elements in the\nproduction process make the Brazilian producer inefficient as compared to the\nsole cooperating exporting producer. The amount of the adjustment was based on\na ratio of labour cost difference per unit (based on productivity difference)\nrelated to the share of labour cost in total cost. The link between such ratio\nand energy efficiency and depreciation and manufacturing overheads difference\nhad not been explained and was not understandable. The claims are thus\nrejected. \n(66)          \nOne party also claimed that adjustments should\nbe made for parameters inter alia such as lift capacity and fork. In this\nrespect, reference is made to comments concerning the parameters of comparison (see\nrecital (50) above) where it is noted that a comparison is based on the most\nrelevant parameters to ensure the highest level of matching. In any case the\nclaims were not substantiated.\n(67)          \nAnother claim was that adjustment should be made\ndue to the fact that the exporting producer uses patented technology. This\nclaim has not been further substantiated. Notably, the exporting producer\nfailed to quantify the adjustment. The only piece of information provided was a\ndocument which was stated to be the patent. In a later submission the\nadjustment was partially quantified but without any supporting evidence. Therefore,\nthe claim could not be accepted.\n(68)          \nFurthermore, the claim for adjustment for\ndifference in efficiency in use of raw materials has been covered by the\nadjustment for thickness of steel (see recital (60) above), as the use of\ndifferent steel thickness might lead to a lower overall consumption of steel.\n(69)          \nFinally, the exporting producer stated that it\nsold via a different sales channel, in particular non-branded products on an\nOEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) basis, than the producer in the analogue\ncountry. Accordingly, a claim for an adjustment reflecting this difference was\nput forward. As specified above (recital (59) a level of trade adjustment was\nmade. It was based on an estimated price difference for sales to different\ntypes of customers, including OEM sales, in the domestic market of the analogue\ncountry. For confidentiality reasons the extent of this adjustment could not be\ndisclosed as it would reveal the normal value based on data of the sole\nanalogue country producer. It was therefore concluded that the differences for\nwhich the adjustment was claimed have been already accounted for.\n(70)          \nNevertheless, it has to be pointed out that the\nexporting producer failed to quantify the adjustment claimed. It stated merely\nthat a 40% adjustment had been granted in another proceeding. An adjustment\ngranted in another proceeding (hence specific to the particular circumstances\nof another proceeding) cannot serve as such as a benchmark for quantifying an\nadjustment in the current case.\n(71)          \nFollowing the additional disclosure (inviting\ncomments on the steel thickness adjustment), the exporting producer presented\nadditional claims for adjustments (unrelated to the steel thickness\nadjustment): adjustment for coating, handle, and steel prices in Brazil.\n(72)          \nIt is noted first and foremost that the claims\nwere submitted after the deadline for comments and were thus formally\ninadmissible. In any case the claims were either not quantified or not\nsubstantiated. The company neither provided evidence for its claims nor did it\nexplain how the extent of different adjustments had been or should be\ncalculated. \n(e) Dumping margin \n(73)          \nAs provided for under Article 2(11) of the basic\nRegulation, the weighted average normal value by type was compared with the\nweighted average export price of the product concerned. The dumping margin,\nexpressed as a percentage of the CIF Union frontier price, duty unpaid, is 70,8%. \n(74)          \nAs regards the dumping margins for all other\nthan Noblelift exporting producers in the original investigation, they ranged from 28,5% to 46,7%. Given that in the current review only Noblelift\ncooperated and that the cooperation could be considered high since the vast\nmajority of Chinese exports were those of Noblelift, the Commission revised the\ncountry-wide dumping margin for all other exporters as well. Consequently, the\nresidual dumping margin should be set at the same level as that of Noblelift,\ni.e. 70,8%.\n(75)          \nOne party claimed that the country-wide duty\nshould not be set at the level of the sole cooperating exporting producer\u2019s\ndumping margin as there is no evidence that the vast majority of imports were\nthose of that sole cooperating exporter. In this respect, it has been confirmed\nthat according to statistical data the vast majority of imports from the PRC\nwere those of the sole cooperating exporting producer. The claim has been\ntherefore rejected.\nD.\nLASTING NATURE OF CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES\n(76)          \nIn accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic\nRegulation, it was also examined whether the changed circumstances could reasonably\nbe considered to be of a lasting nature. \n(77)          \nIn this regard the original\ninvestigation did not establish a substantial price difference between prices\nof raw materials procured locally in the PRC by the Chinese exporting producers\n(including Noblelift) and those at international markets. The circumstances\nhave significantly changed between 2004 (time of the original investigation)\nand 2011 (the RIP) where the price of hot-rolled steel, the main raw material,\nstood between 24% and 31% below international prices. They did not reflect\nmarket values as a result of price distortions in the steel market in the PRC\n(see recital (20) above). Indeed, the Chinese steel market changed\nsignificantly within these seven years and the PRC has shifted in the meantime\nfrom a net steel importing country to a sizeable steel producer and exporter\nworldwide, which fact could reasonably be considered to be of a lasting nature.\n(78)          \nIn addition, Chinese high-tech enterprises\nincluding Noblelift are receiving State benefits in the form of preferential\nincome tax (15%) since 2008. In the investigation period of the original\ninvestigation, the companies were subject to the standard rate of 25%. This\nchanged circumstance could also reasonably be considered to be of a lasting\nnature.\n(79)          \nIt was therefore considered that the\ncircumstances that led to the initiation of this interim review are unlikely to\nchange in the foreseeable future in a manner that would affect the findings of\nthe interim review. Therefore it was concluded that the changed circumstances\nare of a lasting nature and that the application of the measure at its current\nlevel is no longer justified.\nE.\nANTI-DUMPING MEASURES\n(80)          \nIn light of the results of this review\ninvestigation and since the new dumping margin of 70,8% is lower than the\ninjury elimination level established in the original investigation (see\nrecitals (120) to (123) of Regulation (EC) No 128/2005[10]), it is considered appropriate\nto amend the anti-dumping duty applicable to imports of the product concerned\nboth from Zhejiang Noblelift Equipment Joint Stock Co. Ltd and from all other\nexporting producers to 70,8%.\n(81)          \nOne party claimed that the newly established\ndumping margin should not have been compared with the injury elimination level\nestablished in the original investigation. Rather, an injury elimination level should\nbe established in every investigation, even in a partial review limited to\ndumping. According to this party, the current practice whereby injury is not\nassessed, constitutes a breach of the lesser duty rule. The party also claimed\nthat a full interim review should have been opened.\n(82)          \nIn this respect it is noted that since the\nCommission initiated a partial interim review limited to dumping, injury could\nnot be re-assessed in this framework. According to Article 11(3) of the basic\nRegulation the continued imposition of measures may be reviewed, where\nwarranted, on the initiative of the Commission. Hence, there is no obligation\nfor the Commission to initiate an ex-officio interim review covering\nboth dumping and injury, and in any event it should be warranted. In this case,\nthe information and evidence at the Commission\u2019s disposal was sufficient for\nthe initiation of an interim review limited to dumping. Moreover, if injury is\nalways to be assessed in interim reviews the possibility of having a partial\ninterim review limited to dumping as provided for in Article 11(3) of the basic\nRegulation would be devoid of meaning. The claim has to be therefore rejected. Nevertheless\nit is recalled that the interested party in question has the possibility to\nrequest a partial review of injury pursuant to Article 11 (3) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(83)          \nThe lesser duty rule has been fully respected and\nthe newly established dumping margin was indeed compared with the injury\nelimination level established in the original investigation (the latest injury\nfinding).\n(84)          \nOne party claimed that a minimum import price\nwould be better suited in the current case. Alternatively, a fixed duty should\nbe imposed.\n(85)          \nIn this respect it is noted that neither the minimum import price nor the fixed duty are suitable for\nproducts which exists in a multitude of individual types with varying prices,\nwhich are also subject to continuous changes and upgrades. A multitude of duty\nlevels would be very difficult to administer. An additional limitation of the\ncurrent case is that the minimum import price would have to be based on the\nnormal value (since the duty is based on dumping), which is based on\nconfidential data of one company in an analogue country market. The claims are\nthus rejected.\n(86)          \nThe exporting producer expressed interest in an\nundertaking within the statutory deadlines. However, no formal offer was\nsubmitted and thus the Commission was not in a position to consider it further.\n\n(87)          \nInterested parties were informed of the\nessential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to\namend the duty rates applicable to exporting producers and were given the\nopportunity to comment.\n(88)          \nThe oral and written comments submitted by the\nparties were considered.\n(89)          \nIt is noted that pursuant to Article 1(3) of\nCouncil Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1008/2011, the 70,8% anti-dumping duty\nimposed to \"all other companies\" by this Regulation applies to hand\npallet trucks and their essential parts, as defined in Article 1(1) of Council\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 1008/2011, consigned from Thailand whether\ndeclared as originating in Thailand or not,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nArticle 1(2) of Council Implementing Regulation\n(EU) No 1008/2011, shall be replaced by the following: \n\"2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rate of the definitive\nanti-dumping duty applicable to the net free-at-Union-frontier price, before\nduty, for the products described in paragraph 1 and produced by the companies listed\nbellow shall be as follows:\n Company || Rate of duty (%) || TARIC additional code \n Zhejiang Noblelift Equipment Joint Stock Co.
