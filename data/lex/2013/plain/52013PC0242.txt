Combined with a weaker global environment, the\npolitical transition of Jordan has taken a heavy toll on external receipts and\nhas strained public finances. Lower tourism and FDI inflows, higher\ninternational energy prices and the repeated disruptions to the flow of natural\ngas from Egypt, which forced Jordan to replace gas imports from Egypt with more expensive fuels for electricity generation, have put a drag on growth and\nhave resulted in a marked deterioration in the balance of payments and fiscal\nposition. Jordan has also been affected by the intensification of the Syria crisis, notably through the inflow of refugees and its fiscal implications. While Jordan has so far managed to date to maintain macroeconomic stability, including through\nsubstantial fiscal consolidation efforts and financial support from foreign\ndonors, there are significant balance of payments and financing needs. \nUnder the\npressure of a sharp drop of international reserves in the first half of 2012, the\nJordanian authorities have agreed on a USD 2 bn (800% of quota),\n36-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF, approved in August\n2012. \nIn view of the\nworsening economic situation and outlook, the Jordanian government requested\nMacro-Financial Assistance (MFA) from the EU in the amount of EUR\n200 mn in December 2012. The Commission intends to submit to the European\nParliament and the Council a proposal for MFA to the benefit of the Hashemite\nKingdom of Jordan amounting to a maximum of EUR 180 mn in the form of a medium\nterm loan. The proposed legal base is Article 212 of the TFEU. \nThe EU's MFA\nwould contribute towards covering Jordan's residual external financing needs in\n2013 and 2014, in the context of the IMF programme. The MFA would help Jordan address the lingering economic consequences of the Arab Spring and the external\nshocks of its energy sector. It would reduce the economy's short-term\nbalance of payments and fiscal vulnerabilities, while supporting the adjustment\nand reform programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank, as well as the\nreforms agreed under the EU's budgetary support operations (including the Good\nGovernance and Development Contract operation of EUR 40 mn financed by\nthe Support for Partnership Reform and Inclusive Growth\n(SPRING) programme).\nThe proposed assistance would promote\npolicy measures to improve public financial management and tax reform while\nstrengthening the social safety net (including through a better targeting of\nthe cash transfers system put in place last November to compensate households\nfor the reform of the energy subsidy system); measures to improve the\nregulatory framework and climate for investment; and reforms to reduce\nunemployment and encourage participation in the labour market, notably among\nwomen. \nThe proposed\nMFA is consistent with the political and financial pledges made by the EU to\nthe Jordanian authorities at the EU-Jordan Task Force meeting in February 2012.\nIt is also in line with the aims of the new partnership for the South Mediterranean region proposed at the G8 Deauville summit and the orientations of the\nnew European Neighbourhood Policy. In the same vein, it would signal to the\nother countries in the region that the EU is ready to support countries like Jordan, embarking on political reforms, in moments of economic difficulties.\nIn this\ncontext, the Commission considers that the political and economic\npre-conditions for a MFA operation of the proposed amount and nature are\nsatisfied.\n\u00b7      General context\nJordan has faced worsening economic conditions since 2011 due to the\nregional and political turmoil associated with the Arab Spring and the weaker\nregional and global economic environment. These\ncircumstances negatively affected two of the main external drivers of economic\ngrowth, namely tourism receipts and foreign direct investment (FDI). In\naddition, the frequent interruption of gas supplies from Egypt has forced the government to replace gas with more expensive oil imports, which has\nincreased the import bill significantly[1].\nThese adverse external shocks have contributed to create large fiscal and\nexternal imbalances. \nIn this\ncontext, and following a period of robust economic growth averaging 6.5% during\n2000-2009, partly reflecting a propitious external environment, GDP growth dropped sharply to 2.6% in 2011. GDP growth picked up\nmoderately to 2.9% in the first half of 2012, following\na recovery of tourism receipts and despite the weak performance of the mining\nand construction sectors. In 2013, GDP growth is projected to be supported by increased FDIs in the energy and banking sectors but remain relatively low (at about 3%).\nConsumer price inflation increased moderately in the course of 2012, reaching an average of\n4.8%, compared to 4.5% in 2011, as the impact of domestic fuel and electricity\ntariff increases was partially offset by that of weaker domestic demand.\nInflation is expected to rise further to 6.1% on average in 2013, partly as a\nresult of the foreseen energy price adjustments. Since mid-2011, monetary\npolicy has been tightened in order to preserve the attractiveness of\nJOD-denominated assets. The current fixed exchange rate\npolicy (peg to the USD) has helped anchor inflation expectations.\nThe external position has worsened markedly\nsince the beginning of 2011 due to the aforementioned shocks. The current account deficit (including grants) reached 12% of GDP in\n2011 (19% of GDP excluding grants), up from 7.1% of GDP in 2010 (11.3% of GDP\nexcluding grants), partly due to a 16.6% increase in the import bill. By the\nend of 2012, it had widened further to 17% of GDP (20.6% of GDP excluding grants), despite a 15.3% increase in tourism receipts (broadly attributed to tourist\nflows from Arab countries) and a 3.5% increase of\nremittances. The projection is, however, that the current account deficit\nexcluding grants will narrow down to 12.1% in 2013 in view of stronger export\ngrowth and a gradual normalisation of gas supplies from Egypt. The shortfall in FDI in 2011-2012 further deteriorated the\nexternal position. Financing needs for 2011-12 were largely met through foreign\nassistance, in particular form the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, and the mobilisation of international reserves,\nwhich fell by 14% (to USD 10.7 billion) in 2011 and more dramatically\nthroughout 2012, to reach USD 5.2 billion (just above 3\nmonths of imports) by the end of the year.\nPublic finances have been under strain due\nto the social expenditure packages adopted in 2011, the budgetary impact of the\nincrease in energy import prices and the economic slowdown. The budget deficit\nexcluding grants increased from 7.7% of GDP in 2010 to 11.7% in 2011, while\npublic debt had risen to 70.7% of GDP by end-2011 (from 67.1% of GDP at\nend-2010). Although the 2012\nbudget adopted in February envisaged a large fiscal adjustment compared to\n2011, by mid-year it had become clear that this could no longer be possible,\nreflecting much higher than assumed fuel subsidies, a higher wage bill due to\nthe reform of the civil service, higher pension and health outlays, and\nspending on housing and medical assistance for Syrian refugees[2]. To\nmitigate debt sustainability and possible shortfalls in external flows, the\ngovernment decided in May 2012 to take additional fiscal measures, amounting to\n3.4% of GDP. The aim was to lower the overall deficit\nin 2012 by approximately 1.5 percentage points of GDP (to 10.7% of GDP,\nexcluding grants). \nOn the expenditure\nside, fiscal consolidation measures (amounting to 2.9% of GDP) included: the\nremoval of subsidies on gasoline octane 95, jet fuel and heavy fuel oil; a 13%\ndecrease in the subsidy for gasoline octane 90; a 6% increase in the price of\ndiesel; as well cuts in capital spending and current expenditure. On the revenue side, the consolidation effort amounted to 0.4% of\nGDP and included, inter alia, the introduction of a\nsales tax on cellular phones and air conditions; the increase in the taxes on\ncars, air tickets and alcoholic and tobacco products; and the removal of\ncertain tax exemptions. \nIn early September\n2012, the government took the decision to introduce a 6% tax on diesel and to\nremove subsidies from gasoline octane 90. However, this decision, which is a\nstructural benchmark of the IMF programme, was initially suspended by the King.\nThe liberalization of gasoline octane 90 finally took place in mid-November\n(together with the lifting of subsidies on diesel, kerosene, and household gas\nprices), in full alignment with the price adjustment structural benchmark set\nby the IMF program. Although these measures led to serious social protests in\nmid-November, the government maintained the fuel price adjustments. \nAs underlined at the Joint Dialogue on\nEconomic Reforms conducted by the Commission with the Jordanian authorities\nlast October, Jordan has made significant progress in a number of key reform\nareas. This includes the adjustment of energy prices, plans to diversify the\nenergy supply, measures to raise women's participation in the labour force,\nschemes to support SMEs access to finance, and the submission to parliament of\nlegislative proposals on income taxation, PPPs and social security reform. However,\nsubstantial structural reform challenges have yet to be addressed. Moreover,\nmany legislative proposals remain stuck in parliament and the dissolution of\nthe parliament and organisation of parliamentary elections held at end-January\n2013 further delayed their adoption. \nOn 3 August 2012, the IMF Board approved,\nas noted, a USD 2 bn (800% of quota) 36-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) for Jordan. The programme is relatively frontloaded, with 300% of quota (out of the total of\n800%) paid out in the first two tranches (the second tranche is to be disbursed\nupon completion of the first programme review). The program envisages a package\nof measures aimed at strengthening growth while reducing vulnerability to\nexogenous shocks, notably by reforming the energy subsidies system, bringing\nNEPCO back to cost recovery and promoting energy supply diversification. The\nprogram further foresees consolidating the fiscal sector through an effective\nrationalization of the tax system, improved tax administration and cuts in\nexpenditure. For 2013, substantial additional fiscal adjustment measures are\nplanned, including increases in diesel and kerosene prices, reductions in tax\nexemptions and, possibly, increases in excise taxes, with the aim of cutting\nthe fiscal deficit excluding grants to 9.3% of GDP for that year (5.5%\nincluding grants). \nBased on the latest available IMF\nprojections, the external financing gap for the IMF programme period\n(2013-2015) is estimated at USD 5.9 billion, essentially reflecting a sizeable\n(although declining overtime) current account deficit and the need to rebuild\nofficial foreign exchange reserves With reserves already at a critically low\nlevel at the end of 2012 (just above the minimum benchmark of 3 months of\nimports, as noted), and Jordan's balance of payments remaining very vulnerable\nto external shocks, notably further disruptions in gas supplies from Egypt and\npolitical developments in the region, the IMF programme aims at a considerable\nreplenishment of official reserves. Net of disbursements under the SBA and the\nWorld Bank's Development Policy Loan (DPL), Jordan faces a residual external\nfinancing gap of USD 4.1 billion over these three years to be covered by other\ndonors (GCC countries, US, EU, France, and Japan). The proposed MFA from the EU would correspond to about 4.4% of the\nresidual external financing gap.\n\u00b7      Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\nNone\n\u00b7      Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union\nThe EU has for long had an interest to\nengage with Jordan, acknowledging Jordan's stabilizing role in the region as well as its mutual economic and\nfinancial links. The contractual relations between the\nEU and Jordan are framed by the Association Agreement in\nMay 2002, which liberalizes trade between the two parties and foresees the\nstrengthening of our bilateral political dialogue and economic cooperation.\nBilateral relations have been further reinforced under the EU's European\nNeighbourhood Policy (ENP), including through the adoption of a five-year ENP\nAction Plan in 2005, replaced by a new 5-year Action Plan in 2010, which\nidentifies key reform measures in both the political and economic spheres and\npromotes Jordan's regulatory convergence with the EU. Moreover, Jordan is the first Mediterranean partner country with whom the EU has concluded technical\nnegotiations leading to an \"Advanced Status\". It is also a member of\nthe Union for the Mediterranean. Economic ties with the EU are also important. In 2011, the EU was Jordan's first source of imports (20.1%),\nalthough it was only the seventh destination of Jordan's exports. And the EU has offered to Jordan, as noted, the negotiation of DCFTA with\nthe goal to increase Jordan's integration into the EU single market. \nIn sum, while Jordan's road to full\ndemocracy is not without difficulties and significant uncertainties remain, the\ncountry has taken significant steps towards political and\neconomic reform and there is also a strong framework of\nbilateral relations between the EU and Jordan.\nSince the Arab Spring began, the EU has\ndeclared on various occasions its commitment to support Jordan in its economic and political reform process. Indeed, the EU\u2019s commitment to support\n Jordan\u2019s political and economic reform was the main message of the first\nEU-Jordan Task Force held in Amman in February 2012. \nThe MFA proposal is consistent with the\nEU's commitment to support Jordan's economic and political transition. It is\nalso consistent with the guidelines for the MFA, as provided by the Council\nconclusions of 2002 on MFA and the accompanying letter of the Council President\nto the Commission President. In particular, and as explained in more detail in\nthe Staff Working Document accompanying the Commission's proposal, the proposal\nis consistent with the following principles: exceptional character, political\npreconditions, complementarity, conditionality and financial discipline. \nThe Commission will continue to monitor and\nassess during the life of the MFA operation satisfaction of these criteria,\nincluding the assessment, in close liaison with the European External Action\nService, of the political preconditions.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u00b7      Consultation of interested parties\nMFA is provided as an integral part of the\ninternational support to the economic stabilisation and recovery programme of Jordan. In the preparation of this proposal for MFA, the Commission services have consulted\nwith the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which have already put\nin place sizeable financing programs. The Commission consulted the EU Member\nStates in the Economic and Financial Committee before submitting its proposal\nfor MFA. The Commission has also been in regular contact with the Jordanian\nauthorities.\n\u00b7      Collection and use of expertise\nAn Operational Assessment verifying the\nquality and reliability of Jordan's public financial circuits and\nadministrative procedures will be carried out by the Commission with the\nassistance of external experts.\n\u00b7      Impact assessment\nThe MFA and the economic adjustment and\nreform programme attached to it will help alleviate Jordan's short-term\nfinancing needs while supporting policy measures aimed at strengthening\nmedium-term balance of payments and fiscal sustainability and raising\nsustainable growth, as agreed with the IMF. It will notably help improve the\nefficiency and transparency of public finance management; promote fiscal\nreforms to increase tax collections and improve the progressivity of the tax\nsystem; support existing efforts to strengthen the social safety net; promote\nlabour market reforms (to reduce unemployment and raise participation rates,\nnotably among women); and facilitate the adoption of measures to improve the\nregulatory framework for trade and investment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7      Summary of the proposed action\nThe European Union shall make MFA available\nto Jordan for a total maximum amount of EUR 180 million, provided in the form\nof a medium term loan. The assistance will contribute to cover Jordan's residual external financing needs in 2013-14, as identified by the Commission\nbased on the estimates of the IMF. \nThe assistance is planned to be disbursed\nin two loan instalments and to allow some frontloading given the urgency of the\nfinancing needs. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take\nplace in the second half of 2013. The second instalment, conditional on a\nnumber of policy measures, could be disbursed in the first half of 2014. The\nassistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the\nprevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial\nRegulation, are applicable. \nAs usual with the MFA instrument, the\ndisbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the\nIMF's financial arrangement (the SBA). In addition, the Commission and the\nJordanian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a\nMemorandum of Understanding. The Commission will target structural reforms\naimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for\nsustainable growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and efficiency of public\nfinance management; fiscal reforms; reforms to strengthen the social safety\nnet; labour market reforms; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for\ntrade and investment).\nThe decision to disburse the full MFA in the form of loans is\njustified by Jordan's level of development (as measured by its per-capita\nincome) and debt indicators. It is also consistent with the treatment given to Jordan by the World Bank and the IMF. Indeed, Jordan is not eligible for concessional financing from\neither the IDA or the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust fund.\n\u00b7      Legal basis\nThe\nlegal basis for this proposal is Article 212 of the TFEU. \n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the mixed\ncompetence of the EU. The subsidiarity principle applies to the extent that the\nobjectives of restoring short-term macroeconomic stability in Jordan cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone and can therefore be\nbetter achieved by the European Union. The main reasons are the budgetary\nconstraints faced at the national level and the need for strong donor\ncoordination in order to maximise the scale and effectivenes of the assistance.\n\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle: it confines itself to the minimum required in order\nto achieve the objectives of short-term macro economic stability and does not\ngo beyond what is necessary for that purpose. \nAs identified by the Commission based on\nthe estimates of the IMF in the context of the SBA Arrangement, the amount of\nthe assistance corresponds to 4.4% of the residual financing gap for the period\n2013-2015. This is consistent with standard rules on burden-sharing for MFA\noperations. Given the assistance pledged to Jordan by other bilateral and\nmultilateral donors and creditors, it is deemed an appropriate level of\nburden-sharing for the EU.\n\u00b7      Choice of instruments\nOther instruments would not be adequate\nbecause, in the absence of a framework regulation for Macro-Financial\nAssistance, ad hoc European Parliament and Council decisions under Article 212\nTFEU are the only available legal instrument for this assistance.\nProject finance or technical assistance\nwould not be suitable or sufficient to address these macroeconomic objectives.\nThe key value added of the MFA in comparison to other EU instruments would be\nto alleviate the external financial constraint and to help create a stable\nmacroeconomic framework, including by promoting a sustainable balance of\npayments and budgetary situation, and an appropriate framework for structural\nreforms. By helping to put in place an appropriate overall framework for macroeconomic\nand structural policies, MFA can increase the effectiveness of the actions\nfinanced in Jordan under other, more narrowly focused EU financial instruments.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe planned assistance would be\nprovided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing\noperation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary\ncosts of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%,\nof the amounts disbursed in the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU,\nfrom budget line 01 04 01 14 (\"the provisioning of the Guarantee\nFund\"). Assuming that the first loan disbursement will be made in 2013 for\nthe amount of EUR 100 million and the second loan disbursement in 2014 for the\namount of EUR 80 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee\nfund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2015-16 budgets.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n\u00b7      Review/revision/sunset clause\nThe proposal includes a sunset clause. The\nproposed MFA would be made available for two years, starting from the first day\nafter the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding.\n2013/0128 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nproviding macro-financial assistance to\nthe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\nTHE\nEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 212\nthereof,\nHaving regard to\nthe proposal from the European Commission[3],\n\nAfter transmission\nof the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nActing in\naccordance with the ordinary legislative procedure[4],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Relations between the European\nUnion ('the Union') and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ('Jordan') are\ndeveloping within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). An Association Agreement between\nthe European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Jordan, of the other part, entered into force in May 2002.\nBilateral political dialogue and economic cooperation have been further\ndeveloped within the framework of ENP Action Plans, of which the most recent\ncovers the period 2010-2015. In 2010, the Union granted Jordan ''Advanced Status\"\npartnership, implying expanded areas of\ncooperation between both parties.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jordan's economy has been\nsignificantly affected by domestic events related to the events in the Southern\nMediterranean since the end of 2010, known as the \"Arab Spring\", and by\nthe ongoing regional unrest, notably in neighbouring Egypt and Syria. Combined with a weaker global environment, the repeated disruptions to the flow of\nnatural gas from Egypt, which have forced Jordan to replace gas imports from Egypt with more expensive fuels for electricity generation, and the important inflow of refugees\nfrom Syria have resulted in important external and budgetary financial gaps.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the Arab Spring\nbegan, the Union has declared on various occasions its commitment to support Jordan in its economic and political reform process. This commitment was reaffirmed in the\nconclusions of the 10th meeting of the Association Council between the Union\nand Jordan in December 2012. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jordan has embarked on a\nseries of political reforms, most notably leading to the adoption by the\nJordanian Parliament in September 2011 of over 40 constitutional amendments,\nrepresenting a significant step towards a fully-fledged democratic system. Political\nand economic support from the Union to Jordan's reform process is consistent\nwith the Union's policy towards the Southern Mediterannean region, as set\nout in the context of the ENP.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In August 2012, the\nJordanian authorities and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nagreed on a three-year Stand-By-Arrangement of SDR 1,364\nmillion in support of Jordan's economic adjustment and reform programme. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nUnion has made available EUR 293 million in grants for the period 2011-13\nunder its regular cooperation programme in support of Jordan's political and economic reform\nagenda. In addition, EUR 70 million has been allocated to Jordan in 2012 under the \"Support for partnership, reforms and inclusive growth\" (SPRING)\nprogramme, and EUR 10 million in Union humanitarian aid to support Syrian\nrefugees.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In December 2012, Jordan requested macro-financial assistance from the Union in view of the worsening\neconomic situation and outlook.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that, after taking\ninto account macroeconomic support from the IMF and the World Bank, a residual\nfinancing gap remains in Jordan's balance of payments, and given the vulnerability\nof Jordan's external financial position to exogenous shocks, which requires\nmaintaining an appropriate level of the foreign exchange reserves, macro-financial\nassistance is considered an appropriate response to Jordan's request under the\ncurrent exceptional circumstances. The Union macro-financial\nassistance to Jordan (''the Union macro-financial\nassistance\") would support the economic\nstabilisation and the structural reform agenda of Jordan, supplementing resources made available under the IMF's financial arrangement.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union macro-financial\nassistance should not merely supplement programmes and resources from the IMF\nand the World Bank, but should also ensure the added value of Union's\ninvolvement. The Commission should ensure that the Union macro-financial\nassistance is legally and substantially in line with the measures taken within\nthe different areas of external action and other relevant Union policies.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The specific objectives of\nthe Union macro-financial assistance should be to strengthen\nefficiency, transparency and accountability of the public finance management\nsystems in Jordan and to promote structural reforms aimed\nat supporting sustainable and inclusive growth, employment creation and fiscal\nconsolidation. These objectives should be regularly monitored by the\nCommission.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The conditions underlying\nthe provision of the Union macro-financial assistance should reflect the key\nprinciples and objectives of the Union\u2019s policy towards Jordan. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\nefficient protection of the financial interests of the Union linked\nto this macro-financial assistance, it is necessary that Jordan adopt appropriate measures relating to the prevention of, and the fight against,\nfraud, corruption and any other irregularities in relation to the assistance.\nIt is also necessary to provide for appropriate controls by the Commission and appropriate\naudits by the European Court of Auditors.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The release of the Union\nmacro-financial assistance should be without\nprejudice to the powers of the budgetary authority. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The assistance should be\nmanaged by the Commission. In order to ensure that the European Parliament and\nthe Economic and Financial Committee are able to follow the implementation of this Decision, the\nCommission should regularly inform them of developments relating to the\nassistance and provide them with relevant documents.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should\nbe conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles\nconcerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise\nof implementing powers[5].\nThe fact that the assistance is of a substantial amount and, therefore, has a\npotentially important impact, justifies the use of the examination procedure,\nin line with Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union shall make\navailable to Jordan macro-financial\nassistance of a maximum amount of EUR 180\nmillion, with a view to supporting Jordan's economic stabilisation and reforms. The assistance shall contribute\nto covering Jordan's balance of payments needs as identified in the current IMF\nprogramme. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The full amount of the\nmacro-financial assistance shall be provided to Jordan in the form of loans.

The assistance,\nto be disbursed in two instalments, will help the country overcome the economic\nand social hardships endured as a result of the domestic and regional unrest.\nIt will also promote structural reforms aimed at raising sustainable economic\ngrowth and improving public finance management. \n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\nimpact \nThe authorities will be required to report on a\nset of indicators to the Commission services on a regular basis and provide a\ncomprehensive report on the compliance with the agreed policy conditions ahead\nof the disbursement of the second instalment of the assistance. \nThe Commission services will continue to\nmonitor public finance management, following the operational assessment of the\nfinancial circuits and administrative procedures in Jordan that will be carried\nout in preparation of this operation. The EU Delegation in Jordan will also provide regular reporting on issues relevant for the monitoring of the\nassistance. The Commission services will remain in close contact with the IMF\nand the World Bank to benefit from their insights from their on-going\nactivities in Jordan. \nAn annual report to the Council and European\nParliament is foreseen in the proposed legislative decision, comprising an\nassessment of the implementation of this operation. An independent ex-post\nevaluation of the assistance will be carried out within two years after the\nexpiry of the implementation period.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the proposal/initiative\n\n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term \nThe disbursement of the assistance will be\nconditional upon a satisfactory track record in the implementation of the\nStand-By Arrangement (SBA) between Jordan and the IMF. In addition, the\nCommission shall agree with the Jordanian authorities on specific policy\nconditions, listed in a Memorandum of Understanding, to be met before the\nsecond instalment is released by the Commission. \n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nBy helping the country overcome the economic\nshock caused by the domestic and regional unrest, the proposed MFA will\ncontribute to promoting macroeconomic stability, economic reforms and political\nprogress in the country. By complementing the resources made available by the\ninternational financial institutions, the EU and other donors, it will contribute\nto the overall effectiveness of the package of financial support agreed by the\ninternational donor community in the aftermath of the crisis. \nThe proposed programme will also strengthen the\ngovernment's reform commitment and its aspiration towards closer relations with\nthe EU. This result will be achieved, inter alia, through appropriate\nconditionality for the disbursement of the assistance. In a larger context, the\nprogramme will signal to the other countries in the region that the EU is ready\nto support countries embarking on a clear path towards political reforms in times\nof economic difficulties.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nSince 2004, a total of fifteen ex-post\nevaluations have been carried out on macro-financial assistance operations.\nThese evaluations conclude that MFA operations do contribute, albeit sometimes\nmodestly and indirectly, to the improvement of the external sustainability, the\nmacroeconomic stability and the achievement of structural reforms in the\nrecipient country. In most cases, MFA operations had a positive effect on the\nbalance of payments of the beneficiary country and helped to relax their\nbudgetary constraints. They also led to a somewhat higher economic growth.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nThe EU is among the major donors of Jordan. The EU has made available EUR 293 mn in grants for the\nperiod 2011-13 under its regular cooperation, in support of Jordan's political and economic reform agenda. In\naddition, EUR 70 mn has been allocated to Jordan in 2011 under the SPRING\nprogramme, and EUR 10 mn from Humanitarian Aid to support Syrian refugees.\nThe key value added of the MFA in comparison to\nother EU instruments would be to help create a stable macroeconomic framework,\nincluding by promoting a sustainable balance of payments and budgetary\nsituation, and an appropriate framework for structural reforms. MFA does not\nprovide a regular financial support nor is meant to support the economic and\nsocial development of the recipient countries. The MFA is to be discontinued as\nsoon as the country's external financial situation has been brought back into a\nsustainable path. Afterwards, regular EU cooperation assistance instruments are\nmeant to take over.\nMFA is also meant to be complementary to\ninterventions by the international financial institutions, in particular the\nadjustment and reform programme supported by the IMF's SBA and the Development\nPolicy Loan of the World Bank.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact \nX Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration \nX Proposal/initiative in effect for 2 years\nfrom the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding, as stated in\nArticle (1.4) of the Decision \nX Financial impact from 2013 to 2016 \n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged[9] \nX Centralised direct management by the\nCommission \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules \nThis assistance is of macroeconomic nature and\nits design is consistent with the IMF-supported economic programme. The\nmonitoring of the action by the Commission services will take place on the\nbasis of progress in the implementation of the SBA and specific reform measures\nto be agreed with the Jordanian authorities in a Memorandum of Understanding\n(see also point 1.4.4). \n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThere are fiduciary, policy and political risks\nrelated to the proposed MFA operation. \nThere is a risk that the macro-financial\nassistance, which is not dedicated to specific expenses, could be used in a\nfraudulent way. In general terms, this risk is related to factors such as the\nquality of management systems in the central bank and the ministry of finance and\nthe appropriatedness of internal and external audit capabilities. \nAnother key risk to the operation stems from\nthe regional economic and political uncertainty, notably in Syria, which has direct implications for the Jordanian economy. On the domestic front, the\nmain risk is instability related to difficulties in the political and economic\nreform process. The full implementation of the stabilisation and reform\nmeasures supported by the international community, including the proposed MFA\noperation, might be undermined by social dissatisfaction. \nJordan also remains\nvulnerable to possible new disruptions in the supply of imported natural gas\nfrom Egypt. Finally, there are risks stemming from a possible weakening of the\nEuropean and global economic environment and an increase in international\nenergy and food prices. \n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control method(s) envisaged\n\nThe macro-financial assistance will be liable\nto verification, control and auditing procedures under the responsibility of\nthe Commission, including the European Antifraud Office (OLAF), and by the\nEuropean Court of Auditors. \n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Costs and benefits of\ncontrols and probable non-compliance rate\nThe basic costs for the Commission related to\nthe methods of verification and control, as well as the cost of the Operational\nAssessment of financial and administrative circuits conducted prior to the\noperation, are described in Table 3.2.1. In addition, there are costs for the\nEuropean Court of Auditors and of possible interventions of the OLAF. The\nOperational Assessment not only helps assess risks of misuse of the funds but,\nas a collateral benefit, it provides useful information on the necessary\nreforms in the area of public finance management, which are reflected in the\npolicy conditionality of the operation. Regarding the probable non-compliance\nrate, the risk of non-compliance (in the form of non-repayment of the loan or misuse\nof the funds) is judged to be low, based on the experience with the MFA\ninstrument since its creation. \n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\nand irregularities \nTo mitigate the risks of fraudulent use several\nmeasures will be taken: \nFirst, the proposed legal basis for\nmacro-financial assistance to Jordan includes a provision on fraud prevention\nmeasures. These measures will be elaborated further in the Memorandum of Understanding\nand the Loan Agreement, envisaging a set of provisions on inspection, fraud\nprevention, audits, and recovery of funds in case of fraud or corruption. It is\nfurther envisaged that a number of specific policy conditions will be attached\nto the assistance, mainly in the area of public finance management, with a view\nto strengthening efficiency, transparency and accountability. \nSecond, before the agreement on the Memorandum\nof Understanding is reached, the Commission services, with the support of duly\nmandated external experts, will carry out an Operational Assessment of the\nfinancial circuits and administrative procedures at the Ministry of Finance and\nthe Central Bank of Jordan, in order to fulfil the requirements of the\nFinancial Regulation applicable to the General Budget of the European\nCommunities. This review will determine\nwhether the framework for sound financial management of macro-financial\nassistance is sufficiently effective in Jordan by covering areas such as\nmanagement structure and organisation, management and control of funds,\nsecurity of IT systems, internal and external audit capacity as well as the\nindependence of the central bank. In the light of this assessment, specific\nmechanisms applying to the management of the funds by the beneficiaries may be\nintroduced in agreement with the national authorities. Also, the assistance\nwill be paid to a dedicated account at the Central Bank of Jordan.\nFinally, the assistance will be liable to\nverification, control and auditing procedures under the responsibility of the\nCommission, including OLAF, and the European Court of Auditors.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      Existing budget lines\n01 03 02: Macro-financial assistance\n01 04 01 14 \u2013 Provisioning of the Guarantee\nFund\nIn order of\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Description\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.] || Diff./non-diff.
