The current EU legislation for\nmaking available on the market of plant reproductive material is based on two\nmain pillars, namely the registration of varieties/material and the\ncertification of individual plant reproductive material lots of plant species\nas identified in the Directives ('EU listed species'). \nThe draft proposal consolidates and updates the\nlegislation on marketing of plant reproductive material by repealing and replacing\nthe following 12 Directives: Council Directive 66/401/EEC on the marketing of\nfodder plant seed, Council Directive 66/402/EEC on the marketing of cereal\nseed, Council Directive 2002/53/EC on the common catalogue of varieties of\nagricultural plant species, Council Directive 2002/54/EC on the marketing of\nbeet seed, Council Directive 2002/55/EC on the marketing of vegetable seed,\nCouncil Directive 2002/56/EC on the marketing of seed potatoes, Council\nDirective 2002/57/EC on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants, Council\nDirective 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative\npropagation of the vine, Council Directive 1998/56/EC on the marketing of\npropagating material of ornamental plants, Council Directive 92/33/EEC on the\nmarketing of vegetable propagating and planting material, other than seed,\nCouncil Directive 2008/90/EC on the marketing of fruit plant propagating\nmaterial and fruit plants intended for fruit production and Council Directive\n1999/105/EC of 22 December 1999 on the marketing of forest reproductive\nmaterial.\nThe majority of Council Directives for making\navailable on the market of plant reproductive material have first been adopted\nbetween 1966 and 1971 and some Directives are more recent. The old Directives\nhave been updated both frequently and substantially, creating the need for\nclarity and transparency. As a consequence of this history, the Directives are\nquite diverse in the technical backgrounds they are based on, but also in their\napproaches, ranging from official controls on products to official supervision\nof processes. In particular, the product control is very demanding for\ncompetent authorities.\nFurthermore, the complexity and fragmentation\nof the existing legislation is likely to perpetuate existing uncertainties and\ndiscrepancies in its implementation between the Member States. This creates an\nuneven playing field for professional operators on the single market. There is\na need to harmonise implementation of the legislation, reduce cost and\nadministrative burdens and support innovation. It is also important to adapt to\nthe technical progress in plant breeding, and to the rapid evolution of the\nEuropean and global market of plant reproductive material. All those needs make\nthe update and modernisation of the legislative framework imperative. The aim\nof in situ conservation of agro-biodiversity should be further\nstrengthened. In addition, the weak horizontal coordination with other EU\nlegislation, policies and strategies is an obstacle to their more efficient\nimplementation. In the past years, agricultural policy in the EU has come to be\nseen as strategically important for food security and safety, the nutritional\nvalue of food, the environment, biodiversity and climate change.\n\"Sustainable intensification\" and greening of food crop production,\nin which yields are increased without adverse environmental impact and without\nthe cultivation of more land, have become a central concern. Plant reproductive\nmaterial legislation is critically important for reaching this aim. The EU\nForest Strategy emphasises the importance of the multifunctional role of forest\nand its sustainable management.\nCoherence and synergies with the Plant Health\nLaw concerning the plant health checks which are part of the plant reproductive\nmaterial certification process or integration of general principles relating to\nofficial controls embedded in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 on official controls\nare needed.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe impact assessment of this proposal builds\non the results of the evaluation of the EU legislation on the marketing of seed\nand plant propagating material (now plant reproductive material) that was\ncarried out in 2007/2008 by the Food Chain Evaluation Consortium (FCEC), on the\nresults of a study on variety registration conducted by the same consortium in\nthe first half of 2010. It is furthermore based on a broad survey of all\ninterested parties, in particular the competent authorities in the Member\nStates, private sector representatives at EU and at national level, relevant\ninternational standard setting bodies, non-governmental organisations and the\nCommunity Plant Variety Office (CPVO). A number of Commission Horizontal Working\nParty meetings covering all the plant species were held in 2009-2011. In May\n2011, four task forces created under the Hungarian presidency worked on\nspecific topics. In addition, the Commission consulted the working group 'Seeds\nand Propagating Material' of the Advisory Group on the Food Chain, Animal and\nPlant Health on several occasions from 2009 \u2013 2011. On 18 March 2009 an\nopen conference \"Ensuring Seed Availability in the 21st Century\" was\norganised to present and discuss the evaluation results with different\nstakeholders. Finally, a web-based stakeholder survey using an \u201cInteractive\nPolicy Making\u201d (IPM) questionnaire to collect comments on an \"Options and\nAnalysis\" paper was organised from 19 April to 30 May 2011. It yielded\n257 responses from a very wide range of stakeholder groups.\nThe main objective of the consultations was to\nseek views on the provisions and application of existing legislation and the\nneeds for change. Overall, stakeholders were satisfied with the principles\nunderlying the existing Directives, but supported the Commission's intention to\nrevise the legislation. Room for improvement was in particular identified\npertaining to legal simplification, cost reductions and efficiency gains,\nincreased flexibility for professional operators, the level of harmonisation\namong Member States, the role of niche and emerging markets and the\nconservation of agro-biodiversity and plant genetic resources. Maintaining the\ngeneral principles of the current legislation \u2013 especially the procedures for\nthe registration of varieties and the pre-marketing certification of seed lots\n\u2013 was strongly supported by a majority of stakeholders. In addition, concerning\nthe EU legislation on forest reproductive material, the stakeholders requested\nto maintain the current approach.\nThe Impact Assessment identified the following\nmain axes along which the system has to change in order to be fit for the\nchanging economic, environmental, social, scientific circumstances: (i)\nSimplification of the basic legal acts (from 12 Directives to one Regulation),\n(ii) Cost recovery and improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of the\nsystem and (iii) Horizontal coordination with recent, already adopted EU\npolicies. Various ways \u2013 increased flexibility, deregulation or centralisation\n\u2013 are explored for improving the efficiency of the system, while maintaining\nthe assurances for high quality plant reproductive material, competitiveness\nand addressing new challenges such as biodiversity. Based on these 3 axes, 5\npolicy options were identified, where legal simplification and cost recovery\nare constant for all options. In the various options, issues regarding SMEs and\nmicro-enterprises have been addressed throughout, especially in order to ensure\naccess for these enterprises to public services for the execution of certain\ntasks they cannot perform themselves and to support and further develop their\nflexibility to gain improved access to the plant reproductive material market.\nSpecific attention is given to trade-offs between transferring operational work\nand keeping of quality of plant reproductive material.\nThe impact assessment concludes that no single\noption succeeds in achieving the objectives of the review in an efficient,\neffective and coherent manner and suggests, in line with stakeholder opinion, a\npreferred option which combines elements from option 2, 4 and 5. The proposal\nthus creates an environment providing legal security for professional operators\nand consumers, guaranteeing high quality of plant reproductive material and\nsecuring competitive advantage on the internal and the world markets. This\ncombination aims at striking a balance between flexibility for professional\noperators (option 2 and 4) and biodiversity (option 4) and the necessary rigor\nin health and quality requirement (elements of option 2 and 5) for the fair\nfunctioning of the market and for maintaining the quality and health of plant\nreproductive material. This is combined with elements allowing minor crops or\ncrops with particular uses low-burden access to specific or small market\nsegments, but with coupled minimum obligations ensuring traceability, health\nand information to the consumer so that a level playing for all professional operators\nis established.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe aim of the proposal is to replace the\nexisting 12 Directives by one single proposed Regulation. \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part I \u2013 General provisions\nThe scope of the proposed Regulation covers all\ntypes of plant reproductive material. The largest part of it covers, though,\nthe species currently regulated by the 12 Directives (so called 'listed\nspecies'). However, to clarify and harmonise the existing approaches in the\nMember States on the other species, i.e. plant species not listed and thus not\ncovered by the current Directives, also these species will be subject to some\nvery basic rules (see Part III, Title III). \nIn order to take into account the needs of\nproducers and the requirements of flexibility and proportionality, the\nRegulation will not to apply to plant reproductive material intended for\ntesting and scientific purposes and intended for breeding (selection) purposes.\nIn addition, it should not apply to material intended to or maintained in gene\nbanks, organisations and networks of ex-situ and in-situ or on farm\nconservation of genetic resources following national strategies on conservation\nof genetic resources. Furthermore, plant reproductive material exchanged in\nkind between two persons other than professional operators is excluded from the\nscope of the Regulation.\nAs regards definitions, the main change is the\nintroduction of a common term to cover all the plant reproductive material,\neither in the form of seeds or other types of plant propagating material. Plant\nreproductive material is defined to mean plants or parts of plant capable of and\nintended for producing or reproducing entire plants. This includes also young\nplants. All those types of plant reproductive material are subject to common\nprinciples with regard to their production with a view to making available on\nthe market and with regard to making them available on the market.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part\nII \u2013 Professional operators\nAs under this Regulation the definition of\noperator does not include private persons, the term 'professional operator' is\nused. Professional operators are defined by a single definition and shall be\nregistered to ease the control activities. This register shall be combined with\nthe register established under [title of the new Plant Health Regulation].\nBasic obligations will be introduced for professional operators concerning the\nidentification of the plant reproductive material they are producing or making\navailable on the market, keeping of records, facilitation of controls and\nmaintenance of the material. The traceability of any plant reproductive\nmaterial is ensured by the obligation for the professional operators to have\ninformation one step before and one step after their commercial activities.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part III \u2013 Plant reproductive material other than forest reproductive\nmaterial\nTitle I General provisions\nDefinitions of variety and its maintenance,\nvariety with official description or variety with officially recognised\ndescription, clone as well as of the different marketing categories are laid\ndown.\nTitle II Production and making available on\nthe market of listed species\nIn general, the basic approach on registration\nof varieties/material and certification/inspection of lots before making\navailable on the market will be maintained. However, more flexibility will be\ngiven to the professional operators so that they may decide to carry out the\nnecessary examination for variety registration or inspections, sampling and\nanalysis of plant reproductive material for certification under the official\nsupervision of the competent authorities. In addition, secondary acts will be adopted\nsetting out the specific requirements for the production and making available\non the market of particular species and their categories (pre-basic, basic,\ncertified and standard material). This is important to increase flexibility for\nchanges due to technical and scientific developments and at the same time\nrespecting proportionality and sustainability in regulatory approach.\nThe requirements for making available on the\nmarket of plant reproductive material may be summarised as follows: \n\u2013              \nit belongs to a variety or clone registered in\naccordance the provisions of this Regulation; \n\u2013              \nit complies with the specific requirements\nadopted for the marketing category concerned per genera and species; \n\u2013              \nit bears an official label for pre-basic, basic or\ncertified material, or an operator's label in case of standard material;\n\u2013              \nit complies with the handling requirements;\n\u2013              \nit complies with the requirements for certification\nand identification.\nThe obligation of variety registration shall\nnot apply to rootstocks which do not fulfil the conditions of a variety. In\naddition, in order to introduce flexibility for future technical and scientific\ndevelopments, heterogeneous material, which does not fulfil the definition of a\nvariety, could be exempted under certain conditions from the requirement that\nthat material belongs to a registered variety. Furthermore, a specific\nderogation for niche market plant reproductive material is laid down. \nCertain genera and species of plant\nreproductive material, which are listed in the current Directives, should\ncontinue to be subject to enhanced requirements relating to their production\nand making available on the market (listed species). However, there is a need\nto set criteria to decide on these plant species. Genera or species of plants\nwhich represent a significant area and value of production, are produced and\nmade available on the market by a significant number of professional operators\nor they contain substances requiring specific rules to protect human, animal\nhealth or the environment should be included in the list. \nPlant reproductive material should only be\nproduced and made available on the market as pre-basic, basic, certified or standard\nmaterial, in order to ensure transparency and informed choices for users. Detailed\ncriteria need to be established to decide which genera and plant species shall\nnot be made available on the market as standard material to ensure enhanced\nquality and health, identity and traceability of plant reproductive material as\nwell as food and feed security. Specific requirements should be adopted per\ngenera and species for each of those categories. The requirements on identity,\npurity, health and other quality requirements, labelling, lots, packaging\nincluding small packages, post-certification control tests, comparative tests\nand trial and mixtures will continue to be applied. \nDerogations\nThe existing permanent derogations on making\navailable on the market to a limited extent not-yet registered varieties for\ntesting on farm and not finally certified material and authorisation of more\nstringent national requirements should be maintained. This should also concern\nthe important temporary derogations on emergency measures, temporary\ndifficulties in supply and temporary experiments. \nDerogation on niche market plant\nreproductive material\nIn addition, proportionate and sustainable\nrules for small scale activities concerning plant reproductive material, which is\nadapted to local conditions, and made available on the market in small\nquantities, should be established. Such varieties should be exempted from the\nrequirements on registration and making available on the market. This material\nis defined as niche market plant reproductive material. The exemption should\nconcern e.g. farmer-breeders or gardener-breeders whether being professional\noperators or not. However, some basic rules on labelling and traceability of\nthe material should be laid down. In order to prevent an abuse of the exemption\nthe material should only be made available on the market in a defined size of packages.\n\nImports and exports\nThe EU equivalence system is maintained as a\nbasic condition for imports from third countries. However, exports are included\nin the scope of the Regulation. Exports should take place in line with\nlegislation, standards, code of practice or any other legal or administrative\nprocedure in place in the importing third country. Where a bilateral or\nmultilateral agreement between the Union and the third country exists, the\nexports from the Union shall comply with the agreement. Furthermore, in the\nabsence of the latter, an agreement conducted between the professional\noperators shall apply. \nTitle III Production and making available on\nthe market of plant reproductive material belonging to non-listed genera or\nspecies \nPlant reproductive material not belonging to\nthe listed genera and species shall also be subject to a few basic requirements\nwith regard to its health status, fitness for purpose, appropriate reference to\nvarieties, where applicable, and identification of the respective material and\nimports.\nTitle IV Registration of varieties in\nnational and Union registers\nVariety registers\nThe varieties, in order to be made available on\nthe market throughout the Union, shall be included in a national register or in\nthe Union register via direct application procedure to the CVPO. CPVO will keep\nthe updated information on all plant varieties that can be made available on\nthe market in the Union, including the varieties registered in national\nregisters (Union plant variety database).\nFor new improved varieties the basic\nrequirement of DUS (distinct, uniform and stable) will be maintained. The\nuniformity examination should take into account the type of variety and type of\nreproduction. In addition, by secondary act it can be decided for which plant\nspecies additional requirements on value for cultivation and use (VCU) can be\nlaid down. The Member States shall adopt more detailed criteria for the VCU\nexamination of these plant species as regards their yield, quality\ncharacteristics, resilience and suitability for low input production systems\nincluding organic production. Thus, given the specific characteristics required\nfor organic farming, the methodology and requirements established for variety\nexamination should take due account of the specific needs.\nRules on a sustainable value for cultivation\nwill be laid down and harmonised in the EU by adopting specific requirements\nconcerning resistance to specific pests, reduced need for input of resources,\ndecreased content of undesirable substances or increased adaptation to\ndivergent agro-climatic environment. This is an important tool to guide the\nbreeding process to a more sustainable direction.\nIf a variety has been granted a Union Plant\nVariety Right pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2100/1994, or pursuant to national\nrules, that variety should be deemed to be distinct, uniform and stable and to\nhave a suitable denomination for the purposes of variety registration under\nthis Regulation.\nThe basic principle of the use of a single\ndenomination throughout the Union for one variety is kept. In certain specific\ncases synonyms will be allowed. The CPVO is best made available to have an\noverview of applicable denominations of varieties throughout the Union.\nTherefore, and in order to ensure coherence regarding the assignment of\ndenominations throughout the Union, the competent authorities should consult\nCPVO to check a denomination, before the respective variety is registered in a\nnational variety register. \nThe Regulation establishes the detailed\nrequirements for the variety registration procedure regarding conditions for\nregistration, submission and content of applications, formal and technical\nexaminations, examination reports, decisions on registration, period of\nvalidity and its renewal, revocation/deletion of registration and maintenance\nof varieties. For coherence, the same rules shall also apply to direct variety\napplications to the CPVO for registration in the Union variety register. \nSpecific provisions are set out on the\nregistration in the Union variety register and with regard to the possibility\nfor the applicant to launch an appeal against a CPVO decision. Such provisions\nare not laid down for the registration in the national variety registers,\nbecause they are subject to national administrative procedures.\nA new obligation for each national variety\nexamination centre to be audited by the CPVO will be introduced with the aim to\nensure the quality and harmonisation of the variety registration process in the\nUnion. The examination centre of the professional operators will be audited and\napproved by the national competent authorities. In case of direct application\nto the CPVO it will audit and approve the examination centres it uses for\nvariety examination.\nThe competent authorities and the CPVO should\ncharge fees for the processing of applications, the formal and technical\nexaminations including audits, variety denomination, and the maintenance of the\nvarieties for each year for the duration of the registration. Therefore,\nharmonised rules for those fees should be set out in this Regulation. The general\nprinciple of cost recovery shall prevail. However, the micro-enterprises shall\nbe exempted from fees to fulfil the Commission's commitment to lower the burden\non very small businesses, in line with its new policy on minimizing regulatory\nburden for SMEs and adapting EU regulation to the needs of micro-enterprises.\nMoreover, the fee for registration of varieties with officially recognised\ndescription and heterogeneous material shall be reduced in a manner to ensure\nthat the fee does not constitute a barrier to the registration of the variety or\nmaterial concerned. \nOld traditional varieties\nConcerning old varieties, such as conservation\nvarieties (including landraces), or so called 'amateur varieties', less stringent\nrequirements should continue to be laid down in view of promoting their on farm\nconservation and use as currently regulated under the Directives 2008/62/EC and 2009/145/EC. The varieties will continue to be registered, however, on the\nbasis of an 'officially recognised description' which shall be recognised \u2013 but\nnot produced \u2013 by the competent authorities. For that description DUS examination\nis no longer obligatory. The officially recognised description shall only describe\nthe specific characteristics of the plants and parts of plants which are\nrepresentative for the variety concerned and make the variety identifiable,\nincluding the region of origin. This description can be based on an old\nofficial description of the variety, description produced at the time by e.g. a\nscientific, academic body or organisation. The accuracy of its content could be\nsupported by previous official inspections, unofficial examinations or\nknowledge gained from practical experience during cultivation, reproduction and\nuse. The current quantitative restrictions are abolished. The users are informed\nabout the material by a label indicating that this variety is identified by an\nofficially recognised description and the region of origin. Plant reproductive\nmaterial belonging to those varieties should only be made available on the\nmarket as standard material.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part IV \u2013 Production and making\navailable on the market of forest reproductive material\nThe EU legislation sets a specific approach\nincluding specific terminology on forest reproductive material. Therefore, for\nthis area a separate part is laid down in which the current basic approach is\nkept. The requirements for forest reproductive material concern approval of\nbasic material, inclusion in national register and Union list, master\ncertificate, marketing categories, lots, mixtures, labelling, packaging and establishment\nof the conditions of EU equivalence for imports. In addition, the following\nderogatory rules need to be set: authorisation of more stringent national\nrequirements, prohibition to make available to end user specified forest reproductive\nmaterial, rules concerning temporary difficulties in supply and rules\nconcerning temporary experiments.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part V \u2013 Procedural provisions\nRules for delegated acts and the committee\nprocedure are laid down.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part VI \u2013 Final provisions\nThe Regulation (EC) NO 2100/94 on Community\nVariety Rights is amended as regards the name and role of CPVO. The name of the\nagency is amended to follow the recommendations of the EU inter-institutional\nworking group to 'European Agency on Plant Varieties' (EAPV). The mission of\nCPVO is extended to the area of variety registration, in particular the\nmanagement of Union variety register and the registration of plant varieties\nvia direct application procedure to the CPVO. In addition, a number of tasks\nare attributed to the CPVO within its new mission on offering recommendations\non variety denominations, database on reference collections of varieties,\nharmonisation of technical examination of varieties, audits of technical\nexamination centres, advisory tasks, training and technical support.\nThe necessary rules on penalties are laid down.\n\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part VII \u2013 Union competence,\nsubsidiarity and legal form \nThe plant reproductive material legislative\nframework is based on the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\n(TFEU) Article 43 implementing the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The\nobjectives of that policy are to increase agricultural productivity, to ensure\na fair standard of living for the agricultural community, to stabilise markets,\nto assure the availability of supplies and to ensure that supplies reach\nconsumers at reasonable prices. Requirements with regard to the sustainability\nof agriculture have been integrated through the successive revisions of the\nCAP. The Lisbon Treaty qualifies agriculture as shared competence between the\nEU and its Member States. It is obvious, however, that to a very large extent\nall fields of agricultural activity as well as ancillary activities upstream\nand downstream have been regulated at the EU level. This means that legislation\nis predominantly a role for the institutions of the European Union.\nThe proposal takes the form of a Regulation of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council. Other means would not be\nappropriate because the objectives of the measure can be achieved most\nefficiently by fully harmonised requirements throughout the Union, ensuring\nfree movement of plant reproductive material.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\nIMPLICATION\nThe financial appropriations for implementing\nthe Regulation up to 31 December 2020 are being presented in the Regulation on\nlaying down provisions for the management of expenditure relating to the food\nchain, animal health and animal welfare, and relating to plant health and plant\nreproductive material.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL\nELEMENTS\n2013/0137 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nOn the production and making available on\nthe market of plant reproductive material (plant reproductive material law)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee, \nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions, \nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure[1],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The following Directives\nset out rules for the production and marketing of seeds and propagating\nmaterial of agricultural crops, vegetables, vine, fruit plants, forest\nreproductive material and ornamental plants:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14\nJune 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed[2];\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 66/402/EEC OF 14\nJune 1966 on the marketing of cereal seed[3];\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 68/193/EEC of 9\nApril 1968 on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the\nvine[4];\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 98/56/EC of 20 July\n1998 on the marketing of propagating material of ornamental plants[5];\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 1999/105/EC of 22\nDecember 1999 on the marketing of forest reproductive material[6];\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\nDirective 2002/53/EC of 13 June 2002 on the common catalogue of varieties of\nagricultural plant species[7];\n(g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 2002/54/EC of 13 June 2002 on the\nmarketing of beet seed[8];\n(h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 2002/55/EC of 13 June 2002 on the\nmarketing of vegetable seed[9];\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 2002/56/EC of 13\nJune 2002 on the marketing of seed potatoes[10];\n(j)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 2002/57/EC of 13\nJune 2002 on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants[11];\n(k)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 2008/72/EC of 15\nJuly 2008 on the marketing of vegetable propagating and planting material,\nother than seed[12];\n(l)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 2008/90/EC of 29\nSeptember 2008 on the marketing of fruit propagating material and fruit plants\nintended for fruit production[13].\n\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The basic objective of the\nabove Directives is sustainable agricultural, horticultural and forestry\nproduction. In order to ensure productivity, the health, quality and diversity\nof plant reproductive material is of outmost importance for agriculture,\nhorticulture, food and feed security, and the economy in general. Moreover, to\nensure sustainability, legislation should take account of the need to meet\nconsumers' expectations, to ensure the adaptability of production to manifold\nagricultural, horticultural and environmental conditions, to face the\nchallenges of climate change and to foster the protection of agro-biodiversity.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evolution in the areas of\nagriculture, horticulture, forestry, plant breeding and making available on the\nmarket of plant reproductive material has shown that the legislation needs to\nbe simplified and further adapted to the developments of the sector. Therefore,\nthe above Directives should be replaced by a single Regulation on the\nproduction, with a view to making available on the market, and the making\navailable on the market, of plant reproductive material within the Union.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Plant reproductive\nmaterial, should be defined in a comprehensive manner, including all plants\ncapable of, and intended for, producing (including reproducing at any further\nstage of production) entire plants. This Regulation should, therefore, cover seeds,\nas well as all other forms of plant at any growth stage, intended for and\ncapable of producing entire plants. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should\nalso cover plant reproductive material used for the production of agricultural\nraw materials intended for industrial purposes, since that material represents\na major part of several sectors and should fulfil certain quality standards.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to determine the\nscope of the several provisions of this Regulation it is necessary to define\nthe concepts of \u201cprofessional operator\u201d and \u201cmaking available on the market\u201d.\nIn particular, in view of the marketing developments of the sector, the\ndefinition of 'making available on the market' should be as wide as possible to\nensure all forms of transactions of plant reproductive material. That\ndefinition should include inter alia persons concluding sales through\ndistance contracts (e.g. electronically) and persons who collect basic forest\nmaterial. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the needs of\nproducers and the requirements for flexibility and proportionality, this\nRegulation should not apply to reproductive material intended solely for\ntesting, scientific and breeding purposes, to gene banks, organisations and\nnetworks devoted to the exchange and conservation of genetic resources\n(including on-farm conservation), or to reproductive material exchanged in kind\nbetween persons other than professional operators.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 94/62/EC of 20\nDecember 1994 on packaging and packaging waste[14],\nRegulation (EC) No 338/97/EC of 9 December 1996 on the protection of species of\nwild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein[15], Directive 2001/18/EC of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate\nrelease into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing\nCouncil Directive 90/220/EEC[16],\nRegulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed[17], Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the\ntraceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the\ntraceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified\norganisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC[18]\nand Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 [Office of publications, please add number of\nRegulation on protective measures against pests of plants], should also\napply for the production and making available on the market of plant\nreproductive material.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\ntransparency and more effective controls on the production and making available\non the market of plant reproductive material, professional operators should be\nregistered. However, in order to reduce the administrative burden for\nprofessional operators, by allowing them to register only once in a single register,\nit is appropriate that they register in the public registers established by the\nMember States pursuant to Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 (Office of Publication,\nplease insert number of Regulation on protective measures against pests of\nplants). \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basic obligations should be\nintroduced for professional operators active in the production and making\navailable on the market of plant reproductive material area to ensure the\nproper application of this Regulation.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience has shown that\nthe reliability and quality of reproductive material made available on the\nmarket can be jeopardised where it is impossible to trace reproductive material\nnot complying with applicable standards. It is therefore necessary to establish\na comprehensive system of traceability allowing withdrawals to be undertaken or\ninformation to be given to consumers or competent authorities. For that reason,\nthe keeping of the necessary information and records on transfers from and to\nprofessional users should be mandatory. On the basis of the principle of\nproportionality, that rule should not apply in case that supply is part of\nmaking available on the market in retail.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain genera and species\nof plant reproductive material should be subject to enhanced requirements\nconcerning their production and making available on the market due to their\nincreased economic, health or environmental importance. That importance should\nbe determined through the area or value of production of those genera or\nspecies, the number of professional operators or the content of substances\nwhich present a potential risk for health or the environment. The majority of\nthose genera and species is currently regulated by the above Directives. Those\ngenera and species should be inserted in a specific list (hereinafter: 'listed\ngenera and species').\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\ntransparency and enable informed choices by consumers, plant reproductive\nmaterial belonging to listed genera and species should only be produced or made\navailable on the market under predefined categories. Those categories should\nreflect different quality levels and production stages and be named\n\u201cpre-basic\u201d, \u201cbasic\u201d, \u201ccertified\u201d and \u201cstandard\u201d, \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nwidest possible availability of plant reproductive material and choices by its users,\nprofessional operators should, in principle, be able to make available on the\nmarket plant reproductive material belonging to listed genera or species under any\nof the categories. However, in order to ensure food and feed security, and to\nachieve a high level of identity, quality and health of plant reproductive\nmaterial, plant reproductive material should not be made available on the\nmarket as standard material if the certification costs are proportionate to\nthose objectives. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Plant reproductive material\nbelonging to varieties with officially recognised description, as well as\nheterogeneous material and niche market material, should be subject to minimum\nrequirements. Therefore, such material should in all cases be produced and made\navailable on the market only as standard material.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow for informed\nchoices by users concerning its identity and characteristics, plant\nreproductive material belonging to listed genera and species should only be\nproduced and made available on the market if it belongs to varieties registered\nin national variety registers or in the Union variety register.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate\nadaptation to developments in plant breeding, and to possible new techniques, heterogeneous\nplant reproductive material, which does not fulfil the definition of a variety\nin the meaning of this Regulation, should be allowed to be produced or made\navailable on the market, under certain conditions, without belonging to a\nregistered variety, and even if it does not comply with the requirements concerning\nregistration of varieties, namely distinctiveness, uniformity or stability, or\nthe requirements concerning the satisfactory value for cultivation or those\nconcerning the sustainable value for cultivation. The registration of such\nmaterial should take into account its contribution to increase the genetic\nvariability of agricultural crops, the genetic resource basis and biodiversity\nin the Union, as well as to the sustainability of agriculture and thus to the\nadaptation to climate change. The methodology for the registration should\nparticularly take into account those specific characteristics and it should be\nbased on the minimum possible burden for operators who wish to register such\nmaterial. It would also be appropriate and proportionate to exempt from the\nsame requirement rootstocks, as they have a significant commercial and\npractical value for the sectors where they are used, but they frequently do not\nfulfil the definition of a variety.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rules should be set out for\nthe certification of plant reproductive material, as well as for the activities\naiming at verifying the reliability of certification at the post-certification\nstage, to ensure the fulfilment of the applicable quality requirements. Those\nrules should be adapted to the technical and scientific developments. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The quality requirements\nand certification schemes should take into account international recommendations,\nsuch as the Seed Scheme Rules and Regulations of the Organisation for Economic\nCo-operation and Development (OECD), the seed potato standards of the United\nNations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the rules on sampling and\ntesting of the International seed testing association (ISTA). \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the thresholds\nestablished for the presence of quality pests by Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 (Office\nof Publication, please insert number of Regulation on protective measures\nagainst pests of plants) on protective measures against pests of plants[19], it is appropriate to\nestablish detailed inspection and examination procedures leading to a single\ncertification as regards compliance with the requirements adopted pursuant to\nthis Regulation and to Regulation (EU) No. .../\u2026 (Office of Publication,\nplease insert number of Regulation on protective measures against pests of\nplants).\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nmaximum possible purity of the material and the homogeneity of production,\nplant reproductive material belonging to listed genera or species should be\nkept in separate lots.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the diversity of\nplant reproductive material, professional operators should have the option to\nproduce and make available on the market plant reproductive material in the\nform of individual plants, packages, containers or bundles.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rules should be adopted for\nthe labelling of plant reproductive material of listed genera or species to\nensure the appropriate identification of that material. In the case of material\nof the categories subject to certification, the label (hereinafter: 'official\nlabel') should be produced and affixed by authorised professional operators and\nunder the official supervision of the competent authorities. However, and since\ncertain professional operators may not have the resources to carry out the\ncertification activities and issue official labels, it should be provided that\nofficial labels may be issued by competent authorities upon request of\nprofessional operators.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the preservation of the\nnatural environment in the context of the conservation of genetic resources, it\nis desirable to allow the mixture of plant reproductive material belonging to\nlisted genera or species with non-listed genera or species. Those mixtures\nshould be permitted only if their composition is naturally linked to a certain\nregion. In order to ensure transparency and better control concerning the\nquality of the mixtures concerned, the production and making available on the\nmarket of those mixtures should be subject to the authorisation by the\ncompetent authorities.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rules should be adopted for\nthe import of plant reproductive material of listed genera or species into the\nUnion, only allowing the import of plant reproductive material fulfilling the\nsame production and quality requirements as for material produced and made\navailable on the market in the Union. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure flexibility, and\nfacilitate adaptation of the professional operators and the markets to specific\ncircumstances, or in cases of temporary supply difficulties, it is appropriate\nto provide for certain derogations from the general rules of this Regulation. Those\nderogations should be granted under specific conditions to avoid abuses and to\nensure that the overall purposes of this Regulation are respected. They should\nconcern plant reproductive material belonging to varieties, the registration of\nwhich is pending, plant reproductive material which is not finally certified or\nnot certified as complying with applicable germination requirements. The\npossibility should also exist to adopt emergency measures to address risks for\nhuman, animal and plant health, and the environment.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Plant reproductive material\nwhich is made available on the market only in limited quantities by small\nproducers (\u201cniche market plant reproductive material\u201d) should be exempted from\nthe requirement of belonging to a registered variety. That derogation is\nnecessary to prevent undue constraints to the making available on the market of\nplant reproductive material, which is of lesser commercial interest, but is\nimportant for the maintenance of genetic diversity. However, it should be\nensured that that derogation is not regularly used by a wide range of\nprofessional operators and it is only used by professional operators which\ncannot afford the costs and administrative burden of variety registration. This\nis important to avoid abuses of that derogation and to ensure the application\nof the rules of this Regulation. Therefore, niche market material should only\nbe made available on the market by professional operators employing a small\nnumber of persons and with a small annual turnover. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is desirable to organise\ntemporary experiments for the purpose of seeking improved alternatives to any\nmeasures adopted for listed genera or species. In the organisation of those\nexperiments the evolution of techniques relating to the production and control\nof plant reproductive material should be taken into account.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exported plant reproductive\nmaterial of listed genera or species to third countries should comply with the\nrules on plant reproductive material produced and made available on the market\nin the Union, unless the material concerned is subject to bilateral or\nmultilateral agreements or rules of third countries. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basic requirements should\nbe set for plant reproductive material not belonging to listed genera or\nspecies, to ensure minimum quality and identification standards for their\nproduction and making available on the market. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that all\nvarieties have access to registration and are subject to common rules and\nconditions rules should be established for the registration of varieties and should\napply to varieties of listed genera or species as well as to varieties of\nnon-listed species. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience so far has shown\nthat some breeders are interested in making available on the market their\nvarieties in the entire Union market, or in the bigger part of it. It is\ntherefore appropriate to offer the breeders the option of registering their\nvarieties either in a national variety register or in a Union variety register.\nThe task of establishing , publishing and updating the Union variety register\nshould be assigned to the European Agency on Plant Varieties (hereinafter: 'the\nAgency'), previously titled 'Community Plant Variety Office' as established\npursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2100/1994 of the Council, which is\ncurrently in charge of granting plant variety rights. The activities of the\nAgency should thus cover all aspects of plant variety management. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Varieties should, in\nprinciple, be registered on the basis of an official description produced by a\ncompetent authority or the Agency. However, in order to reduce the burden for\nthe competent authorities and the Agency and ensure flexibility, it is\nappropriate to provide for the possibility that the examinations necessary to\nproduce the official description may also be carried out by the applicants.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further to the basic\nregistration requirements, varieties belonging to species with particular\nimportance for the development of agriculture and horticulture in the Union\nshould be subject to the additional requirements ensuring satisfactory and\nsustainable value for cultivation or use. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The requirements ensuring\nsustainable value for cultivation should be established at Union level in order\nto support sustainable development, direct plant breeding and meet breeders', producer\nand consumer demands concerning that type of development. The requirements\nensuring satisfactory value for cultivation and use may be only developed by\nMember States according to their agro-climatic and agricultural conditions.\nTherefore, the respective varieties should only be registered in the national\nvariety registers. The requirements ensuring satisfactory value for cultivation\nand use should concern yields and quality characteristics. When Member States\ndevelop and apply such requirements, they should consider the constraints\ncharacterising specific agricultural management practices. In particular, they\nshould duly take into account the specific needs of organic farming as regards\nresilience and low input conditions.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of the\nConvention on Biological Diversity to which the Union is a party, the Union has\ncommitted to maintain the genetic diversity of cultivated plants, and of wild\nrelatives, and to minimise genetic erosion. That commitment complements the\nobjective of the Union to halt biodiversity loss by 2020. In that context,\ncertain varieties should be allowed to be produced and made available on the\nmarket even if they do not comply with the requirements concerning\ndistinctiveness, uniformity or stability, to ensure their conservation and\nsustainable use and thus contribute to the sustainability of agriculture and\nthe adaptation to climate change. Therefore, those varieties should only be registered\non the basis of an officially recognised description.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the varieties registered\non the basis of an officially recognised description should be produced in the\nregion where they have been historically grown and adapted, to ensure their\nauthenticity and their added value for the conservation of genetic diversity\nand the protection of the environment. Therefore, they should only be included\nin national variety registers. For the same reason, those varieties should have\nbeen available on the market and/or collected e.g. in gene banks before the\nentry into force of this Regulation, or, should have been deleted for more than\nfive years from the national variety register or Union variety register, in\ncase they have been registered there on the basis of a technical examination\nconcerning their distinctness, uniformity and stability.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rules should be established\nconcerning the procedures for the registration of varieties and clones in the\nnational variety registers to ensure uniform conditions for all applications\nand a transparent framework for all interested parties.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain varieties which are\nnaturally adapted to the local and regional conditions and threatened by\ngenetic erosion, or which have no intrinsic value for commercial crop\nproduction but have been developed for growing under particular conditions, are\nalready accepted in national catalogues, lists or registers of varieties\npursuant to Article 3 of Directive 2008/62/EC of the Commission of 20 June 2008\nproviding for certain derogations for acceptance of agricultural landraces and\nvarieties which are naturally adapted to the local and regional conditions and\nthreatened by genetic erosion and for marketing of seed and seed potatoes of\nthose landraces and varieties[20],\nand pursuant to Article 3(1) of Directive 2009/145/EC of the Commission of 26\nNovember 2009 providing for certain derogations, for acceptance of vegetable\nlandraces and varieties which have been traditionally grown in particular\nlocalities and regions and are threatened by genetic erosion and of vegetable\nvarieties with no intrinsic value for commercial crop production but developed\nfor growing under particular conditions and for marketing of seed of those\nlandraces and varieties[21].\nThose varieties have not been subject to complete technical examination\nconcerning their distinctiveness, uniformity or stability. It is therefore appropriate\nthat those varieties be registered directly in the national variety registers\nwithout any further proceedings as varieties with an officially recognised\ndescription. \n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union variety register\nshould also include all varieties that are registered in the national variety\nregisters. In this way, it will be ensured that the Union variety register\noffers a transparent overview of all varieties registered in the Union. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rules should be adopted for\nthe registration of varieties and clones in the Union variety register. For the\npurposes of consistency, those rules should be similar to the rules on\nregistration in national variety registers.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The competent national\nauthorities and the Agency should charge fees for the processing of\napplications, the formal and technical examinations and for each year of the\nregistration period. This would be necessary to ensure the necessary resources\nfor the overall system of registration of varieties, and that the main\nbeneficiaries of that registration bear the costs for the functioning of that\nsystem. Rules concerning the fixing of those fees should be set out in this\nRegulation.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\nregistration of varieties which serve at combating genetic erosion in the\nUnion, Member States should apply a reduced fee for varieties with officially\nrecognised description and for heterogeneous material. Such reduced fees should\nbe sufficiently low as not to constitute a deterrent or a barrier to the making\navailable on the market of those varieties. In order to provide support to\nmicro-enterprises, they should be fully exempted from the payment of fees.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to protect the\ncommercial interests and intellectual property of professional operators, the\nresults of the examination and the description of the genealogical components\nshould be treated as confidential, if the breeder so requests. For the sake of\ntransparency, all descriptions of varieties listed in the national variety\nregisters or in the Union variety register should be made publicly available.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Forests cover a large area\nof the Union and fulfil social, economic, environmental, ecological and\ncultural functions. There is, therefore, a need for specific approaches and\nactions for the different types of forests, considering the wide range of\nconditions characterising the forests in the Union.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Forest reproductive\nmaterial of tree species and artificial hybrids which are important for\nforestry purposes should be genetically suited to local conditions and of high\nquality. The conservation and enhancement of biodiversity of forests, including\nthe genetic diversity of the trees, are essential to sustainable forest\nmanagement.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirements should be set\nfor forest reproductive material as regards basic material, categories under\nwhich the material may be made available on the market, lots, labelling, small\npackages, to ensure the appropriate quality and marketing standards, and to\nadapt to the technical and scientific developments of the sector.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\nflexibility and adaptation to particular circumstances, derogations should be\nprovided, under conditions, for the production and making available on the\nmarket of forest reproductive material. Those derogations should concern the\npossibility for Member States to adopt more stringent requirements, the case of\ntemporary difficulties of supply, the need of making seed rapidly available on\nthe market, the conduct of temporary experiments and the adoption of emergency\nmeasures.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to serve the\ninterest of conservation and sustainable use of forestry plant genetic\nresources, Member States should be allowed to adopt less stringent requirements\non forest reproductive material which is naturally adapted to the local and\nregional conditions and threatened by genetic erosion.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The competent authorities\nshould charge fees for the registration/approval of basic forest material and\nthe issuance of master certificates for the forest material derived from\nregistered/approved basic forest material. This would be necessary to ensure\nthe necessary resources for the certification of forest reproductive material,\nand that the main beneficiaries of that certification bear the respective\ncosts. In order to provide support to micro-enterprises, they should be fully\nexempted from the payment of fees. The rules concerning those fees should be\nset out in this Regulation, as they concern the effective production,\nregistration and making available on the market of forest reproductive\nmaterial.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n2100/1994 needs to be amended to include variety registration in the mission of\nthe Agency and to amend its former title 'Community Plant Variety Office'.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\nAnnexes of this Regulation are adapted to the technical and scientific\ndevelopments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU\nshould be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the Annexes of\nthis Regulation.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to follow the\ntechnical and economic developments of the sector, the power to adopt acts in\naccordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in\nrespect of listing the genera or species whose plant reproductive material may\nnot be placed on the market as standard material. \n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to follow the\ntechnical and economic developments of the sector, the power to adopt acts in\naccordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in\nrespect of setting out the plant reproductive material which may be produced\nand made available on the market without belonging to a registered variety, and\nthe requirements for its production and making available on the market.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\nplant reproductive material of listed genera or species, and certain types of\nforest reproductive material, fulfils the highest possible identity, quality\nand health requirements, as appropriate for the characteristics of the genera,\nspecies or categories concerned, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adopting\nproduction and quality requirements, and certification schemes, for those\ngenera or species, and in respect of adopting quality requirements for making\navailable on the market specific parts of plants and planting stock of species\nand artificial hybrids of forest reproductive material. \n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\nplant reproductive material is made available on the market under conditions\nadapted to the specific characteristics of particular genera or species to\nwhich it belongs, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU\nshould be delegated to the Commission in respect of the maximum size,\ncomposition and identification of lots, and the requirements concerning small\npackages, of plant reproductive material belonging to particular genera or\nspecies. \n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to adapt the rules\nconcerning the official labels and operators' labels to the characteristics of certain\ntypes of plant reproductive material, the power to adopt acts in accordance\nwith Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of\nsetting out additional rules concerning the label for specific categories and\nother groups of plant reproductive material, indications concerning a label\nnumber, indications of generations of pre-basic, basic, certified and standard\nmaterial, the indication of variety types including intraspecific or interspecific\nhybrids, the indication of subdivisions of categories satisfying different\nconditions, in case of mixtures, the indication of the percentage by weight of\nthe various components by species and, where appropriate, by variety, and\nindications concerning the intended use of the material. \n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nability of the professional operators to properly carry out a reliable\ncertification of the plant reproductive material concerned, the power to adopt\nacts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission\nin respect of setting out more detailed requirements concerning the qualification\nof professional operators and of the inspectors which may be entrusted with certification\nactivities, suitability of premises and availability of particular equipment to\nbe used by the professional operators and laboratories. \n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure updated standards\nfor the official supervision of certification carried out by operators as\nappropriate for the characteristics of particular genera or species, the power\nto adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of setting out more detailed requirements concerning the way\ncompetent authorities must supervise the certification. \n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure updated standards\nfor post-certification as appropriate for the characteristics of particular\ngenera or species, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU\nshould be delegated to the Commission in respect of setting out requirements\nconcerning proportion of samples to be submitted to tests and concerning testing\nprocedures. \n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\nmixtures of plant reproductive material are produced and made available on the\nmarket pursuant to the appropriate quality requirements per genera and species,\nand in order to ensure informed choices for their users, the power to adopt\nacts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission\nin respect of adopting rules concerning the production and making available on\nthe market of mixtures of plant reproductive material belonging to different\ngenera or species listed in Annex I, or different varieties of those genera or\nspecies, and in respect of adopting rules concerning mixture of plant\nreproductive material belonging to genera or species listed in Annex I, with\nplant reproductive material belonging to genera or species not listed in Annex\nI.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\nplant reproductive material belonging to varieties, registration of
