Therefore, from this date, Mayotte will cease to be\nan overseas territory and will become an outermost region of the Union within\nthe meaning of Articles 349 and 355(1) TFEU. Union law will apply to\nMayotte from 1 January 2014.\nThis proposal is in response to a request from\nthe French authorities for a modification of the Union acquis by way of\ndeferred implementation of Directive 2010/18/EU of 8 March 2010\nimplementing the revised Framework Agreement on parental leave concluded by\nBUSINESSEUROPE, UEAPME, CEEP and ETUC and repealing Directive 96/34/EC. \nThis request for postponement is objectively\njustified in the light of the specific economic situation of the island of\nMayotte.\n\u00b7              \nThe jobs market is underdeveloped and the\nemployment rate is low for an active population totalling 43 200 people. \n\u00b7              \n15 % of total employment is still in\ntraditional industries (agricultural food production, crafts and small-scale\ncommerce), comprising subsistence activities.\n\u00b7              \nPer capita GDP is 30 % less than the EU\naverage. \n\u00b7              \nThe French authorities plan to increase social\nrights gradually in order to avoid any economic destabilisation of the island.\nThe planned increase in contributions is therefore to be very slow, with the\nalignment of contributions on those generally applicable to be staggered up to\n2036. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Commission has not carried out an impact\nassessment. However, after examining various points and in particular France\u2019s\nrequest, the Commission has been in contact with the representatives of the\nFrench authorities in order to better assess the reasons for the requested\npostponement.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nIn accordance with Article 155(2) TFEU, the\nCouncil has the power to adopt implementing measures for agreements concluded\nat Union level between management and labour in the field of equal treatment\nbetween men and women concerning labour market opportunities and equality at\nwork.\nThe French request for a deferred\nimplementation date of 31 December 2018 is justified in the light of the\nspecific economic situation of the new overseas department of Mayotte, which\ncalls for a progressive alignment of the legislation of Mayotte with French and\nEuropean legislation, together with a gradual increase in social rights, in\norder to avoid any economic destabilisation of the island resulting from a\nnon-progressive increase in social rights and to ensure the gradual achievement\nof equal treatment in the particular field of parental leave.\nOn this basis, it is proposed that Council\nDirective 2010/18/EU of 8 March 2010 be amended to grant France a\ndeferment until 31 December 2018 for the implementation of the Directive\nin Mayotte.\n2013/0189 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\namending Council Directive 2010/18/EU\nbecause of the change in status of Mayotte\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 155(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Decision 2012/419/EU[1], the European Council decided\nto amend the status of Mayotte with regard to the European Union with effect\nfrom 1 January 2014. Therefore, from that date, Mayotte will cease to be\nan overseas territory and will become an outermost region of the Union within\nthe meaning of Articles 349 and 355(1) of the Treaty. Union law will apply\nto Mayotte from that date. Certain specific measures, justified by the\nparticular situation of Mayotte, should be established.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Considering the specific\neconomic and social situation of Mayotte, particularly the fact that the jobs\nmarket is underdeveloped and the employment rate is low, an additional\nimplementation period for Council Directive 2010/18/EU of 8 March 2010\nimplementing the revised Framework Agreement on parental leave concluded by\nBUSINESSEUROPE, UEAPME, CEEP and ETUC and repealing Directive 96/34/EC[2] is appropriate to ensure that\nequal treatment in the particular field of parental leave is achieved\nprogressively and so as not to destabilise the economic development of the\nisland, which will allow this specific situation to be improved. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2010/18/EU\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS\nADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nIn Article 3(2) of Directive 2010/18/EU,\nthe following subparagraph is added: \n\u2018For the French overseas department of\nMayotte, the additional period referred to in the first subparagraph shall be\nextended to 31 December 2018.\u2019\nArticle 2\nThis\nDecision is addressed to the French Republic.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 204, 31.7.2012, p. 131.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 68, 18.3.2010, p. 13.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
