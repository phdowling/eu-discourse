The EU concluded the FCTC by Council Decision 2004/513/EC of 2 June 2004 ([1]).\nThe FCTC recognises in its Article 15 that\r\nthe elimination of illicit trade in tobacco products, including smuggling,\r\nillicit manufacturing and counterfeiting, is an essential component of tobacco\r\ncontrol, and obliges Parties to adopt and implement effective measures to\r\neliminate illicit trade. Article 33 of the FCTC\r\nprovides for the possibility for the Conference of the Parties to adopt\r\nprotocols to the Convention. On the basis of these Articles,\r\nthe Conference of the Parties (COP) to the FCTC, at its second session in\r\nJune-July 2007 decided to establish an Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB)\r\nto negotiate and draft a protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco\r\nproducts (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Protocol\u2019). \nThe Council authorised the Commission to\r\nnegotiate the Protocol on behalf of the EU in its Decision of 20 December 2007.\r\nThis Decision amended the negotiating directives for the FCTC with regard to\r\nthe Protocol. The directives for the FCTC were adopted by the Council on 22\r\nOctober 1999 and supplemented on 21 April 2001. After its fifth session, the INB decided to recommend that\r\nthe draft Protocol on which a consensus was obtained be considered at the fifth\r\nCOP of the FCTC. Accordingly, the fifth COP held in Seoul, Republic of Korea,\r\nadopted the Protocol on 12 November 2012.\nAccording to Article 43, the Protocol is open\r\nfor signature by the Parties to the FCTC in New York until 9 January 2014. The\r\nEU should sign the Protocol as soon as possible. \nThe Protocol\r\nconsists of core provisions on the control of the supply chain of tobacco\r\nproducts and of equipment for manufacturing those products (Part III: Supply\r\nChain Control). It requires the introduction of a licensing, equivalent\r\napproval or control system by a competent authority for any natural or legal person\r\ninvolved in the manufacturing and in the import and export of tobacco products\r\nand manufacturing equipment (Article 6 \u2014 Licensing). It furthermore requires\r\nall natural and legal persons engaged in the supply chain of tobacco, tobacco\r\nproducts and manufacturing equipment to conduct due diligence with regard to their\r\ncustomers (Article 7 \u2014 Due diligence). It provides for the establishment of a\r\nglobal tracking and tracing regime, within five years of the entry into force\r\nof the Protocol, consisting of national tracking and tracing systems controlled\r\nby the Parties for all tobacco products manufactured in or imported into their territory\r\n(Article 8 \u2014 Tracking and tracing).\nThose articles are\r\ncomplemented by provisions on record-keeping and security and preventive\r\nmeasures, including anti-money-laundering measures, and reporting of suspicious\r\ntransactions (Articles 9 and 10). Further provisions concern sales by Internet,\r\ntelecommunication or any other evolving technology (Article 11), duty free\r\nsales of tobacco products and the obligation to implement effective controls on\r\ntobacco and tobacco products in the free zones, including not mixing tobacco\r\nproducts with non-tobacco products at the time of removal from a free zone\r\n(Article 12). \nPart IV of the\r\nProtocol defines the conduct to be established as unlawful under the Parties\u2019 legislation (Article 14) and obliges the\r\nParties to ensure that natural and legal persons are held liable for such unlawful\r\nconduct, including criminal offences (Articles 15 and 16). Further provisions\r\nconcern seizure payments (Article 17), the handling of confiscated tobacco\r\n(Article 18) and special investigative techniques (Article 19). Part V of the\r\nProtocol contains provisions for the exchange of relevant information between\r\nthe Parties (Articles 20 to 22), cooperation and mutual assistance (both\r\nadministrative and legal in relation to criminal matters \u2013 Articles 23 and 24,\r\nand Articles 27 to 29), jurisdiction (Article 26) and extradition (Articles 30\r\nand 31). \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES \nCoordination with Member States throughout\r\nthe negotiations took place in the Council Working Party on Customs Union and\r\nin local coordination meetings during the sessions of the Intergovernmental\r\nNegotiating Body and the Intersessional Working Groups.\nThe European Parliament was informed about\r\nthe outcome of the negotiations.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe Protocol contains a complex set of\r\nmeasures and rules. The main objective of the Protocol is to contribute to the\r\noverall tobacco control efforts by combatting all forms of illicit trade in\r\ntobacco products and manufacturing equipment. This objective is pursued through\r\nseveral sets of measures which are equally important and complementary to each\r\nother. These measures fall into different areas of EU activity which may be\r\nsubdivided as follows:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the manufacture, presentation\r\nand sale of tobacco products,\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 harmonised taxation and related\r\nrules,\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 customs controls and cooperation\r\nincluding through mutual administrative assistance in customs matters,\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 approximation of criminal\r\noffences, judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation.\nIndividual provisions usually fall under\r\none or, in a few cases, more of those headings. As a consequence, the EU has\r\nexternal competence to deal with these matters. In some cases this competence\r\nis of an exclusive nature, in accordance with Article 3 of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union TFEU.\nRegarding heading (a), the Protocol contains provisions that are covered by EU legislation\r\nbased on Article 114 of the TFEU concerning tracking and tracing and sales by\r\nInternet, telecommunications and other evolving technology. \nRegarding heading (b), the Protocol contains provisions covered by EU legislation on indirect\r\ntaxation, notably licensing, record-keeping, duty free sales, and\r\nadministrative cooperation based on Article 113 of the TFEU. \nRegarding heading (c), the Protocol contains provisions that are covered by existing EU\r\nlegislation based on Articles 33 and 207 of the TFEU concerning control and\r\nverification measures applicable to the international transit or transhipment\r\nof tobacco products and manufacturing equipment, and on international\r\ncooperation including mutual administrative assistance. \nThe Protocol also contains provisions on\r\nthe definition of unlawful conduct that may be established by the Parties\r\neither as a non-criminal or as a criminal offence. As far as non-criminal\r\noffences are concerned they fall under EU activity in the fields described\r\nunder headings (a) to (c). \nThe above matters fall under Titles II and\r\nVII of Part IV and Title II of Part V of the TFEU. Therefore, in so far as its\r\nprovisions which do not fall under Title V of Part III of the TFEU are\r\nconcerned, the Protocol should be signed, on behalf of the Union, by means of a\r\nseparate Council Decision, which is the subject of a separate proposal.\nRegarding heading (d), the Protocol contains provisions that are covered by existing\r\nEU legislation concerning approximation of criminal offences, law enforcement cooperation\r\nand judicial cooperation in criminal matters (respectively Chapters 4\r\nand 5 of Title V of Part III of the TFEU). Title V of Part III of the TFEU is\r\ngoverned by a special regime because Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland do\r\nnot participate in measures under that Title. However, the United Kingdom and\r\nIreland have the possibility to take part in the adoption and application of\r\nthe measures. \nThe Protocol contains provisions on the\r\ndefinition of unlawful conduct that may be established by the Parties as a non-criminal\r\nor a criminal offence, including establishing the liability of both natural and\r\nlegal persons. As regards criminal offences, the EU has competence in this area\r\non the basis of Article 83 of the TFEU. The list of unlawful conducts also\r\nincludes the laundering of proceeds of the unlawful conduct established as a\r\ncriminal offence. Under Council Framework Decision 2001/500/JHA[2] of 26 June 2001 on money\r\nlaundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of\r\ninstrumentalities and the proceeds of crime, Member States shall ensure that\r\ncertain money laundering offences are sanctioned by criminal penalties.\nThe Protocol contains measures concerning judicial cooperation in\r\ncriminal matters (mutual legal assistance and extradition). The EU has\r\ncompetence in this area based on Article 82 (1) of the TFEU. Under Council\r\nFramework Decision 2002/584/JHA[3]\r\nof 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures\r\nbetween Member States, Member States may issue an arrest warrant for certain offences\r\ndefined in the Decision, such as fraud and participation in a criminal\r\norganisation, if certain conditions are fulfilled. Council Framework Decision\r\n2003/577/JHA of 22 July 2003 on the execution in the European Union of orders\r\nfreezing property or evidence[4],\r\nestablishes the rules under which Member States will recognise and execute in their\r\nterritory a freezing order issued by a judicial authority of other Member\r\nStates in the framework of criminal proceedings for the purpose of securing\r\nevidence or subsequent confiscation of property. Council Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA\r\nof 6 October 2006 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to\r\nconfiscation orders[5]\r\nestablishes the rules under which Member States shall recognise and execute in\r\ntheir territory a confiscation order issued by a court competent in criminal\r\nmatters of other Member States. The Convention established by the Council in\r\naccordance with Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union on Mutual Assistance\r\nin Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union[6] supplements and facilitates the\r\napplication of the already existing instruments described in its Article 1. Mutual\r\nassistance can be provided in proceedings brought by the administrative\r\nauthorities in respect of acts which are punishable under the national law of\r\nthe requesting or the requested Member State, or both, by virtue of being\r\ninfringements of the rules of law, and where the decision may give rise to\r\nproceedings before a court having jurisdiction in particular in criminal\r\nmatters. Mutual assistance can also be provided in connection with criminal\r\nproceedings and proceedings which relate to offences or infringements for which\r\na legal person may be held liable in the requesting Member State.\nThe Protocol provides for measures on\r\npolice and customs cooperation in criminal matters that fall under EU\r\ncompetence based on Article 87 (2) of the TFEU. Council Decision 2009/917/JHA\r\nof 30 November 2009[7]\r\non the use of information technology for customs purposes is the legal basis\r\nfor the establishment and use of the Customs Information System to assist the\r\nMember States in preventing, investigating and prosecuting serious\r\ncontraventions of national laws. Under Council Act 98/C 24/01 of 18 December 1997\r\ndrawing up, on the basis of Article K3 of the Treaty on European Union, the\r\nConvention on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations[8], the Member States provide each\r\nother with mutual assistance and cooperate with one another through their\r\ncustoms administrations, with a view to preventing and detecting infringements\r\nof national customs provisions, and prosecuting and punishing infringements of\r\nCommunity and national customs provisions. Cross-border cooperation is\r\npermitted under the Convention for the prevention, investigation and\r\nprosecution of infringements in the case of illegal cross-border commercial\r\ntrade in taxable goods to evade tax or to obtain unauthorised State payments in\r\nconnection with the import or export of goods, where the extent of the trade\r\nand the related risk to taxes and subsidies is such that the potential\r\nfinancial cost to the budget of the European Communities or the Member States\r\nis considerable (Article 19). \nCouncil Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA[9] of 18 December 2006 on\r\nsimplifying the exchange of information and intelligence between law\r\nenforcement authorities of the Member States of the European Union (\"Swedish\r\nInitiative\") establishes rules under which Member States' law enforcement\r\nauthorities may exchange existing information and intelligence effectively and\r\nexpeditiously for the purpose of conducting criminal investigations or criminal\r\nintelligence operations.\nArticles 82 (1), Article 83 and Article 87\r\n(2) therefore constitute the legal basis under Title V of Part III of the TFEU\r\nfor the EU to sign the Protocol. \n2013/0260 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, of the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the\r\nWorld Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, in so far\r\nas the provisions of the Protocol are concerned which fall under Title V of\r\nPart III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 82(1), Article 83\r\nand Article 87(2), in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 22 October 1999, the\r\nCouncil authorised the Commission to negotiate, in the context of the World\r\nHealth Organisation (WHO), a Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and\r\nrelated protocols.

The\r\nPresident\nAnnex\nPROTOCOL TO\r\nELIMINATE ILLICIT TRADE IN TOBACCO PRODUCTS\nPreamble\nThe Parties to this Protocol,\nConsidering that on 21\r\nMay 2003, the Fifty-sixth World Health Assembly adopted by\r\nconsensus the WHO Framework Convention on\r\nTobacco Control, which came\r\ninto force on 27 February 2005;\nRecognizing that the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\r\nis one of the United\r\nNations\u2019 most rapidly ratified treaties and a fundamental tool for attaining the objectives of the World\r\nHealth Organization;\nRecalling the\r\nPreamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization,\r\nwhich states that the enjoyment of the\r\nhighest attainable standard\r\nof health as a fundamental right of\r\nevery human being without distinction of race, religion,\r\npolitical belief,\r\neconomic or social condition;\nDetermined also to give priority to their right to protect public health;\nDeeply concerned that the illicit trade in tobacco products\r\nis contributing to the spread of the tobacco epidemic, which is a global\r\nproblem with serious consequences for public\r\nhealth that calls for effective, appropriate and comprehensive domestic and international responses;\nRecognizing further that illicit\r\ntrade in tobacco\r\nproducts undermines price and tax measures\r\ndesigned to strengthen tobacco control and thereby increases\r\nthe accessibility and affordability of tobacco products;\nSeriously concerned by the adverse effects that the increase in accessibility and affordability of illicitly traded tobacco\r\nproducts has on public health and the well-being, in particular of young people,\r\nthe poor and other vulnerable\r\ngroups;\nSeriously concerned\r\nabout the disproportionate economic\r\nand social implications of illicit trade in tobacco products on developing countries and countries with economies in transition;\nAware of\r\nthe need to develop scientific, technical and institutional\r\ncapacity to plan and implement appropriate national, regional\r\nand international measures to eliminate all forms of illicit trade in tobacco products;\nAcknowledging that access to resources and relevant technologies is of great importance for enhancing the ability of Parties,\r\nparticularly in developing\r\ncountries and countries with economies\r\nin transition, to eliminate all forms of illicit trade in tobacco products;\nAcknowledging also that, although free zones are established to facilitate legal trade, they have\r\nbeen used to facilitate the globalization of illicit trade\r\nin tobacco products, both in relation\r\nto the illicit transit of smuggled products and in the manufacture of illicit tobacco products;\nRecognizing also that illicit trade in tobacco products\r\nundermines the economies of Parties and\r\nadversely affects their stability and security;\nAlso aware that illicit trade in tobacco\r\nproducts generates financial profits that are used to fund\r\ntransnational criminal activity, which interferes with government objectives;\nRecognizing that the illicit trade in tobacco products undermines health objectives, imposes additional strain on health systems and causes losses of revenue to the economies of the Parties;\nMindful of Article\r\n5.3 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\r\nin which Parties agree that in setting and implementing\r\ntheir public health policies\r\nwith respect to tobacco\r\ncontrol, Parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial\r\nand other vested interests of the\r\ntobacco industry in accordance with national law;\nEmphasizing the need to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to undermine or subvert\r\nstrategies to combat illicit trade in tobacco products\r\nand the need to be informed\r\nof activities of the tobacco industry that have a negative impact on strategies to combat illicit\r\ntrade in tobacco\r\nproducts;\nMindful of Article 6.2 of the WHO Framework Convention\r\non Tobacco Control,\r\nwhich encourages Parties to prohibit or restrict, as appropriate, sales to and/or importation\r\nby international travellers of tax- and duty-free tobacco\r\nproducts;\nRecognizing in addition that tobacco and tobacco products in international\r\ntransit and transhipment find a channel for illicit trade;\nTaking into account\r\nthat effective\r\naction to prevent and combat illicit trade in tobacco products requires a comprehensive\r\ninternational approach to, and close cooperation on, all aspects\r\nof illicit trade, including,\r\nas appropriate, illicit trade in tobacco, tobacco products and manufacturing equipment;\nRecalling and emphasizing the importance of other relevant\r\ninternational agreements such as the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\r\nPsychotropic Substances and the obligation that Parties to these Conventions have to apply, as appropriate, the relevant provisions\r\nof these Conventions\r\nto illicit trade in tobacco,\r\ntobacco products and manufacturing equipment and encouraging those\r\nParties that have not yet become Parties\r\nto these agreements to consider doing so;\nRecognizing the need to build enhanced\r\ncooperation between the Convention Secretariat of the\r\nWHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\r\nand the United Nations\r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime, the World Customs Organization and other bodies, as appropriate;\nRecalling Article 15 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control,\r\nin which Parties recognize, inter alia, that the elimination of all forms of illicit trade in tobacco\r\nproducts, including\r\nsmuggling and illicit manufacturing,\r\nis an essential component of tobacco control;\nConsidering that this Protocol does not seek to address issues concerning intellectual property rights; and\nConvinced that supplementing\r\nthe WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control by a comprehensive protocol will be a powerful, effective means to counter illicit\r\ntrade in tobacco products and its grave consequences,\nHereby agree as follows:\nPART I:\r\nINTRODUCTION\nArticle 1\nUse of terms\n1 \u201cBrokering\u201d means acting as an agent for

If a Party that makes extradition\r\nconditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another\r\nParty with which it has no extradition treaty, it may consider\r\nthis Protocol as the\r\nlegal basis for extradition in respect of any criminal offence\r\nto which this Article applies.\n4. Parties\r\nthat do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize\r\nthe criminal offences to which this Article\r\napplies as extraditable offences between themselves.\n5. Extradition shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the domestic law of the requested\r\nParty or by applicable extradition treaties, including, inter alia, conditions in relation to the minimum\r\npenalty requirement for extradition and the grounds upon which the requested\r\nParty may refuse extradition.\n6. Parties shall, subject to their domestic\r\nlaw, endeavour to expedite extradition procedures and to simplify evidentiary requirements\r\nrelating thereto in respect of any criminal offences to which this Article applies.\n7. A Party in whose territory an alleged offender is present,\r\nif it does not extradite such person in respect of a criminal offence\r\nto which this Article applies\r\nsolely on the ground that he or she is one of\r\nits nationals, shall,\r\nat the request of the Party seeking extradition, be obliged to submit the case\r\nwithout undue delay to its competent authorities\r\nfor the purpose of prosecution. Those\r\nauthorities shall\r\ntake their decision and conduct\r\ntheir proceedings in the same manner as in the case of any other\r\noffence of a similar nature\r\nunder the domestic law of that Party. The Parties concerned shall cooperate with each other, in particular on procedural\r\nand evidentiary aspects, to ensure the efficiency\r\nof such prosecution.\n8. Whenever a Party is permitted\r\nunder its domestic law to extradite\r\nor otherwise surrender one of its nationals\r\nonly upon the condition that the person will\r\nbe returned to that Party to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or proceedings for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought and that Party and the Party seeking the extradition\r\nof the person agree with this option and\r\nother terms that they may deem appropriate, such conditional extradition or surrender shall be sufficient to discharge the obligation set forth in paragraph 7.\n9. If extradition, sought for purposes of enforcing a sentence, is refused\r\nbecause the person sought is a national\r\nof the requested Party, the requested\r\nParty shall, if its domestic law so permits and in\r\nconformity with the requirements\r\nof such law, upon application of the requesting Party, consider the\r\nenforcement of the sentence that has been imposed under the domestic\r\nlaw of the requesting Party or the\r\nremainder thereof.\n10. Any person regarding\r\nwhom proceedings are being carried out in connection with any of the\r\ncriminal offences to which this Article applies shall be guaranteed\r\nfair treatment at all stages of the proceedings, including enjoyment of all the rights and guarantees\r\nprovided by the domestic law of the Party\r\nin the territory of which that person is present.\n11. Nothing in this Protocol shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the\r\nrequested Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request has\r\nbeen made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person\u2019s sex, race, religion,\r\nnationality, ethnic origin or political opinions or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice\r\nto that person\u2019s position for any one of these reasons.\n12. Parties may not refuse a request for extradition\r\non\r\nthe sole ground that the offence is also\r\nconsidered to involve fiscal\r\nmatters.\n13. Before refusing extradition, the requested Party shall, where appropriate, consult with the\r\nrequesting Party to provide it\r\nwith ample opportunity to present its opinions and to provide information relevant to its allegation.\n14. Parties shall seek to conclude bilateral\r\nand multilateral agreements or arrangements to carry out or to enhance the effectiveness\r\nof extradition. Where Parties are bound by an existing\r\ntreaty or intergovernmental\r\narrangement the corresponding provisions of that treaty or intergovernmental arrangement shall apply unless\r\nthe Parties agree to apply paragraph 1 to 13 in lieu thereof.\nArticle 31\nMeasures to ensure\r\nextradition\n1. Subject to its domestic law and its extradition treaties, the requested Party may, upon being\r\nsatisfied that the circumstances so\r\nwarrant and are urgent and at the request of the requesting\r\nParty, take a person whose extradition\r\nis sought and who is present in its territory into custody or take other\r\nappropriate measures to ensure his or her presence at extradition proceedings.\n2. Measures taken in accordance with\r\nparagraph 1 shall be notified, in conformity with national\r\nlaw, as appropriate and without\r\ndelay, to the requesting Party.\n3. Any person regarding whom the measures in accordance with paragraph 1 are\r\nbeing\r\ntaken, shall be entitled\r\nto:\n(a) communicate without\r\ndelay with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which that person is a national or, if that person is a stateless person, the State in the territory of which\r\nthat person habitually resides;\r\nand\n(b) be visited by a representative of that State.\nPART VI:\r\nREPORTING\nArticle 32\nReporting and exchange\r\nof information\n1.
