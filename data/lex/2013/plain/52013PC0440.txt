The Council recalled,\nhowever, that the transition would end only with the holding of free and\ntransparent parliamentary elections \u2013 the last benchmark for resumption of\ncooperation with Guinea under the 10th European Development Fund (EDF)\n(Decision 2011/465/EU). \nCouncil Decision 2011/465/EU, extended by\nCouncil Decision 2012/404/EU, expires on 19 July 2013. It established two\nbenchmarks: (1) adoption of a detailed timetable for the holding of\nparliamentary elections by the end of 2012; (2) the holding of free and\ntransparent parliamentary elections. With the adoption and transmission by\nGuinea's independent National Electoral Commission of an electoral timetable\nfor holding elections in May 2013, the EU Council considered that the first of\nthese benchmarks had been met. The 10th EDF CSP/NIP was\nsigned in Brussels on 21 December 2012. \nOn 13 April 2013 a presidential decree set\n30 June 2013 as the date for holding the parliamentary elections. \nIn view of the delays already accumulated\nin implementation of the electoral timetable and the strong political tensions\naffecting the holding of elections on the date and under the conditions laid\ndown, the validity of Council Decision 2011/465/EU should be extended by one\nyear and the deadline for holding the parliamentary elections extended until\nend of October 2013. If elections are held after that date, the EU will not be\nable to fulfil its commitment to sign the financing decisions for the rest of\nthe 10th EDF projects/programmes, as Council Decision 1/2006 sets\n31 December 2013 as the time limit for committing 10th EDF funds\n('sunset clause'). \n2013/0209 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nextending the period of application of the\nappropriate measures laid down for the Republic of Guinea by Decision\n2011/465/EU and amending that Decision\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to the Partnership Agreement\nbetween the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States of\nthe one part, and the European Community and its Member States of the\nother part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000[1],\nas last amended in Ouagadougou on 22 June 2010[2]\n(\u2018the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement\u2019), and in particular Article 96 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Internal Agreement\nbetween representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting within\nthe Council, on measures to be taken and procedures to be followed for the\nimplementation of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement[3], and in particular Article 3\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission, \nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision\n2011/465/EU of 18 July 2011 lays down appropriate measures for Guinea under\nArticle 96(2)(c) of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Decision, extended\nand amended by Council Decision 2012/404/EU, lays down two conditions for the\nresumption of cooperation with Guinea, namely that a detailed timetable be\ndrawn up and adopted by the competent authorities for the holding of parliamentary\nelections by the end of 2012, and that free and transparent parliamentary\nelections be held. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the transmission by\nthe President of Guinea's independent National Electoral Commission of an\nelectoral timetable for holding elections on 12 May 2013, the EU Council\nconsidered that the first of these benchmarks had been met. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 13 April 2013 a\npresidential decree set 30 June 2013 as the date for holding the parliamentary\nelections.
