Introduction of the obligation\nto check whether a person has been granted access to the RTP (Article 7(3) (aaa)) \n\u2013     \nVerification of the identity of a RT (Article\n7(3)(b)(v))\n\u2013     \nInformation to the traveller on the remaining\nperiod of authorised stay (Article 7(8))\n\u2013     \nExemptions for RT from certain parts of the\nthorough check in Article 7a\n\u2013     \nObligation of entering data into the EES even in\nthe event border checks are relaxed (Article 8(3))\n\u2013     \nExtension of the use of the lanes indicated by\nthe sign in parts A and B of Annex III (EU citizens lanes) (Article 9(2)(a))\n\u2013     \nIndications/Pictogram for ABC gates (Article 9(6))\n\u2013     \nDeletion of Article 10 (Stamping obligation)\n\u2013     \nPresumption of an irregular stay in the absence\nof the appropriate records (Article 11)\n\u2013     \nChange of Annex III\n\u2013     \nDeletion of Annex II point (f), Annex IV and\nAnnex VIII\nLegal basis\nArticle 77 (2) of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union; as the proposal lays down provisions on\nborder checks of persons crossing the external border.\nThis proposal amends Regulation (EC) No\n562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006\nestablishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons\nacross borders (Schengen Borders Code) which was based on the equivalent\nprovisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community, i.e. Articles\n62(1) and (2)(a). \nSubsidiarity principle\nArticle 77 empowers\nthe Union to develop a policy with a view to \u2018ensuring the absence of any\ncontrols on persons, whatever their nationality, when crossing internal\nborders\u2019 and \u2018carrying out checks on persons and efficient monitoring of the\ncrossing of external borders\u2019.\nThe current proposal is within the limits\nset by these provisions. The objective of this proposal\nis to make the necessary amendments of the Schengen Borders Code for the\nestablishment of an EES and a RTP. It cannot be sufficiently achieved by the\nMember States acting alone, because an amendment to an existing Union Act (the\nSchengen Borders Code) can only be achieved by the Union.\nProportionality principle\nArticle 5 (4) of the Treaty on European\nUnion states that the content and form of Union action must not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. The\nform chosen for this action must enable the proposal to achieve its objective\nand be implemented as effectively as possible. \nThe creation of the Schengen Borders Code\nin 2006 had to be in the form of a regulation, in order to ensure that it is\napplied in the same way in all the Member States that apply the Schengen acquis.\nThe proposed initiative \u2014 amendment of the Schengen Borders Code \u2014 constitutes\nan amendment to an existing regulation and can only be achieved by means of a\nregulation. As to the content, this initiative is limited to improvements of\nthe existing regulation and based on the policy orientations contained therein.\nThe proposal therefore complies with the proportionality principle.\nChoice of instrument \nProposed instrument: Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposed amendment has no implications\nfor the EU budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nConsequences of the various protocols\nannexed to the Treaties and of the association agreements concluded with third\ncountries \nThis proposal builds on the Schengen acquis\nin that it concerns the crossing of external borders. The consequences for\nthe various protocols and association agreements therefore have to be considered\nwith regard to Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom; Bulgaria, Romania and\nCyprus; Iceland and Norway; and Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The situation of\neach of these states is described in recitals 10-17 of this proposal and\nexplained in further detail in the explanatory memoranda for the legislative\nproposals on the establishment of an EES and an RTP.\nSuccinct overview of the proposed\namendments of the Schengen borders code\nArticle 2, Definitions\nAdditional definitions\nPoint 20: Definition of the new Entry/Exit\nSystem (EES)\nPoint 21: Definition of the new Registered\nTraveller Programme (RTP) \nPoint 22: Definition of 'Registered\nTraveller' (RT)\nPoint 23: Definition of \"'Automated\nBorder Control' (ABC)\nNew Article 5a Data to be entered into the\nEES\nThe general obligation for a third country\nnational entering the Schengen area to be registered into the EES is added in a\nnew Article 5a together with the exceptions concerning third country nationals\nthat are exempted from border checks or from the obligation to cross external\nborders only at border crossing points or during the fixed opening hours. \nArticle 7, Border checks on persons\nIn Paragraph (2) the obligation to check the\nauthenticity of the travel documents that contain an electronic storage medium\nusing valid certificates has been added. \nIn Paragraph (3)(a)(iii) the obligation to\ncheck whether the third country national entering the Schengen area has not yet\nexceeded the maximum duration of authorised stay by checking the stamps in the\npassport has been replaced by an obligation to consult the EES.\nThe new Paragraph (3)(aaa) regulates\nthe obligation for border guards to verify whether a third country national\ntraveller has already been registered in the EES. \nIn Paragraph (3)(b)(iv) concerning the obligation\nfor border guards to verify during the exit check whether a third country\nnational exceeded the maximum duration of stay it is clarified that this check\nhas to be made by consulting the EES.\nIn Paragraph (3)(b)(v) the verification of\nidentity and participation in the RTP for a registered traveller is described.\nThe new Paragraph (8) foresees the obligation\nfor borderguards to inform third country nationals on their request about the\nmaximum number of days they are still allowed to stay within the Schengen area\nas set out in the EES and if applicable in the VIS.\nArticle 7a, Border checks on Registered\nTravellers and use of automated means for border checks \nThe new Article 7a Paragraph 1 describes the\nfollowing derogations from thorough checks foreseen in Article 7(3)(a)\napplicable to a registered traveller at entry of the Schengen area.\n- thorough check of the travel document\n(Article 7(3)(a)(ii))\n-\u00a0\u00a0 verification of point of departure and\ndestination, the purpose of the stay including supporting documents (Article\n7(3)(a)(iv))\n-\u00a0\u00a0 verification of the possession of\nsufficient means of subsintence (Article 7(3)(a)(v))\nFinally it provides a procedure for travelers\nthat are identified by the ABC gate as non registered travellers or for registered\ntravellers that do not fullfill all entry conditions. In these cases the normal\nprocedures (carried out by a border guard) foreseen in Article 7(3)(a) shall be\napplicable.\nParagraph 2 opens the possibility to use ABC\nmeans in combination with \"self-service kiosks\" by travellers where\nthe fingerprints are stored in the VIS or in the travel document (biometric\npassport) and where these fingerprints can be accessed by the border guard\nauthorities. The entry conditions determined in Artcle 7(3)(a) shall be\nfullfilled.\nParagraph 3 foresees the possibility to use\nABC means for the exit checks of persons mentioned in Paragraphs 1 and 2. The\nchecks foreseen in Artcle 7(3)(b) and (c) shall remain applicable except the\nverification of travel documents for signs of falsification or counterfeiting\n(Article7(3)(b)(ii)).\nParagraphs 2 and 3 are not technical\namendements determined by the introduction of the EES and the RTP but\nadditional provisions to further facilitate the border check procedures by\nusing modern technologies. The entry and exit conditions for the travellers\nconcerned as such remain unchanged.\nArticle 8 Relaxation of border checks\nThe existing text is adapted to the\nestablishment of the EES and the abolition of the stamping of passports. The\nobligation to always enter the data of the traveller into the EES while exiting\nthe Schengen area is highlighted. Even in situations of relaxation of border\ncheck procedures the registration in the EES shall be carried out.\nArticle 9 Separate lanes and information\non signs\nParagraph 2(a) clarifies that registered\ntravellers are allowed to use the lanes provided for EU-citizens. \nA new paragraph 6 is added to take account of\nthe introduction of ABC means. In order to have a harmonised approach Member\nStates shall use for ABC lanes the signs contained in Annex III Part D shall be\nused by all MS at all border crossing points.\nArticle 11, Presumption as regards\nfulfilment of conditions for duration of stay\nThe existing text is\nadapted to the establishment of the EES. Today Article 11 regulates the\nprocedures and assumptions in case of absence of entry or exit stamps. With the\nEES the stamping will be replaced by an entry in the EES.\nAnnex III Model signs indicating lanes at border crossing points\nThe signs contained in annex III are completed by adding new signs\nfor the use of ABC means and the introduction of the RTP.\n2013/0060 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 as\nregards the use of the Entry/Exit System (EES) and the Registered Traveller\nProgramme (RTP) \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 77(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure, \nWhereas:\n(1)                   \nRegulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community\nCode on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen\nBorders Code)[1]\nlays down the conditions, criteria and detailed rules for the crossing of the\nexternal borders of the Member States. \n(2)                   \n[Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 XXX of the European\nParliament and of the Council establishing the Entry/Exit System (EES) to\nregister entry and exit data of third country nationals crossing the external\nborders of the Member States of the European Union] aims at the creation of a\ncentralised system for the registration of entry and exit data of third country\nnationals crossing the external borders of the Member States of the European\nUnion for a short stay.\n(3)                   \n[Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 XXX of the European\nParliament and the Council establishing a Registered Traveller Programme] aims\nat facilitating the border crossing for frequent, pre-vetted and pre-screened\nthird country nationals at the external borders of European Union optionally by\nusing automated border crossing facilities.\n(4)                   \nIn order to carry out checks on third-country\nnationals in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 562/2006, which include\nthe verification that the third-country national has not exceeded the maximum\nduration of authorised stay in the territory of the Member States, border\nguards should use all the information available, including data in the EES and\nthe RTP.\n(5)                   \nTo ensure full effectiveness of the EES and RTP,\nentry and exit checks need to be carried out in a harmonised way at the\nexternal borders.\n(6)                   \nThe establishment of an EES and a RTP entails\nthe need to adapt the procedures for checking persons when crossing the\nexternal borders laid down in Regulation 562/2006.
