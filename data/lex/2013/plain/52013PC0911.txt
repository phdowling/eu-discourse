It is based on the objective of sound government finances\r\nas a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong\r\nsustainable growth underpinned by financial stability, thereby supporting the\r\nachievement of the Union's objectives for sustainable growth and jobs. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\r\n(EU) No 473/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013\r\non common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and\r\nensuring the correction of excessive deficit of the Member States in the euro\r\narea sets out provisions for enhanced monitoring of budgetary policies in the\r\neuro area and for ensuring that national budgets are consistent with the\r\neconomic policy guidance issued in the context of the SGP and the European\r\nSemester. Since purely budgetary measures might be insufficient to ensure a\r\nlasting correction of the excessive deficit, additional policy measures and\r\nstructural reforms may be required.\u00a0 \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article\r\n9 of Regulation (EU) No 473/2013 sets out the modalities for economic\r\npartnership programmes, to be submitted by euro area Member States under an\r\nExcessive Deficit Procedure. Setting out a roadmap of measures to contribute to\r\nan effective and durable correction of the excessive deficit, the economic\r\npartnership programme should detail\r\nin particular the main fiscal-structural reforms, notably those referring to\r\ntaxation, pension and health systems and budgetary frameworks, which will be\r\ninstrumental to correct the excessive deficit in a lasting manner. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\n2 December 2009, the Council adopted a decision according to Article 126(6) of\r\nthe Treaty, whereby Slovenia is placed in an excessive deficit procedure. The\r\nCouncil adopted on 21 June 2013 a revised recommendation under Article 126(7) of the Treaty in the\r\ncontext of an excessive deficit which was opened before the entry into force of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 473/2013. In this context, Slovenia was requested to present\r\nan economic partnership programme by 1 October 2013, setting out\r\nfiscal-structural reforms that aim at ensuring an effective and lasting\r\ncorrection of the excessive deficit.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\neconomic partnership programme submitted by Slovenia on 1 October includes\r\nmeasures aimed at reinforcing the budgetary strategy for a durable correction\r\nof the excessive deficit (Council Country Specific Recommendation (hereinafter\r\nCSR) 1), supporting the long-term sustainability of the pension system and\r\ncontaining ageing costs (CSR2), reforming the labour market (CSR3), assessing\r\nthe quality of assets in the banking system (CSR4), improving banks regulatory\r\nframework and supervisory capabilities (CSR5), reforming regulated professions\r\n(CSR6), shortening the length of judicial procedures (CSR7), strengthening\r\ncorporate governance of SOEs and privatisation (CSR8) and restructuring companies\r\nand improving the business environment (CSR9). \n\u00a0(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nfiscal-structural measures and reforms that Slovenia plans to implement concern\r\nthe following: (i) tax system and tax compliance; (ii) fiscal framework; (iii)\r\npension system; and (iv) long-term care. The set of measures is partially\r\nadequate and could be expected to contribute to the effective and lasting\r\ncorrection of the excessive deficit situation. Nevertheless, further efforts\r\nand accelerated implementation in some areas are necessary.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recent\r\nstructural revenue-increasing measures, in particular higher VAT rates and new\r\nreal estate tax, are projected to contribute considerably (around 1.3% of GDP)\r\nto the consolidation of public finances. These actions are not complemented\r\nwith structural expenditure side measures also essential to achieve the budget\r\nbalance/surplus position. On current information it is premature to assess\r\nseveral administrative measures to strengthen tax compliance, however if\r\nefficient, they would further strengthen the sustainability of public finances.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The authorities are preparing an overhaul of the legislation\r\nunderpinning the fiscal framework in compliance with the Treaty on Stability,\r\nCoordination and Governance in EMU (TSCG) and the EU\r\nlegal requirements. The approved constitutional budget balance/surplus rule and envisaged legal acts\r\nspecifying its implementation, notably the new Fiscal\r\nRule Act and amended Public Finance Act, should help\r\nanchor fiscal discipline in national legislation.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\na result of the implementation of the December 2012 pension reform monthly\r\nnumbers of new old-age pensioners indicate a moderation in their growth. However,\r\nthe assessment of implementation of the second Council recommendation about\r\nstrengthening the long-term sustainability of the pension system would be\r\npremature. A working group composed of members from academia and public\r\nadministration is assessing the implications of the reform. Based on its\r\nfindings, the government intends to set out proposals for further adaptations\r\nof the pension system to ensure its sustainability beyond 2020. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To\r\nfurther tackle increasing ageing costs, the government approved a blueprint for\r\nan act on long-term care and personal assistance introducing a new\r\ninsurance-based system. The adoption of the new act is foreseen in the first\r\nhalf of 2014. The funding of the compulsory insurance-based system has to be\r\nclarified, but it will likely be based on compulsory contributions from the\r\nactive and inactive population and should not increase the overall social\r\nsecurity contributions rate.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over\r\nthe last months, Slovenia has stepped up the pace of non-fiscal structural\r\nreforms relevant for the adjustment of macroeconomic imbalances. Crucial\r\nprogress is being achieved in the area of the banking sector. Nevertheless, the\r\nkey reforms supporting adjustment and growth are still in preparation and\r\nsubstantially delayed, notably out of court corporate restructuring and\r\nadoption of the classification of state owned assets.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Implementation\r\nof measures to stabilise the banking sector is on-going, notably a thorough\r\nAsset Quality Review and Stress Tests covering almost 70% of the banking sector\r\nare being conducted and due to be completed before end-2013. Such an assessment\r\nis expected to be followed by a comprehensive strategy of restructuring,\r\nconsolidation and recapitalisation of the banking sector, which would also\r\ninclude plans for disinvestment of direct and indirect public sector\r\nparticipations in domestic banks. The latter would significantly reduce risks\r\nfor reappearance of contingent liabilities in coming years.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nreform of the Slovenia Sovereign Holding Law currently discussed, if well\r\ndesigned and thoroughly implemented, including swift progress with the\r\nprivatisation of certain SOEs, could, on the one hand, generate revenues and\r\nreduce contingent liabilities of the general government and, on the other hand,\r\ncontribute to an improved and more efficient strategic\r\nmanagement of state owned assets in particular regarding the possibilities to attract\r\nforeign investors,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS OPINION: \nThe Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme of Slovenia presented to the Commission and to the Council on 1\r\nOctober 2013 includes a set of fiscal structural reforms that is partly\r\nadequate to support an effective and lasting correction of the excessive\r\ndeficit and needs to be properly and comprehensively implemented to deliver the\r\nexpected results. Specifically, the economic partnership programme illustrates\r\nsome progress in meeting the commitments from Slovenia's Stability Programme\r\nand National Reform Programme concerning the tax reform, the strengthening of\r\ntax compliance and of fiscal governance as well as the repair of the banking\r\nsector. The restructuring of the banking and corporate sector and the consolidation\r\nstrategy following the release of the Asset Quality Review and Stress Tests for\r\nthe banks are key in delivering confidence and attracting foreign investors in\r\nSlovenia, including in sovereign bonds. Work on possible further adaptations of\r\nthe pension system has only recently started and information on envisaged\r\nconcrete measures and timelines in this field is not available. In general,\r\nnearly all reforms are work in progress which makes their swift adoption and\r\nfull implementation of key importance. Slovenia is therefore invited to detail\r\nfurther and provide additional information on the envisaged reforms in the\r\nupcoming National Reform Programme and Stability Programme, the full assessment\r\nof which will be conducted by the Commission and the Council in the context of\r\nthe European Semester.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 140, 27.5.2013 p. 11.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
