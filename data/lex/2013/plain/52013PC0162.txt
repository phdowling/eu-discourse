Alongside and linked to the\nnational trade mark systems, Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December\n1993 on the Community trade mark, codified as Regulation (EC) No 207/2009\n(hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Regulation\u2019), established a stand-alone system\nfor the registration of unitary rights having equal effect throughout the EU.\nIn that context, the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM) was\nset up to be responsible for registering and administering Community trade\nmarks. \nA trade mark serves to distinguish the\ngoods and services of a company. It is the mark through which a business can\nattract and retain customer loyalty, and create value and growth. The mark\nworks in this case as an engine of innovation: the necessity to keep it\nrelevant promotes investments in R&D, which leads in turn to a continuous\nprocess of product improvement and development. This dynamic process also has a\nfavourable impact on employment. In an increasingly competitive environment,\nthere has been a steady growth not only in the crucial role of trade marks for\nmarket success, but also in their commercial value. This\nis reflected in the increasing number of trade mark applications at both\nnational and EU levels, and also in the number of trade mark users. This\ndevelopment has been accompanied by growing expectations on the part of\nstakeholders for more streamlined and high-quality trade mark registration\nsystems, which are more consistent, publicly accessible and technologically\nup-to-date. \nIn 2007, when addressing the issue of the\nfinancial perspectives of OHIM, the Council[1]\nemphasised that the establishment of OHIM had been a great success and that it\nhad contributed substantially to strengthening the competitiveness of the EU.\nIt recalled that the Community trade mark system had been designed to co-exist\nwith the national trade mark systems, which continued to be necessary for those\nundertakings which did not want their trade marks protected at EU level. The\nCouncil further noted the importance of the complementary work of national\ntrade mark offices, and called on OHIM to expand its cooperation with them in\nthe interest of the overall functioning of the Community trade mark system.\nLast, it acknowledged that more than a decade had passed since the creation of\nthe Community trade mark, and therefore underlined the need for an overall\nassessment of the functioning of the Community trade mark system. It invited\nthe Commission to start work on a corresponding study, in particular with a\nview to intensifying and broadening the existing instruments of cooperation\nbetween OHIM and national trade mark offices. \nIn its 2008 Small Business Act[2] the Commission pledged to make\nthe Community trade mark system more accessible to SMEs. Furthermore, the 2008\nCommunication on an Industrial Property Rights Strategy for Europe[3] underlined the Commission\u2019s\ncommitment to effective and efficient trade mark protection and to a trade mark\nsystem of high quality. It concluded that it was time for an overall\nevaluation, which could form the basis for a future review of the trade mark\nsystem in Europe and for the further improvement of cooperation between OHIM\nand National Offices. In 2010, in the Communication on Europe 2020, under the\nFlagship Initiative \u2018Innovation Union\u2019, the Commission undertook to modernise\nthe framework of trade marks in order to improve framework conditions for\nbusiness to innovate[4].\nFinally, in its 2011 IPR strategy for Europe[5],\nthe Commission announced a review of the trade mark system in Europe with a\nview to modernising the system, both at EU and at national level, by making it\nmore effective, efficient and consistent overall. \n\n1.2.                \nAim of the proposal\n\nConsidered together as a package, the main\ncommon objective of this initiative and of the parallel proposal for the\namendment to the Regulation is to foster innovation and economic growth by\nmaking trade mark registration systems all over the EU more accessible and\nefficient for businesses in terms of lower costs and complexity, increased\nspeed, greater predictability and legal security. These adjustments dovetail\nwith efforts to ensure coexistence and complementarity between the Union and\nnational trade mark systems. \nSpecifically, the present initiative to\nrecast the Directive is driven by the following objectives:\n\u00b7       \nModernising and improving the existing\nprovisions of the Directive, by amending outdated provisions, increasing legal\ncertainty and clarifying trade mark rights in terms of their scope and\nlimitations;\n\u00b7       \nAchieving greater approximation of national\ntrade mark laws and procedures with the aim of making them more consistent with\nthe Community trade mark system, by (a) adding further substantive rules and\n(b) introducing principal procedural rules into the Directive in accordance\nwith provisions contained in the Regulation;\n\u00b7       \nFacilitating cooperation between the offices of\nthe Member States and OHIM for the purpose of promoting convergence of\npractices and the development of common tools, by putting in place a legal\nbasis for this cooperation. \n\n2.                      \nRESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES\nAND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n2.1.                \nPublic consultation\n\nThis initiative is based on an evaluation\nof the way the trade mark system works as in Europe as a whole and of extensive\nconsultations with all major stakeholders involved. \nThe main component of the evaluation was a\nstudy the Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law\nundertook on behalf of the Commission. The study was carried out between\nNovember 2009 and February 2011[6]. In addition to expert analysis, the study involved consultations\nwith stakeholders. It included a survey among users of the Community trade mark\nsystem, contributions from organisations representing trade mark users at\nnational, European and international level, and a hearing in June 2010\ninvolving these organisations. Lastly, the Institute consulted the Intellectual\nProperty Offices of all the Member States and OHIM.\nThe Final Report of the MPI study concluded\nthat the basics of the European trade mark system are solid. In particular, the\nprocedures followed by OHIM generally met business needs and expectations.\nThere was further consensus that the coexistence of Community and national\ntrade mark rights is fundamental and necessary for the efficient functioning of\na trade mark system that meets the requirements of companies of different\nsizes, markets and geographical needs. The Report nevertheless found that there\nwas a need for modernisation and improvement of the system. It highlighted, in\nparticular, the need to achieve greater consistency between the Community trade\nmark and national trade mark systems by further harmonising the trade mark laws\nof Member States both within and beyond the current scope of the Directive. \nResponding to the interim results of the\nstudy, the Council adopted Conclusions on 25 May 2010[7]. While noting the existing\ninconsistencies between the Community trade mark and national regimes, these\nconclusions called on the Commission to include in its proposals measures to\nmake the Directive more consistent with the Regulation, and thereby further\ncontribute to reducing areas of divergence within the trade mark system in\nEurope as a whole.\nAs a follow up to the MPI study, the\nCommission services convened a hearing of user associations on 26 May 2011. The\nhearing confirmed that there was broad agreement among users of the trade mark\nsystem in Europe that the present level of approximation between national trade\nmark laws, as well as with the Community trade mark system, has not been sufficient.\nUser organisations unanimously stated that further harmonisation of national\ntrade mark laws was required, with regard to both substantive law and\nprocedural issues. \n\n2.2.                \nImpact Assessment\n\nThe impact assessment carried out for both\nthe review of the Regulation and of the Directive identified two main problems:\nthe first relates to the divergent provisions of the existing regulatory\nframework, and the second to the low level of cooperation between trade mark\noffices in the Union. While the latter problem is due to be addressed in the\nreview of the Regulation, the issue of divergent provisions must be dealt with\nin the review of the Directive.\nThe consulation and evaluation exercise has\nrevealed that the business environment in the trade mark field remains very\nmixed in spite of the partial harmonisation of national laws dating back to\nearly 1990s. The level of harmonisation imposed by the Directive was quite low,\nfocusing on a restricted number of substantive rules that were considered at\nthat time to affect the functioning of the internal market most immediately,\nwhereas a large number of areas, in particular those relating to procedures,\nwere left unharmonised. Moreover, the Regulation was enacted several years\nafter the Directive, which meant that at the time when the Directive came into\nbeing there was no \u2018common benchmark\u2019 against which the efficiency of national\nproceedings could be measured. However, the procedures followed by OHIM have\nnow been in place for more than 15 years, and are generally regarded as meeting\nbusiness needs and expectations. \nAs a result, the current landscape of Union\ntrade mark law is still characterised by a wide divergence between national\nrules and procedures, both among themselves and in relation to the rules and\nprocedures applied by OHIM, and no attempt has ever been made to apply best\npractice with regard to procedures.\nThe existing divergences between national\nsystems and the Community trade mark system are regarded significant. They are\ndue to the fact that the Directive does not cover procedural aspects and that a\nnumber of important substantive law issues are not yet harmonised. Together\nwith the limited convergence of practices and tools at trade mark offices -\nwhich is due to a low level of cooperation - the existing divergencies of trade\nmark laws and procedures limit accessibility to the systems of trade mark\nprotection, involve a great deal of legal uncertainty, and endanger the\ncomplementary relationship between the Community trade mark and national trade\nmark systems. Furthermore, they prevent a level playing field for companies,\nwith the consequent adverse impacts on the competitiveness of EU companies and\nthe competiveness of the Union as a whole. \nThe following possible options for\nresolving the problem were considered:\n\u00b7       \nOption 1: No further approximation of trade mark laws\nand procedures;\n\u00b7       \nOption 2: Partial\nexpansion of the approximation of national laws and their consistency with the\nCommunity trade mark system. This would include aligning the principal procedural\nrules with the relevant provisions of the Regulation, including those where\nexisting difference create major problems from the users' perspective, and\nwhere such alignments are deemed indispensable for creating a harmonious,\ncomplementary system of trade mark protection in Europe. It would also cover\nthe alignment of further aspects of substantive law in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Regulation;\n\u00b7       \nOption 3: Full\napproximation of national trade mark laws and procedures. This approach would\nbe based on option 2, embrace all of its components, but also include all\nremaining aspects of substantive trade mark law and procedures;\n\u00b7       \nOption 4: A\nsingle trade mark rulebook which would replace Member States' trade mark laws\nin their entirety, by setting uniform rules across the Union. \nThe impact assessment concluded that option\n2 would be proportionate and would best serve to achieve the objectives\npursued.\n\n3.                      \nLEGAL BASIS AND SUBSIDIARITY\n\nArticle 114(1) of the Treaty empowers the\nEuropean Parliament and the Council to adopt measures for the approximation of\nthe provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member\nStates which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the\ninternal market.\nThe problems identified in relation to the\nsignificant divergences in the regulatory framework either prevent, or\nsubstantially distort, the level playing field for EU companies with further\nadverse consequences for their competitiveness and that of the EU as a whole.\nIt is therefore advisable to adopt measures capable of improving the conditions\nfor the functioning of the internal market. Measures aimed at extending the\ncurrent level of approximation through the Directive can only be taken at Union\nlevel. Furthermore, action at Union level is the only way to ensure consistency\nwith the Community trade mark system. \nIn this context, it has to be borne in mind\nthat the Community trade mark system is embedded in the European trade mark\nsystem - the latter being built on the principle of coexistence and\ncomplementarity between national and Union-wide trade mark protection. While\nthe Regulation provides a comprehensive system in which all issues of\nsubstantive and procedural law are provided for, the current level of\nlegislative approximation provided for in the Directive is limited to selected\nprovisions of substantive law only. In order to be able to ensure effective and\nsustainable coexistence and complementarity between the components involved, it\nis therefore necessary to create an overall harmonious system of trade mark\nprotection in the Union with substantially similar substantive rules and at\nleast principal procedural provisions which are compatible. \n\n4.                      \nBUDGETARY IMPLICATION \n\nThe proposal will not have an impact on the\nEuropean Union budget and is therefore not accompanied by the financial\nstatement provided for under Article 31 of the Financial Regulation (Regulation\n(EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October\n2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and\nrepealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002).\n\n5.                      \nDETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE PROPOSAL\n\nThe proposed amendments are presented in\naccordance with the objectives pursued by the recast of the Directive as set\nout in section 1.2 above. \n\n5.1.                \nModernising and improving existing provisions\n\n- Definition of a trade mark (Article 3)\nAt present, signs must be capable of being\nrepresented graphically in order to be protected as a trade mark. This\nrequirement of \u2018graphic representability\u2019 is out of date. It creates a great\ndeal of legal uncertainty around the representation of certain non-traditional\nmarks, such as mere sounds. In the latter case, representation by other than\ngraphical means (e.g. by a sound file) may even be preferable to graphic\nrepresentation, if it permits a more precise identification of the mark and\nthereby serves the aim of enhanced legal certainty. The proposed new definition\ndoes not restrict the permissible means of representation to graphic or visual\nrepresentation but leaves the door open to register matter that can be\nrepresented by technological means offering satisfactory guarantees. The idea\nis not to go for a boundless extension of the admissible ways to represent a\nsign, but to provide for more flexibility in that respect while ensuring\ngreater legal certainty. \n- Rights conferred by a trade mark\n(Articles 10 and 11)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rights conferred without prejudice\nto prior rights\nNeither the Directive nor the Regulation\ncontains a clear rule stating that the trade mark proprietor cannot\nsuccessfully invoke his rights against the use of an identical or similar sign\nwhich is already the subject of an earlier right. In line with Article 16(1) of\nthe Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS\nAgreement)[8],\nthis proposal would make it clear that infringement claims are without\nprejudice to earlier rights.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cases of double identity\nThe recognition of additional trade mark\nfunctions under Article 5(1)(a) of the Directive has created legal uncertainty.\nIn particular, the relationship between double identity cases and the extended\nprotection afforded by Article 5(2) to trade marks having a reputation has\nbecome unclear[9].\nIn the interest of legal certainty and consistency, it is clarified that in cases\nof both double identity under Article 5(1)(a) and similarity under Article 5(1)(b)\nit is only the origin function which matters. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use as a trade or company name \nAccording to the Court of Justice[10], Article 5(1) of the Directive\nis applicable where the public considers the use of a company name as (also)\nrelating to the goods or services offered by the company. It is therefore\nappropriate to treat trade name use of a protected trade mark as an infringing\nact, if the requirements of use for goods or services are met. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use in comparative advertising\nDirective 2006/114/EC of 12 December 2006\nconcerning misleading and comparative advertising[11] regulates the conditions under\nwhich advertising, which explicitly or by implication identifies a competitor or\ngoods or services offered by a competitor, is permissible. The relationship of\nDirective 2006/114/EC to the legislation on trade marks has given rise to\ndoubts. It is therefore appropriate to clarify that the trade mark owner may\nprevent the use of his trade mark in comparative advertising where such\ncomparative advertising does not satisfy the requirements of Article 4 of\nDirective 2006/114/EC.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consignments from commercial\nsuppliers\nIt should be made clear that the importing\nof goods into the Union is also prohibited where it is only the consignor who\nacts for commercial purposes. This is to ensure that a trade mark owner has the\nright to prevent businesses (whether located in the EU or not) from importing\ngoods located outside the EU that have been sold, offered, advertised or\nshipped to private consumers, and to discourage the ordering and sale of\ncounterfeit goods in particular over the internet.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Goods brought into the customs\nterritory\nAccording to the Court of Justice in the Philips/Nokia\njudgment[12],\nthe entry, presence and movement of non-EU goods in the customs territory of\nthe EU under a suspensive procedure does, under the existing acquis, not\ninfringe intellectual property rights as conferred by substantive law of the\nUnion and its Member States. Such goods can only be classified as counterfeit\nonce there is proof that they are subject of a commercial act directed at EU\nconsumers, such as sale, offer for sale or advertising. The implications of the\nPhilips/Nokia judgment have met with strong criticism from stakeholders\nas placing an inappropriately high burden of proof on rights holders, and\nhindering the fight against counterfeiting. It is evident that there is an\nurgent need to have in place a European legal framework enabling a more\neffective fight against the counterfeiting of goods as a fast-growing activity.\nIt is therefore proposed to fill the existing gap by entitling right holders to\nprevent third parties from bringing goods, from third countries, bearing\nwithout authorization a trade mark which is essentially identical to the trade\nmark registered in respect of those goods, into the customs territory of the\nUnion, regardless of whether they are released for free circulation. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preparatory acts\nNeither the Directive nor the Regulation contains\nany provisions allowing proceedings against the distribution and sale of labels\nand packaging and similar items which may subsequently be combined with illicit\nproducts. Some national laws have explicit rules covering this activity.\nIncluding a rule on this in the Directive and the Regulation is appropriate to\nprovide another practical, relevant and efficient contribution to the combat\nagainst counterfeiting.\n- Limitation of the effects of a trade\nmark (Article 14)\nThe limitation in Article 14(1)(a) of the\nDirective is restricted in this proposal to cover the use of personal names\nonly in accordance with the Joint Statement of the Council and the Commission[13]. For reasons of consistency,\nthe limitation in Article 14(1)(b) is extended to cover also the use of\nnon-distinctive signs or indications. It is also considered appropriate to\nprovide in Article 14(1)(c) for an explicit limitation covering referential use\nin general. Finally, a separate paragraph clarifies the conditions under which\nthe use of a trade mark shall not be considered as complying with honest\nbusiness practices. \n\n5.2.                \nAchieving greater approximation of substantive\nlaw \n\n- Protection of geographical indications\nand traditional terms (Articles 4 and 5)\nContrary to the Regulation, the grounds for\nrefusal contained in the Directive do not address conflicts with protected\ngeographical indications, traditional terms for wines and traditional\nspecialities guaranteed. Consequently, there is no guarantee that the levels of\nprotection afforded to those rights by other instruments of Union law[14] are actually being applied in\na uniform and exhaustive manner in trade mark examination throughout the Union,\nin particular, when applying absolute grounds for refusal. It is therefore\nproposed to insert corresponding provisions relating to geographical\nindications, traditional terms for wine and traditional specialities guaranteed\nin the Directive.\n- Protection of trade marks with\nreputation (Articles 5 and 10)\nArticles 5 and 10 convert extended\nprotection into mandatory provisions in order to ensure that, in all Member\nStates, national trade marks with reputation enjoy the same level of protection\nas that afforded to Community trade marks. \n- Trade marks as objects of property\n(Articles 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27)\nApart from some basic rules concerning\nlicensing, and unlike the Regulation, the Directive does not comprise\nprovisions regarding other aspects of trade marks as objects of property, such\nas transfers or right in rem. As a result, vital aspects of the commercial\nexploitation of trade marks are regulated poorly or differently across the\nUnion. It is therefore proposed that the Directive be complemented by a\ncorresponding body of rules addressing trade marks as objects of property as\ncontained in the Regulation. \n- Collective marks (Articles 28, 30, 31,\n32, 33, 34, 35, 36 and 37)\nIn order to come into line with the\nRegulation, the amendments to these Articles of the Directive provide for a set\nof specific provisions for the registration and protection of collective marks.\nThey are protectable in a number of Member States and have proved to be\nparticularly successful in protecting the economic value inherent in such\ncommercial instruments. Although at EU level, and in most Member States,\ncollective marks require a holder \u2013 normally an association \u2013 whose members use\nthe mark, this is not so in other Member States, and this makes it difficult to\nkeep this type of trade mark clearly apart from certification marks. \n\n5.3.                \nAchieving alignment of principal procedural\nrules\n\n- Designation and classification of\ngoods and services (Article 40)\nIn line with the proposal on the\nRegulation, this Article lays down common rules for the designation and\nclassification of goods and services. These rules follow the principles\nestablished by the Court of Justice[15],\naccording to which goods and services for which protection is sought need to be\nidentified by the applicant with sufficient clarity and precision to enable the\ncompetent authorities and businesses to determine the extent of protection the\ntrade mark confers. The general indications of the class headings of the Nice\nClassification may be used to identify goods or services provided that such\nidentification is sufficiently clear and precise. Article 40 further clarifies\nthat the use of general terms has to be interpreted as including only all goods\nor services clearly covered by the literal meaning of the term. \n- Ex officio examination (Article 41)\nIn line with the Regulation, this Article\nprovides that the ex officio examination of whether a trade mark application is\neligible for registration shall be confined to the absence of grounds\nconcerning the mark itself. The ex-officio examination of relative grounds\ncreates several unnecessary barriers to the registration of trade marks. Companies\nare obliged to undergo superfluous expenses and delays and they often fall\nvictim to extortion. The earlier right on which the objection is based may not\nbe used by its owner, which means that the offices concerned raise an objection\non the basis of a right that could not have been validly relied on by its\nproprietor to prevent the registration or use of a later mark. Hence, the ex\nofficio system leads to artificial disputes, and distorts competition by\nerecting unjustified barriers to market entry.\nFinally, the ex officio approach creates\nlegal uncertainty, since offices applying the ex-officio system raise\nobjections, as far as earlier rights are concerned, only on the basis of\nearlier registered rights that have been filed for identical or similar goods\nand services. Accordingly, they cannot offer a guarantee that an application\nwhich successfully passes the ex-officio control will not subsequently be\nopposed on the basis of a mark which has acquired reputation in the marketplace\nand/or on the basis of an earlier well-known mark that has not been registered.\nHowever, this leads to an unacceptable duplication of procedures which are both\ntime consuming and inefficient.\n- Fees (Article 44)\nIn order to reduce the potential of\ncluttering of the registries, this Article aims at aligning the fee structure\nof offices by making the registration and renewal of a trade mark subject to\nthe payment of an additional (class) fee for each class of goods and services\nbeyond the first class which should be included in the initial\n(application/registration) fee.\n- Opposition procedure (Article 45)\nThis Article requires Member States to\nprovide for an efficient and expeditious administrative procedure to oppose the\nregistration of a trade mark application on the basis of earlier rights before\ntheir offices. An administrative opposition procedure is already available\nunder the Regulation and in almost all Member States. \n- Non use as defence in opposition\nproceedings (Article 46)\nIn line with the Regulation, this Article enables\nthe person applying for registration of a trade mark to raise the defence of\nnon-use in relation to an opposition filed by the proprietor of an earlier\ntrade mark where, at the filing date or date of priority of the later trade\nmark, the earlier trade mark has been registered for not less than five years. \n- Procedure for revocation or\ndeclaration of invalidity (Article 47)\nThis Article obliges Member States to\nprovide for an administrative procedure to challenge the validity of a trade\nmark registration before their offices. In some Member States, trade mark\napplicants and owners cannot challenge the validity of the earlier rights\nrelied upon against their trade mark in the same proceedings, but need to\ncontest the validity of a prior trade mark in court proceedings. This delays\nproeedings and usually requires the appointment of a qualified lawyer to\nprosecute the case. These systems are exceedingly long, cumbersome and\nexpensive. In comparison, the administrative cancellation procedures, as applied\nat OHIM and the National Offices, are much simpler since the validity of\nearlier rights can be raised as a defence in the same proceedings and without\nthe need for professional representation. In practice, this means that\napplicants for a Community trade mark may successfully defend themselves\nagainst an opposition and obtain a trade mark years earlier and at considerably\nless expense than a national applicant.\n- Non use as defence in proceedings\nseeking a declaration of invalidity (Article 48)\nIn line with the Regulation, this Article\nenables the person in whose name a trade mark has been registered to raise the\ndefence of non-use in proceedings for a declaration of invalidity based on\nearlier trade mark, where at the date of the application for a declaration of\ninvalidity the earlier trade mark has been registered for not less than five\nyears. \n\n5.4.                \nFacilitating cooperation between offices\n(Article 52)\n\nAs a complement to the legal framework for\ncooperation proposed in the context of the review of the Regulation, Article 52\nprovides a legal basis to facilitate cooperation between OHIM and the\nintellectual property offices of the Member States for the purpose of promoting\nconvergence of practices and the development of common tools. \n\u00ea 2008/95/EC\n(adapted)\n2013/0089 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nto approximate the laws of the Member\nStates relating to trade marks\n(Recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community \u00d6 on the\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\nparticular Article 95 \u00d6 114 \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[16],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00ea 2008/95/EC\nrecital 1 (adapted)\n\u00f0 new\n(1)              \n\u00f0 A number of amendments are to\nbe made to \u00ef The content of Council Directive\n89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 2008/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 22\nOctober 2008 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks[17] has been amended[18]. In the interests of clarity,\nand rationality the said \u00d6 that \u00d5 Directive should be codified \u00f0 recast \u00ef .\n\u00ea 2008/95/EC recital 2 (adapted)\n(2)              \nThe \u00d6 Directive\n2008/95/EC has harmonised central provisions of substantive \u00d5 trade mark laws applicable in the Member States before the\nentry into force of Directive 89/104/EEC contained disparities which may have\nimpeded \u00d6 which at\nthe time of adoption were considered as most directly affecting the functioning\nof the internal market by impeding \u00d5 the free\nmovement of goods and \u00d6 the \u00d5 freedom to\nprovide services \u00d6 in the\nUnion \u00d5 and may have distorted competition within the\ncommon market. It was therefore necessary to approximate the laws of the Member\nStates in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.\n\u00ea 2008/95/EC\nrecital 3 (adapted)\nIt is important not\nto disregard the solutions and advantages which the Community trade mark system\nmay afford to undertakings wishing to acquire trade marks.\n\u00ea 2008/95/EC\nrecital 4\nIt does not appear to be necessary to undertake\nfull-scale approximation of the trade mark laws of the Member States. It will\nbe sufficient if approximation is limited to those national provisions of law\nwhich most directly affect the functioning of the internal market.\n\u00f2 new\n(3)              \nTrade mark protection\nin the Member States coexists with protection available at Union level through\nEuropean trade marks which are intellectual property rights unitary in\ncharacter and valid throughout the Union as laid down in Council Regulation\n(EC) No 207/2009 of 26 February 2009 on the European trade mark[19]. Coexistence of trade mark\nsystems at national and Union level in fact constitutes a cornerstone of the\nUnion\u2019s approach to intellectual property protection. \n(4)              \nFurther to the\nCommission's Communication of 16 July 2008 on an Industrial Property Rights\nStrategy for Europe[20],\nthe Commission carried out a comprehensive evaluation of the overall\nfunctioning of the trade mark system in Europe as a whole, covering Union and\nnational levels and the interrelation between each other.\n(5)              \nIn its conclusions of\n25 May 2010 on the future revision of the Trade Mark system in the European\nUnion[21],\nthe Council called on the Commission to present proposals for the revision of\nRegulation (EC) No 207/2009 and Directive 2008/95/EC. In doing so, the revision\nof the latter should include measures to make it more consistent with\nRegulation (EC) No 207/2009 and would thus reduce the areas of divergence\nwithin the trade mark system in Europe as a whole. \n(6)              \nThe Commission\nconcluded in its Communication \u2018A Single Market for Intellectual Property\nRights\u2019 of 24 May 2011[22]\nthat in order to meet increased demands from stakeholders for faster, higher\nquality, more streamlined trade mark registration systems, which are more\nconsistent, user friendly, publicly accessible and technologically up-to-date,\nthere is a necessity to modernise the trade mark system in the Union as a whole\nand adapt it to the Internet era. \n(7)              \nConsultation and evaluation\nfor the purpose of this Directive has revealed that in spite of the previous\npartial harmonisation of national laws, the European business environment\nremains very heterogeneous, limiting the accessibility to trade mark protection\noverall and thus having a detrimental effect on competitiveness and growth. \n(8)              \nIn order to serve the objective of fostering and\ncreating a well functioning single market and to facilitate acquiring and\nprotecting trade marks in the Union, it is therefore necessary to go beyond the\nlimited scope of approximation achieved by Directive 2008/95/EC and extend\napproximation to all aspects of substantive trade mark law governing trade\nmarks protected through registration as covered by Regulation (EC) No 207/2009.\n\n(9)              \nFor the purpose of making trade mark\nregistrations throughout the Union easier to obtain and administer, it is\nessential to approximate not only provisions of substantive law but also\nprocedural rules. Therefore, principal procedural rules in the Member States\nand in the European trade mark system, including those in respect of which\ndivergences cause major problems for the functioning of the internal market,\nshould be aligned. As regards procedures under national law it is sufficient to\nlay down general principles, leaving the Member States free to establish more\nspecific rules. \n(10)          \nIt is fundamental to\nensure that registered trade marks enjoy the same protection under the legal\nsystems of all the Member States, and that the protection of trade marks at the\nnational level is the same as the protection of European trade marks. In line\nwith the extensive protection granted to European trade marks which have a\nreputation in the Union, extensive protection should also be granted at\nnational level to all registered trade marks which have a reputation in the\nMember State concerned.\n\u00ea 2008/95/EC recital 5 (adapted)\n(11)          \nThis Directive should not deprive the Member\nStates of the right to continue to protect trade marks acquired through use but\nshould take them into account only in regard to the \u00d6 their \u00d5 relationship between them and \u00d6 with \u00d5 trade marks\nacquired by registration.\n\u00ea 2008/95/EC\nrecital 6\nMember States should also remain free to fix the\nprovisions of procedure concerning the registration, the revocation and the\ninvalidity of trade marks acquired by registration. They can, for example,\ndetermine the form of trade mark registration and invalidity procedures, decide\nwhether earlier rights should be invoked either in the registration procedure\nor in the invalidity procedure or in both and, if they allow earlier rights to\nbe invoked in the registration procedure, have an opposition procedure or an ex\nofficio examination procedure or both. Member States should remain free to\ndetermine the effects of revocation or invalidity of trade marks.\n\u00ea 2008/95/EC\nrecital 8 (adapted)\n\u00f0 new\n(12)          \nAttainment of the objectives at which this\napproximation of laws is aiming requires that the conditions for obtaining and\ncontinuing to hold a registered trade mark be, in general, identical in all\nMember States.\n(13)          \nTo this end, it is necessary to list examples of\nsigns which may constitute a trade mark, provided that such signs are capable\nof distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other\nundertakings. \u00f0 In order to fulfil the objectives of the registration\nsystem for trade marks, which are to ensure legal certainty and sound\nadministration, it is also essential to require that the sign is capable of\nbeing represented in a manner which allows for a precise determination of the\nsubject of protection. A sign should therefore be permitted to be represented\nin any appropriate form, and thus not necessarily by graphic means, as long as\nthe representation offers satisfactory guarantees to that effect. \u00ef\n(14)          \n\u00d6 Furthermore, \u00d5 Tthe\ngrounds for refusal or invalidity concerning the trade mark itself, for example, \u00d6 including \u00d5 the absence of\nany distinctive character, or concerning conflicts between the trade mark and\nearlier rights, should be listed in an exhaustive manner, even if some of these\ngrounds are listed as an option for the Member States which should therefore be\nable to maintain or introduce those grounds in their legislation. Member States\nshould be able to maintain or introduce into their legislation grounds of\nrefusal or invalidity linked to conditions for obtaining and continuing to hold\na trade mark for which there is no provision of approximation, concerning, for\nexample, the eligibility for the grant of a trade mark, the renewal of the\ntrade mark or rules on fees, or related to the non-compliance with procedural\nrules.\n\u00ea 2008/95/EC\nrecital 9\nIn order to reduce the total number of trade marks\nregistered and protected in the Community and, consequently, the number of\nconflicts which arise between them, it is essential to require that registered\ntrade marks must actually be used or, if not used, be subject to revocation. It\nis necessary to provide that a trade mark cannot be invalidated on the basis of\nthe existence of a non-used earlier trade mark, while the Member States should\nremain free to apply the same principle in respect of the registration of a\ntrade mark or to provide that a trade mark may not be successfully invoked in\ninfringement proceedings if it is established as a result of a plea that the\ntrade mark could be revoked. In all these cases it is up to the Member States\nto establish the applicable rules of procedure.\n\u00ea 2008/95/EC\nrecital 10\nIt is fundamental, in order to facilitate the free\nmovement of goods and services, to ensure that registered trade marks enjoy the\nsame protection under the legal systems of all the Member States. This should\nnot, however, prevent the Member States from granting at their option extensive\nprotection to those trade marks which have a reputation.\n\u00f2 new\n(15)          \nIn order to ensure\nthat the levels of protection afforded to geographical indications by other\ninstruments of Union law are applied in a uniform and exhaustive manner in the\nexamination of absolute and relative grounds for refusal throughout the Union,\nthis Directive should include the same provisions in relation to geographical\nindications as contained in Regulation (EC) No 207/2009. \n\u00ea 2008/95/EC recital 11\n(16)          \nThe protection afforded by the registered trade\nmark, the function of which is in particular to guarantee the trade mark as an\nindication of origin, should be absolute in the case of identity between the\nmark and the sign and the goods or services. The protection should apply also\nin the case of similarity between the mark and the sign and the goods or\nservices. It is indispensable to give an interpretation of the concept of\nsimilarity in relation to the likelihood of confusion. The likelihood of\nconfusion, the appreciation of which depends on numerous elements and, in\nparticular, on the recognition of the trade mark on the market, the association\nwhich can be made with the used or registered sign, the degree of similarity\nbetween the trade mark and the sign and between the goods or services\nidentified, should constitute the specific condition for such protection. The\nways in which likelihood of confusion may be established, and in particular the\nonus of proof, should be a matter for national procedural rules which should\nnot be prejudiced by this Directive.\n\u00f2 new\n(17)          \nIn order to ensure\nlegal certainty and full consistency with the principle of priority, under\nwhich an earlier registered trade mark takes precedence over later registered\ntrade marks, it is necessary to lay down that the enforcement of rights\nconferred by a trade mark should be without prejudice to the rights of\nproprietors acquired prior to the filing or priority date of the trade mark.\nThis is in conformity with Article 16(1) of the Agreement on trade related\naspects of intellectual property rights of 15 April 1994 (hereinafter: \u2018TRIPS Agreement\u2019)[23].\n(18)          \nIt is appropriate to\nprovide that an infringement\nof a trade mark can only be established if there is a finding that the\ninfringing mark or sign is used in the course of trade for purposes of\ndistinguishing goods or services as to their commercial origin. Uses for other\npurposes should be subject to the provisions of national law.\n(19)          \nIn order to ensure\nlegal certainty and clarity, it is necessary to clarify that not only in the\ncase of similarity but also in case of an identical sign being used for\nidentical goods or services, protection should be granted to a trade mark only if\nand to the extent that the main function of the trade mark, which is to\nguarantee the commercial origin of the goods or services, is adversely\naffected. \n(20)          \nInfringement of a\ntrade mark should also comprise the use of the sign as a trade name or similar\ndesignation as long as the use is made for the purposes of distinguishing goods\nor services as to their commercial origin.\n(21)          \nIn order to ensure\nlegal certainty and full consistency with specific Union legislation, it is appropriate\nto provide that the proprietor of a trade mark should be entitled to prohibit a\nthird party from using a sign in a comparative advertising where such\ncomparative advertising is contrary to Directive 2006/114/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 concerning misleading and\ncomparative advertising[24].\n(22)          \nWith the aim of\nstrengthening trade mark protection and combatting counterfeiting more\neffectively, the proprietor of a registered trade mark should be entitled to\nprevent third parties from bringing goods into the customs territory of the Member\nState without being released for free circulation there, where such goods come\nfrom third countries and bear without authorization a trade mark which is\nessentially identical to the trade mark registered in respect of such goods.\n(23)          \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order\nto more effectively prevent the entry of infringing goods, particularly in the\ncontext of sales over the Internet, the proprietor should be entitled to\nprohibit the importing of such goods into the Union where it is only the\nconsignor of the goods who acts for commercial purposes.\n(24)          \nIn order to enable\nproprietors of registered trade marks to fight counterfeiting more effectively,\nthey should be entitled to prohibit the affixing of an infringing trade mark to\ngoods and certain preparatory acts prior to the affixing. \n(25)          \nThe exclusive rights\nconferred by a trade mark should not entitle the proprietor to prohibit the use\nof signs or indications which are used fairly and in accordance with honest\npractices in industrial and commercial matters. In order to create equal\nconditions for trade names and trade marks against the background that trade\nnames are regularly granted unrestricted protection against later trade marks,\nsuch use should be considered to include the use of one\u2019s own personal name. It\nshould further include the use of descriptive or non-distinctive signs or\nindications in general. Furthermore, the proprietor should not be entitled to\nprevent the general fair and honest use of the mark for identifying or\nreferring to the goods or services as those of the proprietor.\n(26)          \nIt follows from the\nprinciple of free movement of goods that the proprietor of a trade mark must\nnot be entitled to prohibit its use by a third party in relation to goods which\nhave been put into circulation in the Union, under the trade mark, by him or\nwith his consent, unless the proprietor has legitimate reasons to oppose\nfurther commercialisation of the goods. \n\u00ea 2008/95/EC recital 12\n(27)          \nIt is important, for reasons of legal certainty\nand without inequitably prejudicing the interests of a proprietor of an earlier\ntrade mark, to provide that the latter may no longer request a declaration of\ninvalidity nor may he oppose the use of a trade mark subsequent to his own of\nwhich he has knowingly tolerated the use for a substantial length of time,\nunless the application for the subsequent trade mark was made in bad faith.\n\u00f2 new\n(28)          \nIn order to ensure\nlegal certainty and safeguard trade mark rights legitimately acquired, it is\nappropriate and necessary to lay down, without affecting the principle that the\nlater trade mark cannot be enforced against the earlier trade mark, that proprietors of earlier trade marks should\nnot be entitled to obtain refusal or invalidation or to oppose the use of a\nlater trade mark when the later trade mark was acquired at a time when the\nearlier trade mark was liable to be declared invalid or revoked, for example\nbecause it had not yet acquired distinctiveness through use, or when the\nearlier trade mark could not be enforced against the later trade mark because\nthe necessary conditions were not applicable, for example when the earlier mark\nhad not yet obtained reputation.\n(29)          \nTrade marks fulfil\ntheir purpose of distinguishing goods or services and allowing consumers to\nmake informed choices only when they are actually used on the market. A\nrequirement of use is also necessary in order to reduce the total number of\ntrade marks registered and protected in the Union and, consequently, the number\nof conflicts which arise between them. It is therefore essential to require\nthat registered trade marks must actually be used in connection with the goods\nor services for which they are registered, or, if not used, must be liable to\nbe revoked.\n(30)          \nConsequently a registered\ntrade mark should only be protected in so far as it is actually used and an\nearlier registered trade mark should not enable its proprietor to oppose or\ninvalidate a later trade mark if that proprietor has not put its trade mark to\ngenuine use. Furthermore, Member States should provide that a trade mark may\nnot be successfully invoked in infringement proceedings if it is established as\na result of a plea that the trade mark could be revoked or, when the action is\nbrought against a later right, could have been revoked at the time when the\nlater right was acquired. \n(31)          \nIt is appropriate to\nprovide that, where the seniority of a national mark has been claimed for a\nEuropean trade mark and the national mark has thereafter been surrendered or\nallowed to lapse, the validity of that national mark may still be challenged.\nThe challenge should be limited to situations where the national mark could\nhave been declared invalid or revoked at the time the mark was removed from the\nregister.\n(32)          \nFor reasons of\ncoherence and in order to facilitate the commercial exploitation of trade marks\nin the Union, the rules applicable to trade marks as objects of property should\nbe aligned with those already in place for European trade marks, and should\ninclude rules on assignment and transfer, licensing, rights in rem, levy of\nexecution and insolvency proceedings. \n(33)          \nCollective trade marks\nhave proven a useful instrument for promoting goods or services with specific\ncommon properties. It is therefore appropriate to subject national collective\ntrade marks to rules similar to the rules applicable to European collective\nmarks.\n(34)          \nIn order to improve\nand facilitate access to trade mark protection and to increase legal certainty\nand predictability, the procedure for the registration of trade marks in the\nMember States should be efficient and transparent and should follow rules\nsimilar to those applicable to European trade marks. With a view to achieving a\nconsistent and balanced trade mark system both at national and Union level, all\nthe central industrial property offices of the Member States should therefore\nlimit their examination ex officio of whether a trade mark application is\neligible for registration to the absence of absolute grounds for refusal only.\nThis should however not prejudice the right of those offices to provide, upon\nrequest of applicants, searches for earlier rights on a purely informative\nbasis and without any prejudice to or binding effect on the further\nregistration process, including subsequent opposition proceedings.\n(35)          \nIn order to ensure\nlegal certainty with regard to the scope of trade mark rights and to facilitate\naccess to trade mark protection, the designation and classification of goods\nand services covered by a trade mark application should follow the same rules\nin all Member States and should be aligned on those applicable to European\ntrade marks. In order to enable the competent authorities and economic\noperators to determine the extent of the trade mark protection sought on the\nbasis of the application alone, the designation of goods and services should be\nsufficiently clear and precise. The use of general terms should be interpreted\nas including only goods and services clearly covered by the literal meaning of\nthe term.\n(36)          \nFor the purpose of\nensuring effective trade mark protection, Member States should make available\nan efficient administrative opposition procedure, allowing proprietors of\nearlier trade mark rights to oppose the registration of a trade mark\napplication. Furthermore, in order to offer efficient means of revoking or\ndeclaring invalid trade marks, Member States should provide for an\nadministrative procedure for revocation or declaration of invalidity similar to\nthat applicable to European trade marks at Union level.\n(37)          \nMember States' central\nindustrial property offices should cooperate with each other and with the\nEuropean Union Trade Marks and Designs Agency (\u2018the Agency\u2019) in all fields of\ntrade mark registration and administration in order to promote convergence of\npractices and tools, such as the creation and updating of common or connected\ndatabases and portals for consultation and search purposes. The offices of the\nMember States and the Agency should further cooperate in all other areas of\ntheir activities which are relevant for the protection of trade marks in the\nUnion.\n\u00ea 2008/95/EC recital 7\n(38)          \nThis Directive should not exclude the\napplication to trade marks of provisions of law of the Member States other than\ntrade mark law, such as the provisions relating to unfair competition, civil\nliability or consumer protection.\n\u00ea 2008/95/EC recital 13 (adapted)\n(39)          \nAll Member States are bound by the Paris\nConvention for the Protection of Industrial Property \u00d6 (Paris Convention) and the TRIPS Agreement \u00d5.
