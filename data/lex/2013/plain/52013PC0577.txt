To\r\nthis end, in the above-mentioned European Council Decision, Mayotte has been added to the list of outermost regions in Articles 349 and 355(1) of\r\nthe TFEU. Union legislation on VAT (Directive 2006/112/EC[1]) and excise duties (Directive 2008/118/EC[2]) will therefore apply in Mayotte after the change of status. In substance, the objective of this proposal is to\r\nbring Mayotte's situation into line with that of other French outermost\r\nregions by excluding it from the scope of Directives 2006/112/EC and\r\n2008/118/EC. Furthermore, by referring to Articles 349 and 355(1) of the\r\nTFEU, the intention is to make it clearer that all these regions, including Mayotte, are excluded from the scope of these Directives.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n 305 || In substance the only change made by this proposal concerns the region of Mayotte. Given its similar situation to that of other French outermost regions, the objective of the proposal is to ensure that it is subject to the same treatment under the two above\u2011mentioned directives when it becomes an outermost region on 1 January 2014. The proposal will not have any impact on the situation of the other French outermost regions. In order to make it clear that any change in the status of all these regions - including Mayotte - under national law does not have any bearing on their situation under the above-mentioned directives, it is proposed that their designation should be changed and reference made to Articles 349 and 355(1) of the TFEU from now on. Thus, there are no grounds for an impact assessment and the Commission has therefore not carried one out. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n Summary of the proposed measures The proposal states that Directives 2006/112/EC and 2008/118/EC do not apply to the French outermost regions listed in Articles 349 and 355(1) of the TFEU. \n Legal basis Article 113 of the TFEU. \n Principle of subsidiarity Article 113 of the TFEU asks the Council to adopt provisions for the harmonisation of legislation concerning turnover taxes and excise duties. Only the European Union is competent to define the territory to which harmonised legislation applies. The proposal therefore complies with the principle of subsidiarity. \n Principle of proportionality The proposal complies with the principle of proportionality for the following reasons. The objective of the proposal is to give Mayotte the same status as that which has long applied in Guadeloupe, French Guyana, Martinique and R\u00e9union. It clarifies the status of the French part of Saint Martin without modifying it. \n Choice of instruments \n Proposed instrument: Council Directive on the basis of Article 113 of the Treaty. \n Other instruments would not have been appropriate for the following reasons. As the purpose is to amend two Directives, the same legal form must be used. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe proposal has no impact on the budget of the\r\nEuropean Union.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nArticles 1 and 2 make the same amendment\r\nto two articles of Directives 2006/112/EC and 2008/118/EC, which relate to\r\nthe territorial scope of these two Directives, replacing 'French overseas\r\ndepartments' by 'the French outermost regions listed in Articles 349\r\nand 355(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union'.\nThis new wording makes it clear that any change\r\nin the national law of these territories will not have any bearing on their\r\nsituation with respect to the two Directives. \nThe situation of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy does not need\r\nto be examined as this territory ceased to be an outermost region on\r\n1 January 2012 pursuant to European Council Decision 2010/718/EU\r\nof 29 October 2010.\nGiven the simplicity of the transposition\r\nmeasures to be implemented, the Commission does not require explanatory\r\ndocuments to carry out its task of overseeing the transposition of the\r\nDirectives. The individual transposition measures to be notified should be\r\nsufficiently self-explanatory.\n2013/0280 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\namending Directives 2006/112/EC and\r\n2008/118/EC as regards the French outermost regions and Mayotte in particular\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 113 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[3],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],\nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With\r\nDecision 2012/419/EU amending the status of Mayotte with regard to the\r\nEuropean Union[5],\r\nthe European Council has decided that, from 1 January 2014, the\r\nstatus of Mayotte will be that of outermost region within the meaning of\r\nArticle 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)\r\ninstead of that of an overseas country or territory (OCT) within the meaning of\r\nArticle 355(2) of the TFEU. To this end, under the above-mentioned\r\nEuropean Council Decision, Mayotte has been added to the list of outermost\r\nregions in Articles 349 and 355(1) of the TFEU. Community tax law shall\r\ntherefore apply in Mayotte after this change of status.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards added value tax\r\n(VAT) and excise duties, Mayotte is in a situation similar to that of the\r\nexisting French outermost regions (Guadeloupe, French Guyana, Martinique,\r\nR\u00e9union and Saint-Martin), which fall outside the territorial scope of Council\r\nDirective 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system\r\nof value added tax[6],\r\nand Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning\r\nthe general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC[7]. Although the existing\r\nprovisions of these two Directives exclude the 'French overseas\r\ndepartments' from their territorial scope and Mayotte enjoys that status under\r\nFrench law, it is necessary to adapt the two Directives as Mayotte was not\r\npart of the Union territory when these Directives were adopted. Article 6\r\nof Directive 2006/112/EC and Article 5 of Directive 2008/118/EC must\r\ntherefore be amended in order to include Mayotte in these provisions.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to make it clear\r\nthat Mayotte and the other French outermost regions are excluded from the scope\r\nof Directives 2006/112/EC and 2008/118/EC regardless of any change in\r\ntheir status under French law, reference should be made to Articles 349\r\nand 355(1) of the TFEU for all these regions.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directives 2006/112/EC\r\nand 2008/118/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nArticle 6(1)(c) of\r\nDirective 2006/112/EC shall be replaced by the following:\n'c) the French outermost regions listed in\r\nArticles 349 and 355(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion;'.\nArticle 2\nArticle 5 of\r\nDirective 2008/118/EC is amended as follows:\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Paragraph (2)(b) is\r\nreplaced by the following:\n'b) the French outermost regions listed in\r\nArticles 349 and 355(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union;'.\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Paragraph (5) is replaced\r\nby the following:\n'France may give notice, by means of a\r\ndeclaration, that this Directive and the Directives referred to in\r\nArticle 1 apply to the territories referred to in paragraph (2)(b) \u2014\r\nsubject to measures to adapt to their extreme remoteness \u2014 in respect of all or\r\nsome of the excise goods referred to in Article 1, as from the first day\r\nof the second month following deposit of such declaration.'\nArticle 3\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States shall adopt\r\nand publish, no later than 31 December 2013, the laws, regulations\r\nand administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
