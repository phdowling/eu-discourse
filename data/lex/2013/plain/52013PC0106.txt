This Regulation is the\nproposed single Common Market Organisation for agricultural products (sCMO)\nafter its adaptation to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) towards 2020 and\nto the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2014-2020.\n\u00b7              \nto align it with Council Regulation [COM(2011) 629\nfinal] determining measures on fixing aids and refunds related to the common\norganisation of the markets in agricultural products \n\u00b7              \nto update the Annexes to the current Regulation\n(EC) No 1216/2009 and to integrate the Annexes I and II to implementing\nRegulation (EC) No 578/2010 in the basic act, taking into account that\nRegulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 [COM(2011) 626 final] does not provide for an Annex\nreplacing Annex XX to Regulation (EU) No 1234/2007.\n\u00b7              \nto align the common system of trade for\novalbumin and lactalbumin, actually laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No\n614/2009 of 7 July 2009 on the common system of trade for ovalbumin and\nlactalbumin[4],\nto the Lisbon Treaty and its differentiation between delegated and implementing\npowers. For reasons of rationalisation, harmonisation and simplification, the\ncommon system of trade for ovalbumin and lactalbumin- processed agricultural\nproducts which are not included in Annex I to the Treaty and which do not fall\nunder the single Common market organisation for agricultural products \u2013 is\nproposed to be integrated in the trade regime applicable to certain goods\nresulting from the processing of agricultural products, actually laid down in\nRegulation (EC) No 1216/2009. \n\u00b7              \nto simplify and update the current legal text\nwhich, although codified in 2009, has been in place since 1993 without major\nchanges, improve its readability and its understandability and provide a more\nclear and solid legal basis for implementing rules. For reasons of clarity and\nsimplification, overlaps with other legal texts such as Regulation (EEC) No\n2913/1992 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs code[5], Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of\n23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common\nCustoms Tariff[6]\nand Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common\norganisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain\nagricultural products (Single CMO Regulation)[7]\nhave been removed.\n\u00b7              \nto create a solid legal framework for the\nmanagement of the reduced import duties and import quotas as provided for by\nFree Trade Agreements (FTAs) and for the management of the export refund system\nand adapt the text to current practices in FTAs and export refunds.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The alignment to the Lisbon Treaty of\nthe sCMO concerns the following point:\n\u00b7              \nthe common organisation for agricultural markets\nand the trade regime for processed agricultural products contain similar provisions\nabout the import or export regime for agricultural products and processed\nagricultural products respectively (such as by example: reduced import duties,\nadditional import duties, import quotas, export refunds, export licenses/refund\ncertificates, etc \u2026). They also confer implementing power to the Commission\nconcerning similar competences. Therefore, there should be a parallelism in the\nway both regulations are adapted to the Lisbon Treaty.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The adaptation to the options taken\nfor the sCMO after 2013 in comparison to the current legal texts (Regulation\n(EC) No 1234/2007 and Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009) concerns the following:\n\u00b7              \nAnnex XX of Council Regulation(EC) No 1234/2007\nand Annex XVII of Regulation No \u2026/\u2026 COM (2010) 799 final] provide for a list of\nprocessed goods that are eligible for the granting of export refunds on\nexportation of certain agricultural products used for their manufacturing.\nRegulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 [COM(2011) 626 final] provides in article 133(1)b that\nexport refunds may be granted for certain agricultural products to be exported\nin the form of processed goods in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009.\nTherefore, this proposal establishes in Annex II the list of non-Annex I goods\nthat are eligible for export refunds.\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to maintain the statu-quo,\nthe proposal contains the following Annexes:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex I is the list with processed\nagricultural products and replaces the current Annex II to Regulation (EC) No\n1216/2009;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex II is the list with non-Annex I\ngoods and replaces the current Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 578/2010 of 29\nJune 2010 on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009 as\nregards the system of granting export refunds for certain agricultural products\nexported in the form of goods not listed in Annex I to the Treaty, and the\ncriteria for fixing the amount of such refunds[8]\nand replaces also the current Annex XX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007;\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex III is the list with basic\nproducts used for the manufacture of non-Annex I goods and replaces the current\nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 578/2010;\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex IV is the list with processed\nagricultural products on which additional import duties may be levied and replaces\nthe current Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009;\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex V is the list with agricultural\nproducts used for the manufacture of processed agricultural products and\nreplaces the current Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly it is appropriate to\nrepeal Regulations (EC) No 1216/2009 and (EC) No 614/2009.\n(2)         \nGeneral context\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delegated and implementing powers\nArticles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) establish a clear distinction between\non the one hand the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative\nacts and, on the other, the powers conferred on the Commission to adopt\nimplementing acts:\n\u00b7              \nArticle 290 TFEU allows the legislator to\ndelegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general\napplication to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a\nlegislative act. Legal acts adopted by the Commission by virtue of this Article\nare referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as \"delegated\nacts\" (Article 290(3)).\n\u00b7              \nArticle 291 TFEU requires Member States to adopt\nall measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts.\nThose acts can confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform\nconditions for implementing them are needed. Legal acts adopted by the\nCommission by virtue of this Article are referred to in the terminology used by\nthe Treaty as \"implementing acts\" (Article 291(4)).\nThe proposed alignment to\nthe new requirements resulting from Articles 290 and 291 TFEU is based on a\ncareful qualification of the existing Commission powers under Regulations (EC)\nNo 1216/2009 and 614/2009 as \"delegated\" or \"implementing\"\nwhich was operated against the background of the implementing measures adopted\nby the Commission on the basis of its current powers. \nFollowing this exercise,\na draft proposal has been prepared. This project provides the Legislator with\nthe power to define the essentials of the trade arrangements applicable to\nprocessed agricultural products/non-Annex I goods. The general guidelines for\nthese arrangements and the general principles that underlie them are determined\nby the Legislator. For example, the general principles for reducing the\nagricultural part of the import duties, for the management of import quotas or\nfor granting export refunds are fixed by the Legislator. Similarly, the Legislator\nlays down the principle of establishing a system of refund certificates, the\nfundamental elements of the rules for fixing export refund rates and the\nexchange of information.\nPursuant to Article 290\nTFEU, the Legislator gives the Commission the power to complete or modify\ncertain non-essential elements of a legislative act. A Commission delegated act\nmay therefore determine the additional elements necessary for the proper\nfunctioning of the trade arrangements established by the Legislator. For example,\nthe Commission shall adopt delegated acts in order to lay down the rights (to\nget refunds for the export of non-Annex I goods) and obligations (to apply for\nrefunds on export of non-Annex I goods) derived from the issue of a refund\ncertificate and, if necessary depending on the economic situation, to specify\nthe cases where a guarantee is not required for the issuance of certificates.\nThe Commission will also be given the power to adapt the annexes to the\nproposed Regulation to international agreements concluded or provisionally applied in accordance with\nArticle 218 TFEU. Similarly, the Legislator delegates to the Commission the\npower to adopt appropriate rules in order to ensure the implementation of the\nUnion\u2019s preferential trade arrangements and international commitments and to\navoid distortion of trade. \nMember States in\naccordance with Article 291 TFEU are responsible for implementing the regime\nestablished by the Legislator. However, it is necessary to ensure uniform\nimplementation of the scheme in the Member States. Therefore, the Legislator\ngives the Commission powers of implementation, in accordance with Article\n291(2) TFEU as regards the uniform conditions for the implementation of the\ntrade arrangements and a general framework of measures and procedures that\nMember States shall implement.\nThose powers should be\nexercised in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 182/2011 of the European\nParliament and the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and\ngeneral principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of\nthe Commission's exercise of implementing powers[9].\nThe examination procedure should be used for\nthe adoption of the acts implementing this Regulation given that those acts\nrelate to the CAP as referred to in point (ii) of Article 2(2)(b) of Regulation\n(EU) No 182/2011. \nIn order to ensure the efficiency and smooth\nfunctioning of the trade arrangements, powers should also be conferred on the\nCommission to carry out certain administrative or management tasks in respect\nof: fixing the representative prices and trigger volumes for the purposes of\nimport duties and fixing the level of the additional import duty, limiting,\nrejecting or suspending the issuing of import licences for ovalbumin and\nlactalbumin, ensuring that the available quantities of tariff quota are not\nexceeded and that the unused quantities of a tariff quota are reallocated, the\nmanagement of the process to guarantee that the quantities available under the\ninward processing regime without prior examination of the economic conditions\nare not exceeded and the technical measures of adjustment of the refund\ncertificate system for keeping the expenditure within available budget limits\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council powers under Article 43(3)\nTFEU\nArticle 43(3) TFEU provides that \"the Council,\non a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt measures on fixing prices,\nlevies, aids and quantitative limitations. This provision forms an exception\nfrom Article 43(2) TFEU which requires the ordinary legislative procedure to be\nused \"to establish the common organisation of agricultural markets and the\nother provisions necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the common\nagricultural policy\". It also constitutes an exception from Article 207(2)\nTFEU which equally requires the ordinary\nlegislative procedure to be used to \u201cadopt the measures defining the framework\nfor implementing the common commercial policy\u201d.\nAs an exception, Article 43(3) TFEU needs\ntherefore to be interpreted restrictively so as to ensure that the Legislator\ncan exercise its legislative prerogatives under Article 43(2) and Article\n207(2) TFEU. This includes the Legislator regulating the fundamental elements\nof the common agricultural policy and of the Common commercial policy and\ntaking the political decisions that shape their structure, and determine their\ninstruments and effects. Against this background the specific procedure laid\ndown in Art. 43(3) TFEU should only be applied where an issue referred to in\nthat provision does not form part of the fundamental policy decisions reserved\nto the Legislator under Article 43(2) and 207(2) TFEU. Therefore, where such an\nissue is inextricably linked with the political substance of the\ndecisions to be taken by the Legislator, Article 43(3) TFEU should not be\napplied. \nConsequently, the proposal is based on the\nfollowing principles:\n\u2013              \nThe structural parameters and fundamental\nelements of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Commercial Policy may\nonly be decided by the Legislator. For example, the export refund scheme for\nnon-Annex I goods established by Regulation 1216/2009 and all its elements\n(refund certificates, small exporters reserve) should stay at the Legislator's\nlevel, as these elements are inextricably linked to the definition of the\ncontent of the scheme established by the Legislator and the boundaries of this\nregime.\n\u2013              \nMeasures on fixing prices, levies, aids and\nquantitative limitations as referred to in Article 43(3), which do not fall in\nthe scope of Article 43(2) TFEU, shall be taken by the Council. For example,\nthe general principles for the fixation of export refund rates should be\ndetermined by the Council under Article 43(3) TFEU. Against this background, it\nis proposed that measures on the fixing of refund rates as referred to in\nArticle 43(3), which do not fall in the scope of Article 43(2) TFEU, shall be\ntaken by the Council. \nArticle 43(3) TFEU is an autonomous basis for\nthe adoption of legal acts by the Council. For fixing the refund rates Article\n43(3) TFEU applies and in the interest of clarity, the Commission has adopted a\nseparate proposal for a Council Regulation on fixing refunds which explicitly\nrefers to that provision. The Commission has submitted that proposal,\nwhich is in common with that needed in the context of the adaptation of the\nsingle CMO Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 to the Lisbon Treaty, in due course to\nthe Council (COM(2011) 629 final[10]).\n\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Common Agricultural policy post\n2013\nThe proposal of Regulation (EU) of the Council\nand of the Parliament No \u2026/\u2026 [COM(2011) 626 final] aims at adapting the\nsingle CMO to the Common Agricultural policy post 2013 and to the multiannual\nfinancial framework 2014-2020. It is currently the subject of long and\nexhausting discussions at Council and Parliament level. The\nproposed Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council is based on a careful examination of the new CMO post 2013\nproposal and the necessary adaptations of current legal arrangements on the\ntrade arrangements for processed agricultural products/non-Annex I goods in\norder to maintain the status quo. \nConsequently, the list containing the non-Annex\nI goods eligible for export refunds (Annex XX of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007,\nannex XVII of COM(2010) 799 final) is transferred from the single CMO to the\nRegulation laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods\nresulting from the processing of agricultural products.\n(3)         \nConsistency with other policies and\nobjectives of the Union\nThe proposal is in line with the Common\nAgricultural Policy and with the Common Commercial Policy.\nThe proposal is in line with the proposal to\nadapt the single CMO Regulation (EC) to the Lisbon Treaty (COM(2010) 799\nfinal).\nThe proposal is in line with the Common\nAgricultural Policy (CAP) post 2013 and in particular with the proposal to\nadapt the single CMO Regulation (EC) No \u2026/\u2026 [COM(2010) 799 final] to the post\n2013 CAP (COM(2011) 626 final).\nFor reasons of coherence and in order to avoid\na legal loophole, this proposal needs to be adapted to the outcome of the\ndiscussions in Council and Parliament about proposals (COM(2010) 799 final) and\n(COM(2011) 626 final).\nThe proposal is also in line with the Union\nCustoms legislation and in particular with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92\nof 12 October 1992 establishing the Common Customs Code and with Council Regulation\n(EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and\non the Common Customs Tariff. The latter two Regulations will also be aligned\nto the Lisbon Treaty. Therefore, once a final text of them is adopted, this\nproposal may need to be adjusted, accordingly. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n(1)         \n Consultation of interested parties\nMember States were informed and involved through\nthe channel of an expert group.\n(2)         \nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for consultation of\ninterested parties or for external expertise since the proposal for the\nalignment of Regulation No 1216/2009 to the Lisbon Treaty is an\ninter-institutional matter of relevance to all Council Regulations. \nThe same applies for the adaptation to the CAP\nafter 2013 and to the new MFF 2014-2020 which is a pure technical consequence\nof the adoption of the new Single CMO Regulation (EC) No \u2026/\u2026 [COM(2011) 626\nfinal].\n(3)         \nImpact assessment\nThere is no need for an impact assessment since\nthe proposal to align Regulation No 1216/2009 to the Lisbon Treaty is an\ninter-institutional matter of relevance to all Council Regulations and the\nalignment to the new Single CMO Regulation is a consequence of the new CAP\nafter 2013 and the new MFF 2014-2020.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n(1)         \nSummary of the proposed action\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Identify in Regulation (EC) No\n1216/2009 the delegated and implementing powers of the Commission and establish\nthe corresponding procedure for the adoption of these acts and this in parallel\nwith the Lisbon alignment of the sCMO (COM(2010) 799 final).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adapt Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009 to\nthe new Single CMO Regulation [COM (2011)626 final] in the context of the CAP\nafter 2013 and the new MFF 2014-2020.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Integrate the common system of trade\nfor ovalbumin and lactalbumin (Regulation (EC) No 614/2009) in the trade regime\nfor processed agricultural products (Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009).\n(2)         \nLegal basis\nArticle 43(2) and Article 207(2) of the Treaty\non the Functioning of the European Union.\n(3)         \nSubsidiarity principle\nCommercial policy is an exclusive competence of\nthe Union \u2013 therefore only the Union, and not individual Member States,\ncan legislate on trade matters. Agricultural policy is of shared competence\nbetween the EU and the Member States. This means that as long as the Union does\nnot legislate in this field, Member States maintain their competence. This\nproposal is limited to the adaptation of Regulations (EC) No 1216/2009 and (EC)\nNo 614/2009 to new requirements introduced by the Lisbon Treaty on one hand,\nand to the new Common Agricultural Policy after 2013 on the other hand and thus\nthe existing Union approach is not affected.\n(4)         \nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality\nprinciple which requires each decision and measure to be based on a fair\nassessment and balancing of interests, as well as on a reasonable choice of\nmeans . \n(5)         \nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: Regulation of the European\nParliament and of the Council.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason: direct application is due to the nature of the CAP and the\nCommon Commercial Policy and their management requirements and is an\nindispensable characteristic of CAP and Trade legislation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\nIMPLICATION \nThis measure does not involve any additional\nUnion expenditure\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL\nINFORMATION\nThe proposal will improve the comprehensibility\nand accessibility of the legal text laying down the trade arrangements\napplicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural\nproducts. It will consolidate the legal basis for its implementing Regulations\nand will align the text with existing Commission provisions for example by\nadding a provision allowing opening of import quotas and the way of managing them.\nIn addition it will remove inconsistencies in the current legal text such as in\nArticle 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009 that refers to Commission\nimplementing Regulation (EC) No 1460/96[11],\nwhile implementing Regulation (EC) No 1460/96 has Council Regulation (EC) No\n1216/2009 as a legal basis.\n2013/0063 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nlaying down the\ntrade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of\nagricultural products \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) and Article 207(2)\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\nCommission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\nEconomic and Social Committee[12],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure[13],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\n1216/2009 of 30 November 2009 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to\ncertain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products[14] and Council Regulation (EC) No\n614/2009 of 7 July 2009 on the common system of trade for ovalbumin and lactalbumin[15] need to be adapted as a\nconsequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, in particular as\nregards its introduction of a distinction between powers for the Commission to\nadopt delegated acts and powers for it to adopt implementing acts. Further\nadaptations are needed to improve the clarity and transparency of the existing\ntexts.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Until now the main\ninstrument of the common agricultural policy provided for in the Treaty has\nbeen Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a\ncommon organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for\ncertain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation)[16]. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the framework of the\nreform of the common agricultural policy Regulation (EU) No 1234/2007 is to be replaced,\nwith effect from 1 January 2014, by Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 of the European\nParliament and of the Council [COM (2011) 626 final][17]. Regulations (EC) No 1216/2009\nand (EC) No 614/2009 should be adapted to take account of that Regulation in\norder to maintain the coherence of the trade arrangements with third countries\nfor agricultural products on the one hand and for goods resulting from the\nprocessing of agricultural products on the other hand. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain agricultural\nproducts are used for manufacturing both processed agricultural products and\ngoods not listed in Annex I to the Treaty. It is necessary to take measures\nboth under the common agricultural policy and under the common commercial\npolicy in order to take account of the impact which trade in such products and\ngoods has on the achievement of the objectives of Article 39 of the Treaty and of\nthe effects which measures adopted to implement Article 43 of the Treaty have on\nthe economic position of those products and goods, given the differences between\nthe costs of procuring agricultural products in the Union and on the world\nmarket.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Union, a\ndistinction is drawn between agricultural products listed in Annex I to the\nTreaty and processed agricultural products not listed in that Annex in order to\ntake account of the different situations of agriculture and the food industry\nin the Union. The same distinction may not be drawn in certain third countries\nwith which the Union concludes agreements. Provision should therefore be made\nfor extending the general rules applicable to processed agricultural products\nnot listed in Annex I to the Treaty to certain agricultural products listed in that\nAnnex where an international agreement provides for the assimilation of those\ntwo types of products. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to prevent or\ncounteract adverse effects which imports of certain processed agricultural\nproducts could have on the Union market and on the efficiency of the common\nagricultural policy, it should be possible to subject imports of such products\nto payment of an additional duty if certain conditions are fulfilled.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ovalbumin and lactalbumin\nare processed agricultural products which are not included in Annex I to the\nTreaty. For reasons of harmonisation and simplification, the common system of\ntrade for ovalbumin and lactalbumin laid down in Regulation (EC) No 614/2009\nshould be integrated in the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods\nresulting from the processing of agricultural products. In view of the fact\nthat to a large extent, eggs can be substituted by ovalbumin and, to a certain\nextent, by lactalbumin, the trade arrangements for ovalbumin and lactalbumin\nshould correspond to those established for eggs.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to lay\ndown the main rules governing the trade arrangements applicable to processed\nagricultural products and non-Annex I goods resulting from the processing of\nagricultural products. It is also necessary to provide for the fixing of\nreduced import duties and tariff quotas and the granting of export refunds in\naccordance with those main rules. Those rules and provisions should take\naccount of the constraints on import duties and export subsidies arising from\nthe undertakings accepted by the Union under the WTO agreements and bilateral\nagreements.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the close links\nbetween the market for ovalbumin and lactalbumin and the market for eggs, it\nshould be possible to require the presentation of an import license for imports\nof ovalbumin and lactalbumin and suspend the inward processing arrangements for\novalbumin and lactalbumin where the Union market for those products or the\nmarket for eggs is disturbed or is liable to be disturbed by inward processing\narrangements of ovalbumin and lactalbumin. It should be made possible to make the\nissue of import licences for ovalbumin and lactalbumin and\nthe release for free circulation of such products covered by a licence subject\nto requirements as to the origin and provenance of the product\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take into\naccount the evolution of trade and market developments, the needs of the\nmarkets for ovalbumin and lactalbumin or the market for eggs and the results of\nthe monitoring of the imports of ovalbumin and lactalbumin, the power to adopt\nacts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of making the import of ovalbumin and lactalbumin for\nrelease for free circulation subject to the presentation of an import licence,\ndefining the rights and obligations derived from that import licence and its\nlegal effects, determining the level of tolerance as regards the respect of the\nobligation to import, laying down the rules as to the indication of the origin\nand provenance where that is compulsory, providing for the issue of import\nlicences and the release for free circulation to be subject to the presentation\nof a document issued by a third country or an entity certifying inter alia the\norigin, the authenticity and the quality characteristics of the products,\nestablishing the rules on transfer of the import licences, establishing the\nrules necessary for the reliability and the efficiency of the import licence\nsystem and providing for specific administrative assistance between Member\nStates where needed in order to prevent or deal with cases of fraud and\nirregularities, determining the cases where the presentation of an import\nlicence is not required and the cases where the lodging of the security is not\nrequired and laying down rules related to the application of horizontal\nprovisions on import licenses for agricultural products and of horizontal rules\non securities to import licenses for ovalbumin and\nlactalbumin. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain processed\nagricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty are obtained using\nagricultural products subject to the common agricultural policy. The duties\napplied to imports of those processed agricultural products should counterbalance\nthe difference between the world market prices and the prices on the Union\nmarket for the agricultural products used in their production while ensuring\nthe competitiveness of the processing industry concerned.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under certain preferential\nagreements reductions of import duties for processed agricultural products, which\nmay lead to a phasing out, are granted on the agricultural components of the import\nduties within the framework of the commercial policy of the Union. Those\nreductions should be established by reference to the agricultural components\napplicable to non-preferential trade.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The agricultural component of\nthe import duty should counterbalance the difference between prices for the\nagricultural products used in the production of the processed agricultural\nproducts in question on the world market and on the Union market. Therefore, it\nis necessary to maintain a close link between the calculation of the\nagricultural component of the import duty applicable to processed agricultural\nproducts and that applicable to agricultural products imported in the unaltered\nstate.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to implement the\ninternational agreements providing for the reduction or phasing out of import\nduties on processed agricultural products on the basis of specific agricultural\nproducts used or considered to have been used in the manufacturing of the\nprocessed agricultural products, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of\nestablishing a list of the specific agricultural products considered to have\nbeen used, establishing the equivalent quantities and the rules for the\nconversion of quantities of other agricultural products than those considered\nto have been used to equivalent quantities of those specific agricultural\nproducts, laying down the elements necessary for the calculation of the reduced\nagricultural component and the reduced additional duties and establishing the\nmethods of that calculation, establishing the appropriate documentary\nrequirements and laying down the negligible amounts for which the reduced\nagricultural components and additional duties on sugar and flour shall be fixed\nat zero.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Import tariff concessions\nmay be granted for unlimited quantities of the goods concerned or may be\ngranted for limited quantities falling under a tariff quota. Where, under\ncertain preferential agreements, tariff concessions are granted within tariff\nquotas, the quotas should be opened and managed by the Commission. For\npractical reasons, it is essential that the management of the non-agricultural\npart of the import duties of the goods for which tariff preferences have been\nagreed are subject to the same rules as the management of the agricultural component.\n\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the close links\nbetween the market for ovalbumin and lactalbumin and the market for eggs,\ntariff quotas for ovalbumin and lactalbumin should be opened and managed in the\nsame way as those for eggs under Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 [COM(2011) 626 final].\nWhere necessary, the method of management should take account of the supply\nneeds of the Union market and of the need to preserve its equilibrium and\nshould be based on methods used in the past, taking into account the rights\narising under the WTO agreements.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\nequitable market access for operators and equal treatment of operators, take\naccount of the supply requirements of the Union market and preserve the\nequilibrium of that market, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\n290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of laying\ndown the conditions which must be fulfilled in order to submit an application\nwithin a tariff quota and provisions relating to transfer of rights within a\ntariff quota, providing for the participation in a tariff quota to be subject\nto the presentation of an import license and the lodging of a security and laying\ndown provisions on documentary evidence, requirements or restrictions applicable\nto tariff quotas.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is possible that the\ndemand of the processing industries for agricultural raw materials cannot be\ncovered completely by Union raw materials under competitive conditions. Council\nRegulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs\nCode[18]\nadmits such goods under the inward processing arrangements subject to\nfulfilment of the economic conditions defined by Commission Regulation (EEC) No\n2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council\nRegulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code[19]. Under clearly defined\ncircumstances, economic conditions should be considered to be fulfilled for the\nadmission of certain quantities of agricultural products under the inward\nprocessing arrangements. Those quantities should be determined on the basis of\na supply balance. Fair access to the quantities available, equal treatment of\noperators and clarity should be assured by a system of inward processing\ncertificates issued by Member States.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nprudent and efficient management of the inward processing arrangements, taking\naccount of the situation on the Union market for the commodities concerned and\nof the needs and practices of the processing industries, the power to adopt\nacts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of establishing a list of specific agricultural products\nfor which inward processing certificates may be issued, laying down the conditions\nand eligibility requirements that operators need to fulfil in order to submit\nan application for an inward processing certificate, the rights derived from\nthe inward processing certificates and its legal effects, provisions relating\nto the transfer of those rights between operators and provisions on documentary\nevidence and establishing the rules necessary for the reliability and the\nefficiency of the inward processing certificate system. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Arrangements should be made\nfor granting export refunds, within the limit set by the Union's WTO\ncommitments, on certain agricultural products used in the manufacturing of\ngoods not listed in Annex I to the Treaty in order not to penalise producers of\nthose goods for the prices at which they are obliged to procure their supplies\nas a result of the common agricultural policy. Those refunds should only cover\nthe difference between the price of an agricultural product on the Union market\nand on the world market. Those arrangements should therefore be established as part\nof the trade arrangements for certain goods resulting from the processing of\nagricultural products. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The list of non-Annex I\ngoods qualifying for refunds should be established taking account of the impact\nof the difference between the prices of the agricultural products used in their\nproduction on the Union market and on the world market and the need to counterbalance\nthis difference in whole or in part in order to facilitate the exportation of\nthe agricultural products used in the non-Annex I goods concerned.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to ensure\nthat no export refund is granted for imported non-Annex I goods released for\nfree circulation which are re-exported, exported after processing or\nincorporated in other non-Annex I goods. As regards imported cereals, rice,\nmilk and milk products or eggs released for free circulation it is necessary to\nensure that no refund is granted where the goods are exported after processing or\nincorporated in non-Annex I goods.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The export refund rates for\nagricultural products exported in the form of non-Annex I goods should be fixed\nin accordance with the same rules and modalities and in accordance with the\nsame procedure as the export refund rates for agricultural products exported in\nthe unaltered state pursuant to Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 [COM(2011) 626 final]\nand Regulation (EC) No \u2026/\u2026 of the European Parliament and of the Council [COM(2011)\n629 final].\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the close\nrelationship between non-Annex I goods and the agricultural products which are\nused in the manufacturing of those non-Annex I goods, on the one hand, and the\ndifferences between those goods and products on the other hand, it is necessary\nto provide for the application of the horizontal rules and conditions relating\nto export refunds and export licenses laid down in and adopted pursuant to\nRegulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 [COM(2011) 626 final], to non-Annex I goods. It is also\nnecessary to provide for the application of horizontal provisions on\nsecurities, checks, verification and penalties laid down in and adopted\npursuant to Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil [COM(2011) 628 final][20]\nto non-Annex I goods.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take account of\nthe specific manufacturing processes and trading requirements of non-Annex I\ngoods incorporating certain agricultural products, the power to adopt acts in\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission\nin respect of establishing the rules relating to the definition and\ncharacteristics of the non-Annex I goods to be exported and the agricultural\nproducts used for their manufacture, rules on the calculation of the export\nrefunds for certain agricultural products exported after processing into\nnon-Annex I goods, rules on the proof of the composition of the exported non-Annex\nI goods, rules on the simplified proof of arrival at destination in the case of\ndifferentiated refunds, rules on the requirement of a declaration of the use of\ncertain imported agricultural products, rules on the assimilation of other\nagricultural products to basic products and on the determination of the\nreference quantity of each of the basic products, rules on the application for and\nthe issue of certificates for the export of certain non-Annex I goods to\ncertain destinations when provided for in an international agreement concluded\nby the Union in accordance with Article 218 of the Treaty, and rules on the\napplication of the horizontal provisions on export refunds for agricultural\nproducts and on securities, checks, verifications and penalties to non-Annex I\ngoods.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compliance with the export\nlimits arising from international agreements concluded by the Union in\naccordance with Article 218 of the Treaty should be ensured through the issuing\nof refund certificates for the reference periods laid down in the agreements taking\ninto account the annual amount provided for in respect of small exporters.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export refunds should be\ngranted up to the total amount available, depending on the particular situation\nof trade in non-Annex I goods. The system of refund certificates should\nfacilitate the efficient management of the amounts of refunds. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision should be made\nfor refund certificates issued by Member States to be valid throughout the\nUnion and for their issuance to be subject to the lodging of a security\nguaranteeing that the operator will apply for refunds. Rules should be laid\ndown for refunds under the advance fixing system to be granted for all the\napplicable refund rates and for the lodging and release of securities.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to monitor the\nexpenditure on export refunds and the implementation of the refund certificate\nsystem, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty\nshould be delegated to the Commission in respect of defining the rights and\nobligations derived from refund certificates, specifying the rules relating to\ntheir transfer, identifying the cases where the presentation of a refund\ncertificate or the lodging of a security is not required and specifying the\nlevel of tolerance in the event of non-respect of the obligation to apply for\nrefunds and rules on the application of horizontal rules on export licenses and\non securities to refund certificates.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When taking account of the\nimpact of targeted measures relating to export refunds consideration should be\ngiven to enterprises processing agricultural products in general and the\nsituation of small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. In view of the\nspecific needs of small exporters, a global amount should be allocated to them\nfor each budget year, and they should be exempted from the requirement to\nsubmit refund certificates under the export refund arrangements.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where pursuant to\nRegulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 [COM(2011) 626 final] measures with regard to export of\nan agricultural product are adopted and the export of non-Annex I goods with a\nhigh content of the agricultural product is likely to hinder the achievement of\nthe objective of those measures, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of\nproviding for equivalent measures to be taken with regard to exports of those non-Annex\nI goods. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under certain preferential\nagreements, the Union may limit import duties and amounts payable in respect of\nexports in order to counterbalance, in whole or in part, differences in the\nprice of agricultural products used in the production of the processed\nagricultural products or the non-Annex I goods in question. For those processed\nagricultural products and non-Annex I goods, it is necessary to establish that\nthose amounts are to be determined jointly as a part of the overall duty and are\nto counterbalance the differences between the prices of the agricultural\nproducts that have to be taken into account on the market of the country or the\nregion concerned and the Union market.. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the composition of\nprocessed agricultural products and non-Annex I goods may be relevant for the\nright application of the trade arrangements laid down in this Regulation, it\nshould be possible to establish their composition using qualitative and\nquantitative analyses.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to implement\ninternational agreements concluded by the Union and ensure clarity and\ncoherence with amendments to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July\n1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs\nTariff[21],\nthe power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of amending certain parts of this\nRegulation and its Annexes for those purposes.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision should be made for\nMember States to provide the Commission and each other with the information\nnecessary for the implementation of the trade arrangements for processed\nagricultural products and non-Annex I goods.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure an appropriate\nexchange of information between Member States and the Commission the power to\nadopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to\nthe Commission in respect of defining the nature and type of the information to\nbe communicated, the methods of communication, the rules on rights of access to\nthe information and information systems and the conditions and means of\npublication of this information.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid unnecessary\nadministrative burdens for operators and national authorities the power to\nadopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to\nthe Commission in respect of setting a threshold below which amounts are not to\nbe levied or granted in respect of import duties, additional import duties,\nreduced import duties, export refunds and amounts to be levied or payable when\noffsetting a jointly established price.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation as regards imports and\ninward processing arrangements, implementing powers should be conferred on the\nCommission in respect of measures determining the processed agricultural products\nto which additional import duties should apply in order to prevent or\ncounteract adverse effects on the Union market, measures for the application of\nthose additional import duties as regards time limits\nfor proving the import price, submitting documentary evidence, the lodging of a\nsecurity and determining the additional import duties, measures\nfixing the representative prices and trigger volumes for the purposes of\napplying additional import duties, and measures determining the level of those\nduties based on the difference between the

on the proof that the requirements for the use of those\nlicences have been fulfilled, on the issuing of replacement and duplicate\nimport licenses, on the treatment of import licences by the Member States, on\nthe exchange of information needed for the management of the system of import\nlicences for ovalbumin and lactalbumin and on the application of horizontal\nrules on import licenses and

are not exceeded, measures to\nreallocate unused quantities of the tariff quota,\nmeasures to adopt safeguard measures against imports\ninto the Union in accordance with Council Regulations (EC) No 260/2009 of 26\nFebruary 2009 on the common rules for imports[22]\nand (EC) No 625/2009 of 7 July 2009 on common rules for imports from certain\nthird countries[23]\nor safeguard measures provided for

issued,\nrejecting quantities applied for in respect of those certificates and\nsuspending the lodging of applications for inward processing certificates where\nlarge quantities are applied for, and measures suspending the use of processing\nor inward processing arrangements for ovalbumin and lactalbumin. \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation as regards exports and\ncertain general provisions, implementing powers should be conferred on the\nCommission in respect of measures on the application of refund rates, on the\nmethod of calculation of the export refunds, on the assimilation of certain products\nto basic products and the determination of the reference quantity of basic\nproducts, on the management of

this Regulation given that\nthose acts relate to the common agricultural policy as referred to in point\n(ii) of Article 2(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should adopt\nimmediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases\nrelating to safeguard measures against imports of processed agricultural\nproducts into the Union or to a disturbance or a potential disturbance of the\nUnion market requiring the suspension of the use of processing or inward\nprocessing arrangements for ovalbumin and lactalbumin, imperative grounds of\nurgency so require. \n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is of particular\nimportance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its\npreparatory work prior to adopting delegated
