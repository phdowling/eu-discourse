They affect the social and economic fabric and undermine the quality of\r\nlife of individuals, as well as the security of the Member States. Although\r\nconsumption of substances controlled under the UN Conventions on drugs[1], such as cocaine, ecstasy or\r\ncannabis (\u2018controlled drugs\u2019), seems to have stabilised in recent years[2], albeit at high levels, a major\r\nchallenge is to address new substances that emerge on the market at a rapid\r\nspeed. \nNew psychoactive substances, which imitate\r\nthe effects of controlled drugs and are often marketed as legal alternatives to\r\nthem because they are not subjected to similar control measures, and which have\r\nnumerous uses in the industry, are increasingly available in the Union. Between 1997 and 2012, Member States reported around 290 substances, with more than\r\none new substance notified every week in 2012. The number of reported substances\r\ntripled between 2009 and 2012 (from 24 to 73). \nA growing number of individuals, in particular\r\nyoung people, consume new psychoactive substances. However, these substances\r\ncan cause harms to individuals\u2019 health and safety, and can put burdens on\r\nsociety, just like controlled drugs do. The risks that new psychoactive\r\nsubstances can pose have prompted national authorities to submit them to\r\nvarious restriction measures. However, such national restriction measures have\r\nlimited effectiveness, since these substances can be moved freely in the\r\ninternal market - around 80% of the substances notified were detected in more\r\nthan one Member State. \nThe Commission Communication \"Towards\r\na stronger European response to drugs\"[3],\r\nadopted in October 2011, identified new psychoactive substances as one of the\r\nproblems requiring a firm response at the EU level.\nCouncil Decision 2005/387/JHA of 10 May\r\n2005[4] provides a mechanism for\r\naddressing the risks posed by new psychoactive substances, which can lead to\r\nthe submission of substances to control measures and criminal penalties across\r\nthe Union. To address more sustainably the frequent emergence of new\r\npsychoactive substances and their rapid spread across the Union, the Commission\r\nproposed stronger rules, under [Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 on new psychoactive substances].\nTo effectively reduce the availability of\r\nharmful new psychoactive substances, which pose severe health, social and\r\nsafety risks to individuals and society, and to deter trafficking in these\r\nsubstances as well as the involvement of criminal organisations in their\r\nproduction or distribution, along with controlled drugs, it is necessary to\r\ncover new psychoactive substances by criminal law provisions.\nCouncil Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA of\r\n25 October 2004[5]\r\nprovides a common approach to the fight against illicit drug trafficking. It\r\nsets out minimum common rules on the definition of drug trafficking offences\r\nand sanctions to avoid that problems arise in cooperation between the judicial\r\nauthorities and law enforcement agencies of Member States, owing to the fact\r\nthat the offence or offences in question are not punishable under the laws of\r\nboth the requesting and the requested State. However, while these provisions\r\napply to substances covered by the UN Conventions and to synthetic drugs\r\nsubmitted to control under Joint Action 97/396/JHA of 16 June 1997[6], they do not apply to new\r\npsychoactive substances. \nIn order to streamline and clarify the\r\nlegal framework applicable to drugs, the most harmful new psychoactive\r\nsubstances should be covered by the same criminal law provisions as substances\r\ncontrolled under the UN Conventions. \nIt is, therefore, necessary to extend the\r\nscope of application of Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA to new psychoactive\r\nsubstances subjected to control measures under Council Decision 2005/387/JHA as\r\nwell as to those substances subjected to permanent market restriction measures\r\nunder [Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 on new psychoactive substances]. \nA legislative proposal on illicit drug\r\ntrafficking was foreseen in the Commission\u2019s 2012 Work Programme.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for and objectives of\r\nthe proposal\nThis proposal amends Framework Decision\r\n2004/757/JHA to include new psychoactive substances posing severe risks within\r\nits scope of application. \nThis proposal accompanies the proposal for\r\na [Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 on new psychoactive substances]. The two\r\nproposals are linked, so that new psychoactive substances that pose severe\r\nhealth, social and safety risks and are therefore submitted to permanent market\r\nrestriction under that Regulation are also subjected to the criminal law\r\nprovisions on illicit drug trafficking set by the Framework Decision\r\n2004/757/JHA.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stakeholders' consultation\nBroad stakeholder and expert consultations and\r\na web-based public consultation have informed the preparatory work for this\r\nproposal. \nThe Commission consulted all Member States\r\nin the assessment of the functioning of Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA and Council\r\nDecision 2005/387/JHA. Moreover, in the context of external studies on illicit\r\ndrug trafficking and new psychoactive substances, the Commission collected and\r\nexamined the views of a broad range of stakeholders, practitioners and experts,\r\nincluding EU agencies involved in the implementation of these instruments.\nThe Commission also organised two experts'\r\nmeeting on illicit drug trafficking, on 10 November 2011 and 29 February 2012, and\r\ntwo experts' meetings on new psychoactive substances, on 15 December 2011 and 1\r\nMarch 2012. During these meetings, academic experts and practitioners stressed\r\nthe importance of criminal law provisions in helping clamp down and deter\r\nillicit drug trafficking, and tackling the spread of harmful new psychoactive\r\nsubstances. At the same time, they pointed out that legislation on new\r\npsychoactive substances should be proportionate and calibrated to the different\r\nlevels of risks that they pose. \nA survey was conducted among young people\r\n(15-24 years' old) in 2011, through the Eurobarometer \"Youth attitudes on\r\ndrugs\". Almost half of respondents (47%) thought that only those\r\nsubstances which are proved to pose risks to health should be restricted, while\r\n34% held that all substances which imitate the effects of controlled drugs\r\nshould be restricted.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nThe Commission assessed the impacts of this\r\nproposal for an amendment to Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA in an impact assessment\r\non new psychoactive substances. The analysis concluded that, as under the\r\nCouncil Decision 2005/387/JHA, harmful new psychoactive substances (those\r\nposing severe health, social and safety risks) should be subjected to criminal\r\nlaw provisions. It further concluded that they should, therefore, be subjected\r\nto the criminal law provisions on illicit drug trafficking. This represented\r\npart of the preferred policy option, which foresees a graduated set of\r\nrestriction measures that are proportionate to the level of risks posed by new\r\npsychoactive substances, and which do not cause obstacles to legitimate trade\r\nin the internal market.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legal base\nThis proposal is based on Article 83(1)\r\nTFEU, which empowers the European Parliament and the Council to establish\r\nminimum rules concerning the definition of offences and sanctions in the area\r\nof illicit drug trafficking, by means of a Directive adopted in accordance with\r\nthe ordinary legislative procedure.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity,\r\nproportionality and respect of fundamental rights\nThe EU is better placed than the Member\r\nStates to take action to restrict the availability in the internal market of\r\nharmful new psychoactive substances for consumers, while simultaneously\r\nensuring that legitimate trade is not impeded. \nThis is because individually Member States\r\ncannot address effectively and sustainably the rapid emergence and spread of\r\nthese substances. Uncoordinated national action and the proliferation of\r\ndiverse national regimes on new psychoactive substances can produce knock-on\r\neffects on other Member States (displacement of harmful substances) and can pose\r\nproblems in cooperation between national judicial authorities and law\r\nenforcement agencies.\nThe proposal is proportionate and does not\r\ngo beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives because it only addresses\r\nthrough criminal law those new psychoactive substances that are a serious concern\r\nat the EU level.\nThis proposal\r\nindirectly impacts on certain fundamental rights and principles enshrined in\r\nthe EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, because it expands the scope of\r\napplication of the Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA, whose provisions impact on\r\nthe following fundamental rights and principles: the right to liberty and\r\nsecurity (Article 6), the right to property (Article 17), the right to an\r\neffective remedy and to a fair trial (Article 47), the presumption of innocence\r\nand right to defence (Article 48), and the principle of legality and\r\nproportionality of criminal offences and penalties (Article 49). These rights\r\nand freedoms can be subject to limitations, but only under the limits and\r\nrequirements set by Article 52(1) of the EU Charter.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instrument\nIn accordance\r\nwith Article 83(1) TFEU, a Directive is the appropriate instrument to ensure\r\nminimum harmonisation at the EU level in the area of illicit drug trafficking,\r\nwhile leaving flexibility to Member States when implementing the principles,\r\nrules and their exemptions at national level.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Explanatory documents\r\naccompanying notification of transposition measures\nMember States are requested to communicate\r\nto the Commission the national measures adopted to comply with this Directive.\nMember States are not requested to submit\r\nto the Commission explanatory documents (including correlation tables)\r\naccompanying the notification of national measures adopted for transposing the\r\nprovisions of this Directive. This is not necessary because of the reduced\r\nscope of the proposed amendment. The submission of additional explanatory\r\ndocuments would add an unjustified administrative burden on Member States'\r\ncompetent authorities.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Main provisions\nArticle 1 \u2013 this\r\nprovision lays down the amendments to the Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA, in\r\nrelation to the definition of the term \"drug\", to the provision for covering by criminal law new psychoactive substances posing\r\nsevere health, social and safety risks, and to the assessment of the implementation and impacts of the Framework\r\nDecision by the Commission.\nArticle 2 \u2013\r\nthis provision lays down the deadline for the transposition of the provisions\r\nof the Directive in national legislation.\nArticles 3 and 4 \u2013 these provisions relate to the entry into force and addressees of\r\nthe Directive.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implications for the\r\nUnion budget.\n2013/0304 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Framework Decision\r\n2004/757/JHA of 25 October 2004 laying down minimum provisions on the\r\nconstituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit\r\ndrug trafficking, as regards the definition of drug\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 83(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Framework Decision\r\n2004/757/JHA of 25 October 2004 laying down minimum provisions on the\r\nconstituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit\r\ndrug trafficking[7]\r\nprovides a common approach to the fight against illicit drug trafficking, which\r\nposes a threat to the health, safety and quality of life of citizens of the\r\nUnion, and to the legal economy, stability and security of the Member States.\r\nIt sets out minimum common rules on the definition of drug trafficking offences\r\nand sanctions, to avoid that problems may arise in cooperation between the\r\njudicial authorities and law enforcement agencies of Member States, owing to\r\nthe fact that the offence or offences in question are not punishable under the\r\nlaws of both the requesting and the requested State.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Framework Decision\r\n2004/757/JHA applies to the substances covered by the 1961 United Nations\r\nSingle Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended by the 1972 Protocol, and the\r\n1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (\u2018UN Conventions\u2019),\r\nas well as to the synthetic drugs subjected to control across the Union\r\npursuant to Joint Action 97/396/JHA of 16 June 1997 concerning the information\r\nexchange, risk assessment and the control of new synthetic drugs[8], which pose public health risks\r\ncomparable to those posed by the substances scheduled under the UN Conventions.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Framework Decision\r\n2004/757/JHA should also apply to the substances subjected to control measures\r\nand criminal penalties pursuant to Council Decision 2005/387/JHA of 10 May 2005\r\non the information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive\r\nsubstances[9],\r\nwhich pose public health risks comparable to those posed by the substances\r\nscheduled under the UN Conventions.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New psychoactive\r\nsubstances, which imitate the effects of substances scheduled under the UN\r\nConventions, are emerging frequently and are spreading fast in the Union. Certain new psychoactive substances pose severe health, social and safety risks, as\r\nascertained by [Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 on new psychoactive substances].\r\nUnder that Regulation, measures may be taken to prohibit the production,\r\nmanufacture, making available on the market including importation to the Union,\r\ntransport, and exportation from the Union of new psychoactive substances posing\r\nsevere health, social and safety risks. To effectively reduce the availability\r\nof new psychoactive substances that pose severe risks to individuals and society,\r\nand to deter trafficking in those substances across the Union, as well as the\r\ninvolvement of criminal organisations, permanent market restriction measures\r\nadopted under that Regulation should be underpinned by criminal law provisions.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The new psychoactive\r\nsubstances subjected to permanent market restriction pursuant to [Regulation\r\n(EU) No \u2026/\u2026 on new psychoactive substances] should, therefore, be covered\r\nby the Union criminal law provisions on illicit drug trafficking. This would\r\nalso help streamline and clarify the Union legal framework, as the same\r\ncriminal law provisions would apply to substances covered by the UN Conventions\r\nand to the most harmful new psychoactive substances. The definition of 'drug'\r\nin the Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA should, therefore, be amended. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to swiftly\r\naddress the emergence and spread of harmful new psychoactive substances in the\r\nUnion, Member States should apply the provisions of the Framework Decision\r\n2004/757/JHA to new psychoactive substances posing severe health, social and\r\nsafety risks within twelve months from their submission to permanent market\r\nrestriction under [Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 on new psychoactive substances].\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nDirective, namely to extend the application of the Union criminal law\r\nprovisions that apply to illicit drug trafficking to new psychoactive\r\nsubstances posing severe health, social and safety risks, cannot be\r\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States acting alone, and can therefore be\r\nbetter achieved at the Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance\r\nwith the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the\r\nEuropean Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out\r\nin that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order\r\nto achieve its objective. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects\r\nthe fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of\r\nFundamental Rights of the European Union, and notably the right to an effective\r\nremedy and to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence and the right of\r\ndefence, the right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings\r\nfor the same criminal offence and the principles of legality and proportionality\r\nof criminal offences.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [In accordance with\r\nArticle 3 of the Protocol (No 21) on the position of the United Kingdom and\r\nIreland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the\r\nTreaty on the European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union, the United Kingdom and Ireland have notified their wish to take\r\npart in the adoption and application of this Directive.]\nAND/OR\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [In accordance with\r\nArticles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 21) on the position of the United Kingdom\r\nand Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to\r\nthe Treaty on the European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, the United\r\nKingdom and Ireland are not taking part in the adoption of this Directive and are\r\nnot bound by or subject to its application.]\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\r\n1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 22) on the position of Denmark annexed to the\r\nTreaty on the European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Directive\r\nand is therefore not bound by or subject to its application.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Framework\r\nDecision 2004/757/JHA should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nFramework Decision 2004/757/JHA is amended\r\nas follows:\n(1)                   \r\nIn Article 1, point 1 is replaced by the\r\nfollowing:\n\"\u2018drug\u2019 means:\n(a)          \r\nany of the substances covered by the 1961 United\r\nNations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (as amended by the 1972 Protocol)\r\nand the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances;\n(b)         \r\nany of the substances listed in the Annex;\n(c)          \r\nany new psychoactive substance posing severe\r\nhealth, social and safety risks, subjected to permanent market restriction on\r\nthe basis of [Article 13(1) of Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 on new psychoactive\r\nsubstances];\"\n(2)                   \r\nIn Article 9, the following paragraphs 3 and 4\r\nare added:\n\"3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of new psychoactive\r\nsubstances subjected to permanent market restriction on the basis of [Article\r\n13(1) of Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 on new psychoactive substances], Member\r\nStates shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative\r\nprovisions necessary to apply the provisions of this Framework Decision to\r\nthese new psychoactive substances within twelve months after entry into force\r\nof the permanent market restriction.
