The present proposal contains the necessary amendments to\nthis Regulation.\nLatvia's National Euro\nChangeover Plan specifies that the so-called \u201cbig bang\u201d scenario should be\napplicable, i.e. that the adoption of the euro as the currency of Latvia and the introduction of euro banknotes and coins in this Member State should coincide.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nThe formal procedure following the Commission\nproposal for a Council Decision involves consultation of the ECB. Discussions\nwith Member States on economic policy challenges in Member States are held\nunder various headings on a regular basis in the Economic and Financial\nCommittee and ECOFIN/Eurogroup. These include informal discussions on issues\nspecifically relevant to the preparation of eventual euro area entry (incl.\nexchange rate policies). Dialogue with academics and other interested groups\ntakes place in the context of conferences/seminars and on an ad-hoc basis.\nEconomic developments in the euro area and the\nMember States are assessed in the framework of the various procedures of\neconomic policy co-ordination and surveillance (notably under Article 121 of\nthe Treaty), as well as in the context of the Commission\u2019s regular monitoring\nand analysis of country-specific and area-wide developments (incl. forecasts, regular\npublication series, input to EFC and ECOFIN/Eurogroup). In accordance with the\nproportionality principle and in line with past practice, the Commission\nproposes not to develop a formal impact assessment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe legal basis for the present proposal is\nArticle 140(3) of the Treaty, which allows for the adoption of the other\nmeasures necessary for the introduction of the euro in the Member State the derogation of which has been abrogated under Article 140(2) of the Treaty.\nThe Council shall act with the unanimity of the\nMember States whose currency is the euro and the Member State concerned on a\nproposal from the Commission and after consulting the ECB.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\nproportionality\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\nThe present initiative does not go beyond what\nis necessary to achieve its objective and, therefore, complies with the\nproportionality principle.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of the legal\ninstrument\nThe Regulation instrument is the only\nappropriate legal instrument to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 on the\nintroduction of the euro.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implications for the budget\nof the Union.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COMMENTARY ON INDIVIDUAL\nARTICLES \n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 1\nIn accordance with Article 1 lit. (a) and with\nArticle 1a of Regulation (EC) No 974/98, the table in the Annex to that\nRegulation lists the participating Member States and defines the euro adoption\ndate, the cash changeover date, and the \u201cphasing-out\u201d period, if applicable,\nfor all these Member States. According to Article 1 lit. (i) of Regulation (EC)\nNo 974/98, a \"phasing-out\" period can only apply to Member States\nwhere the euro adoption date and the cash changeover date fall on the same day.\nThis was not the case for the eleven Member States which adopted the euro on 1\nJanuary 1999 and for Greece which adopted the euro on 1 January 2001. Slovenia,\nCyprus, Malta, Slovakia and Estonia's euro adoption date and cash changeover\ndate coincided (1 January 2007 for Slovenia, 1 January 2008 for Cyprus and\nMalta, 1 January 2009 for Slovakia, 1 January 2011 for Estonia), but the\ncountries have chosen not to have a \"phasing-out\" period. Also Latvia's Euro National Changeover Plan sets the same date for the euro adoption date and\nfor the cash changeover date (1 January 2014), while the country has\nchosen not to have a \"phasing-out\" period.\nThis Article adds Latvia and the following\nrelevant data for this Member State to the table in the Annex to Regulation (EC)\nNo 974/98 in protocol order.\n Member State || Euro adoption date || Cash changeover date || Member State with a \"phasing-out\" period \n \"Latvia || 1 January 2014 || 1 January 2014 || No\" \n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 2\nThis Article sets the date of entry into force\nof the Regulation at 1 January 2014, ensuring that it will be applicable in\nconformity with the timing of the other Council acts relating to the adoption\nof the euro by Latvia, i.e. the date of the abrogation of the derogation and\nthe date of the entry into force of the conversion rate of the Latvian lats.\n2013/0176 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EC) No 974/98 as\nregards the introduction of the euro in Latvia\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 140(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission[3],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Central Bank[4],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\n974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro[5] provides for the substitution\nof the euro for the currencies of the Member States which fulfilled the\nnecessary conditions for the adoption of the euro at the time when the\nCommunity entered the third stage of economic and monetary union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article 4 of\nthe 2003 Act of Accession, Latvia is a Member State with a derogation as\ndefined in Article 139(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion (hereinafter the Treaty).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Council\nDecision 2013/\u2026/EU of \u2026 \u2026 2013 on the adoption by Latvia of the euro on\n1 January 2014[6],\nLatvia fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro and the\nderogation in favour of Latvia is to be abrogated with effect from 1 January\n2014.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The introduction of the\neuro in Latvia requires the extension to Latvia of the existing provisions on\nthe introduction of the euro set out in Regulation (EC) No 974/98.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Latvia's National Euro Changeover\nPlan specifies that euro banknotes and coins should become legal tender in that\n  Member State on the day of the introduction of the euro as its currency.\nConsequently, the euro adoption date and the cash changeover date shall be\n1 January 2014.
