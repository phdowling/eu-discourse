Due to their strategic aspect, satellite navigation systems are\nsensitive infrastructures that could be susceptible to malicious use. Given the\nincreasing usage of satellite navigation across a great number of fields of\nactivity, an interruption in the supply of services could lead to significant\nharm to modern society.\nRegulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 9 July 2008 on the further implementation of the European satellite\nnavigation programmes (EGNOS and Galileo)[1]\nprovides that the Commission should manage all aspects relating to security of\nthe two systems established under the Galileo and EGNOS programmes. However,\nthe security of the systems is itself subject to accreditation which consists\nof verifying the compliance of the systems with the specified security\nrequirements and ensuring compliance with the relevant security rules\napplicable to the Council and the Commission. As is the case for all\naccreditation activities, security accreditation of the two European satellite\nnavigation systems must be carried out independently, particularly with regard\nto all parties involved in their design, construction and operation.\nThe European GNSS agency is responsible for this accreditation\nactivity pursuant to the combined provisions of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 and\nRegulation (EU) No 912/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council\nsetting up the European GNSS Agency, repealing Council Regulation (EC) No\n1321/2004 on the establishment of structures for the management of the European\nsatellite radio navigation programmes and amending Regulation (EC) No 683/2008\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[2].\nThe latter lays down the terms for implementing the accreditation task\nentrusted to the Agency and specifies that security accreditation decisions\nmust be taken independently with regard to the Commission and the bodies\nresponsible for implementing the programmes. The obligation of independence\nmust also apply to the other tasks assigned to the Agency.\nIn order to ensure that the security accreditation activities are\nperformed in an independent manner, including, to a large extent, with regard\nto the other activities of the European GNSS Agency, Regulation (EU) No\n912/2010 provides the Agency with an independent body, the Security\nAccreditation Board, which constitutes one of the three separate roles of the\nAgency along with the Executive Director and the Administrative Board. The\nSecurity Accreditation Board has equivalent status to the Administrative Board\nand is solely responsible for accreditation decisions. These decisions are\nnevertheless made on behalf of the Agency, in the same way as the decisions of\nthe Administrative Board, since the Agency alone has legal personality.\nThe European GNSS Agency's internal structural organisation is\nunusual in as much as it separates the activities associated with system\nsecurity accreditation from the other activities, namely, security centre\nmanagement, contribution to the preparation for commercialisation of the\nsystems and any activities that the Commission might entrust to the Agency via\ndelegations.\nOn 30 November 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a\nRegulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation\nand exploitation of European satellite navigation systems[3]. This future GNSS Regulation\nwill replace Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 as of 1 January 2012 and\ndetermine the governance framework during the 2014-2020 period. In particular,\nit stipulates that most of the tasks associated with the operation of both the\nGalileo and EGNOS systems will be entrusted to the European GNSS Agency. The\ncommitment expressed by the Commission in its proposal to delegating these\ntasks to the Agency is shared by the European Parliament and the Council,\nfollowing discussions of the draft since the start of 2012. On 7 June\n2012, the Council adopted a partial general approach (document 11105/12 of 11\nJune 2012) confirming this.\nThe question of the future of accreditation activities within the\nAgency will determine whether the European GNSS Agency will manage the\nexploitation of the two systems after 2013. In fact, for reasons associated\nwith the potential for conflicts of interest and the fact that one cannot be\nboth judge and interested party, the need for independence in security\naccreditation decisions, does not appear to be easily reconciled with the fact\nthat such decisions are made within a body that is also responsible for\nexploitation, even though, as has been explained above, Regulation (EU) No\n912/2010 lays down terms for a degree of independence for the Security\nAccreditation Board. In its proposal on the future GNSS regulation, the\nCommission, being aware of this difficulty, also stipulated that security\naccreditation of the systems would be one of the Agency's tasks 'until 30 June\n2016 at the latest', at which time the exploitation activities would be in full\nflow. The question of the future of the accreditation activities following this\ndate was therefore left open, which is to be the subject of a subsequent\nproposal.\nThe Commission's approach regarding the date of 30 June 2016 was\nwidely supported when the draft was discussed by the members of the various\nparliamentary committees. Within the Council, the Member States emphasised the\nneed to carry out accreditation activities independently and wanted the issue\nof the future of system security accreditation after 1 January 2014 to be\nsettled as quickly as possible. Furthermore, on 7 June 2012, the Council\nadopted a declaration (document 11279/12 ADD 1) in which it deemed that\naccreditation activities should be performed in a strictly independent manner\nwith regard to the other tasks entrusted to the European GNSS Agency, that a\nstructural and effective division should be made within the Agency between its\nvarious activities by 1 January 2014 at the latest, and that the\nChairperson of the Security Accreditation Board should be the only person in\nthe Agency responsible for accreditation activities. Accordingly, the Council\nasked the Commission to submit such a proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No\n912/2010 in good time.\nIt is important to resolve the issue of the future of the security\naccreditation of the European satellite navigation systems during the future\nfinancial framework 2014-2020. This means that Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 must\nbe amended.\nAmending Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 also presents an opportunity to\nincorporate changes in the text to bring it into line with the principles\ncontained in the common approach of the European Parliament, Council and\nCommission on the decentralised agencies, as approved by the Commission on 12\nJune 2012.\nFinally, the proposal on the abovementioned future GNSS Regulation\nadopted by the Commission on 30 November 2011, which provides for the possibility\nof extending the tasks of the European GNSS Agency and assignment of\noperational tasks, significantly affects its staff requirements and, hence, has\nconsequences for its future budget. It is therefore important to amend the\nlegislative financial statement associated with Regulation (EU) No 912/2010.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Commission's proposal was not subject to an impact assessment\nnor did it follow formal consultation of the parties concerned.\nWith regard to the amendments designed to align Regulation (EU) No\n912/2010 with the principles of the interinstitutional approach to the\ndecentralised agencies, an impact assessment and formal consultation of the\nparties concerned was not required because this approach was itself the result\nof consultation between the Commission, the Council and the European\nParliament.\nWith regard to the amendments concerning security accreditation of\nthe European satellite navigation systems, it is important to note that the\nMember States, which are closely involved in all security-related matters, are\nin this case, the main, or in fact only, parties concerned other than the\ninstitutions of the Union and the European GNSS Agency. The Member States were\nwidely consulted on this point during discussions on the future GNSS Regulation\nwithin the Council, which made its position known in the abovementioned\ndeclaration of 7 June 2012. In addition, the arrangements finally adopted\nwere the focal point of extensive discussions with the European GNSS Agency.\nThe European Parliament has received the proposal for the future European GNSS\nRegulation but has not yet issued a specific opinion on the matter.\nIn addition, the various solutions that could theoretically be\nenvisaged for system security accreditation after 2013 have been assessed.\nThere are six potential solutions.\n1) Entrusting accreditation to the private sector:\nAccreditation of European satellite navigation system security\ndirectly affects the security of the Union and its Member States, which want to\nbe closely involved in the accreditation work and decisions. Consequently,\nentrusting accreditation to the private sector is not a serious option.\n2) Creating a new regulatory agency for accreditation:\nCreating a regulatory agency for accreditation of the security of\nthe European GNSS systems might seem to be a good idea but clashes with the\nUnion institutions' shared commitment over the last few years not to create any\nnew regulatory agencies. In addition, this solution would have a significant\ncost, disproportionate to actual requirements. In fact, the permanent staff\nresponsible for system security accreditation accounts for approximately ten\npeople.\n3) Entrusting accreditation to another existing regulatory agency:\nAn alternative solution to creating a new agency would be to entrust\nsecurity accreditation to another existing regulatory agency. Among the various\nagencies of the Union, only the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and, to\na lesser extent, the European Defence Agency appear, in principle, capable of\nproviding security accreditation of complex systems such as Galileo and EGNOS.\nIt should, however, be noted that such an accreditation task does\nnot fall within the scope of the current tasks of these agencies. In addition,\nwith regard to the EASA which should eventually be responsible for EGNOS\ncertification, there is a serious risk of conflict of interests between this\nfuture certification role and any potential security accreditation task. With\nregard to the European Defence Agency which is principally concerned with the\npromotion of cooperation between Member States in matters relating to arms and\nthe defence industries, entrusting it with the security accreditation of\nGalileo and EGNOS might appear to contradict the assertion that both systems\nare civil systems under civil control.\n4) Entrusting\naccreditation to the Commission:\nIn 2007, during the preparatory work for the drafting of Regulation\n(EC) No 638/2008 reforming the governance of the programmes, it was planned to\nentrust the security accreditation of the two European satellite navigation\nsystems to the Commission. This solution was abandoned at the time because it\nappeared that it could not be reconciled with the obligation of independence,\nwith the Commission managing 'all questions relating to the security of the\nsystems' under the terms of that Regulation. The same difficulty continues to\napply today since the future GNSS Regulation which is intended to replace\nRegulation (EC) No 638/2008 from 1 January 2014 also provides for the\nCommission to ensure the security of the programmes, including system security.\nFurthermore, the Member States are very attached to the structure of the\nAccreditation Board as it currently exists within the European GNSS Agency and\nit would be difficult, on an administrative level, to incorporate such a body\nin the Commission departments.\n5) Entrusting accreditation to the Council:\nThere are several advantages associated with entrusting the security\naccreditation of European GNSS systems to the Council. First and foremost, the\nCouncil is not involved in the management of the programmes and its\nindependence would not be called into question. It has a degree of expertise in\naccreditation of complex systems since it has already approved around fifty\nsystems for its own needs. In addition, it is the body most able to assume\nresponsibility for the political consequences of accreditation-related\ndecisions, which could have significant repercussions on the progress of the\nprogrammes in terms of costs and schedules. Finally, the Member States, which\nwant to be very closely associated with the accreditation process, are\nnaturally much better represented in the Council than in any other Union body.\nThe disadvantages involved in implementing this solution, however,\noutweigh the advantages. In fact, the Council is not a managing authority and\nalthough it effectively has experience in accrediting a number of systems, up\nto now these have been Council internal systems only designed to ensure its\nsmooth running. Furthermore, transferring and incorporating the structure made\nup of the Administrative Board and its subordinate components as they currently\nstand with staff including permanent officials into the administration of the\nGeneral Secretariat of the Council would present the same administrative\ndifficulties as a transfer to the Commission.\n6) Reinforcing\nthe separation of activities within the European GNSS Agency:\nThis involves modifying the internal organisation of the Agency so\nthat there can be no further doubt concerning the independence of the\naccreditation activities vis-\u00e0-vis the other activities carried out by\nthe Agency.\nThis solution, which means further separating the activities of the\nEuropean GNSS Agency and reinforcing the independence of the two different\nbodies under a single legal and institutional roof, can provide the right\ndegree of independence in the exercise of accreditation activities and is\nultimately the solution that is least onerous, simplest and easiest to implement.\nMoreover, it was recommended by the Council in its declaration of 7 June\n2012.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nWith regard to the need to ensure that activities associated with\naccreditation of the systems are carried out independently and hence to reinforce\nthe separation of these activities and the other activities of the European\nGNSS Agency, the proposal provides mainly for an increase in the powers of the\nSecurity Accreditation Board and those of the Chairperson of the Security\nAccreditation Board, by partly aligning them with those of the Administrative\nBoard and the Executive Director respectively.\nIt is also provided that the Security Accreditation Board must\nprepare and approve the part of the Agency work programmes describing the\noperational activities associated with system security accreditation as well as\nthe part of the annual report concerning the activities and prospects of the\nAgency concerning systems' security accreditation activities and forward them\nin due course to the Administrative Board so that they can be incorporated in\nthe Agency's work programme and annual report. It must also exercise\ndisciplinary authority over its Chairperson.\nThe Chairperson of the Security Accreditation Board plays a role in\nrelation to security accreditation activities comparable to that of the\nExecutive Director in other Agency activities. In addition to representing the\nAgency, a function which is already laid down in Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 in\nits current version, he/she will henceforth manage the security accreditation\nactivities under the direction of the Security Accreditation Board and ensure\nthe implementation of the part of the Agency work programmes associated with\naccreditation. At the invitation of the Parliament or the Council, he/she may\nalso submit a report on the performance of its tasks and make a statement\nbefore these institutions.\nAs regards the implementation of the interinstitutional approach to\nthe decentralised agencies, the alignment with the principles set out in this\napproach notably affects the rules for adopting decisions by the Administrative\nBoard, the mandate of the members of the Administrative Board and the Security\nAccreditation Board as well as those of their Chairpersons, the existence of a\nmultiannual work programme, the powers of the Administrative Board concerning\nstaff management, evaluation and revision of the Regulation, prevention of\nconflicts of interest and processing of non-classified sensitive information.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe legal elements of the proposal referred to in point 3 above do\nnot in themselves have any budgetary implications.\nHowever, the legislative financial statement associated with\nRegulation (EU) No 912/2010, which accompanies the proposal and incorporates\nthe new staff requirements of the Agency relating to the new tasks which may be\nentrusted to it, such as the exploitation of the European GNSS systems,\ntranslates these requirements in financial terms. In budgetary terms, the\namounts required are already included in the Commission's proposal for the next\nfinancial framework 2014-2020. They will be financed by redeployment within the\nbudget headings of the GNSS programmes in the same way as the additional\nrequirements for 2013. It should be noted that the expenditure associated with\nthe new staff requirements of the Agency will be partially offset by a\nreduction of 30 posts in the Commission's establishment plan during the same\nperiod, i.e. from 2014 to 2020. The budget details are shown in the legislative\nfinancial statement in Annex.\nIt should be noted in any event that the figures referred to in the\nlegislative financial statement are dependent on the adoption of the financial\nframework 2014-2020 by the budgetary authority and the adoption of the future\nGNSS Regulation.\n2013/0022 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) No 912/2010\nsetting up the European GNSS Agency\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nfunctioning of the European Union and in particular, Article 172 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter forwarding of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[5],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from the\ncombined provisions of Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on the further\nimplementation of the European satellite navigation programmes (EGNOS and\nGalileo)[6]\nand Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council setting up the European GNSS Agency, repealing Council Regulation\n(EC) No 1321/2004 on the establishment of structures for the management of the\nEuropean satellite radio navigation programmes and amending Regulation (EC) No\n683/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council[7] that the European GNSS Agency\n(hereinafter the 'Agency') must ensure the security accreditation of the\nEuropean satellite navigation systems (the 'systems') and, to this end,\ninitiate and monitor the implementation of security procedures and perform\nsecurity audits.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of\nRegulation (EU) no 912/2010, in particular those in Chapter III of the\nRegulation, expressly lay down the terms under which the Agency must perform\nits task concerning security accreditation of the systems. In particular, they\nstipulate, in principle, that security accreditation decisions must be taken\nindependently of the Commission and the bodies responsible for implementing the\nEuropean satellite navigation programmes (hereinafter the 'programmes') and\nthat the systems' security accreditation authority shall be a independent body\nwithin the Agency that makes decisions independently.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with this\nprinciple, Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 establishes the Security Accreditation\nBoard for European GNSS systems (hereinafter the 'Security Accreditation\nBoard') which, alongside the Administrative Board and the Executive Director,\nis one of the three bodies of the Agency. This body performs the tasks\nentrusted to the Agency concerning security accreditation and is authorised to\nmake security accreditation decisions on behalf of the Agency. It must adopt\nits rules of procedure and appoint its chairperson.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\nxxx/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation\nand exploitation of European satellite navigation systems[8], replacing Regulation (EC) No\n683/2008, which will enter into force on 1 January 2014, defines the public\ngovernance arrangements for the programmes during 2014-2020. It extends the\ntasks entrusted to the Agency and provides, in particular, for the Agency to\nplay a major role in the exploitation of the systems.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this new context, it is\nessential to ensure that the Security Accreditation Board is able to carry out\nthe task entrusted to it with complete independence, in particular vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe other bodies and activities of the Agency. It is therefore essential to\nfurther separate, within the Agency itself, the activities associated with\naccreditation from its other activities, such as management of the security\ncentre, contribution to the commercialisation of the systems and any activities\nthat the Commission might entrust to the Agency by way of delegation, in\nparticular those associated with exploitation of the systems. To this end, a\ntangible and effective structural division should be set up within the Agency\nbetween its various activities by 1 January 2014 at the latest.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve this,\nRegulation (EU) No 912/2010 must be amended in order to increase the\nindependence and powers of the Security Accreditation Board and its chairperson\nand to align these largely with the Administrative Board and the Executive\nDirector of the Agency respectively, while providing for a cooperation\nrequirement between the various bodies of the Agency.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Security Accreditation\nBoard and not the Administrative Board prepares and approves the part of the\nAgency work programmes describing the operational activities associated with\nsecurity accreditation of the systems as well as the part of the annual report\nconcerning the activities and prospects of the Agency with regard to the\nsystems' security accreditation activities and submits them in good time to the\nAdministrative Board so that they can be incorporated in the Agency's work\nprogramme and annual report. It must also exercise disciplinary authority over\nits Chairperson.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It would be desirable to\nassign a role in relation to security accreditation activities to the\nChairperson of the Security Accreditation Board comparable to that of the\nExecutive Director in other Agency activities. Therefore, in addition to the\nfunction of representing the Agency, already provided for under Regulation (EU)\nNo 912/2010 in its draft of 22 September 2010, the Chairperson of the\nSecurity Accreditation Board should manage the security accreditation\nactivities under the direction of the Security Accreditation Board and ensure\nthe implementation of the part of the Agency work programmes associated with\naccreditation. At the request of the Parliament or the Council, it should also\nsubmit a report on the performance of its tasks and make a declaration before\nthese institutions.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, in the\ninterests of preserving the independence of the Security Accreditation Board\nand avoiding any conflicts of interest, it would also be useful for the Security\nAccreditation Board and the Agency staff under its control to carry out their\nwork in a location ensuring their autonomy and independence with regard to the\nAgency's other activities, in particular vis-\u00e0-vis the operational\nactivities associated with the exploitation of the systems and for the Agency's\ninternal rules on staff to ensure the autonomy and independence of the staff\nperforming the security accreditation activities vis-\u00e0-vis staff\ncarrying out other Agency activities.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, given the\ninvolvement of a number of third countries in the European GNSS programmes,\nincluding in security matters, express provision should be made for\nrepresentatives of third countries to be able to participate under conditions\nto be specified in the work of the Security Accreditation Board.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 912/2010\nmust be made consistent with the principles contained in the shared approach of\nthe Parliament, Council and Commission to the decentralised agencies, adopted\nby the three institutions on 5 July, 26 June and 12 June 2012\nrespectively, particularly with regard to the rules for adopting decisions of\nthe Administrative Board, the terms of office of the members of the\nAdministrative Board and Security Accreditation Board and those of their chairpersons,\nthe existence of a multiannual work programme, the powers of the Administrative\nBoard concerning staff management, assessment and revision of the Regulation,\nprevention of conflicts of interest and handling of non-classified sensitive\ninformation.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The financial interests of\nthe Union must be protected using proportionate measures throughout the\nexpenditure cycle, in particular, by means of prevention and detection of\nirregularities, carrying out surveys, recovering lost, unduly paid or poorly\nadministered funds and, if necessary, applying penalties.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, given that Article\n[8] of Regulation (EU) No xxx/2013 (future GNSS Regulation) allows the Member\nStates to contribute extra funds in order to finance certain programme\nfeatures, the Agency should be permitted to award joint contracts with the\nMember States when appropriate for performance of its tasks.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU)\nNo 912/2010 should be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: \nArticle 1\nRegulation (EU) No 912/2010 is amended\nas follows:\n(1)                   \nArticle 3 is replaced by the following:\n'Article 3\nBodies\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The bodies of the Agency\nshall be:\na)                 \nthe Administrative Board;\nb)                \nthe Executive Director;\nc)                 \nthe Security Accreditation Board for European\nGNSS systems.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The bodies of the Agency shall\naccomplish their tasks, as specified in Articles 6, 8 and 11 respectively, in\naccordance with the guidelines issued by the Commission as set out in Article\n16 of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Administrative Board\nand the Executive Director on one hand, and the European GNSS System Security\nAccreditation Board and its Chairperson on the other hand, shall cooperate to\nensure the operation of the Agency in accordance with the procedures determined\nby the Agency's internal rules, such as the rules of procedure of the\nAdministrative Board, the rules of procedure of the Security Accreditation\nBoard, the financial rules applicable to the Agency, the implementing rules for\nthe status of staff and the rules governing access to documents.'\n(2)                   \nArticle 4 is replaced by the following:\n'Article 4\nLegal status, local offices\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agency is a body of\nthe Union.

They aim to provide navigation services and\nwill foster considerable developments in numerous sectors of activity, drive\ntechnological innovation and growth of competitiveness in the European economy\nand provide a source of job creation, commercial revenue and socio-economic\nbenefits. As such, they form part of the Europe 2020 strategy and policies for\nsustainable development. \nMore specifically, the Galileo programme aims to establish Europe's\nglobal navigation satellite system (hereafter GNSS). It will lead to the\nprovision of positioning, timing and navigation services to users worldwide for\na wide range of applications, from transport, financial securities clearance,\nelectricity provision, weather forecasting, to road tolling.\nEGNOS is a European system developed to improve the performance of\nthe American GPS over the European area. It makes existing satellite navigation\nservices suitable for safety-critical applications such as flying and landing\naircraft or navigating ships through narrow channels in air or maritime\ntransport.\nBased on the governance structure proposed by the Commission in its\nproposal for a regulation on the implementation and exploitation of the\nEuropean satellite navigation programmes[11]\ngovernance structure supported by the Council in its partial general approach\nagreed on 7 June 2012 and by the European Parliament, the European GNSS Agency\n(hereafter the \"Agency\") will become a major stakeholder in the\nexploitation phase of the programmes. \nNevertheless, considering that the Regulation on the implementation\nand exploitation of the European satellite navigation systems (hereafter\n\"GNSS Regulation\") has not been adopted yet \u2013 it is currently under\ndiscussion at the level of the Budgetary Authority \u2013 and is subject to the\nfinal decision on the content of the next multiannual financial framework, some\nof the hypotheses used to prepare the present legislative financial statement\nare not definitive.\n1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific objective(s) and\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\nConsidering this more active role of the Agency in the exploitation\nphase of the programmes, the present proposal aims to reinforce the independence\nof the Security Accreditation Board (one of the three bodies of the Agency) and\nto provide the appropriate financial and human ressources to perform the tasks\nallocated to the Agency.\n1. Security accreditation:\nDue to their strategic importance, the European satellite navigation\nsystems are critical infrastructures. They could be misused, threatening the\nsecurity of the Union and of Member States. Moreover, any interruption of their\nservices could lead to significant losses for the European economy as more and\nmore economic sectors are dependent on satellite navigation.\nTo guarantee the security of the systems, an independent security\naccreditation needs to be performed and is crucial for the systems. Such\naccreditation ensures that the security measures are adequate to defend the\nsystem against threats and vulnerabilities, that the system itself does not\nmeet any unacceptable risk during its lifecycle and that the system itself can\nprocess, store or forward sensitive or classified information without\nunacceptable risks, according to specific conditions. \nAs the Agency will be more involved in the implementation of the\nprogrammes under the new governance structure, the separation between\nactivities relating to security accreditation and the other activities of the\nAgency needs to be reinforced to avoid conflict of interest between these\nactivities and safeguard the independence of security accreditation.\n2. Market development and applications development:\nThe agency should contribute to the commercialisation of Galileo and\nEGNOS services to foster their uptake. As regards commercialisation of\nservices, the latter is very important to maximise the socio-economic benefits\nexpected from the systems.\n3. Operation of the Galileo Security Monitoring Centres and PRS\napplications development:\nThe Agency will be responsible for the operations of the GSMC\n(Galileo Security Monitoring Centre). \nThe GSMC is considered to be the 'brains' of the Galileo system as\nregards overall security. It is a critical operational centre for the system.\nIt will be able to analyse and respond to threats or attacks. It will therefore\nhave to be operational prior to the Galileo services being up and running and\nneeds to be operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week by qualified experts.\nIt is based at two geographical sites located in Saint Germain en Laye in\nFrance and Swanwick in the United Kingdom.\n4. Exploitation of the systems:\nThe objective of the exploitation of the systems is to provide high\nquality services to satisfy users' needs and to take all measures for their\nwidest and fastest adoption. An appropriate setting-up of the exploitation is\ncritical to ensure the long term running of the systems and the maximisation of\nsocio-economic benefits.\nThe governance shall be tailored to the different programmes\n(Galileo and EGNOS) as they are at different stages of development and to the\nphases of the programmes to avoid disruption. While EGNOS is already\noperational and in its exploitation phase, Galileo will soon start a crucial step\nin its development with the provision of services which will mark the beginning\nof its exploitation phase.\nWith respect to EGNOS,\n- its exploitation phase started in October 2009;\n- the management of EGNOS exploitation is currently under the\nresponsibility of the Commission. The latter will be transferred to the Agency\non 1 January 2014, with a gradual phasing-in envisaged as from 2012\nonwards; \n- in the new governance framework (from 2014 onwards), the Agency\nwill manage all EGNOS exploitation-related activities from 2014 and will\noutsource specific operational tasks to other entities, in particular the EGNOS\noperator. \nWith respect to Galileo,\n- different phases of the programme will overlap in the coming\nyears;\n- during the on-going deployment phase of the programme, the current\nset-up will remain in place to ensure continuity and consistency; the\nCommission will remain responsible for the completion of the Galileo's\ninfrastructure; \n- during the exploitation phase, which should start in 2014 with the\nprovision of initial services, the Agency will progressively manage\nexploitation-related activities under a delegation agreement with the\nCommission. The Agency will ensure the coordination of all the tasks relating\nto the exploitation of the system such as maintenance, operations, service\nprovision and the implementation of future generation of systems, as well as\nsupporting the definition of system requirements for future systems by\nproviding feedback on changing operational needs and users' requirements. This\nexploitation phase of Galileo constitutes a new programme phase and is subject\nto a delegation of programme management from the Commission to the Agency. \nTo perform tasks relating to the exploitation of the systems, the\nAgency will need to be sufficiently staffed. To ensure service continuity and a\nsmooth start of the exploitation phase of Galileo in 2014, it is also crucial\nthat the appropriate transition period is implemented prior to 2014.\nSpecific objective\nTo develop and provide infrastructure and services based on\nsatellite radio-navigation (Galileo) \nABM/ABB activities concerned\n02 05 SATELLITE NAVIGATION PROGRAMME \u2013 GALILEO AND EGNOS\n1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected result(s) and\nimpact\nSpecify the effects\nwhich the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\nThe European satellite radio navigation programmes commenced more\nthan 10 years ago on the basis of a political vision to develop and operate a\nglobal system that would allow the European Union to reap the economic and\nstrategic benefits thereof and provide satellite navigation services optimised\nfor civil use.\nGalileo and EGNOS will bring significant socio-economic benefits to\nthe European Union due to:\ni) direct benefits resulting from the growth of the downstream\nGNSS-based market (receivers and applications). For example, if more planes are\nequipped with GNSS receivers, additional revenues will be generated by the\nmanufacturers of these receivers;\nii) indirect benefits, outcome of the emergence of new applications.\nIf flight duration is reduced thanks to better navigation, planes will pollute\nless and passengers will save precious time. Moreover, safer transport modes\nand more efficient emergency services will allow more lives to be saved;\niii) direct benefits resulting from the growth of the upstream\nmarket and technological spillover to other sectors. Investment directly made\ninto the GNSS upstream segment will benefit the industry. However, other\nsectors will also take advantage of new developments in the space sector. For example,\ninstruments developed to evaluate and monitor the structural health of\nlaunchers or fuel tanks can be used in automotive, construction, energy and\nutility companies.\nAlthough the system resulting from the Galileo programme will be\nself-contained, the performance of its services will be enhanced thanks to its\ninteroperability with other systems such as the US GPS or Russia's GLONASS.\nHence cooperation with other countries providing satellite navigation services\nwill help maximise benefits for users, the public or the economy as a whole.\nManaging the exploitation of the systems, as well as security\naccreditation, the Agency will be the cornerstone of service provision. It will\nalso be a major stakeholder to foster downstream market development. As such, the\nAgency performance will have a direct impact on the socio-economic benefits\nexpected from the systems.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\nimpact\nSpecify the\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nIndicators for monitoring the performance of the Agency will be set\nbased on the type of activity as follows:\n1. Security accreditation:\nThe Agency needs to ensure the successful completion of the security\naccreditation activities on time for each milestone of the Galileo programme (e.g.\nto allow each launch of satellites). Its implementation will be evaluated based\non its contribution to the successful deployment of the infrastructure and on\nthe number of audit/security checks performed every year. \nThese checks consist of detailed technical examination by or for the\nappropriate authority, or its nominated competent representatives, of the\nsecurity aspects of the system, of a cryptographic or a computer security\nproduct. The evaluation confirms the presence of required security functionality\nand makes an assessment of the incorruptibility of such functionality. The\nevaluation determines the extent to which the security requirements of a system\nare satisfied and establishes the assurance level of the system.\nThe number of checks depends on the progress made and on the\ndeployment of ground stations.\nIt is estimated that around 10 checks will be performed yearly\nbetween 2013 and 2015, and 5 between 2016 and 2020. \n2. Market development and applications development:\nActivities relating to the performance of the Agency with regard to\nthe commercialisation of the services will be evaluated based on the market\nuptake of the services provided be EGNOS and Galileo with specific indicators\nto be developed by services once they become operational such as the number of\nairports with EGNOS-based approach procedures, the number of tractors equipped\nwith EGNOS receivers and the estimated total socio-economic benefits from the\nsystems.\nSo far 82 airports have developed EGNOS-based approach procedures.\nThe aim is for 50% of all the appropriate relevant airports to have developed\nEGNOS-based approach procedures by 2020.\n3. Operation of the Galileo security monitoring centres and PRS\napplications development:\nThese operations can be measured with an indicator of the number of\noperational processes put in place. The aim is for a figure of 500 to be\nreached in 2016. As the centres are not operational yet, no processes are in\nplace today.\n4. Exploitation of the systems:\nAccording to the proposal for a regulation on the implementation and\nexploitation of the European satellite navigation systems, activities relating\nto the exploitation of the systems will be based on a delegation agreement\nbetween the Commission and the Agency. This delegation agreement will detail\nthe operational indicators for monitoring the implementation of these\nactivities as it is currently the case for EGNOS.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\nproposal/initiative\n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term\nIn light of current figures on the development of the Agency, it is\nnot possible to carry out the new tasks included in the proposal for a\nregulation on the implementation and exploitation of the European satellite\nnavigation systems, in particular with regard to their exploitation. The financial\nstatement should therefore be revised to adapt to the reality of the agency's\nstaffing needs. \nMoreover, it should be noted that the implementation of the proposed\ngovernance model requires the Agency to have appropriate technical and\noperational staff with high level expertise in a very specialised area. The\norganisational set-up of the Agency should also build on the specificities of\nthe activities to be performed.\nAlthough the Agency will not perform all the activities internally\nand will outsource a large number of tasks relating to service provision and\nthe development of major modifications and new generations of systems, it needs\nto be staffed with the appropriate technical experts to manage necessary\nprocurement, control outsourced activities and prepare high quality reporting\nto the Commission. Considering the complexity of the programmes, it is also\nimportant to avoid intellectual hazard. Intellectual hazard could prevent the\nappropriate acquisition, communication, process and implementation of\ninformation crucial to the success of the operations and therefore poses a threat to the smooth, orderly, and\nefficient functioning of the programmes.\nThe extra staff will be funded by a redeployment within the budget\nheadings of the GNSS programmes.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nThe EU right to act is based on article 172 of the Treaty on the\nfunctioning of the European Union and the GNSS Regulation.\nThe systems established under the European satellite navigation\nprogrammes are infrastructures set up as trans-European networks of which the\nusage extends well beyond the national boundaries of the Member States.\nFurthermore, the services offered through these systems contribute, in\nparticular, to the development of trans-European networks in the areas of\ntransport, telecommunications and energy infrastructures.\nSatellite navigation systems cannot be set up by any single Member\nStates as this would exceed its financial and technical capacities. Therefore,\nit can be only achieved by action at EU level.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nNot relevant.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nSynergies are possible with other existing or future space\nprogrammes, e.g. for the expansion of user segments (applications for the\ndownstream market).\nSynergies shall also be sought within the other directorates of the\nEuropean Commission as regards research and innovation. Applications and\ntechnologies using satellite navigation systems can impact various sectors of\nthe economy and of society such as transport, energy, location based services,\nbanking, agriculture, etc. It is important to ensure that research and\ninnovation programmes are coordinated by the Commission to maximise the\nsocio-economic benefits expected from the programmes in those sectors of\nactivities. \nFurthermore, cooperation with the Joint Research Centre should be\nstrengthened. The programmes could benefit from its scientific and technical\nexpertise, as well as its state-of-the-art testing and measurement facilities\nfor activities relating to the security of the GNSS systems and the development\nof GNSS-based applications.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY\n\u00fe Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from 2014\nto 2016,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged[12]\n\u00fe Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies\n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 bodies set up by the European Union[13]\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the 'Comments' section.\nComments\nThe current\ngovernance framework was established for Galileo's development and deployment\nphase as well as EGNOS initial exploitation i.e. for the period 2008-2013. This\nframework needs to be revised taking into consideration the fact that the\nGalileo deployment phase will extend beyond 2013 and that a new phase of the\nprogramme will start in 2014 with the provision of initial services. EGNOS\ngovernance should also be defined as the system has entered its operational\nphase. The GNSS Regulation, currently under discussion by the Council and the\nEuropean Parliament, aims to define this governance framework.\nAs already\nmentioned in the GNSS Regulation proposal, a stable, long-term and sustainable\ngovernance framework needs to be defined. It shall optimise and rationalise the\nuse of existing structures and ensure a gradual transition between the\ndeployment phase and the exploitation phase safeguarding continuity of\nservices. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules\nSpecify frequency\nand conditions.\nFor its core activities, the Agency will apply monitoring and\nreporting rules defined in the Common Approach on decentralised agencies agreed\nbetween the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council. The Agency\nwill therefore propose:\n- a strategic framework (multiannual work programme) including main\nactions, estimated budget and time-table necessary to meet its objectives at\nthe latest by 30 June 2014;\n- an annual work programme translating the strategic framework into\ndetailed measures and indicators to be proposed at the latest by\n15 November of the preceding year;\n- an annual report evaluating the completion of the annual work\nprogramme;\nIn addition, every five years the Agency's performance will be\nevaluated according to its objectives and mission. Its legitimacy will also be\nre-evaluated every ten years.\nBeyond these standard measures, for tasks delegated to it by the\nCommission, the Agency should ensure that all contracts and agreements\nconcluded in the framework of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes will provide for\nsupervision and financial control. Particular focus in all monitoring and\nevaluation mechanisms should be on containing programmes' cost while delivering\nthe services on schedule.\nIn addition, the Commission, in exercising its powers of political\nsupervision over the Galileo and EGNOS programmes, will strengthen the\nmonitoring and evaluation mechanisms by requesting detailed annual management\nplans and implementation reports as well as organising regular programme\nprogress meetings and carrying out financial and technological audits.\nFinally, in the day-to-day management, the Agency will implement a\nrisk management mechanism and appropriate management tools to contain programmes'\ncost based on better cost estimation, taking stock of previous experience and\nactual system implementation.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\nsystem\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThe Agency will be responsible for activities crucial for the\nsystems, their security and their market uptake. \nIf it cannot have the appropriate organisational set-up and staff to\nperform these activities the overall programmes will be at risk.\nThe major risks identified are the following:\n\u2022 Market risks: market adoption of the services offered by the\nEuropean satellite navigation systems depend on two major factors: the quality\nof the services offered and the readiness of the market to take on the new\nservices offered. Technical performance inferior to that promised or service\ndisruption will have a negative effect among users worldwide, and the\ninfrastructure will not be used as a result. Therefore it is crucial that the\nexploitation of the systems is efficient. In addition, the availability of\nreliable receivers must be ensured for all services to be offered by Galileo,\nespecially the Public Regulated Service and users awareness about the services\nprovided by Galileo and EGNOS must be raised to maximise market adoption and\nhence the socio-economic benefits expected from the systems.\n\u2022 Technological risks: satellite navigation uses leading-edge\ntechnology which has yet to be validated and the specifications of which are\nconstantly evolving. Effective processes have to be put in place to ensure that\nsystems evolution and new generations are based on users' latest needs and most\nhigh-performance technologies. The Agency needs to have the appropriate\nresources to put it place these processes and provide the necessary information\nto the Commission in order to determine the priorities as regards mission\nevolution.\n\u2022 Industrial risks: establishing the infrastructure involves many\nindustrial players, in a number of countries, whose work has to be coordinated\neffectively in order to arrive at systems which are reliable and fully\nintegrated, particularly with regard to security. Lack of resources within the\nAgency could lead to delays and cost overruns, if the programmes cannot be\ncoordinated effectively.\n\u2022 Security risks: the Agency must see to it that the security of the\nsystems is safeguarded effectively to guarantee the security of the Union and\nMember States.\n\u2022 Governance risk: governance of the programmes requires various\nbodies to work together, and an appropriate degree of stability and\norganisation has to be guaranteed. The Agency will have a major role in the\nexploitation of the programmes and as such, it represents a major governance\nrisk if it cannot operate efficiently.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control method(s) envisaged\nThe Agency\u2019s accounts will be submitted for the approval of the\nCourt of Auditors, and subject to the discharge procedure. The Commission\u2019s\nInternal Audit Service will be the Agency's internal auditor. In addition, the\nAgency is working towards quality and security certification of its key\nprocesses as from 2014.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\nand irregularities\nSpecify existing or\nenvisaged prevention and protection measures.\nThe Agency is subject to monitoring by the Anti-Fraud Office.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected\n\u00b7      Existing expenditure budget lines\nIn order of\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Participation \n Number [Description\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026] || Diff./non-diff.

The\ngovernance structure of the programmes and the subsequent missions of the\nAgency are not defined in the present legislative proposal but in the GNSS\nRegulation, which is currently under discussion by the European Parliament and\nthe Council. The need for more personnel is related to the new tasks allocated\nto the Agency in the GNSS Regulation.\nTherefore, the Commission reserves its\nright to amend the present proposal if major changes occur in the governance or\nin the financing of the programmes. Hence, if the Budgetary Authority decides\nto drastically cut the budget allocated to the programmes, the tasks and the staff\nallocated to the Agency will have to be re-assessed. Similarly, if the\nBudgetary Authority decides to assign additional tasks to the Agency, staff\nallocation will also need to be re-evaluated.

If that is the case,\nmanagement of EGNOS exploitation should be transferred to the Agency and the\nprogramme management of the exploitation phase of Galileo should be delegated\nto the Agency from 01/01/2014. These major tasks require appropriate staffing\nand budgetary resources for the Agency in order to achieve the different\nprogramme milestones. The GNSS programme requirements and their development\nought to entail an expansion of the Agency, which should be particularly fast\nuntil 2016 and gradual thereafter.\n\u2013                        \nThe set up of the Galileo Security Monitoring Centres\nin France and the United Kingdom is currently under preparation. Full\ndeployment is expected to take place in 2013 and 2014 and operational\nvalidation tests lasting 24 months are to begin at this time, which explains\nthe need for certain additional staff and one-off costs in 2014. The need for\nthis centre has been highlighted in particular during the detailed preparation\nwork for the services. This centre must be equipped with qualified operators\nwho will use the software and equipment with in-depth knowledge of the security\naspects of the system and who must be trained in the services' deployment and\nprogressive supply phase. In particular, they must also meet requirements in\nterms of access to PRS (Public Regulated Service) for PRS users. They must also\ndraw up operational procedures and monitor and manage security incidents across\nthe whole system.\n\u2013                        \nRental costs for the Agency in Prague are free\nof charge until June 2017. After that, the Agency will have to pay, 25% of the\ncommercial market value of the offices as rental costs to the Czech\nAuthorities. An estimation has been carried out based on real Prague prices.\nApart from headquarters, the Agency will have to cover other rental costs for\nadditional locations where the Agency will perform its tasks i.e., in France\n(St. Germain en Laye, Toulouse), in the United Kingdom (Swanick) and in the\nNetherlands (ESTEC Centre, European Space Agency).\n\u2013                        \nStaff costs of the Agency are calculated based\non the Commission average costs. They include a relatively low turnover of\nstaff and an average entry into service for new recruits of April each year.\nCost of living coefficients are also taken into account (Prague is 15% below\nBrussels coefficient, while France is 16% above Brussels coefficient).\n\u2013                        \nCosts subject to an estimated 3% inflation\nannual increase are salaries, rental costs, IT costs and services provided by\nthe Commission, postage and telecommunications. The other costs have not been\naffected by inflation, which leads to a reduction in real costs for the Agency.\n\u2013                        \nCurrent administrative costs have been\ncalculated based on real costs in 2011 and 2012, without increase due to\ninflation.\n\u2013                        \nIn 2012 and 2013, the Agency IT networks and IT\nequipments are being fully renovated due to the relocation of the Agency's\nheadquarters to Prague in September 2012. Based on depreciation and usability,\na renewal of such equipment is expected in 2018, both for headquarters and for\nthe Galileo Security Monitoring Centres.\n\u2013                        \nDuring the period 2014-2020 some of the most\nimportant communication activities will take place e.g., launch of Galileo\nearly services in 2014-2015, Galileo full operational capabilities in\n2018-2019. These major events will also require more segment markets to be\nincluded in the Agency's full campaigns, and a major revamp in existing\nwebsites and communication tools (including real time content enhancement).\n\u2013                        \nCosts are calculated on the assumption that the\nreinforcement of security accreditation independence defined in the present\nproposal vis-\u00e0-vis the Agency's other tasks will not lead to a duplication of\ncentral administrative services.\nThe table here below illustrates the\ndetailed budget of GSA for the period 2013-2020.\n3.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimated impact on the\nAgency's human resources \n3.2.3.1.\u00a0 Summary \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 The proposal/initiative does not require the use of appropriations\nof an administrative nature.\n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 The proposal/initiative requires the use of appropriations of an\nadministrative nature, as explained below:\nEUR million (to 3\ndecimal places)\n   || 2013 || 2014 || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 || 2020 || TOTAL \n Officials (AD Grades) ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Officials (AST grades) ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Contractual agents ||   || 1.125 || 1.276 || 1.376 || 1.393 || 1.435 || 1.478 || 1.522 || 9.606 \n Temporary agents ||   || 9.768 || 11.081 || 13.071 || 12.960 || 13.550 || 14.061 || 14.599 || 89.090 \n Seconded National Experts ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n TOTAL ||   || 10.893 || 12.357 || 14.447 || 14.353 || 14.985 || 15.539 || 16.122 || 98.696 \nThe main assumptions used to calculate\nstaff costs are the following:\n- TAs rates = Commission average rate\n(9 5000 EUR + inflation)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n- CAs rate = = Commission average rate (mix\nof FGIII and FGIV = 40 000 EUR + inflation) \n- Inflation of 3% per year\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n- Existing costs of staff reduced by 3% due\nto rotation\u00a0\u00a0 \n- New recruited staff cost reduced by 25% -\naverage entry into service 1 April\u00a0 \n- Installation costs according to Staff\nRegulations: Installation allowance, daily allowance (only three months),\nremoval costs, travelling costs.\nThe Agency's staff required 2013-2020 (in\nnumber of FTEs)\n   || 2013 || 2014 || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 || 2020 \n Temporary agents || 77 || 97 || 109 || 117 || 121 || 123 || 124 || 125 \n SNEs / CAs || 17 || 25 || 29 || 31 || 31 || 31 || 31 || 31 \n TOTAL || 94 || 122 || 138 || 148 || 152 || 154 || 155 || 156 \nThe Agency's staff by activity (in number\nof FTEs)\n   || 2013 || 2014 || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 || 2020 \n Staff directly assigned to exploitation of GNSS systems || 20 || 43 || 57 || 65 || 69 || 71 || 72 || 73 \n Staff directly assigned to the GSMC || 28 || 34 || 37 || 40 || 40 || 40 || 40 || 40 \n Staff for core GSA tasks (existing tasks) || 46 || 45 || 44 || 43 || 43 || 43 || 43 || 43 \n TOTAL || 94 || 122 || 138 || 148 || 152 || 154 || 155 || 156 \nThe Agency's staff by activity (as a % of\nthe total)\n   || 2013 || 2014 || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 || 2020 \n % of GSA staff assigned to exploitation || 21% || 35% || 41% || 44% || 45% || 46% || 46% || 47% \n Percentage of GSA staff assigned to the GSMC || 30% || 29% || 27% || 26% || 26% || 26% || 26% || 26% \n Percentage of GSA staff assigned to core GSA tasks (existing tasks) || 49% || 36% || 32% || 30% || 29% || 28% || 28% || 27% \n TOTAL || 100% || 100% || 100% || 100% || 100% || 100% || 100% || 100% \nAs previously outlined, the Agency will be\nresponsible for a mix of tasks, some of which are new and some of which are a\ncontinuation of its current activities.

This is reflected in the decrease of\n1 FTE in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively.\nThe Agency's staff requirements have been\nassessed by the Commission after consultation with the Agency and on the basis\nof a study detailing all the activities to be carried out for the exploitation\nof the programmes[23].\nDescription of tasks to be carried out:\n Officials and temporary agents || 1. Security Accreditation of the GNSS systems (Agency's core task) 2. Management of the Galileo Security Monitoring Centres (Agency's core task, which will be further increased mainly in 2014, following the initial posts in 2012 and 2013) 3. Market Development, GNSS applications development including PRS user technology development (Agency's core task with possible additional delegated tasks) 4. GNSS Communication (Agency's core task) 5. Exploitation of the GNSS systems (new delegated task \u2013 tasks relating to EGNOS exploitation constitute a transfer of responsibility from the Commission to the Agency while tasks relating to Galileo's exploitation phase constitute programme management tasks delegated to the Agency).   The activities to be carried-out during the exploitation phase have been identified and structured into a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Responsibility for all exploitation activities will be delegated to the Agency, which must ensure their coordination but not necessarily their execution. It should be noted that the majority of these activities arise from the need to ensure the operations of service provision and that these activities are not currently addressed in the existing organisation of the programmes. Within the WBS, all activities relating to exploitation can be structured in the following five strands: -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 execution management, mainly consisting in o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 detailing the high-level objectives set by the Commission, the international or intergovernmental agreements and the system security requirements in the form of a technical Mission Requirement Document o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 controlling programme planning, cost and risk, o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 setting-up and following-up agreements and contracts required in programme exploitation; -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 programme engineering, consisting of the design of future developments in line with the Mission Requirement Document , coordinating system standardisation processes, developing new infrastructure, qualifying the new infrastructure (including software release), performing mission engineering and assessing the performance of the system; -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 infrastructure management, relating to the management of the infrastructure project, the performance of system engineering, building the space and ground infrastructures and deploying system updates; -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 operations and services provision, consisting of managing the service provisions, operating the infrastructure and monitoring the performance of the operations; -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 utilisation of the services through definition and maintenance of a market strategy, promotion of the use and adoption of the services and fostering of the definition and development of new applications. \n External personnel || Mostly support/administrative tasks for operations. From 2015, the share of support staff amounts to 16% of all Agency's staff, which is in the lower band of all Agencies and below Union standard levels (this share is estimated at 25% for Union agencies at full cruising speed, and is even higher in the Commission). \nThe table here below illustrates detailed\nstaff numbers of the Agency for the period 2013-2020:\nThe additional staff required by the exploitation\nof the systems is essentially composed of AD posts, with less than 10%\nallocated to management tasks (AD10-12). The majority of the posts will be\nrecruited under an AD6-9 grade due to the difficulties involved in recruiting\nexperienced people with highly specialised technical skills.\n3.2.3.2.\u00a0  Estimated requirements of\nhuman resources for the parent DG\n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 The proposal/initiative does not require the use of human\nresources. \nThe proposal does not require the Commission to\nmake use of additional human resources.

In\nfact, while the tasks associated with the exploitation of EGNOS are to be\ntransferred from the Commission to the Agency, the tasks associated with the\nexploitation of the system arising from the Galileo programme delegated to the\nAgency are new tasks as the system is not yet operational. This is because\ntoday Galileo is not yet providing any services, and the teams involved in the\nCommission and in the Agency have concentrated their efforts on the deployment\nof the infrastructure. The transition to an operational infrastructure, the start\nof provision of services on which lives depend will require entirely new\nactivities and additional personnel. While this will lead to a combined\nCommission and Agency staff increase of 31%, the average yearly budget managed\nbetween 2007-2013 and 214-2020 will increase by 103%.\nFor some years to come and until the\nappropriate milestone is achieved, the Commission will continue to be\nresponsible for the deployment of the Galileo infrastructure and will have to\nkeep in place the teams that supervise these activities. Thereafter the\nCommission's role will focus on the political supervision of the programmes,\nand this is why the Commission has proposed to reduce its establishment plan by\na total of 30 posts over the 2014-2020 period. This reduction reflects notably:\n2)                \nthe process of transferring EGNOS exploitation\nactivities (the exploitation phase of the Galileo programme being a new task)\nto the Agency will lead to a reduction of Commission GNSS staff numbers by 3\nFTEs (3.3%);\n3)                \nthe staff decrease decided by the Commission for\nexisting activities will lead to a further reduction by 12 FTEs (13%);\n4)                \nthe principle of an additional staff reduction\nof 15 FTEs following internal redeployment in the Commission.\nThe change in staff numbers at the\nCommission for GNSS services is therefore as follows:\n Commission staff assigned to GNSS tasks || 2013 || 2014 || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 || 2020 || Total reduction \n Reduction || 0 || -3 ||   ||   || -3 || -4 || -5 || 0 || -15 \n TOTAL || 92 || 89 || 89 || 89 || 86 || 82 || 77 || 77 ||   \nThe additional reduction referred to in\npoint 3) above will be distributed on a non-linear basis over the seven years.\nThe reduction by 30 posts is independent and therefore in addition to the\nhorizontal reduction of 5% in the Commission's workforce between 2013 and 2017;\nthese posts will all be deducted from the Commission's establishment plan. \nAdditional reduction in staff at the\nCommission\n   || 2014 || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 || 2020 || Total reduction \n TOTAL Additional reduction in staff at the Commission || -2 || -3 || -3 || -2 || -2 || -2 || -1 || -15 \nThese human resources requirements will be\ncovered by the workforce of the DG already responsible for managing the\nactivity and/or redeployed internally within the DG, supplemented, as required,\nby any additional allocation that could be granted to the managing DG in the\ncontext of the annual allocation procedure and in the light of existing\nbudgetary constraints.\nThis reduction is applied despite the\nCommission's continued overall responsibility for the GNSS Programmes and\ndespite a number of new tasks intended for the Commission by the Council and\nthe European Parliament (as witnessed during the negotiations of the new GNSS\nRegulation), such as the definition of a new IPR policy, mission evolution and\nstringent reporting requirements to the GNSS Committee, the Council and the\nEuropean Parliament. The Commission will endeavour to accommodate these new\ntasks through internal redeployments. \nSpecifically, the Commission's future role\ncan be summarised in the following six blocks of activities:\n\u2013                        \ncontributing to the EU's broader policy\nobjectives: the goal is to promote the inclusion of GNSS technologies across\ndifferent areas of research and their considerations in sectoral policy\ninitiatives ranging from the modes of transport, to agriculture, personal\nmobility, timing, energy. The purpose is to ensure that EU policies in these\nsectors make the best use of the innovative potential and added value of the\nEuropean satellite navigation systems;\n\u2013                        \ndefinition and developing the high-level\nobjectives of the Programmes to reflect policy requirements and those of other\nstakeholders and users, and translating these into programme policy and\ntechnical requirements;\n\u2013                        \ndefining and adapting the implementation\nconditions. In accordance with the strategic objectives of the Commission with\nregard to the programmes, measures for their implementation, such as delegation\nagreements, need to be defined, site hosting agreements elaborated and\nappropriate standards developed. Moreover, the Commission will remain\nresponsible for the security of the systems. Therefore, it needs to define security\nrequirements and ensure coordination with regard to security matters;\n\u2013                        \ndefining and developing the GNSS-related\npolicies, creating the regulatory and international environment conducive to\nachieving the GNSS Programmes' objectives. As part of the work on the\nregulatory framework for the GNSS Programmes, the Commission will examine the\nsafety and security of the GNSS users, assess the vulnerability of satellite\nnavigation systems and devices and propose countervailing measures, ensure the\nharmonisation of European radionavigation services, increase stability to allow\nindustry to plan future investment, as well as increase safety and security\n(for example with the development of measures to reduce the dependency on GPS).\nIn the international domain, it will draft and negotiate international\nagreements and coordinate with international organisations in order to ensure\ncompatibility and interoperability with other GNSS systems; \n\u2013                        \nmonitoring of the programmes' implementation.\nAlthough the Commission will not be responsible for the operational management\nof the programmes, it retains the overall responsibility with regard to their\nsmooth progress, and it will be held responsible for any cost overrun or\nschedule delay. Therefore, it is crucial that the Commission closely monitors\nthe implementation of the programmes by the European Space Agency (for the\ncompletion of the deployment phase) and by the European GNSS Agency (for the\nexploitation phase). Member States and the European Parliament have also put\nforward very stringent requirements for reporting through the draft GNSS\nRegulation currently in co-decision. Finally, the Commission will ensure the\npreparation, presentation and circulation of these reports to the GNSS\nCommittee and the Budgetary Authority in particular; \n\u2013                        \nmanaging stakeholder relations by providing\nup-to-date, positive, coherent and useful information on the status of\nimplementation of EGNOS and Galileo to stakeholders, as well as regular,\nprofessional reports for internal and external audiences.\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 196, 24.07.2008, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 276, 20.10.2010, p. 11.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2011) 814 final\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p..\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p..\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 196; 24.7.2008, p. 1\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 276; 20.10.2010, p. 11\n[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L \u2026 of \u2026...2013, p. \u2026[It should be noted that, as\nlong as this Regulation and the Regulation implementing the future multiannual\nfinancial framework have not yet been adopted, the scope of the tasks entrusted\nto the European GNSS Agency and the budget appropriations assigned accordingly\ncannot be regarded as definitive]\n[9]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ABM: activity-based management \u2013 ABB: Activity-Based\nBudgeting.\n[10]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As referred to in Article 49(6)(a) or (b) of the\nFinancial Regulation.\n[11]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2011) 814 final\n[12]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Details of management modes and references to the\nFinancial Regulation may be found on the BudgWeb site: http://www.cc.cec/budg/man/budgmanag/budgmanag_en.html\n[13]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As referred to in Article 185 of the Financial\nRegulation.\n[14]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 = Differentiated appropriations / Non-diff. =\nNon-Differentiated Appropriations\n[15]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EFTA: European Free Trade Association. \n[16]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Candidate countries and, where applicable, potential\ncandidate countries from the Western Balkans.\n[17]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Budget for Europe 2020 \u2013 COM(2011) 500\n[18]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PE489.561v02-00\n[19]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This amount differs from the budget of the Agency for\n2013 as it takes into account the financing of 20 additional posts in 2013 by\nredeployment of the GNSS programmes.
