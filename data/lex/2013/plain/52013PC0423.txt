The objectives of such\nagreements are to give all European Union air carriers non-discriminatory\naccess to routes between the European Union and third countries, and to bring\nbilateral air service agreements between Member States and third countries in\nline with the law of the Union.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General\ncontext\nInternational\naviation relations between Member States and third countries have traditionally\nbeen governed by bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries, the Annexes to such agreements and other related bilateral\nor multilateral arrangements.\nTraditional\ndesignation clauses in Member States\u2019 bilateral air services agreements\ninfringe the law of the Union. They allow a third country to reject, withdraw\nor suspend the permissions or authorisations of an air carrier that has been\ndesignated by a Member State but that is not substantially owned and\neffectively controlled by that Member State or its nationals. This has been\nfound to constitute discrimination against European Union carriers established\nin the territory of a Member State but owned and controlled by nationals of\nother Member States. This is contrary to Article 49 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union which guarantees nationals of Member States\nwho have exercised their freedom of establishment the same treatment in the\nhost Member State as that accorded to nationals of that Member State.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing\nprovisions in the area of the proposal\nThe provisions of\nthe Agreement supersede or complement the existing provisions in the 12\nbilateral air services agreements between Member States and the Republic of   Peru.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency\nwith the other policies and objectives of the Union\nThe Agreement will\nserve a fundamental objective of the external aviation policy of the Union by\nbringing existing bilateral air services agreements in line with the law of the\n Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation\nof interested parties\nConsultation\nmethods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents\nMember States as well as the industry were\nconsulted throughout the negotiations.\nSummary of\nresponses and how they have been taken into account\nComments made by\nMember States and the industry have been taken into account.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary\nof the proposed action\nIn accordance with\nthe mechanisms and directives in the Annex to the \u201dhorizontal mandate\u201d, the\nCommission has negotiated an agreement with the Republic of Peru that replaces\ncertain provisions in the existing bilateral air services agreements between\nMember States and the Republic of Peru.
