Consequently it is planned to propose criminal law harmonisation\nfor this offence based on Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union (TFEU) in 2013[2].\nGeneral\ncontext\nThe breaking down of barriers within the\nInternal Market facilitates not only the establishment or development of\nlegitimate businesses across the EU, but may also provide increased\nopportunities for money laundering and terrorist financing. Criminals engaged\nin money laundering could therefore attempt to conceal or disguise the true\nnature, source or ownership of the assets in question and transform them into\nseemingly legitimate proceeds. Moreover, terrorist financing can be funded\nthrough both legitimate and criminal activities, as terrorist organisations\nengage in revenue-generating activities which in themselves may be, or at least\nappear to be, legitimate. Money\nlaundering and terrorism financing create thus a high risk to the integrity,\nproper functioning, reputation and stability of the financial system, with\npotentially devastating consequences for the broader society.\nEuropean legislation has been adopted to\nprotect the proper functioning of the financial system and of the Internal\nMarket. However, the changing nature of money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing threats, facilitated\nby a constant evolution of technology and of the means at the disposal of\ncriminals, requires a permanent adaptation of the legal framework to counter\nsuch threats.\nAt the EU level, Directive 2005/60/EC of 26\nOctober 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the\npurpose of money laundering and terrorist financing[3] (hereinafter referred to as the\nThird AMLD) sets out the framework designed to protect the soundness, integrity\nand stability of credit and financial institutions and confidence in the\nfinancial system as a whole, against the risks of money laundering and\nterrorist financing. The EU rules are to a large extent based on international\nstandards adopted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and, as the\nDirective follows a minimum harmonisation approach, the framework is completed\nby rules adopted at national level.\nAt international level, the FATF has\nundertaken a fundamental review of the international standards and adopted a\nnew set of Recommendations in February 2012. \nIn parallel to the international process,\nthe European Commission has been undertaking its own review of the European\nframework. A revision of the Directive at this time is complementary to the\nrevised FATF Recommendations, which in themselves represent a substantial\nstrengthening of the anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing\nframework. The Directive itself further strengthens elements of the revised\nRecommendations, in particular in relation to scope (by including providers of\ngambling services and dealers in goods with a threshold of EUR 7 500),\nbeneficial ownership information (which is to be made available to obliged\nentities and competent authorities), and in the provisions on sanctions. It\ntakes into account the necessity to increase effectiveness of AML measures by\nadapting the legal framework to ensure that risk assessments are carried out at\nthe appropriate level and with the necessary degree of flexibility to allow\nadaptation to the different situations and actors. As a consequence of this,\nthe Directive, while setting a high level of common standards, requires Member\nStates, supervisory authorities and obliged entities to assess risk and take\nadequate mitigating measures commensurate to such risk. This results in the\nDirective being less detailed as regards concrete measures to be taken.\nExisting\nprovisions in this area\nVarious legal instruments have been adopted\nto ensure an effective anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing framework\nat EU level. The most important ones are:\n\u2013                        \nThe Third AML Directive, which covers most of\nthe 40 FATF Recommendations and some of the 9 FATF Special Recommendations; \n\u2013                        \nRegulation (EC) No 1781/2006 of 15 November 2006\non information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds[4], which implements FATF SR VII\non wire transfers;\n\u2013                        \nRegulation (EC) No 1889/2005 of 26 October 2005 on\ncontrols of cash entering or leaving the Community[5], which implements FATF SR IX on\ncash couriers;\n\u2013                        \nDirective 2007/64/EC of 13 December 2007 on\npayment services in the internal market[6]\n(Payment Services Directive) which, in combination with the Third AMLD,\nimplements FATF SR VI on alternative remittance;\n\u2013                        \nRegulation (EC) No 2580/2001 of 27 December 2001\non specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities\nwith a view to combating terrorism[7]\nwhich, together with Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 of 27 May 2002[8] implementing UN Al Qai'da and\nTaliban sanctions, implements part of FATF SR III on freezing terrorist assets.\nConsistency\nwith other policies and objectives of the Union \nThe proposed adaptation of the anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing framework is fully coherent with EU policies in other areas. In\nparticular:\n\u2013                        \nthe Stockholm Programme[9], which aims at achieving an\nopen and secure Europe serving and protecting citizens, calls on Member States\nand the Commission to further develop information exchange between the FIUs, in\nthe fight against money laundering;\n\u2013                        \nthe EU's Internal Security Strategy[10] identifies the most urgent\nchallenges to EU security in the years to come and proposes five strategic\nobjectives and specific actions for 2011-2014 to help make the EU more secure.\nThis includes tackling money laundering and preventing terrorism. The need to\nupdate the EU anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing framework\nwith a view to enhancing the transparency of legal persons and legal\narrangements has been specifically recognised;\n\u2013                        \nthe potential for misuse of new technologies to\nconceal transactions and hide identity makes it important for Member States to\nbe aware of technological developments and simulate the use of electronic\nidentification, electronic signature and trust services for electronic\ntransactions, in line with Commission\u2019s proposal for a Regulation on electronic\nidentification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal\nmarket[11];\n\u2013                        \nin March 2012, the European Commission adopted a\nproposal on the freezing and confiscation of proceeds of crime in the EU[12] which seeks to ensure that\nMember States have in place an efficient system to freeze, manage and\nconfiscate criminal assets, backed by the necessary institutional setup,\nfinancial and human resources;\n\u2013                        \nwith respect to data protection, the proposed\nclarifications to the Third AMLD are fully in line with the approach set out in\nthe Commission's recent data protection proposals[13], whereby a specific provision[14] empowers EU or national\nlegislation to restrict the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in\nthe draft regulation on a number of specified grounds, including the prevention,\ninvestigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences;\n\u2013                        \nwith respect to sanctions, the proposal to\nintroduce a set of minimum principles-based rules to strengthen administrative\nsanctions is fully in line with the Commission's policy as outlined in its\nCommunication \"Reinforcing sanctioning regimes in the financial services\nsector\"[15];\n\u2013                        \nwith respect to financial inclusion, the fact\nthat applying an overly cautious approach to anti-money laundering and combating\nterrorist financing safeguards might have the unintended consequence of\nexcluding legitimate businesses and consumers from the financial system has\nbeen recognised. Work has been carried out on this issue at international level[16] to provide guidance to support\ncountries and their financial institutions in designing anti-money laundering\nand combating terrorist financing measures that meet the national goal of\nfinancial inclusion, without compromising the measures that exist for the\npurpose of combating crime. At EU level, the issue of financial inclusion is\ncurrently under consideration as part of the work on a Bank Accounts package;\n\u2013                        \nwith respect to the cooperation with persons or\nauthorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the\nassessment of, collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or\nthe determination of appeals in relation to taxes and any other public levy,\nthe proposal is consistent with the approach for fighting against tax fraud and\ntax evasion[17]\nfollowed at international level in including a specific reference to tax crimes\nwithin the serious crimes which can be considered as predicate offences to\nmoney laundering. The enhancement of the customer due diligence procedures for\nAML purposes will also assist the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation\nof interested parties\nThe Commission adopted in April 2012 a\nreport on the application of the Third AMLD and solicited comments from all\nstakeholders. The report focused on a number of identified key themes (e.g.\nincluding application of a risk-based approach, extending the scope of the\nexisting framework, adjusting the approach to customer due diligence,\nclarifying reporting obligations and supervisory powers, enhancing FIU\nco-operation etc.), which were essential for the review of the Third AMLD. \nThe Commission received 77 contributions\nfrom public authorities, civil society, business federations and companies in\nseveral fields (including financial services, gambling sector, liberal\nprofessions, real estate sector, trust and company service providers),\nrepresenting a broad variety of stakeholders. An additional number of comments,\nposition papers and contributions were received outside the consultation. \nThe overall results of the consultation[18] point to a general\nconfirmation of the issues and problems highlighted by the Commission's Report,\nas well as broad support for the proposed alignment to the revised FATF\nstandards and for greater clarification in certain areas (i.e. data protection\nand how to apply the rules in cross-border situations). \nUse of\nexpertise\nSubstantial efforts have been made to\nobtain evidence in this field and to ensure full engagement of the different\nstakeholders.\nIn particular, over the course of 2010, a\nstudy by external consultants Deloitte[19]\nwas carried out on behalf of the Commission to look into the application of the\nThird AML Directive. \nImpact\nassessment\nThe Commission has undertaken an Impact\nAssessment[20],\nwhere it analysed the potential consequences of money laundering and terrorism\nfinancing. In particular, the financial system failing to prevent money\nlaundering and terrorist financing can lead to negative economic impacts\n(arising from disruptions to international capital flows, reduced investment\nand lower economic growth) and financial market instability (resulting from\nreluctance of other financial intermediaries to engage in business, loss of\nreputation, drop in confidence and prudential risks). \nThe following problem drivers were\nexamined: \n\u2013                        \nthe different application of existing EU rules\nacross Member States, leading to reduced legal certainty;\n\u2013                        \nthe inadequacies and loopholes with respect to\nthe current EU rules;\n\u2013                        \nthe inconsistency of the current rules with the\nrecently revised international standards.\nThis requires the achievement of the\nfollowing operational objectives: \n\u2013                        \nensure consistency between national rules and,\nwhere appropriate, flexibility in their implementation by strengthening and\nclarifying current requirements; \n\u2013                        \nensure that the rules are risk-focused and\nadjusted to address new emerging threats, by strengthening and clarifying\ncurrent requirements;\n\u2013                        \nensure that the EU approach is consistent with\nthe approach followed at international level by extending the scope of application,\nstrengthening and clarifying the current requirements.\nThe impact assessment concluded that the\nbest options to improve the existing situation would be: \n\u2013                        \nBroadening scope to cover gambling: broaden the scope of the Directive beyond \"casinos\" to\ncover the gambling sector;\n\u2013                        \nThresholds for traders in goods: reduce the scope and customer due diligence thresholds for traders\nin high value goods from EUR 15 000 to EUR 7 500 for cash transactions;\n\u2013                        \nSanctions regimes:\nintroduce a set of minimum principles-based rules to strengthen administrative\nsanctions;\n\u2013                        \nComparability of statistical data: reinforce and make more precise the requirement regarding the\ncollecting and reporting of statistical data;\n\u2013                        \nData protection:\nintroduce provisions in the Directive to clarify the interaction between\nanti-money laundering/combating terrorist financing and data protection\nrequirements;\n\u2013                        \nInclusion of tax crimes in the scope: include an explicit reference to tax crimes as a predicate\noffence;\n\u2013                        \nAvailability of beneficial owner information: require all companies to hold information on their beneficial\nowners;\n\u2013                        \nIdentification of Beneficial Owner (BO): maintain the approach which requires identification of the BO as of\na 25% ownership threshold, but clarify what the \"25% threshold\" refers\nto;\n\u2013                        \nHome and host supervisory responsibilities\nfor AML: introduce new rules clarifying that\nbranches and subsidiaries situated in other Member States than the head office\napply host state AML rules and reinforce cooperation arrangements between home and\nhost supervisors;\n\u2013                        \nCross-border cooperation between Financial\nIntelligence Units (FIUs): introduce new\nrequirements that would strengthen FIU powers and cooperation;\n\u2013                        \nNational Risk Assessments: introduce a requirement for Member States to carry out a risk\nassessment at national level and take measures to mitigate risks;\n\u2013                        \nCustomer Due Diligence: Member States to ensure that enhanced due diligence must be\nconducted in certain situations of high risk, while allowing them to permit\nsimplified due diligence in lower risk situations;\n\u2013                        \nEquivalence of third country regimes: remove the \"white list\" process;\n\u2013                        \nRisk-Sensitive Approach to supervision: specific recognition in the Directive that supervision can be\ncarried out on a risk-sensitive basis;\n\u2013                        \nTreatment of Politically Exposed Persons\n(PEPs): introduce new requirements for domestic\nPEPs/PEPs working in international organisations, with risk-sensitive measures\nto be applied.\nIn addition, the impact assessment analysed\nthe impact of the legislative proposals on Fundamental Rights. In line with the\nCharter of Fundamental rights, the proposals seek in particular to ensure\nprotection of personal data (Article 8 of the Charter) by clarifying the\nconditions under which personal data can be stored and transferred. The proposals\nwill bring no change and therefore have no impact on the right to an effective\nremedy and to a fair trial (Article 47 of the Charter) which are not infringed\nby the Directive as confirmed by the European Court of Justice (case C-305/05).\nThe respect for private life (Article 7), the freedom to conduct a business\n(Article 16) and the prohibition of discrimination (Article 21) have been duly\ntaken into account. Finally, the proposal will indirectly help to protect the\nright to life (Article 2 of the Charter).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nLegal\nbasis\nThe current proposal is based on Article\n114 TFEU. \nSubsidiarity\nand proportionality\nIn accordance with the principles of\nsubsidiarity and proportionality as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union, the objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved\nby Member States and can therefore be better achieved at the Union level. The\nproposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\nRecital 2 of the Third AMLD underlines the\nnecessity of having measures at the EU level aiming at protecting the\nsoundness, integrity and stability of credit and financial institutions and\nconfidence in the financial system as a whole, \"in order to avoid Member\nStates adopting measures to protect their financial systems which could be\ninconsistent with the functioning of the internal market and with the\nprescriptions of the rule of law and Community public policy, Community action\nin this area is necessary\".\nAs massive flows of dirty money and\nterrorist financing can damage the stability and reputation of the financial\nsector and threaten the internal market, any measures adopted solely at\nnational level could have adverse effects on the EU Single Market: an absence\nof coordinated rules across Member States aimed at protecting their financial\nsystems could be inconsistent with the functioning of the internal market and\nresult in fragmentation. EU action is also justified in order to maintain a\nlevel playing field across the EU \u2013 with entities in all Member States subject\nto a consistent set of anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing\nobligations.\nThe Commission considers that the proposed\nrule changes are proportionate to the objectives. By imposing thresholds on\nscope and customer due diligence, the Commission has taken proportionate steps\nto limit the applicability of the Directive, where appropriate. In addition,\nthe Directive allows certain of the preventative measures to be taken by SMEs\nto be proportionate to the size and nature of the obliged entity. At the same\ntime, by ensuring a tailored and flexible risk-based approach, Member States\nshould not be constrained from adopting measures and taking actions as\nnecessary to counter important threats they may confront at national level.\nThese measures are better suited to a Directive than a fully harmonised\nRegulation, with the inclusion of processes at EU level to ensure greater\ncoordination and the development of supranational approaches, together with\nfurther harmonisation in specific areas ensuring that EU objectives are also\nmet. Although ensuring an effective AML/counter terrorism financing system\nentails some cost for obliged entities (these costs have been analysed in the\nImpact Assessment), the Commission considers that the benefits associated with\npreventing money laundering and terrorist financing will continue to outweigh\nthe costs.\nThe evaluation of the new international\nstandards will begin in the fourth quarter of 2013. Unless the Commission\nprovides clear and early indications of the desired EU approach to their\nimplementation, there is a risk that those EU Member States who will be\nevaluated first will opt for solutions which may not coincide with the proposed\nEU approach, thus rendering agreement of common EU rules more difficult.\nFinally, with the adoption of revised\ninternational standards, commitments have been taken by the Commission as well\nas all EU Member States (either directly or via their membership of FATF or\nMoneyval) to ensure their implementation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the\nbudget of the European Union.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nDetailed\nexplanation of the proposal\nThe main modifications to the Third AMLD\nare:\n\u2013                        \nExtension of the scope of the Directive: two main changes are proposed to the scope: \n(a)         \nthe threshold for traders in high value goods\ndealing with cash payments be reduced from EUR 15 000 to EUR 7 500. Currently\ntraders in goods are included in the scope of the Directive if they deal with\ncash payments of EUR 15 000 or more. After receiving information from Member\nStates that this relatively high threshold was being exploited by criminals it\nis proposed to lower it to EUR 7 500. In addition, the new proposal requires\ntraders to carry out customer due diligence when carrying out an occasional\ntransaction of at least EUR 7 500, a reduction from the previous threshold of\nEUR 15 000. Both the definition and the threshold show a tightening of measures\nagainst the use of these traders for money laundering purposes across the EU;\n(b)         \nthe scope of the Directive includes\n\"providers of gambling services\" (in accordance with Directive\n2000/31/EC of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society\nservices, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market[21]). The current Third AMLD and\nthe revised FATF Recommendations require that only casinos be included in the\nscope of anti-money laundering/combating terrorist financing legislation.\nEvidence in the EU suggests that this leaves other areas of gambling vulnerable\nto miss-use by criminals.\n\u2013                        \nRisk-based approach: The Directive recognises that the use of a risk-based approach is\nan effective way to identify and mitigate risks to the financial system and\nwider economic stability in the internal market area. The new measures proposed\nwould require evidence-based measures to be implemented in three main areas,\neach of which would be supplemented with a minimum list of factors to be taken\ninto consideration or guidance to be developed by the European Supervisory\nAuthorities:\n(a)         \nMember States will be required to identify,\nunderstand and mitigate the risks facing them. This can be supplemented by risk\nassessment work carried out at a supra-national level (e.g. by the European\nSupervisory Authorities or Europol) and the results should be shared with other\nMember States and obliged entities. This would be the starting point for the\nrisk-based approach, and would recognise that an EU-wide response can be\ninformed by Member States' national experience; \n(b)         \nObliged entities operating within the scope of\nthe Directive would be required to identify, understand and mitigate their\nrisks, and to document and update the assessments of risk that they undertake.\nThis is a key element of the risk-based approach, allowing competent\nauthorities (such as supervisors) within Member States to thoroughly review and\nunderstand the decisions made by obliged entities under their supervision.\nUltimately, those adopting a risk-based approach would be fully accountable for\nthe decisions they make; \n(c)         \nThe proposal would recognise that the resources\nof supervisors can be used to concentrate on areas where the risks of money\nlaundering and terrorist financing are greater. The use of a risk-based\napproach would mean that evidence is used to better target the risks.\n\u2013                        \nSimplified and Enhanced Customer Due\nDiligence: in the proposal, obliged entities would\nbe required to take enhanced measures where risks are greater and may be\npermitted to take simplified measures where risks are demonstrated to be less. With\nregard to the current (Third) AMLD, the provisions on simplified due diligence\nwere found to be overly permissive, with certain categories of client or\ntransaction being given outright exemptions from due diligence requirements.\nThe revised Directive would therefore tighten the rules on simplified due\ndiligence and would not permit situations where exemptions apply. Instead,\ndecisions on when and how to undertake simplified due diligence would have to\nbe justified on the basis of risk, while minimum requirements of the factors to\nbe taken into consideration would be given. In one of the situations where\nenhanced due diligence should always be conducted, namely for politically\nexposed persons, the Directive has been strengthened to include politically\nexposed persons who are entrusted with prominent public functions domestically,\nas well as those who work for international organisations.\n\u2013                        \nInformation on the beneficial owner: the revised Directive proposes new measures in order to provide\nenhanced clarity and accessibility of beneficial ownership information. It\nrequires legal persons to hold information on their own beneficial ownership.\nThis information should be made available to both competent authorities and obliged\nentities. For legal arrangements, trustees are required to declare their status\nwhen becoming a customer and information on beneficial ownership is similarly\nrequired to be made available to competent authorities and obliged entities. \n\u2013                        \nThird country equivalence: the revised Directive will remove the provisions relating to\npositive \"equivalence\", as the customer due diligence regime is\nbecoming more strongly risk-based and the use of exemptions on the grounds of\npurely geographical factors is less relevant. The current provisions of the\nThird AMLD require decisions to be made on whether third countries have anti-money\nlaundering/combating terrorist financing systems that are\n\"equivalent\" to those in the EU. This information was then used to\nallow exemptions for certain aspects of customer due diligence. \n\u2013                        \nAdministrative sanctions: in line with Commission policy to align administrative sanctions,\nthe revised Directive contains a range of sanctions that Member States should\nensure are available for systematic breaches of key requirements of the\nDirective, namely customer due diligence, record keeping, suspicious\ntransaction reporting and internal controls.\n\u2013                        \nFinancial Intelligence Units: the proposal would bring in the provisions of Council Decision\n2000/642/JHA\nof 17 October 2000 concerning arrangements for\ncooperation between financial intelligence units of the Member States in\nrespect of exchanging information and further extend and strengthen cooperation.\n\u2013                        \nEuropean Supervisory Authorities (ESA): the proposal contains several areas where work by the ESA is\nenvisaged. In particular, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA are asked to carry out an\nassessment and provide an opinion on the money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing risks facing the EU. In addition, the greater emphasis on the\nrisk-based approach requires an enhanced degree of guidance for Member States\nand financial institutions on what factors should be taken into account when\napplying simplified customer due diligence and enhanced customer due diligence\nand when applying a risk-based approach to supervision. In addition, the ESAs\nhave been tasked with providing regulatory technical standards for certain\nissues where financial institutions have to adapt their internal controls to\ndeal with specific situations.\n\u2013                        \nData Protection:\nthe need to strike a balance between allowing robust systems and controls and\npreventative measures against money laundering and terrorist financing on the\none hand, and protecting the rights of data subjects on the other is reflected in\nthe proposal.\n\u2013                        \nTransposition measures: Due to the complexity and scope of the proposal, Member States are\nrequired to transmit a correlation table of the provisions of their national\nlaw and the Directive.\nEuropean\nEconomic Area \nThe proposal is relevant for the EEA\ncountries. \n2013/0025 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the prevention of the use of the\nfinancial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[22],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Central Bank[23],\nAfter consulting the European Data\nProtection Supervisor[24],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Massive flows of dirty\nmoney can damage the stability and reputation\nof the financial sector and threaten the single market, and terrorism\nshakes the very foundations of our society. In addition to the criminal law approach, a preventive effort via the financial system\ncan produce results. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The soundness, integrity and stability of credit and financial institutions\nand confidence in the financial system as a whole could be seriously jeopardised by the efforts of criminals and their associates\neither to disguise the origin of criminal proceeds or to channel lawful or unlawful money for terrorist purposes. In\norder to facilitate their criminal activities, money launderers and terrorist financers could try to take\nadvantage of the freedom of capital movements and the freedom to supply\nfinancial services which the integrated\nfinancial area entails, if certain coordinating\nmeasures are not adopted at Union level. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current proposal is\nthe fourth Directive to deal with the threat of money laundering. Council Directive\n91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for\nthe purpose of money laundering[25]\ndefined money laundering in terms of drugs offences and imposed obligations\nsolely on the financial sector. Directive 2001/97/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of December 2001 amending Council Directive 91/308/EEC[26] extended the scope both in\nterms of the crimes covered and the range of professions and activities\ncovered. In June 2003 the Financial Action\nTask Force (hereinafter referred to as the FATF) revised its\nRecommendations to cover terrorist financing, and provided more detailed\nrequirements in relation to customer identification and verification, the\nsituations where a higher risk of money laundering may justify enhanced\nmeasures and also situations where a reduced risk may justify less rigorous\ncontrols. These changes were reflected in Directive 2005/60/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the\nprevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money\nlaundering and terrorist financing[27] and Commission\nDirective 2006/70/EC of 1 August 2006 laying down implementing measures for\nDirective 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards\nthe definition of politically exposed person and the technical criteria for\nsimplified customer due diligence procedures and for exemption on grounds of a\nfinancial activity conducted on an occasional or very limited basis[28].\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Money laundering and\nterrorist financing are frequently carried out in an international context.\nMeasures adopted solely at national or even European\nUnion level, without taking account of international coordination and\ncooperation, would have very limited effects. The measures adopted by the European Union in this field should\ntherefore be consistent with other action undertaken\nin other international fora. The European\nUnion action should continue\nto take particular account of the Recommendations\nof the FATF, which constitutes the foremost international body active in\nthe fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. With the view to\nreinforce the efficacy of the fight against money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing, Directives 2005/60/EC and 2006/70/EC should be aligned with the new FATF\nRecommendations adopted and expanded in February 2012.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the misuse of\nthe financial system to channel criminal or even clean money to terrorist\npurposes poses a clear risk to the integrity, proper functioning, reputation\nand stability of the financial system. Accordingly, the preventive measures of\nthis Directive should cover not only the manipulation of money derived from\ncrime but also the collection of money or property for terrorist purposes.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of large cash\npayments is vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing. In order to\nincrease vigilance and mitigate the risks posed by cash payments natural or\nlegal persons trading in goods should be covered by this Directive to the\nextent that they make or receive cash payments of EUR 7 500 or more. Member\nStates may decide to adopt stricter provisions including a lower threshold.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal professionals, as\ndefined by the Member States, should be subject to the provisions of this\nDirective when participating in financial or corporate transactions, including\nproviding tax advice, where there is the greatest risk of the services of those\nlegal professionals being misused for the purpose of laundering the proceeds of\ncriminal activity or for the purpose of terrorist financing. There should,\nhowever, be exemptions from any obligation to report information obtained\neither before, during or after judicial proceedings, or in the course of\nascertaining the legal position of a client. Thus, legal advice should remain\nsubject to the obligation of professional secrecy unless the legal counsellor\nis taking part in money laundering or terrorist financing, the legal advice is\nprovided for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes or the lawyer\nknows that the client is seeking legal advice for money laundering or terrorist\nfinancing purposes.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directly comparable\nservices should be treated in the same manner when provided by any of the\nprofessionals covered by this Directive. In order to ensure the respect of the\nrights guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\nin the case of auditors, external accountants and tax advisors, who, in some\nMember States, may defend or represent a client in the context of judicial\nproceedings or ascertain a client's legal position, the information they obtain\nin the performance of those tasks should not be subject to the reporting\nobligations in accordance with this Directive.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important to expressly\nhighlight that \"tax crimes\" related to direct and indirect taxes are\nincluded in the broad definition of \"criminal activity\" under this\nDirective in line with the revised FATF Recommendations. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is a need to identify\nany natural person who exercises ownership or control over a legal person. While\nfinding a percentage shareholding will not automatically result in finding the\nbeneficial owner, it is an evidential factor to be taken into account. Identification\nand verification of beneficial owners should, where relevant, extend to legal\nentities that own other legal entities, and should follow the chain of\nownership until the natural person who exercises ownership or control of the\nlegal person that is the customer is found.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The need for accurate and\nup-to-date information on the beneficial owner is a key factor in tracing\ncriminals who might otherwise hide their identity behind a corporate structure.\nMember States should therefore ensure that companies retain information on\ntheir beneficial ownership and make this information available to competent\nauthorities and obliged entities. In addition, trustees should declare their\nstatus to obliged entities.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should also\napply to those activities of the obliged entities covered by this Directive which\nare performed on the internet.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of the gambling\nsector to launder the proceeds of criminal activity is of concern. In order to\nmitigate the risks related to the sector and to provide parity amongst the\nproviders of gambling services, an obligation for all providers of gambling\nservices to conduct customer due diligence for single transactions of EUR 2 000\nor more should be laid down. Member States should consider applying this\nthreshold to the collection of winnings as well as wagering a stake. Providers\nof gambling services with physical premises (e.g. casinos and gaming houses)\nshould ensure that customer due diligence, if it is taken at the point of entry\nto the premises, can be linked to the transactions conducted by the customer on\nthose premises.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The risk of money\nlaundering and terrorist financing is not the same in every case. Accordingly,\na risk-based approach should be used. The risk-based approach is not an unduly\npermissive option for Member States and obliged entities. It involves the use\nof evidence-based decision making to better target the money laundering and\nterrorist financing risks facing the European Union and those operating within\nit.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Underpinning the risk-based\napproach is a need for Member States to identify, understand and mitigate the\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing risks it faces. The importance of a\nsupra-national approach to risk identification has been recognised at\ninternational level, and the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking\nAuthority) (hereinafter \u2018EBA\u2019), established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a\nEuropean Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), amending Decision\nNo 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/78/EC[29]; the European Supervisory\nAuthority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) (hereinafter\n\u2018EIOPA\u2019), established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European\nSupervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority),\namending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/79/EC[30]; and the European Supervisory\nAuthority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (hereinafter \u2018ESMA\u2019),\nestablished by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority\n(European Securities and Markets Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC\nand repealing Commission Decision 2009/77/EC[31],\nshould be tasked with issuing an opinion on the risks affecting the financial\nsector.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The results of risk\nassessments at Member State level should, where appropriate, be made available\nto obliged entities to enable them to identify, understand and mitigate their\nown risks.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to better\nunderstand and mitigate risks at European Union level, Member States should\nshare the results of their risk assessments with each other, the Commission and\nEBA, EIOPA and ESMA, where appropriate.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When applying the\nprovisions of this Directive, it is appropriate to take account of the\ncharacteristics and needs of small obliged entities which fall under its scope,\nand to ensure a treatment which is appropriate to the specific needs of small\nobliged entities, and the nature of the business.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk itself is variable in\nnature, and the variables, either on their own or in combination, may increase\nor decrease the potential risk posed, thus having an impact on the appropriate\nlevel of preventative measures, such as customer due diligence measures. Thus,\nthere are circumstances in which enhanced due diligence should be applied and\nothers in which simplified due diligence may be appropriate.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be recognised\nthat certain situations present a greater risk of money laundering or terrorist\nfinancing. Although the identity and business profile of all customers should\nbe established, there are cases where particularly rigorous customer\nidentification and verification procedures are required.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is particularly true\nof business relationships with individuals holding, or having held, important\npublic positions, particularly those from countries where corruption is\nwidespread. Such relationships may expose the financial sector in particular to\nsignificant reputational and legal risks. The international effort to combat\ncorruption also justifies the need to pay special attention to such cases and\nto apply appropriate enhanced customer due diligence measures in respect of\npersons who hold or have held prominent functions domestically or abroad and\nsenior figures in international organisations.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Obtaining approval from\nsenior management for establishing business relationships need not, in all\ncases, imply obtaining approval from the board of directors. Granting of such\napproval should be possible by someone with sufficient knowledge of the\ninstitution's money laundering and terrorist financing risk exposure and\nsufficient seniority to make decisions affecting its risk exposure.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid repeated\ncustomer identification procedures, leading to delays and inefficiency in\nbusiness, it is appropriate, subject to suitable safeguards, to allow customers\nwhose identification has been carried out elsewhere to be introduced to the\nobliged entities. Where an obliged entity relies on a third party, the ultimate\nresponsibility for the customer due diligence procedure remains with the obliged\nentity to whom the customer is introduced. The third party, or the person that\nhas introduced the customer, should also retain his own responsibility for compliance\nwith the requirements in this Directive, including the requirement to report\nsuspicious transactions and maintain records, to the extent that he has a\nrelationship with the customer that is covered by this Directive.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of agency or\noutsourcing relationships on a contractual basis between obliged entities and\nexternal natural or legal persons not covered by this Directive, any anti money\nlaundering and anti-terrorist financing obligations for those agents or\noutsourcing service providers as part of the obliged entities, may only arise\nfrom contract and not from this Directive. The responsibility for complying\nwith this Directive should remain with the obliged entity covered hereby. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All Member States have, or\nshould, set up financial intelligence units (hereinafter referred to as FIUs)\nto collect and analyse the information which they receive with the aim of\nestablishing links between suspicious transactions and underlying criminal activity\nin order to prevent and combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Suspicious\ntransactions should be reported to the FIUs, which should serve as a national\ncentre for receiving, analysing and disseminating to the competent authorities\nsuspicious transaction reports and other information regarding potential money\nlaundering or terrorist financing. This should not compel Member States to\nchange their existing reporting systems where the reporting is done through a\npublic prosecutor or other law enforcement authorities, as long as the\ninformation is forwarded promptly and unfiltered to FIUs, allowing them to perform\ntheir tasks properly, including international cooperation with other FIUs.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of derogation from\nthe general prohibition on executing suspicious transactions, obliged entities may\nexecute suspicious transactions before informing the competent authorities,\nwhere refraining from the execution thereof is impossible or likely to\nfrustrate efforts to pursue the beneficiaries of a suspected money laundering\nor terrorist financing operation. This, however, should be without prejudice to\nthe international obligations accepted by the Member States to freeze without\ndelay funds or other assets of terrorists, terrorist organisations or those who\nfinance terrorism, in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security\nCouncil resolutions.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should have\nthe possibility to designate an appropriate self-regulatory body of the\nprofessions referred to in Article 2(1)(3)(a),(b), and (d) as the authority to\nbe informed in the first instance in place of the FIU. In line with the case\nlaw of the European Court of Human Rights, a system of first instance reporting\nto a self-regulatory body constitutes an important safeguard to uphold the\nprotection of fundamental rights as concerns the reporting obligations\napplicable to lawyers.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a Member State\ndecides to make use of the exemptions provided for in Article 33(2), it may\nallow or require the self-regulatory body representing the persons referred to\ntherein not to transmit to the FIU any information obtained from those persons in\nthe circumstances referred to in that Article. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There have been a number of\ncases of employees who report their suspicions of money laundering being\nsubjected to threats or hostile action. Although this Directive cannot\ninterfere with Member States' judicial procedures, this is a crucial issue for\nthe effectiveness of the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing\nsystem. Member States should be aware of this problem and should do whatever\nthey can to protect employees from such threats or hostile action. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 95/46/EC of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of\nindividuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free\nmovement of such data[32],\nas implemented in national law, is applicable to the processing of personal\ndata for the purposes of this Directive. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain aspects of the\nimplementation of this Directive involve the collection, analysis, storage and\nsharing of data. The processing of personal data should be permitted in order\nto comply with the obligations laid down in this Directive, including carrying\nout of customer due diligence, ongoing monitoring, investigation and reporting\nof unusual and suspicious transactions, identification of the beneficial owner\nof a legal person or legal arrangement, sharing of information by competent\nauthorities and sharing of information by financial institutions. The personal\ndata collected should be limited to what is strictly necessary for the purpose\nof complying with the requirements of this Directive and not further processed\nin a way inconsistent with Directive 95/46/EC. In particular, further\nprocessing of personal data for commercial purposes should be strictly\nprohibited.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fight against\nmoney-laundering and terrorist financing is recognised as an important public\ninterest ground by all Member States.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive is without\nprejudice to the protection of personal data processed in the framework of\npolice and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, including the provisions\nof Framework decision 977/2008/JHA.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rights of access of the\ndata subject are applicable to the personal data processed for the purpose of\nthis Directive. However, access by the data subject to information contained in\na suspicious transaction report would seriously undermine the effectiveness of\nthe fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Limitations to this\nright in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 13 of Directive\n95/46/EC may therefore be justified.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Persons who merely convert\npaper documents into electronic data and are acting under a contract with a\ncredit institution or a financial institution do not fall within the scope of\nthis Directive, nor does any natural or legal person that provides credit or\nfinancial institutions solely with a message or other support systems for\ntransmitting funds or with clearing and settlement systems.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Money laundering and\nterrorist financing are international problems and the effort to combat them\nshould be global. Where Union credit and financial institutions have branches\nand subsidiaries located in third countries where the legislation in this area\nis deficient, they should, in order to avoid the application of very different\nstandards within the institution or group of institutions, apply Union\nstandards or notify the competent authorities of the home Member State if\napplication of such standards is impossible. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Feedback should, where\npracticable, be made available to obliged entities on the usefulness and\nfollow-up of the suspicious transactions reports they present. To make this\npossible, and to be able to review the effectiveness of their systems to combat\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing Member States should keep and improve\nthe relevant statistics. To further enhance the quality and consistency of the\nstatistical data collected at Union level, the Commission should keep track of\nthe EU-wide situation with respect to the fight against money laundering and\nterrorist financing and publish regular overviews.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competent authorities\nshould ensure that, in regard to currency exchange offices, trust and company\nservice providers or gambling service providers, the persons who effectively\ndirect the business of such entities and the beneficial owners of such entities\nare fit and proper persons. The criteria for determining whether or not a\nperson is fit and proper should, as a minimum, reflect the need to protect such\nentities from being misused by their managers or beneficial owners for criminal\npurposes.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\ntransnational character of money laundering and terrorist financing,\nco-ordination and co-operation between EU FIUs are extremely important. This\nco-operation has so far only been addressed by Council Decision 2000/642/JHA of\n17 October 2000 concerning arrangements for cooperation between financial\nintelligence units of the Member States in respect of exchanging information[33]. In order to ensure better\nco-ordination and cooperation between FUIs, and in particular to ensure that\nsuspicious transactions reports reach the FIU of the Member State where the\nreport would be of most use, more detailed, further going and up-dated rules should\nbe included in this Directive.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Improving the exchange of\ninformation between FIUs within the EU is of particular importance to face the\ntransnational character of money laundering and terrorist financing. The use of\nsecure facilities for the exchange of information, especially the decentralised\ncomputer network FIU.net and the techniques offered by that network should be\nencouraged by Member States.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The importance of combating\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing should lead Member States to lay down\neffective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions in national law for failure\nto respect the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Member\nStates currently have a diverse range of administrative measures and sanctions for\nbreaches of the key preventative measures. This diversity could be detrimental\nto the efforts put in combating money laundering and terrorist financing and\nthe Union's response is at risk of being fragmented. This Directive should\ntherefore include a range of administrative measures and sanctions that Member\nStates shall have available for systematic breaches of the requirements\nrelating to customer due diligence measures, record keeping, reporting of suspicious\ntransactions and internal controls of obliged entities. This range should be\nsufficiently broad to allow Member States and competent authorities to take\naccount of the differences between obliged entities, in particular between\nfinancial institutions and other obliged entities, as regards their size, characteristics\nand areas of activity. In the application of this Directive, Member States\nshould ensure that the imposition of administrative measures and sanctions in\naccordance with this Directive and of criminal sanctions in accordance with\nnational law does not breach the principle of ne bis in idem.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technical standards in\nfinancial services should ensure consistent harmonisation and adequate\nprotection of depositors, investors and consumers across the Union. As bodies\nwith highly specialised expertise, it would be efficient and appropriate to\nentrust EBA, EIOPA and ESMA with the elaboration of draft regulatory technical\nstandards which do not involve policy choices, for submission to the\nCommission. \n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should adopt\nthe draft regulatory technical standards developed by EBA, EIOPA and ESMA pursuant\nto Article 42 of this Directive by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article\n290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and in accordance\nwith Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, Regulation (EU) No\n1094/2010 and Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. \n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the very\nsubstantial amendments that would need to be made to Directive 2005/60/EC and\nDirective 2006/70/EC, they should be merged and replaced for reasons of clarity\nand consistency.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\nDirective, namely the protection\nof the financial system by means of prevention, investigation and detection of money\nlaundering and terrorist financing, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the\nMember States, as individual measures adopted by Member States to protect their\nfinancial systems could be inconsistent with the functioning of the internal\nmarket and with the prescriptions of the rule of law and Union public policy\nand can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better\nachieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the\nprinciple of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that\nArticle, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\nachieve that objective.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects the\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of\nFundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular, the respect for\nprivate and family life, the right to protection of personal data, the freedom\nto conduct a business, the prohibition of discrimination, the right to an\neffective remedy and to a fair trial, and the right of defence.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with Article 21 of\nthe EU Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibiting any discrimination based on\nany ground, Member States have to ensure that this Directive is implemented, as\nregards risk assessments in the context of customer due diligence, without\ndiscrimination.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nJoint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September\n2011 on explanatory documents, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in\njustified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or\nmore documents explaining the relationship between the components of a\ndirective and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.\nWith regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of\nsuch documents to be justified,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nSection 1\nscope and definitions\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States shall ensure\nthat money laundering and terrorist financing are prohibited.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of this\nDirective, the following conduct, when committed intentionally, shall be\nregarded as money laundering:\n(a)         \nthe conversion or transfer of property, knowing\nthat such property is derived from criminal activity or from an act of\nparticipation in such activity, for the purpose of concealing or disguising the\nillicit origin of the property or of assisting any person who is involved in\nthe commission of such activity to evade the legal consequences of his action;\n(b)         \nthe concealment or disguise of the true nature,\nsource, location, disposition, movement, rights with respect to, or ownership\nof property, knowing that such property is derived from criminal activity or\nfrom an act of participation in such activity;\n(c)         \nthe acquisition, possession or use of property,\nknowing, at the time of receipt, that such property was derived from criminal\nactivity or from an act of participation in such activity;\n(d)         \nparticipation in, association to commit,\nattempts to commit and aiding, abetting, facilitating and counselling the\ncommission of any of the actions referred to in points (a), (b) and (c).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Money laundering shall be\nregarded as such even where the activities which generated the property to be\nlaundered were carried out in the territory of another Member State or in that of a third country.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of this\nDirective, \u2018terrorist financing\u2019 means the provision or collection of funds, by\nany means,
