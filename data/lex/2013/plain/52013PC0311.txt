These\nobjects are generally classified in terms of their cultural importance and\ncovered by more or less stringent protection rules. Of these cultural objects,\nnational treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value\n(\u201cnational treasures\u201d) under national legislation or administrative procedures\nwithin the meaning of Article 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union (TFEU), are objects of major interest that should be preserved\nfor future generations. As a general rule, national treasures receive better\nlegal protection preventing their permanent removal from the Member State\u2019s\nterritory.\nThe internal market is an area without\ninternal frontiers in which the free movement of goods is ensured in accordance\nwith the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThese provisions do not preclude prohibitions or restrictions justified on\ngrounds of the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic\nor archaeological value within the meaning of Article 36 TFEU.\nCouncil Directive 93/7/EEC on the return of\ncultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State[1] was adopted in 1993, when the\ninternal frontiers were abolished, in order to protect the Member States\u2019\ncultural objects that are classified as national treasures. This Directive\nseeks to reconcile the fundamental principle of free movement of goods with the\nneed for effective protection of national treasures. \nThe assessments of the Directive[2] have shown that its\neffectiveness in securing the return of cultural objects classified as national\ntreasures which have been unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member\nState and are located on the territory of another Member State is limited. The main\nreasons for this were identified as being:\n\u00b7              \nthe conditions making objects classified as\nnational treasures eligible for return, in other words whether they belong to\none of the categories referred to in the Annex and meet the financial and age\nthresholds;\n\u00b7              \nthe short time available for bringing return\nproceedings;\n\u00b7              \nthe cost of compensation. \nThe assessment reports also highlighted the\nneed for improved administrative cooperation and consultation between the\ncentral authorities in order to enable them to better implement the Directive.\nUnder the system set up by the Directive,\ncertain Member States would have to use the mechanisms provided for by\ninternational agreements in order to secure the return of their cultural\nobjects. UNESCO\u2019s Convention of 1970 on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing\nthe Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property and\nthe UNIDROIT Convention of 1995 on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural\nObjects have not been ratified by all Member States[3].\nDespite the variety of instruments\navailable, trafficking in cultural objects has become one of the most\nwidespread forms of illegal trade. Trafficking in cultural objects classified\nas national treasures is a particularly serious form of this crime which\nadversely affects the national identity, culture and history of the Member\nStates, since the disappearance of national treasures deprives a State\u2019s\ncitizens of a mark of their identity and history. \nIn response to this problem and its major\nimpact on the Member States, the Council of the European Union concluded on 13\nand 14 December 2011 that measures needed to be taken to make preventing\nand combating crime against cultural objects more effective. It therefore\nrecommended that the Commission, amongst other bodies, support the Member\nStates in the effective protection of cultural objects with a view to\npreventing and combating trafficking and promoting complementary measures where\nappropriate[4].\nThe aim of this proposal is to enable\nMember States to secure the return of any cultural object which is classified\nas a national treasure and has been unlawfully removed from their territory\nsince 1993. \nThe overall objective is to contribute to\nthe protection of cultural objects in the context of the internal market. \nConsistency with other policies and\nobjectives of the Union\nThis initiative is consistent with the\nUnion's policy on the protection of cultural objects. It is also in line with\nthe above-mentioned conclusions of the Council of the European Union on\npreventing and combating crime against cultural goods.\nThe proposal for a Directive relates to the\nreturn of cultural objects by means of arrangements enabling Member States to\nprotect their cultural objects which are classified as national treasures. \nAs far as the recovery of a cultural object\nby its owner is concerned, Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012[5] on jurisdiction and the\nrecognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters\nprovides for the creation of a forum for civil recovery proceedings based on\nownership at the courts of the place where the object is located. This new\nprovision would also cover civil proceedings brought for the recovery of\ncultural objects. \nBoth initiatives are aimed at protecting\ncultural objects, one enabling national authorities to request the return of a\ncultural object which is classified as a national treasure and has been removed\nunlawfully from the territory, and the other giving the owner the right to seek\nrecovery of a cultural object before the courts of the Member State where the\nobject is located.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Results of consultations with interested\nparties and impact assessment\n\u00b7                        \nConsultation of interested parties \nA public consultation, addressed to all the\nparties concerned by this initiative, was held from 30 November 2011 to\n5 March 2012. The consultation was carried out via the interactive\npolicy-making system (\u201cYour Voice in Europe\u201d) in the form of two\nspecific questionnaires, one for public authorities and bodies and the other\nfor citizens and economic operators concerned by the issue or working in the\narea of cultural objects.\nThe Commission received 142 replies, 24 of\nwhich were from public bodies and 118 from the private sector. A summary of the\nresults of this public consultation is available on the Europa website[6]. \nMost (61%) of those from the private sector\ntaking part in the consultation felt that Directive 93/7/EEC met the needs of\nthe Member States and that there was no need to revise it. Only 22% were in\nfavour of revision.\nHowever, 54% of the representatives of\npublic authorities and bodies took the view that the Directive did not\nguarantee the return of national treasures unlawfully removed from the\nterritory of a Member State. The solutions proposed for improving the\nDirective\u2019s effectiveness received fairly even support, with 29% in favour of\nrevision of the Directive, 29% in favour of improved administrative cooperation\nand information exchange between the competent authorities, 17% in favour of\npromoting ratification by the Member States of the international agreements\n(UNESCO and UNIDROIT) and 25% in favour of an approach combining several\nsolutions, such as revision of the Directive together with improved\nadministrative cooperation and consultation between the competent authorities. \n\u00b7                        \nAcquisition and use of expertise\nThe Commission has regularly drawn up\nreports reviewing Directive 93/7/EEC on the basis of national reports on its\napplication. These evaluation reports covering the period 1993 to 2011 are\naddressed to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and\nSocial Committee[7].\n\nThe Commission also carried out an ex\npost evaluation of the Directive by setting up a group of national experts\nrepresenting the central authorities which carry out the tasks set out in the\nDirective. The role of the Return of Cultural Goods expert group, established\nwithin the Committee on the Export and Return of Cultural Goods, was to\nidentify problems in applying the Directive and find possible solutions. The\ngroup carried out its work between 2009 and 2011. \nThe group concluded that the Directive\nshould be revised to make it a more effective instrument for the return of\nnational treasures and that mechanisms should be put in place to improve\nadministrative cooperation and consultation between the central authorities[8]. \n\u00b7                        \nImpact assessment\nThis proposal is accompanied by an\nexecutive summary of the impact assessment and an impact assessment, a draft\nversion of which was assessed by the Impact Assessment Board of the European\nCommission, which issued its opinion on 21 September 2012. The final\nversion of the impact assessment was amended to take the Board\u2019s\nrecommendations into account.\nThe impact assessment took particular\naccount of the reports reviewing the application of the Directive, the\ndocumentation obtained from the work of the Return of Cultural Goods expert\ngroup, the work of the OMC (Open Method of Coordination) expert group on the\nmobility of collections under the Work Plan for Culture 2007-2010[9], the results of the public\nconsultation on the matter, and also studies looking into cultural goods\ncarried out in 2004, 2007 and 2011[10].\n\nBased on the information collected, the\nCommission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared the\nfollowing options[11]:\nOption 1: no change to the current\nsituation \nNo amendment is made to Directive 93/7/EEC\nas amended by Directives 96/100/EC and 2001/38/EC.\nOption 2: promoting the use of common\ntools by the central authorities\nThe central authorities are provided with\nan electronic tool (the Internal Market Information System or \"IMI\")\nto facilitate administrative cooperation, consultation and the exchange of information\nbetween these authorities. \nOption 3: revision of Directive 93/7/EEC\n\nDirective 93/7/EEC is revised to: (i)\nextend its scope to include all objects classified as national treasures, (ii)\nextend the time-limits for bringing return proceedings and for checking the\ncultural object, and (iii) align the conditions for compensating the possessor.\n\nOption 4: encouraging ratification and\napplication by the Member States of the UNESCO Convention of 1970 on cultural\nproperty\nDirective 93/7/EEC remains unamended and\naction is focused on ratification and application by the Member States of the\n1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit\nImport, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.\nThe preferred approach is a combination of\noptions 2 and 3, aimed in particular at:\n- prescribing the use of the IMI administrative\ncooperation system between the central authorities;\n- extending the scope of the Directive to\ninclude all cultural objects classified as national treasures within the\nmeaning of Article 36 of the Treaty;\n- extending the time available for bringing\nreturn proceedings;\n- extending the time allowed for checking\nthe cultural object;\n- aligning the conditions for compensating\nthe possessor in cases of return.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal aspects of the proposal\n\u00b7                        \nSummary of the proposed action \nThe aim of recasting Directive 93/7/EEC, as\namended by Directives 96/100/EC and 2001/38/EC, is to enable Member States to\nsecure the return of any cultural object which is classified as a national\ntreasure. The recast is also intended to simplify Union legislation in this\narea.\nThe changes made to the provisions of\nDirective 93/7/EEC concern: (i) extending its scope to cover all cultural\nobjects classified as national treasures within the meaning of Article 36 of\nthe Treaty, (ii) prescribing the use of the IMI system for administrative\ncooperation and information exchanges between the central authorities, (iii)\nextending the time given to the authorities of the requesting Member State to\ncheck the nature of the cultural object found in another Member State, (iv)\nextending the time-limit for bringing return proceedings, (v) indicating which\nauthority of the requesting Member State starts the period for bringing return\nproceedings, (vi) stipulating that the possessor has the burden of proof that\ndue care and attention was taken when the cultural object was acquired, (vii)\nindicating the common criteria for interpreting the concept of due care and\nattention and (viii) extending the time-limit for the reports assessing and\nreviewing the application of the Directive.\n\u00b7                        \nLegal basis\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the\nTreaty (TFEU).\n\u00b7                        \nSubsidiarity principle \nThe internal market is a competence that is\nshared between the Union and the Member States. Therefore the principle of\nsubsidiarity applies.\nDirective 93/7/EEC was adopted when the\ninternal market was created, since any action taken in isolation by Member\nStates towards the return of objects might be thwarted by differences between\nnational laws. \nEstablishing rules on the return of objects\ncontributes towards the smoother functioning of the internal market. It would\nbe very difficult for a Member State to secure the return of a cultural object\nclassified as a national treasure that has been unlawfully removed without a\ncommon procedure that is also available in the Member State where the object is\nlocated. A possessor who knows that the object has been unlawfully removed\ncould therefore establish himself in a Member State without having to fear the\nloss of that object.\nThe cross-border dimension of the unlawful\nremoval of cultural objects makes the Union better suited to act on these matters\nand enable the return of objects that have been unlawfully removed and are\nlocated in the territory of a Member State. Therefore, the objective of the\nproposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and requires action\nat EU level.\nHowever, the Union is not competent for\ndetermining what is a national treasure or which national courts have\ncompetence for hearing the return proceedings brought by the requesting Member\nState against the possessor and/or holder of a cultural object that is classified\nas being a national treasure and has been unlawfully removed from the territory\nof the Member State. These matters are covered by subsidiarity, as they fall\nwithin the competence of the Member States.\n\u00b7                        \nProportionality principle\nIn accordance with the principle of\nproportionality, the proposed modifications do not go beyond what is necessary\nto achieve the objectives set.\nThe scale of the proposed measure is\nconnected with the major factors limiting the effectiveness of Directive\n93/7/EEC with regard to securing the return of certain objects classified as\nnational treasures. This proposal is proportionate to the objective of ensuring\nthe return of all cultural objects that are classified as national treasures\nand have been unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State since\n1993 and does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose. \nIn order to improve its application, this\nproposal stipulates that administrative cooperation and information exchange\nbetween the central authorities is to be carried out using the IMI system; it\nalso indicates which national authority of the requesting Member State starts\nthe period for bringing return proceedings, stipulates that the possessor has\nthe burden of proof that due care and attention was exercised, and sets out\ncertain common criteria for interpreting the concept of due care and attention\nso that it is easier for national judges to arrive at a more uniform\ninterpretation of this concept for the purposes of compensating the possessor.\nThese criteria are not exhaustive.\nHowever, there is no need for action with\nregard to other aspects, such as enabling an individual to bring return\nproceedings to retrieve an object considered a national treasure which belongs\nto him, extending the time-limit for bringing return proceedings from thirty to\nfifty years, or limiting the maximum amount of compensation to the possessor.\nThe proposal will not add to the\nadministrative burden of the administrations; it should, in fact, reduce it.\n\u00b7                        \nLegislative technique\nOn 1 April 1987, the Commission\ndecided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more\nthan ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that\ndepartments should endeavour to codify the texts for which they are responsible\nat even shorter intervals in order to ensure that their provisions are clear\nand readily understandable.\nCodification of Council Directive 93/7/EEC\nof 15 March 1993 on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from\nthe territory of a Member State[12]\nwas initiated by the Commission, and a relevant proposal was submitted to the\nlegislative authority[13].\nThe new Directive was to have superseded the various acts incorporated in it[14].\nIn the course of the legislative procedure,\nit was acknowledged that Article 16(4) of Directive 93/7/EEC, which\ncorresponded to Article 16(3) of the proposed codified text, established a\nsecondary legal basis. In the light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of\n6 May 2008 in Case C-133/06, it was considered necessary to delete Article\n16(3) of the proposed codified text. Since such a deletion would have involved\na substantive change going beyond straightforward codification, it was\nconsidered necessary that point 8[15]\nof the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 \u2013 Accelerated\nworking method for official codification of legislative texts \u2013 be applied, in\nthe light of the joint declaration on that point[16].\nThe Commission therefore considered it\nappropriate to withdraw the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament\nand of the Council codifying Directive 93/7/EEC[17] and to transform the\ncodification of the Directive into a recast in order to incorporate the\nnecessary amendment.\nAs explained above, the objective of\nenabling Member States to secure the return of cultural objects which are\nclassified as national treasures requires a certain number of substantial\nchanges to be made to Directive 93/7/EEC. It has therefore been decided to\napply the recasting technique in accordance with the Interinstitutional\nAgreement of 28 November 2001 on a more structured use of the recasting\ntechnique for legal acts[18].\nThis proposal is for a recast of Directive\n93/7/EEC, as amended by Directives 96/100/EC and 2001/38/EC. It provides for\nsimplification of the legislation in force and will lead to the repeal of\nDirectives 93/7/EEC, 96/100/EC and 2001/38/EC.\n\u00b7                        \nDetailed explanation of the proposal\nArticle 1(1)\ndefines a \u2018cultural object\u2019 as an object which is classified, before or after\nits unlawful removal from the territory of a Member State, among the \u2018national\ntreasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value\u2019 under national\nlegislation or administrative procedures within the meaning of Article 36 of\nthe Treaty. The Annex to Directive 93/7/EEC is deleted.\nFor the purposes of the return of an\nobject, this Directive removes the requirements that objects classified as\nnational treasures should:\n\u00b7              \nbelong to one of the common categories referred\nto in the Annex and to respect, where necessary, the age and/or financial\nthresholds set for those categories, or, \n\u00b7              \nwhere the objects do not belong to one of those\ncategories, form an integral part of public collections listed in the\ninventories of museums, archives or libraries' conservation collections or the\ninventories of ecclesiastical institutions.\nEach Member State must define their\nnational treasures within the meaning and the limits of Article 36 of the\nTreaty. The Annex to Directive 93/7/EEC is not intended to define objects which\nrank as national treasures within the meaning of that article, but merely\ncategories of object which may be classified as such and may be eligible for\nreturn proceedings.\nThis proposal seeks to reconcile the\nfundamental principle of the free movement of cultural objects with the need\nfor effective protection of national treasures. It confirms\nthe intention of the legislature of 1993 to make Directive 93/7/EEC a first\nstep in establishing cooperation between Member States in this field in the\ncontext of the internal market, and that its aim was mutual recognition of the\nrelevant national laws.\nThis proposal meets the repeated demand\nmade by representatives of the Member States for effective arrangements for the\nreturn of cultural objects classified as national treasures. It allows Member\nStates to secure the return of cultural objects which are classified as\nnational treasures and have been unlawfully removed from their territory since\n1993, and thus provides better protection for the Member States\u2019 cultural\nheritage.\nHowever, the possessor would be able to\nsubmit evidence in the return proceedings to argue that the requesting State\ninfringed Article 36 of the Treaty when it classified the object as a national\ntreasure. The court in question will then have to make a ruling, where\nnecessary after sending a referral for a preliminary ruling to the Court of\nJustice of the European Union.\nArticles 4 and 6 provide for the use by the central authorities of the Internal\nMarket Information System (\"IMI\") in order to facilitate\nadministrative cooperation, consultation and the exchange of information\nbetween them.\nArticle 4(3)\nextends the time-limit allowed to the competent authority of the requesting\nMember State to check that the object discovered in another Member State is a\ncultural object to five months after the notification that the object has been\ndiscovered.\nIn view of the cross-border aspect of this\nissue, extending this time-limit will contribute to more effective\nadministrative cooperation between the competent authorities.\nArticle 7(1)\nstipulates that the return proceedings may not be brought more than three years\nafter the central authority of the requesting Member State became aware\nof the location of the cultural object and of the identity of its possessor or\nholder.\nThe extension of this period takes account\nof the complexity of cross-border relations and also the obligation of due care\nand attention incumbent on the requesting State. \nArticle 9\ncontains common criteria for interpreting the concept of the due care\nand attention exercised by the possessor in acquiring the object. These\ncriteria are based on those set out in Articles 4(4) and 6(2) of the UNIDROIT\nConvention of 1995.\nUnder this proposal, the burden of proof\nof due care and attention in acquiring the object will lie with the possessor.\nThe person acquiring the object will be entitled to compensation provided that\nhe can prove that he exercised due care and attention in acquiring the object\nwith respect to whether the cultural object was lawfully removed from the\nterritory of the requesting Member State. \nThese changes should enable the Directive\nto be applied more uniformly and, where necessary, make it more difficult for\npossessors acting in bad faith or not exercising due care and attention to\nobtain compensation.\nArticle 16\nlays down the evaluation and monitoring arrangements allowing the other\ninstitutions of the Union to gain an insight into the actual implementation of\nthe Directive. The reports reviewing the application of the Directive will be\ndrawn up every five years.

The aim is mutual recognition of the\nrelevant national laws. whereas provision should therefore be made, in particular, for the\nCommission to be assisted by an advisory committee.\n\u00ea 93/7/EEC\nRecital 7 (adapted)\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whereas Regulation (EEC) No\n3911/92\n116/2009 introduces, together with\nthis Directive, a Community\n\u00d6 Union \u00d5 system to\nprotect Member States\u2019 cultural goods. whereas the date by which Member States have to\ncomply with this Directive has to be as close as possible to the date of\nentry into force of that Regulation; whereas, having regard to the nature of\ntheir legal systems and the scope of the changes to their legislation necessary\nto implement this Directive, some Member\nStates will need a longer period,\n\u00f2 new\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Application\nof Directive 93/7/EEC has shown the limitations of the arrangements for\nsecuring the return of objects classified as national treasures which have been\nunlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State and discovered in the\nterritory of another Member State.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nMember States should have arrangements at their disposal to ensure that the\nunlawful removal of a cultural object classified as a national treasure to\nanother Member State does not present the same risk as its illegal export\noutside the Union.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nscope of this Directive must extend to any cultural object classified as a national\ntreasure possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value under national\nlegislation or administrative procedures within the meaning of Article 36 of\nthe Treaty. The criterion of falling under one of the categories referred to in\nthe Annex to Directive 93/7/EEC should therefore be removed and thus the Annex\nitself should be deleted and the criterion of forming an integral part of public\ncollections listed in the inventories of museums, archives and libraries'\nconservation collections or the inventories of ecclesiastical institutions\nshould also be removed. The diversity of national arrangements for protecting\ncultural objects is recognised in Article 36 of the Treaty. In this context,\nmutual trust, a willingness to cooperate and mutual understanding between\nMember States are therefore essential.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Administrative\ncooperation between the Member States needs to be stepped up so that this\nDirective can be applied more effectively and uniformly. The central\nauthorities should therefore be required to use the Internal Market Information\nSystem (\u201cIMI\u201d) provided for by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on administrative\ncooperation through the Internal Market Information System and repealing\nCommission Decision 2008/49/EC[24].\nIt would also be desirable for other competent authorities of the Member States\nto use the same system where possible.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to ensure the protection of personal data, administrative cooperation and\nthe exchange of information between the competent authorities should comply\nwith the rules set out in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with\nregard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[25] and, insofar as the Internal\nMarket Information System is used, in Regulation(EU) No 1024/2012.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ntime given to the competent authorities of the requesting Member State to check\nwhether the cultural object found in another Member State is a cultural object\nwithin the meaning of this Directive should be extended. A longer period should\nallow appropriate measures to be taken in order to keep the object and, where\nnecessary, prevent any action to evade the return procedure.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ntime-limit for bringing return proceedings should be set at three years after\nthe requesting Member State became aware of the location of the cultural object\nand of the identity of its possessor or holder. In the interests of clarity, it\nshould be stipulated that the time-limit for bringing proceedings begins on the\ndate on which the information came to the knowledge of the central authority of\nthe requesting Member State.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCouncil of the European Union has recognised the need for measures to be taken\nin order to make preventing and combating crime against cultural objects more\neffective. It therefore recommended that the Commission support the Member\nStates in the effective protection of cultural objects with a view to\npreventing and combating trafficking and promoting complementary measures where\nappropriate[26].\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis desirable to ensure that all those involved in the market in cultural\nobjects exercise due care and attention in transactions involving cultural\nobjects. The consequences of acquiring a cultural object of unlawful origin\nwill be genuinely dissuasive only if the obligation to return is coupled with\nan obligation on the possessor to prove the exercise of due care and attention\nin order to obtain compensation. In order, therefore, to achieve the Union\u2019s\nobjectives in preventing and combating unlawful traffic in cultural objects, it\nmust be stipulated that the possessor must provide proof that he exercised due\ncare and attention in acquiring the object in order to obtain compensation, and\nthat the possessor may not claim to have acted in good faith if he failed to\nexercise the level of due care and attention required by the circumstances.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to enable Member States to arrive at a uniform interpretation of the\nconcept of due care and attention, the circumstances should be set out which\nare to be taken into account to determine whether due care and attention have\nbeen exercised.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\naim of this Directive, that of enabling the return of any cultural object\nclassified as a national treasure which has been unlawfully removed from the\nterritory of a Member State, cannot be adequately achieved by the Member States\nand can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at\nUnion level. The Union may therefore adopt measures in accordance with the\nprinciple of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that\nArticle, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\nachieve that objective.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\nthe tasks of the committee set up by Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 116/2009\nare rendered obsolete by the deletion of the Annex to Directive 93/7/EEC,\nreferences to that committee should be deleted.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\nthe Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 contains a list of provisions on\nadministrative cooperation in Union acts which are implemented by means of the\nIMI, the Annex should be amended to include this Directive.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nobligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to\nthose provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with the\nearlier Directives. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are\nunchanged arises from Directive 93/7/EEC.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nDirective should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States\nrelating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the\nDirectives set out in Annex I, Part B,\n\u00ea 93/7/EEC\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Cultural object\u2019 shall mean an\nobject which: is classified, before or after its unlawful removal from the\nterritory of a Member State, among the \u2018national treasures possessing artistic,\nhistoric or archaeological value\u2019 under national legislation or administrative\nprocedures within the meaning of Article 36 of the Treaty.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and\n\u2013              \nbelongs to one of\nthe categories listed in the Annex or does not belong to one of these\ncategories but forms an integral part of:\n\u2013              \n- public\ncollections listed in the inventories of museums, archives or libraries'\nconservation collection.\n\u00ea 93/7/EEC\n(adapted)\nFor the purposes of this Directive, \u2018public\ncollections\u2019 shall mean collections which are the property of a Member State,\nlocal or regional authority within a Member States or an institution situated\nin the territory of a Member State and defined as public in accordance with\nthe legislation of that Member State, such institution being the property of,\nor significantly financed by, that Member State or a local or regional\nauthority;\n\u00ea 93/7/EEC\n\u2013              \n- the inventories\nof ecclesiastical institutions.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Unlawfully removed from the\nterritory of a Member State\u2019 shall mean:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 removed from the territory of a Member State in breach of its\nrules on the protection of national treasures or in breach of Regulation (EEC)\nNo 3911/92\n116/2009,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 or\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 not returned at the end of a period of lawful temporary removal\nor any breach of another condition governing such temporary removal.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Requesting Member State\u2019 shall\nmean the Member State from whose territory the cultural object has been unlawfully\nremoved.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Requested Member State\u2019 shall\nmean the Member State in whose territory a cultural object unlawfully removed\nfrom the territory of another Member State is located.\n5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Return\u2019 shall mean the physical\nreturn of the cultural object to the territory of the requesting Member State.\n6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Possessor\u2019 shall mean the person\nphysically holding the cultural object on his own account.\n7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Holder\u2019 shall mean the person\nphysically holding the cultural object for third parties.\n\u00ea 93/7/EEC\n(adapted)\n\u00d6 8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Public collections\u2019 shall mean\ncollections which are the property of a Member State, local or regional\nauthority within a Member State or an institution situated in the territory of\na Member State and defined as public in accordance with the legislation of that\nMember State, such institution being the property of, or significantly financed\nby, that Member State or a local or regional authority.\u00d5\n\u00ea 93/7/EEC\nArticle 2\nCultural objects which have been unlawfully\nremoved from the territory of a Member State shall be returned in accordance\nwith the procedure and in the circumstances provided for in this Directive.\nArticle 3\nEach Member State shall appoint one or more\ncentral authorities to carry out the tasks provided for in this Directive.\nMember States shall inform the Commission\nof all the central authorities they appoint pursuant to this Article.\n\u00ea 93/7/EEC\n(adapted)\nThe Commission shall publish a list of\nthese central authorities and any changes concerning them in the C series of\nthe Official Journal of the European Communities \u00d6 Union \u00d5.\n\u00ea 93/7/EEC\nArticle 4\nMember States' central authorities shall\ncooperate and promote consultation between the Member States' competent\nnational authorities.
