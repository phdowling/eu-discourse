Under Articles 10 and 118 of the Conditions of\nEmployment of Other Servants of the European Union, those provisions apply by\nanalogy to temporary and contract staff serving in third countries.\nRemuneration is payable in euros in\nBelgium, however upon request of an official all or part of it may be paid in\nthe currency of the country of employment. In that event, it is subject to the\nweighting for the place of employment and is converted on the basis of the\ncorresponding exchange rate. \nIn order to ensure as far as possible that\nofficials, temporary and contract staff of the Union enjoy equivalent\npurchasing power irrespective of their place of employment, the Council should adjust\nthe weightings once a year. To establish the purchasing power equivalence of\nthe remuneration paid in Brussels, as the reference city, with that paid in the\nother places of employment Eurostat calculates the economic parities. The\nweighting is the factor obtained by dividing the economic parity by the\nexchange rate. The exchange rates used are established in accordance with the\nrules for the implementation of the Financial Regulation and correspond to the\ndate of application of the weightings. \nThe initial weightings applicable from 10\nOctober 1987 were laid down in the Council Regulation (ECSC, EEC, Euratom) No\n2175/88 of 18 July 1988. The most recent weightings, which took effect on 1\nJuly 2010, were laid down by the Council in Regulation (EU) No 964/2011 of 26\nSeptember 2011. Considering the time elapsed since the last adjustment it is\nappropriate to cover two consecutive annual adjustments by the attached\nproposal. Hence it lays down the weightings applicable to remuneration from 1\nJuly 2011 to 30 June 2012 and weightings applicable to remuneration from 1 July\n2012.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe elements of the proposal have been\ndiscussed with the staff representatives in accordance with the appropriate\nprocedures.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe attached proposal for the Council\nRegulation adjusts the weightings applicable from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 and\nfrom 1 July 2012 to the remuneration of officials, temporary staff and contract\nstaff of the European Union serving in a third country.\nThe Council should, by the written\nprocedure within one month, act on a proposal from the Commission by the\nqualified majority provided for in Article 16(4) and (5) of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union. Should a Member State request formal examination of the\nCommission proposal, the Council should act within two months.\nThe Annex to the proposed Council Regulation\nsets out the weightings derived from the parities communicated by Eurostat for\nJuly 2011 and for July 2012 respectively, for all places of employment outside\nthe European Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe budgetary impact is small (in\npercentage terms); see the Financial Statement.\n2013/0131 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nlaying down the weightings applicable from\n1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 and the weightings applicable from 1 July 2012 to\nthe remuneration of officials, temporary staff and contract staff of the\nEuropean Union serving in third countries\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 336 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Staff Regulations of\nOfficials and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European\nUnion, as laid down by Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68[1], and in particular the first\nparagraph of Article 13 of Annex X thereto,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis necessary to take account of changes in the cost of living in third countries and to determine\naccordingly the weightings applicable from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 and from\nof 1 July 2012 to remuneration paid in the currency of the country of\nemployment to officials, temporary staff and contract staff of the Union\nserving in third countries,\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nweightings in respect of which payment has been made on the basis of Council\nRegulation (EC) No 964/2011[2]\nmay lead to retrospective upward or downward adjustments to remuneration,\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision\nshould be laid down for back-payments in the event of an increase in\nremuneration as a result of the new weightings,\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision\nshould be laid down for the recovery of sums overpaid in the event of a\nreduction in remuneration as a result of the new weightings for the period\nbetween 1 July 2011 and the date of entry into force of this Regulation,\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision\nshould be laid down for any such recovery to be restricted to a period of no\nmore than six months preceding the date of entry into force of this Regulation,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nWith effect from 1 July 2011 to 30 june\n2012, the weightings applicable to the remuneration of officials, temporary\nstaff and contract staff of the Union serving in third countries payable in the\ncurrency of the country of employment shall be as shown in Table 1 of the\nAnnex.\nWith effect from 1 July 2012, the\nweightings applicable to the remuneration of officials, temporary staff and\ncontract staff of the Union serving in third countries payable in the currency\nof the country of employment shall be as shown in Table 2 of the Annex .\nThe exchange rates for the calculation of\nsuch remuneration shall be established in accordance with Regulation (EU,\nEuratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\nOctober 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the\nUnion and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002[3] and shall correspond to 1 July 2011 and 1 July 2012 respectively.\nArticle 2\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The institutions shall\nmake back-payments in the event of an increase in remuneration as a result of\nthe weightings shown in the Tables 1 and 2 of the Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The institutions shall\nmake retrospective downward adjustments to remuneration in the event of a\nreduction in renumeration as a result of the weightings shown in the Tables 1\nand 2 of the Annex for the period between 1 July 2011 and the date of entry\ninto force of this Regulation.\nRetrospective adjustments involving the\nrecovery of sums overpaid shall be restricted to a period of six months\npreceding the date of entry into force of this Regulation.
