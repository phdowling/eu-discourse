Ltd. and\nthe second reopening was triggered by the annulment by the General Court of the\nsame Council Regulation, but for different reasons, in its entirety. In line\nwith Article 266 of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the\ninstitutions of the European Union are obliged to comply with the judgment of\nthe General Court. Consequently, the European Commission initiated the partial\nre-openings of the anti-dumping investigation, initially, on 3 December 2011,\nin so far as it concerns the two above mentioned Chinese exporting producers\nand eventually, on 19 June 2012, as concerns all parties.\nThe enclosed Commission proposal for a\nCouncil Regulation re-imposing the anti-dumping duty on all imports concerned\nis made upon the interested parties having been given sufficient time to\nprovide comments to the final disclosure document of 6 December 2012. \nIt is proposed that the Council adopt the\nattached proposal for a Regulation which should be published in the Official\nJournal of the European Union as soon as possible.\nLegal basis\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30\nNovember 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members\nof the European Community.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and\nadministrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional\nand local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and\nproportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason:\nOther means would not be adequate because\nthe basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\nUnion budget.\n2013/0017 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION \nimposing\na definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain prepared or preserved\ncitrus fruits (namely mandarins, etc.) originating in the People's Republic of China \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, \nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries\nnot members of the European Community[1]\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Article 2(7)(a) and Article 9\nthereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\nthe European Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) after having consulted the Advisory\nCommittee, \nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 20 October 2007 the\nCommission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports\ninto the Community of certain prepared or preserved citrus fruits (namely\nmandarins, etc.) originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u2018PRC\u2019)[2]. On 4 July 2008, the\nCommission, by Regulation (EC) No 642/2008[3]\n(\u2018the provisional Regulation\u2019) imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on\nimports of certain prepared or preserved citrus fruits originating in the PRC.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proceeding was\ninitiated as a result of a complaint lodged on 6 September 2007 by the Spanish\nNational Federation of Associations of Processed Fruit and Vegetables (\u2018FENAVAL\u2019,\npreviously named \u2018FNACV\u2019) (\u2018the complainant\u2019) on behalf of producers representing\n100 % of the total Community production of certain prepared or preserved citrus\nfruits (namely mandarins etc.). The complaint contained evidence of dumping of\nthe product concerned and of material injury resulting there from, which was\nconsidered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As set out in recital (12)\nof the provisional Regulation, the investigation of dumping and injury covered\nthe period from 1 October 2006 to 30 September 2007 (\u2018investigation period\u2019 or \u2018IP\u2019).\nThe examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the\nperiod from 1 October 2002 to the end of the investigation period (\u2018period\nconsidered\u2019).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n9 November 2007, the Commission made imports of the same product originating in\nthe PRC subject to registration by Regulation (EC) No 1295/2007[4]. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that\nsafeguard measures were in force against the same product until 8 November\n2007. The Commission imposed provisional safeguard measures against imports of\ncertain prepared or preserved citrus fruits (namely mandarins, etc.) by\nRegulation (EC) No 1964/2003[5].\nDefinitive safeguard measures followed by Regulation (EC) No 658/2004 (\u2018the\nsafeguard Regulation\u2019)[6].\nBoth the provisional and definitive safeguard measures consisted of a tariff\nrate quota i.e. a duty was only due once the volume of duty free imports had\nbeen exhausted. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation (EC) No\n1355/2008 ([7])\n(\u2018the original Regulation\u2019) the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty\non imports of certain prepared or preserved citrus fruits (namely mandarins,\netc.) originating in the People's Republic of China. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The range of the definitive anti-dumping duty was between 361,4 and\n531,2 EUR/tonne net product weight.\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Xinshiji judgment\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\njudgment of 17 February 2011 in case T-122/09 - Zhejiang Xinshiji Foods Co. Ltd\nand Hubei Xinshiji Foods Co. Ltd v Council of the European Union supported by\nEuropean Commission[8]\n- ('the Xinshiji judgment') the General Court\nannulled the original Regulation in so far as it concerns the applicants\nZhejiang Xinshiji Foods Co., Ltd. and Hubei Xinshiji Foods Co. Ltd. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGeneral Court's judgment was based on the grounds that the Commission breached\nthe rights of defence by not providing the information necessary for the\napplicants to determine whether, in the light of the structure of the market,\nthe adjustment of export price to the ex-work level of the importer was\nappropriate in that it made it possible to compare the export price and the\nUnion industry price at the same level of trade. The General Court also\nconsidered that the Commission infringed the duty to state reasons as the\nreasons for a measure must appear in the actual body of the measure and may not\nbe stated in written or oral explanations given subsequently when the measure\nis already the subject of proceeding brought before the European Union Courts.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nApril 2011 the Commission lodged an appeal (C-195/11P) seeking to set aside the Xinshiji\njudgment. Following the declaration of invalidity of\nthe original Regulation by the Court of Justice of the European Union ('the\nCourt') on 22 March 2012 (see recital (16) below), the Commission withdrew its\nappeal as it became without object.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n3 December 2011 the Commission published a notice[9] partially reopening the\nanti-dumping investigation ('the first reopening Notice') in order to implement\nthe General Court's Xinshiji judgment. The re-opening was limited to determine whether, in the light of\nthe structure of the market, the adjustment of export price to the ex-work\nlevel of the importer was appropriate in that it made it possible to compare\nthe export price and the Union industry price at the same level of trade.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simultaneously,\nall interested parties received a disclosure document with its enclosures\nexplaining the reasons behind the adjustment of the post-importation costs\nwhich had been taken into account in calculating the price of products\noriginating in the People's Republic of China. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties were\ngiven the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to be heard\nwithin the time limit set out in the notice.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All parties which so\nrequested within the above time-limit and which demonstrated that there were\nparticular reasons why they should be heard were granted the opportunity to be\nheard. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two applicant\nexporters, eight importers, two associations of importers and one association\nof producers came forward as interested parties. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analogue country judgment\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n22 March 2012, in Case C\u2011338/10 \u2013 Gr\u00fcnwald Logistik Service GmbH (GLS) v\nHauptzollamt Hamburg-Stadt ('the analogue country judgment') \u2013 the Court\ndeclared the original Regulation invalid[10]. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Court held that since the\nCommission and the Council had determined the normal value of the product\nconcerned on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable in the European\nUnion for a like product, without taking all due care to determine that value\non the basis of the prices paid for that same product in a market economy third\ncountry, they had infringed the requirements of Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 19 June 2012 a notice[11] ('the second reopening\nNotice') was published in the Official Journal of the European Union. In the\nnotice parties were informed that, in view of the above-mentioned judgment of\nthe Court, imports into the European Union of certain prepared or preserved\ncitrus fruits (namely mandarins, etc.) originating in the People's Republic of\nChina were no longer subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by the\noriginal Regulation, and that definitive anti-dumping duties paid pursuant to\nthat Regulation for the product concerned should be repaid or remitted. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The notice also partially\nreopened the relevant anti-dumping investigation concerning imports of certain\nprepared or preserved citrus fruits (namely mandarins, etc.) originating in the\nPeople's Republic of China in order to implement the above judgment of the\nCourt. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The notice set out that the\nreopening was limited in scope to the selection of an analogue country, if any,\nand the determination of the normal value pursuant to Article 2(7)(a) of the\nbasic Regulation to be used for the calculation of any margin of dumping. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, by the same\nnotice, interested parties were invited to make their views known, submit\ninformation and provide supporting evidence regarding the availability of\nmarket economy third countries which could be selected to determine normal\nvalue pursuant to Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, including with\nregard to Israel, Swaziland, Thailand and Turkey.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission directly\ninformed the Union industry and their association, the exporting producers,\nsuppliers and importers and their associations known to be concerned, and the\nauthorities of the third countries concerned. Interested parties were given the\nopportunity to make their views known in writing and to be heard within the\ntime limit set out in the notice.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All parties which so\nrequested within the above time-limit and which demonstrated that there were\nparticular reasons why they should be heard were granted the opportunity to be\nheard.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eight importers and one\nassociation of importers came forward as interested parties.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE AFTER DISCLOSURE\nOF PROVISIONAL MEASURES \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the imposition of\nprovisional anti-dumping duties on imports of the product concerned originating\nin the PRC, several interested parties submitted comments in writing. The\nparties who so requested were also granted the opportunity to be heard.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission continued to\nseek and verify all information it deemed necessary for its definitive\nfindings. In particular, the Commission completed the investigation with regard\nto Union (\"Community\") interest aspects. In this respect,\nverification visits were carried out at the premises of the following unrelated\nimporters in the Union:\n\u2013              \nW\u00fcnsche Handelsgesellschaft International (GmbH\n& Co KG), Hamburg, Germany,\n\u2013              \nH\u00fcpeden & Co (GmbH & Co), Hamburg, Germany,\n\u2013              \nI. Schroeder KG. (GmbH & Co), Hamburg, Germany,\n\u2013              \nZumdieck GmbH, Paderborn, Germany,\n\u2013              \nGaston spol. s r.o., Zlin, Czech Republic.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All parties were informed\nof the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended\nto recommend the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of the\nproduct concerned originating in the PRC and the definitive collection of the\namounts secured by way of the provisional duty. They were also granted a period\nof time within which they could make representations subsequent to this\ndisclosure.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some importers proposed a\njoint meeting of all interested parties, pursuant to Article 6(6) of the basic Regulation;\nhowever the request was refused by one of them.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The oral and written\ncomments submitted by the interested parties were considered and taken into account\nwhere appropriate.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE\nPRODUCT \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent to the\nimposition of provisional measures, two unrelated Union importers argued that\ncertain types of mandarins should be excluded from the definition of the\nproduct concerned either because of their sweetness level or because of their\npacking when exported. In this respect, it is noted that these claims were not\naccompanied with any type of verifiable information and data proving that these\ntypes have characteristics that differentiate them from the product concerned.\nIt is also noted that differences in packing cannot be considered as a critical\nelement when defining product concerned, especially when formats of packing\nwere already taken into account when defining the product concerned as set out\nin recital (16) of the provisional Regulation. These arguments are therefore\nrejected.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures were imposed\non the product defined in the original Regulation as follows: prepared or preserved\nmandarins (including tangerines and satsumas), clementines, wilkings and other\nsimilar citrus hybrids, not containing added spirit, whether or not containing\nadded sugar or other sweetening matter, and as defined under CN heading 2008,\ncurrently falling within CN codes 2008 30 55, 2008 30 75 and ex 2008 30 90\n(TARIC codes 2008 30 90 61, 2008 30 90 63, 2008 30 90 65, 2008 30 90 67 and\n2008 30 90 69) and originating in the People's Republic of China.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis regard, in the analogue country judgement the Court interpreted the\nstatistics communicated by the Commission to the Court on 27 July 2011 as data\nrelative solely to the product concerned. However, it should be noted that such\nstatistics have a broader scope than the product under measures, since they\nincluded full CN codes 2008 30 55, 2008 30 75 and 2008 30 90.The statistical\ndata only covering the product concerned or like product for CN codes 2008 30\n55 and 2008 30 75, for the above mentioned countries during the investigation\nperiod are as follows:\n Country || Volume of imports (tonnes) \n People's Republic of China || 49,791.30 \n Thailand || 666.10 \n Turkey || 151.20 \n Israel || 4.80 \n Swaziland || 0 \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Under CN code 2008 30 90 ,\nthe statistics included products other than the product concerned. As a\nconsequence, no conclusions can be drawn on imports of the like product with\nregard to this CN code. Therefore, contrary to what the Court held in paragraph\n33 of the analogue country judgement, it cannot be derived from the statistics\nthat the like product was imported during the investigation period in\nsignificant quantities from either Israelor Swaziland.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SAMPLING \n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sampling for exporting\nproducers in the PRC\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two unrelated EU importers\ndisputed that the Chinese exporting producers selected for the sample\nrepresented 60 % of the total exports to the Union. Nevertheless, they were not\nable to provide any verifiable information that could undermine the accuracy of\nthe sampling information submitted by the cooperating Chinese exporting\nproducers and largely confirmed in the course of the further investigation.\nThis argument is therefore rejected.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three Chinese cooperating\nexporting producers submitted representations claimed that their related companies\nwere exporting producers of the product concerned and should therefore be\nincluded in the Annex of cooperating exporting producers. These claims were\nconsidered warranted and it was decided to revise the relevant Annex\naccordingly. One unrelated EU importer argued that exports made to the Union through traders should automatically be allowed to benefit from the measures\napplicable to the Chinese exporting producers. In this respect, it is noted\nthat anti-dumping measures are imposed on products manufactured by exporting\nproducers in the country under investigation that are exported to the Union\n(irrespective of which company trades them) and not to business entities engaged\nonly in trading activities. The claim was therefore rejected.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DUMPING \n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market economy treatment\n(MET)\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the imposition of\nprovisional measures, no comments were submitted by the Chinese cooperating exporting\nproducer with respect to the MET findings. In the absence of any relevant\ncomments, recitals (29) to (33) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individual treatment\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nrelevant comments, recitals (34) to (37) of the provisional Regulation\nconcerning individual treatment are hereby confirmed. \n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal value\n5.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of interested\nparties following the second reopening notice\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain\nimporters argued that Chinese imports would be necessary to cover Union demand,\nalthough one importer indicated that Spanish and Turkish production together would\nbe sufficient to cover the Union market needs. One importer remarked that\nimposition of anti-dumping duties would have resulted in significant increases\nin the price of the product concerned. Increase in prices were also mentioned\nby other importers. Different factors were identified as cause for such\nincrease like the decreasing availability of Chinese mandarins in the Union due\nto internal demand and demand from other markets, crop failures and labour\nshortage in China. Another\nfactor indicated was the reduced competition in the Union (it is estimated that\ncurrently there are only three Union producers, while in 2000 there were\neight). One importer complained that anti-dumping measures would favour large\ntrading companies instead of the traditional ones, which have been trading the\nproduct concerned with China for decades. This importer defends the existence\nof a license system based on pre-2001 data.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A group of importers\nclaimed that the Union institutions should initiate a whole new investigation\ninstead of partially reopening the anti-dumping investigation which had\nresulted in the imposition of measures which had been in force until the analogue\ncountry judgment. This claim was based on the fact that those importers did not\nsee sufficient evidence for dumping or injury in the present situation of the\nmarket.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other importers submitted that\nthey disagreed with the possible use of the IP data if a new dumping margin\nwould needed to be calculated. According to those importers most recent data\nshould be used and in particular the periods 2010-11 and 2011-12 were suggested.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A group of importers\nconsidered that the partial reopening of the investigation is in breach of\nArticle 266 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. According\nto those importers, the case-law[12]\nmentioned in the second reopening Notice should be recalled only if measures\nare annulled or declared invalid due to an erroneous injury determination. In\ntheir own words, \"the Community institutions did not blunder at the stage\nof determining injury, but as early as assessing whether the products concerned\nwere dumped at all\". As in this case the original Regulation was declared\ninvalid due to the determination of normal value, the importers claimed that\nsuch case-law does not apply.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally,\nseveral importers recommended Turkey to be used as analogue country. At a hearing, one importer\nsuggested contacting the authorities of Japan and Korea, as also in those\ncountries there would also be companies which manufactured the like product\nduring the IP.\n5.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis of comments following\nthe second reopening notice\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nregards the many claims summarized under recital (38) above it should be\nunderlined that the Commission decided to re-open the initial investigation in\na limited manner, restricted to the possible identification of an analogue\ncountry. It did not define a new investigation period, contrary to the approach\nfollowed in the case that led to the judgment in Industrie des poudres\nsph\u00e9riques v Council (Case C-458/98 P [2000] ECR I-8147). This was\nbased on the consideration that given that antidumping duties had been in\nplace, any data collected during a new investigation period would have been\ndistorted by the existence of these antidumping duties, in particular with\nregards to the establishment of injury. The Commission considers that the\npoints raised by the parties on the alleged absence of dumping at the present\npoint in time can be more appropriately discussed in the framework of an\ninterim review pursuant to Article 11 (3) of the basic Regulation. Whereas in\nthe initial investigation, the analysis on the existence of injury is carried\nout ex post for the investigation period, the analysis of injury during\nan interim review is done in a prospective manner, as the injury observed\nduring the investigation period of the review is likely to be influenced by the\nfact that an antidumping duty is in place.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nparties concerned are reminded that if an importer or another party wants the\nmeasures to be fully reviewed, it has the possibility to request the initiation\nof an interim review, as prescribed in Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation.\nThe parties concerned have that possibility at any time as the one year period\nsince the imposition of definitive measures referred to in Article 11(3) has\nelapsed. Any party that had lodged a request for review pursuant to Article\n11(3) prior to the analogue country judgement will be contacted by the\nCommission services to determine whether it wishes to pursue its request. \n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the alleged\nillegality of the partial reopening, it should be noted that the mentioned\ncase-law does not imply that a partial reopening might take place only if it\nconcerns determination of the injury suffered by the Union industry. What is\nclarified in case T-2/95 and case C-458/98 P is that \"in the case of an\nact concluding an administrative proceeding which comprises several stages, its\nannulment does not necessarily entail the annulment of the entire procedure\nprior to the adoption of the contested act regardless of the grounds,\nprocedural or substantive, of the judgment pronouncing the annulment\"[13]. Therefore it is irrelevant\nwhether the annulment or the declaration of invalidity of a regulation relates\nto the determination of injury or the determination of the normal value.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrespect of the use of IP data, it should be recalled that the second reopening\nNotice concerned a partial reopening of the original investigation and not a\nnew investigation. Therefore, only data from the IP could be relevant and\nshould be examined, even more so as the export prices used in the comparison\nwould also be pertaining to that period. The claims for the use of more recent\ndata, therefore, have to be dismissed.\n5.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation following the\nsecond reopening notice\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the judgement referred\nto in recital (16) above, the Court specifically referred to four countries\nfrom which, according to Eurostat data, there would have been significant\nimports into the Union under the CN codes 2008 30 55, 2008 30 75 and ex 2008 30\n90. These countries are Israel, Swaziland, Thailand and Turkey. In view of this, the Commission contacted the authorities of these countries via their\nMissions to the European Union. They were all contacted before the partial\nreopening of the investigation and again at the time of reopening. The Missions\nconcerned, as well the Delegations of the European Union to those four\ncountries, were requested to identify possible domestic producers of the like\nproduct and, if any, to assist in obtaining their cooperation. \n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although been contacted\ntwice, no replies were received from the Missions of Swaziland and Thailand to the European Union. Replies were received from the Missions of Israel and Turkey. The Turkish Mission provided addresses of six alleged producers, while the Israeli\nMission informed the Commission services that there had been no production of\nthe like product in Israel during the IP (nor that would be any such production\nat the moment).\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All six Turkish producers were\ncontacted, five of them twice. Three did not reply at all and the other three\ninformed the investigators that they were not producing the like product during\nthe IP. Therefore, although these companies offered to cooperate, they were not\nin a position to provide the Commission with the necessary data. This finding\nwas corroborated by a submission received from a German importer with producing\ninterests in Turkey, which stated that during the investigation period there\nwas no production of the like product in Turkey.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the absence of a\nreply from the Mission of Thailand, two Thai companies, from which updated\naddresses were obtained via the European Union Delegation in Bangkok, were also\ncontacted, twice each. Those two producers had already been contacted during\nthe original investigation \u2013 but at the time, this had not resulted in their\ncooperation. Also this time, one of the producers did not reply at all to the\ntwo requests while the other replied it did not intend to cooperate in the\ninvestigation.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the efforts of the\nCommission via the Mission of Swaziland to the European Union and the\nDelegation of the European Union in Swaziland, it has not been possible to\nidentify one or several producers in Swaziland. \n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the suggestion\nreferred to in recital (42) above, cooperation was also requested from the\nauthorities of Japan and the Republic of Korea and in parallel the Delegations\nof the European Union in those countries were requested to identify local\nproducers of the like product, if any. The Korean authorities did not reply,\nbut the Commission managed, through the Delegation of the European Union to the\n Republic of Korea, to obtain a name and address of a possible producer of the\nlike product in the Republic of Korea. This producer was contacted once but it\ndid not reply to the request for cooperation.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Japanese authorities\ncontacted possible Japanese producers, however, according to the Japanese\nauthorities, these companies did not want to cooperate in the proceeding and\nalso did not want their identities to be forwarded to the Commission. \n5.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the\ninvestigation following the second reopening notice\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Account\ntaken of the comments made by the parties, the analysis thereof and, in spite\nof significant efforts by the Commission services, the lack of cooperation from\npotential third country producers, it was concluded that a normal value on the\nbasis of the price or constructed value in a market economy third country as\nprescribed by Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation could not be determined.\n5.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of interested\nparties following the imposition of provisional measures\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis recalled that the normal value determination was based on the data provided\nby the Union Industry. This data was verified at the premises of the\ncooperating Union producers.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe imposition of provisional measures, all three Chinese sampled cooperating\nexporting producers and two unrelated Union importers questioned the use of\nUnion industry prices for the calculation of normal value. It was submitted\nthat normal value should have been calculated on the basis of the PRC\nproduction costs account taken of any appropriate adjustments relating to the\ndifferences between the EU and the PRC markets. \n5.3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis of comments\nfollowing the imposition of provisional measures\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect it is noted that the use of information from a non-market economy\ncountry and in particular from companies which have not been granted MET would\nbe contrary to the provisions of Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation. This\nargument is therefore rejected. It was also argued that data on prices from all\nother importing countries or relevant published information could have been\nused as a reasonable solution account taken of the lack of analogue country\ncooperation. However, such general information, in contrast to the data used by\nthe Commission, could not have been verified and cross checked with regard to\ntheir accuracy in line with the provisions of Article 6(8) of the basic\nRegulation. This argument is therefore rejected. No other argument was\nsubmitted that could cast doubt on the fact that the methodology used by the\nCommission is in line with the provisions of Article 2(7)(a) of the basic\nRegulation and, in particular, the fact that it constitutes in this particular\ncase the only remaining reasonable basis for calculation of normal value.\n5.3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on normal value\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe absence of any other comments and the fact that despite the significant\nefforts of the Commission services to identify a cooperating producer in an\nanalogue country, it has not been possible to obtain data from an analogue\ncountry producer for the investigation period, recitals (38) to (45) of the\nprovisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export price\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe imposition of provisional measures, one Chinese sampled cooperating\nexporting producer submitted that its export price should be adjusted in order\nto take into account certain cost elements (in particular ocean freight). In\nthis respect it is noted that this issue was dealt with during the on-the-spot\nverification both with regard to this company as well with regard to the other\ncompanies in the sample. On that occasion, each company submitted information\nwith regard to the costs in question. The amount claimed now by the company is\nconsiderably higher than the amount originally reported. It is noted that this\nnew claim is based simply on a declaration by a freight forwarder and does not\nreflect data relating to a real transaction. None of the other sampled\nexporting producers questioned the figures used with respect to ocean freight.\nMoreover, given the late submission, this claim cannot be verified. In\nparticular, the adjustment requested does not relate to any data already on the\nfile. Following this claim the Commission has nevertheless reviewed the amount\nof the cost in question account taken of the importance of this particular cost\nto the EU export transactions reported by the company. As a consequence, the\nCommission came to the conclusion that it is more appropriate to use the\naverage ocean freight cost verified on-the-spot for all the sampled Chinese\ncompanies. Consequently, the company\u2019s export price was adjusted accordingly.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\nother Chinese sampled cooperating exporting producer highlighted two\ncomputation errors on the calculation of its export price related to its\nsubmitted export listings. The claim was considered warranted and the\nproducer\u2019s relevant export price was revised accordingly.\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe absence of any other comments in this respect, recital (46) of the\nprovisional Regulation is hereby confirmed.\n5.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe absence of any comments in this respect, recitals (47) and (48) of the\nprovisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n5.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margins\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nlight of the above, the definitive dumping margins, expressed as a percentage\nof the CIF Union frontier price duty unpaid, are the following:\n\u2013              \nYichang Rosen Foods Co., Ltd, Yichang, Zhejiang: 139,4 %,\n\u2013              \nHuangyan No 1 Canned Food Factory, Huangyan, Zhejiang: 86,5 %,\n\u2013              \nZhejiang Xinshiji Foods Co., Ltd, Sanmen,\nZhejiang and its related producer Hubei Xinshiji Foods Co., Ltd, Dangyang City,\nHubei Province: 136,3 %,\n\u2013              \nCooperating exporting producers not included in\nthe sample: 131 %,\nAll other companies: 139,4 %.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE XINSHIJI\nJUDGMENT \n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of interested\nparties\n6.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Premature reopening\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nexporters concerned and a group of importers argued against the partial\nreopening prior to the delivery of the judgment in case C-338/10. It was argued\nthat reopening the investigation while the validity of the original Regulation\nwas challenged and, in the opinion of the parties concerned, the act was likely\nto be declared void, breached the principles of proportionality and of good\nadministration in the light of Article 41 of Charter of Fundamental Rights of\nthe European Union as it unnecessarily placed an undue burden on the parties\nconcerned to devote significant financial and personal resources to the\nreopened procedure. \n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naddition, the same parties also argued that reopening the investigation before\nthe judgment in the appeal case C-195/11P was premature and contrary to\nArticles 266 and 264 TFEU and Article 60(2) of Statute of the Court of Justice\nalleging that the Commission was anticipating the success of its own appeal.\nSuch initiation contradicted the relationship between, on the one hand, the\nCommission and the Council and on the other, the Court and it impaired the\nright to an effective court remedy. The importers concerned requested that the\nCommission first await the final decision of the Court before it reopens the\nanti-dumping proceeding to implement the judgment in question. \n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nexporters concerned and a group of importers argued that the reopening violated\nArticle 3 of the basic Regulation as it was based on the data collected during\nthe investigation period (i.e. 1 October 2006 \u2013 30 September 2007) and not during\na more recent period. \n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\ngroup of importers challenged the fairness and impartiality of the Commission's\nconduct pursuant to Article 41(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European\nUnion on the grounds that the Commission allegedly rejected an application by\nthe Union importers to launch a full interim review, even though the official\nEurostat data already showed an increase on a sustained and lasting basis of\nthe import price. \n6.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retroactivity \n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nexporters concerned and a group of importers argued that the reopening was\ndestined to fail for the reason that the infringement of the rights of defence\nand the failure to state reasons in case of a definitive anti-dumping\nRegulation cannot be rectified in isolation and retroactively. In particular,\nit was argued that the rights of defence of the interested parties were to be\nprotected during the on-going anti-dumping proceeding, i.e. before adoption of\nthe measure, and the proper statement of reasons for the definitive\nanti-dumping regulation was to be provided no later than at the adoption of the\noriginal Regulation. \n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\nwas also argued that a legal act based on an inadequate statement of reason is,\nand remains, ineffective from the start and the intended measure can only\nbecome effective by adopting a new legal act with a proper statement of\nreasons. \n6.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inadequate disclosure\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exporters concerned and\na group of importers claimed that the disclosure was not sufficient to remedy\nthe legal errors identified by the General Court for the reasons set out below.\n\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exporters concerned\ntogether with a group of importers argued that the violation of EU law found by\nthe General Court affected the entirety of the findings and the outcome of the\ninjury margin calculation, which required a new process to be launched taking\ninto account the most recent injury data. \n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\nthe same parties argued that the Commission failed to recognise correctly the\nscope and consequences of its infringement. It was argued that, contrary to the\nCommission's interpretation, the legal infringements established by to General\nCourt did not relate exclusively to the calculation of the 2% uplift of the\nimport costs of the Chinese products (post-importation costs) and the transport\ncosts of the products produced by Union producers. The importers concerned\nargued that those infringements related at the very least to the entire determination\nof the injury margin. \n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis context it was argued that the disclosure sent at the reopening failed to\naddress the question of the comparability of the level of trade and how the\nmethod chosen by the Commission for the comparison of the import and Union\nprices was justified against the background of the market environment\nconcerned, i.e. whether the products produced by Union producers and the\nimported goods are in fact in competition with each other 'in the warehouse of\nthe Hamburg importers'. The exporters concerned and a group of importers argued\nthat the information on the level of trade determination provided at the time\nof reopening remained far too general to enable the parties to understand why\nthe comparison of the import price and the Union industry price was done at the\nsame level of trade and it largely left unexplained the factors which emerged\nfrom the investigation on which that calculation was based. It did not deal\nwith the issue why the 2% uplift in question, which contained neither the\noperating and administrative expenses (SG&A) nor a profit margin of the\nimporters, was appropriate to achieve comparability of the selling prices of\nthe Union producers with the import prices of the exporting Chinese producers. \n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsame parties argued that no findings of any kind were made regarding the\nassumption that the Union producers sold the goods exclusively via importers.\nAlso, it was argued that the underlying reasoning for the selected level of\ntrade that the Union producers sold exclusively to importers was refuted since\naccording to the disclosed information only 62% of the sales of Union producers\nwent to the independent importers. The parties argued that the Commission\nappeared to ignore the fact that allegedly 38% of the Union production had not\nbeen sold through importers, meaning that in respect of these sales imported\nproducts were competing at a different level of trade. For this part of sales,\nit was argued, the method used by the Commission to determine the injury margin\nwas inappropriate as the importers' prices should have been adjusted by adding\npost-importation costs, selling, general and administrative expenses and an\nappropriate profit margin of the independent importer. In the light of these\ncorrections the injury margin would have been reduced for 38% of the Union\ngoods, which would lead to an overall reduction in the injury margin and a\nfollowing substantial reduction in the anti-dumping duties. \n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a result, the parties\nargued that the Commission failed to develop an appropriate method to determine\nthe injury margin for all imports which would have taken account of the actual\nmarket conditions. It was argued that there was a need for differentiated\nconsideration of the sales of the products of the Union producers for the\ndetermination of the injury margin in view of the different distribution\nchannels of the Union producers.\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nparties called for the Commission to provide a detailed description and\nanalysis of the evidence verified in respect of trade flows and related volumes\nsupporting its findings and to disclose that relevant information, which was\nnot confidential. \n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\ngroup of importers also contested the \"stereotype reference\" to the\nconfidentiality of the data as a result of which the exporting producers and\nUnion importers were barred from access to relevant sources necessary for them\nto determine whether, in the light of the structure of the market, the\nadjustment in dispute was appropriate in that it made it possible to compare\nthe export price and the Union industry price at the same level of trade. The\nimporters concerned argued that this claim was upheld by the General Court in\npara 86 of the Xinshiji judgment.\n6.1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transport costs\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nexporters concerned opposed the increase of the Union industry's ex-works\nselling price to include the costs of delivering to the importer's warehouse on\nthe grounds that it goes against the concept of internal market and that the\ntrade defence measures are not meant to remedy cost disadvantages of the Union\nindustry due to the location of its production facilities. \n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nexporters concerned and a group of importers argued that the Commission should\nhave taken into account the fact that the importers had higher transhipment\ncosts because the Chinese products were delivered in containers, while the\nproducts produced by Union producers were palletized for transportation by\ntruck and therefore could immediately be re-expedited to customers without any\nfurther manipulation, which reduced the handling charges by 50% or 7 EUR/tonne. \n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\ngroup of importers argued that the Commission overlooked, for a percentage of\nthe Union industry products which were in fact distributed via an importer,\nthat the transport costs for the Union industry goods to the importers'\nwarehouse were incurred only if the preserved mandarins had been 'physically'\nmade available in the warehouse of the importer concerned. In fact, however,\nthe bulk of the products sold by the Union producers via importers were\ndelivered directly by the Union producers to the importers' customers. This was\nclaimed to procure a considerable cost advantage for the Union producers\ncompared to imported products and, if it had been properly taken into\nconsideration, a smaller injury margin would have resulted than that determined\non the basis of the Commission's calculation method.\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nassociation of importers and some importers objected to the figure (90 EUR)\nused as a basis for the calculation of the transport costs. The parties claimed\nthat the transport costs chosen were too high, referring probably to transport\nby truck. However, according to the information of the parties, the majority of\ngoods was transported by vessels, which is a much cheaper mode of transport.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nparties asked for an explanation concerning the inclusion of terminal handling\ncharges and the costs for trucking to the importer's premises in the post-importation\ncosts. \n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis of comments\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of the argument\nthat the investigation should not have been reopened while the validity of the\noriginal Regulation had been challenged in case C-338/10 (recital (64), the\nCommission explained that it acted under the presumption of legality. \n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of claims\nconcerning the premature reopening subject to the pending appeal case C-195/11P\n(recital (65)) the Commission considers the argument without object, given that\nthe re-opening was based on the findings of the General Court. Furthermore, the\nappeal has in the meantime been withdrawn.\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrespect of the claims for a new investigation it has to be underlined that the\npartial reopening has as its objective to remedy only of the violation of the\nrights of defence identified by the General Court, not to reopen the entire\nproceeding. However, the Commission will advise the parties concerned that they\nhave the possibility to request the initiation of an interim review, as\nprescribed in Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, if they want the\nInstitutions to verify their claim that on the basis of more recent data, there\nis no more injury.\n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regards to the claim\nthat the injury analysis should be based on more recent data (recital (66)), it\nis observed that any more recent data will be influenced by the fact that an\nantidumping duty has been in place. Therefore, the appropriate instrument to\nanalyse more recent data is an interim review as prescribed in Article 11(3) of\nthe basic Regulation, and not a new investigation (see also recital (43)\nabove).\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the doubt\nconcerning the impartiality and fairness of the proceeding (recital (67)), this\nis based on a misunderstanding that the Commission rejected the request for an\ninterim review. The Commission's Services informed the respective parties by\nletter of 6 September 2011 that on the basis of the information provided to\nthat date no decision could be taken whether or not a review could be\ninitiated. The points which required further clarification or evidence were\noutlined. The parties were informed about this at the hearing of 29 February\n2012 and were invited to continue the discussion with the relevant Commission\nservice. The Commission services will inform them that they can pursue their\nrequest as of the date of entry into force of this Regulation. The one-year\nperiod foreseen in Article 11 (3) of the basic Regulation does not apply in the\ncase at hand, as this would run counter its objective, which is that there\nshould be a minimum amount of time between the initial investigation period and\nan interim review. In the present case, this minimum amount of time has been\nobserved.\n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the argument\nconcerning the retroactive remedy of the breach of rights of defence (recital (68))\nthe Commission considers that as a consequence of the judgement of the General\nCourt, the investigation has been re-opened at the point where the illegality\noccurred. The parties have now a possibility to exercise their rights to the\nextent they were prevented from doing as established by the General Court. Furthermore,\nthe duties will be imposed only for the future. Against this background the\nCommission considers that there is no issue of retroactive remedy as claimed by\nthe parties and this argument of the parties has to be therefore dismissed.\n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the argument\nconcerning the inadequate statement of reasons (recital (69)), the very purpose\nof the reopening is to remedy the lack of reasoning and to base the new legal\nact on a complete statement of reasons. It is therefore considered that this\nargument of the parties is addressed.\n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of the scope of\nthe judgment (recital (72)) the purpose of the reopening is to establish the\nappropriate level of trade, and in particular to clarify why the\npost-importation cost adjustment of the CIF export price was necessary to\nensure that the comparison of the export price and of the Union industry price\nwas done at the same level of trade. The argument of the parties has to be,\ntherefore, dismissed.\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the claims\nconcerning the deficiency of the disclosure document of 5 December 2011 in\nrespect of the explanation of level of trade applied in this case (in\nparticular, recitals (73) to (76)), the parties were provided with additional\ninformation and explanation at several occasions, namely in points 4 and 5 of\nthe disclosure document of 5 December 2011 as well as during the hearings of 29\nFebruary 2012. \n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the sake of full clarity on this point, the findings\nconcerning the level of trade are summarised as follows: (i) The investigation\nshowed that the canned mandarins are only produced in one Spanish region (Valencia) and are mainly sold in Germany and United Kingdom. The proportion of Union sales to Germany and United Kingdom was\nestablished to represent 62% of the total Union sales. (ii) On the basis of the\nverified data it was established that during the IP the Union producers and the\nChinese exporters sold essentially to the same customers, i.e. to traders or\ndistributors. (iii) For these reasons, the price comparison between the imports\nfrom the exporting producers and the sales of the Union producers was made for\nthe exporting producers at frontier level (CIF) and for the Union producers at\nfactory level (ex-works) adjusted to the importers' warehouses. (iv) This\nmethodology required the following adjustments: on the one hand, a\npost-importation costs adjustment of the Chinese CIF export prices to bring the\ngoods from the port to the importers' warehouses; this adjustment, fixed at 2%,\nwas based on the collected and verified invoices and the respective calculation\nwas disclosed to the interested parties in the annex to the disclosure document\nof 5 December 2011. On the other hand, the Union ex-works prices were increased\nto reflect the cost of freight to bring the goods from the producers (Valencia) to the importers' premises (Germany and United Kingdom). This freight adjustment was\ncalculated based on the established transport costs from Valencia to Hamburg. Given that not all sales of Union producers were delivered to Germany and United Kingdom, this average was lowered in proportion of the share of sales to Germany and United Kingdom (62%) and in proportion of direct sales. \n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the proportion\nof direct sales of the Union producers, it has been in a range of between 2%\nand 12% during the IP. The precise percentage cannot be disclosed for\nconfidentiality reasons.\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, it was argued\nthat a differentiated approach in determination of the appropriate level of\ntrade in respect of the direct sales of the Union producers (recital (72))\nshould have been developed. In this respect it is to be noted that based on the\nverified findings none of the Chinese imports were sold directly during the IP.\nSince there were not matching direct sales on the side of the Chinese exports,\nit was not possible to develop a differentiated approach for establishing a\nlevel of trade for the proportion of direct sales of Union producers. Instead,\nfor the purpose of the injury margin calculation, the direct sales of Union\nproducers were adjusted back to the ex-works level and subjected to the freight\nadjustment described in recital (92) point (iv) above. Against this background,\nthe respective claim of the parties has to be dismissed.\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the claim of the\nparties that the adjustment of the CIF export price should have included the\nSG&A and a reasonable profit margin (recital (73)) it is noted that had the\nCommission adjusted the export CIF price by adding SG&A and profit, it\nwould have brought the sales of imported goods to the retailer level. In such\ncase the comparison between the Chinese export prices and the Union sales\nprices would have been carried out at different levels of trade. For this\nreason, the claim of the parties has to be dismissed.\n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the argument of\nthe parties that it stems from the disclosure document of 5 December 2011 that\n38% of sales of Union producers in the IP were direct sales (recital (74)), it\nwas explained to the parties at the hearings of 29 February 2012 that this\nconclusion was mistaken. The figure of 62% of Union industry sales that were\nmade in Germany and United Kingdom relates to the geographical distribution of\nthe sales and has no relevance as regards the identification of the type of\ncustomer, and thus as regards the identification of direct sales. It may only\nbe deduced from this fact, and it is confirmed, that the remaining 38% of the\nsales of Union producers were made outside Germany and the United Kingdom. Since the parties' assumption on the level of trade of 38% of sales of Union\nproducers is incorrect, the subsequent claim based on this assumption\nconcerning the need to recalculate the injury margin has to be also dismissed.\n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding the claim on\ndetailed disclosure of trade flow and related volumes (recital (76)), it is\nrecalled that the facts and figures underlying the choice of methodology to\ndetermine the level of trade in this case have been addressed in the points 3\nto 7 of the disclosure document of 5 December 2011. The parties are referred to\nthis information as well as the explanation provided at the hearings of 29\nFebruary 2012. For sake of clarity, the underlying trade flows are explained in\ndetail in recital (92) above. \n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the argument on a\n'stereotype reference to confidentiality' (recital (77)), the Commission\nconsiders that the information that was kept confidential related to the (i)\npercentage of direct sales and (ii) the information used for the calculation of\nthe 2% uplift based on invoices and data gathered during the verification\nvisit. In this respect it is noted that the invoices constitute information confidential\nby nature. The non-confidential summary of the latter has been provided in the\nannex to the disclosure document of 5 December 2011. As regards the direct\nsales the Hearing Officer at the joint hearing of 29 February 2012 confirmed\nthat actual figures about direct sales are confidential information and offered\nto examine on request of the interested parties how the actual data in the\nconfidential file was used by the Commission services responsible for the\ninvestigation and to inform the parties whether in his view the data were\ncorrectly reflected in the findings. The parties did not request it. For these\nreasons the Commission considers that the requirement to disclose all but\nconfidential information was met. Furthermore, given that the data under\nassessment is more than 5 years old, the Commission considers that it can\ndisclose at this stage that the percentage of direct sales is between 2% and\n12%. \n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the objection of\nthe parties to the freight adjustment of the Union ex-works selling price\n(recital (78)) the Commission considers the adjustment in question was made to\nbring the goods to the importer's warehouse, i.e. to the same level of trade as\nthe Chinese exports. This adjustment was based on the specific circumstances of\nthe relevant market where the canned mandarins are only produced in one Spanish\nregion (Valencia) and are mainly sold in Germany and United Kingdom. It was\nmade to achieve the fair comparison between export price and the Union price at\nthe same level of trade, not to offset the claimed cost disadvantage of the\nUnion producers due to the location of their production facilities. The\nargument of the parties is therefore dismissed.\n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the argument that\nthe Commission should have taken into account the higher costs of importers\nbecause the Chinese products were delivered in containers while the Union\nindustry products were palletised which resulted in the reduction of handling\ncharges by the Union producers (recital (79)), it is noted that the adjustments\nmade covered only the cost of bringing the goods to the importer's warehouse.\nThe subsequent costs incurred in the context of the shipment of the goods to\nthe retailers are to be borne after the defined level of trade and cannot be\ntherefore taken into account. For this reason the argument of the parties is\ndismissed. \n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the argument that\nthe transport costs of the Union producers should have been reduced to take\ninto account cases where the products were delivered directly to the customers\nof importers as claimed by the latter (recital (80)), it is recalled that the\nfreight adjustment of the Union ex-works sales price was based on the\nestablished costs of physical delivery to the warehouse in Hamburg (90 EUR)\nbased on collected invoices, because the warehouse Hamburg is the appropriate\nlevel of trade for comparing export price and prices of the Union product. The\nfreight adjustment is not justified on the ground that it includes total\ntransport costs between the Union producer and the retailer (which would be\nhigher than the costs for delivery to the warehouse), but on the ground that in\nthe light of the specificities of the market for the product concerned, the\nwarehouse in Hamburg is the appropriate level of trade. In this context, the\nargument raised by the parties appears immaterial.\n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 The parties claimed that the\napplied freight adjustment was too high because it was based on the transport\ncosts by truck (recital (81)). In this context, it is recalled that the freight\nadjustment was based on the established costs of physical delivery to Hamburg, which included both truck and boat. Therefore, the adjustment requested by the\nparties had already been included in the calculation of freight cost to Hamburg. It was therefore not necessary to verify the data submitted by the parties during\nthe hearing, as during the original investigation, the costs for delivery to Hamburg had been established on the basis of the verified data of the EU producers.\n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding the comment made\nby the applicant concerning the calculation of the post-importation cost\n(recital (82)), it was stated that, as explained in paragraph 9 of the\ndisclosure document sent on 5 December 2011, both terminal handling charges and\nthe costs for trucking to the importer's premises were included in the\ncalculation. No ocean or insurance freights were included in terminal handling\ncharges as these costs were already included in the CIF price gathered and\nverified during the on-spot verifications at the exporter's premises. Thus, if\nthe Commission had included those costs in the calculation of the\npost-importation costs this would have implied double-counting.\n6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Procedure\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 On 5 December 2011 the\nCommission submitted a disclosure document with facts and figures relating to the\ngrounds on which the General Court annulled the measures. All interested\nparties were invited to comment.\n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 On 29 February 2012 the\nCommission held hearings with all parties that requested so, including a joint\nhearing with the Hearing Officer of the exporters concerned and a group of\nimporters.\n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 On 26 March 2012 one of the\ninterested parties informed the Commission that in view of the judgment in case\nC-338/10 it considered the partial reopening concerning post-importation cost\nwithout purpose. \n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 On 17 July 2012 the\nCommission responded that in the light of the reopening of 19 June 2012 it was\nconsidered that both partial reopenings are still pending and none of these\ninvestigations had become without purpose.\n6.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 The Xinshiji judgment of\nGeneral Court has been implemented by providing additional reasoning,\ninformation and explanation to the parties on the reopened point of the\noriginal investigation. The parties were given opportunity to comment and to be\nheard. All arguments raised have been addressed and duly taken into account. \n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 Account taken of the\ncomments made by the parties and the analysis thereof it was concluded that the\narguments and facts raised by the interested parties did not show a need to\nmodify the contested injury margin calculation. \n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the injury margin\ndetermined in the original investigation is hereby confirmed.\n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above it\nwas concluded that the implementation of the Xinshiji judgment should take the\nform of re-imposing the definitive anti-dumping duty for the applicants in the\ncase in question. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 INJURY\n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union production and Union\nindustry\n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of\nsubstantiated comments, the findings set out in recitals (52) to (54) of the\nprovisional Regulation are confirmed. \n7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union consumption\n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 One of the exporting parties\nargued that there is a discrepancy between the level of the consumption set out\nin the safeguard Regulation No 658/2004 and the level set in the provisional\nRegulation. It is underlined that the difference in the level of consumption\nwas basically due to the different product scope in the current investigation\nand to the different number of Member States in those two investigations. No\nfurther and substantiated information was received in this respect. The\nfindings set out in recitals (55) to (57) of the provisional Regulation are\ntherefore confirmed. As a corollary, the subsequent parts of the analysis which\ndraw on consumption are also confirmed in this respect. \n7.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from the country\nconcerned\n7.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume and market share of\nimports of the product concerned \n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrespect of the market share some interested parties opposed the Commission\nstatement set out in recital (58) of the provisional Regulation that indicated\nan increase of the market share of the dumped imports. They argued that\ncontrary to the Commission findings the market share of imports from China decreased. The evaluation of imports from\nthe PRC in volume and market share was verified. As set out in said recital\nthere was only one year where the market share of the Chinese imports\ndecreased. For the rest of the period examined the market share of imports from\n  China remained consistently high. Therefore the findings presented at the\nprovisional stage are confirmed.\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties argued that\npost-IP volumes should also be examined to assess whether Chinese imports are\nincreasing. It is to be noted that trends on imports from China were evaluated for the period 2002/2003 to 2006/2007 and a clear increase was observed. In\naccordance with the provisions of the basic Regulation, post-IP events are not\ntaken into account, except in exceptional circumstances. In any event, as\nstated below in recital (136) the level of imports post-IP was examined and was\nfound to be significant. \n7.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Price undercutting\n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 Three\ncooperating exporting producers contested the Commission's findings on\nundercutting. One contested the methodology used to calculate undercutting and\nrequested an adjustment to reflect costs borne by traders for their indirect\nsales. Where justified, calculations were adapted. The revised comparison\nshowed that, during the IP, imports of the product concerned were sold in the\nUnion at prices which undercut the Union industry's prices by a range of 18,4%\nto 35,2% based on the data submitted by the sampled cooperating exporting\nproducers.\n7.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Situation of the Union\nindustry\n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 Two importers and the\nimporters' association contested the duration of the packing season indicated\nin recital (79) of the provisional Regulation. They argued that the packing\nseason in Spain lasts only three months instead of four to five as indicated in\nthe provisional Regulation. However this allegation is linked to the crop\n(variable by nature) and to the quantity produced and in any case has no impact\non the injury factors as analysed by the Commission services. \n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other substantiated information or argument\nconcerning the situation of the Union industry, recitals (63) to (86) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n7.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on injury\n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure of the\nprovisional Regulation, some importers and some exporting producers claimed,\nwith reference to recitals (83) to (86) of the provisional Regulation, that\ndata used by the Commission to establish the injury level was neither correct\nnor objectively evaluated. They argued that almost all injury-related\nindicators showed positive trends and that therefore no evidence of injury can\nbe found.\n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, it is noted\nthat even if some indicators show small improvements, the situation of the\nUnion industry has to be evaluated as a whole and in consideration of the fact\nthat safeguard measures were in place until the end of the investigation\nperiod. This matter was explored at length in recitals (51) to (86) of the provisional Regulation. The deep restructuring\nprocess which these measures allowed for, resulting in a large reduction in\nproduction and capacity, would have under normal circumstances led to a significant\nimprovement in the Union producers\u2019 overall situation, including production,\ncapacity utilisation, sales, and price/cost differentials. Instead, volume\nindicators have remained weak, stocks have increased substantially and\nfinancial indicators have continued to be in the red\u2014some even worsening. \n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, it is\nconsidered that the conclusions regarding the material injury suffered by the\nUnion industry as set out in the provisional Regulation are not altered. In the\nabsence of any other substantiated information or arguments, they are therefore\ndefinitively confirmed.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CAUSATION\n8.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of the dumped\nimports \n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties argued that the\nvolume of the Chinese imports had been stable since 1982 and that therefore\nthey could not have caused injury as explained in the provisional Regulation\n(see recital (58)). Indeed, as explained above in recital (114), imports from China during the period examined have increased significantly to the detriment of the EU\nindustry market share. Moreover, the argument refers to the trend in imports\nthat exceed well above the period in question therefore the argument is\nrejected. \n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital (116)\nabove, it is definitively concluded that during the IP, the prices of imports\nfrom the sampled Chinese exporting producers undercut the average Union\nindustry prices by percentages ranging from 18,4% to 35,2%. The revision\nof the undercutting margin leaves unaffected the conclusions on the effect of\nthe dumped imports set out in recitals (100) and (101) of the provisional\nRegulation.\n8.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exchange rate fluctuations\n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 After the imposition of the\nprovisional duties some importers further argued the negative influence of the\nexchange rate on the price level. They\nargued that the exchange rate level is the main factor that caused injury.\nNevertheless, the Commission\u2019s assessment refers merely to a difference between\nprice levels with no requirement to analyse the factors affecting the level of\nthose prices. As a consequence a clear causal link between the high\ndumping level and the injury suffered by the Union industry was found and\ntherefore recital (95) of the provisional Regulation can be confirmed.\n8.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Supply and price of raw\nmaterials\n(125)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nargued that injury is not caused by dumped imports but rather by the scarce\nsupply of fresh fruit i.e. the raw material for canned mandarins. \n(126)\u00a0\u00a0 However, official data from\nthe Spanish Ministry for Agriculture confirm that the quantity available for\nthe canning industry is more than sufficient to cover all the production\ncapacity of the Spanish producers.\n(127)\u00a0\u00a0 Producers compete to a\ncertain extent for fresh fruit with the direct fresh produce consumer market.\nHowever, this competition does not break the causal link. A clear, significant\nreason for the Union industry\u2019s relatively low production, sales and market\nshare is rather to the pressure of the massive imports from China at very low prices. In this situation, and considering that the market price is dictated by\nthe imports covering more than 70% of the market, which engage in price\nundercutting, suppression and depression, it would be uneconomic to produce\nmore without reasonable expectations for selling the product at prices allowing\nfor a normal profit. Therefore the Spanish industry could reasonably provide\nsignificantly higher quantities under the condition that the market price would\nnot penalise their economic results.\n(128)\u00a0\u00a0 Another\nfact confirming this analysis is the consistent existence of a significant\namount of stocks by Union producers, underlining that the Union industry\u2019s\ninjurious situation occurred not because of insufficient production, but due to\nproduction that cannot be sold due to the pressure of Chinese imports.\n(129)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nan agricultural product, the price of the raw material is subject to seasonal\nfluctuations due to its agricultural nature. Nevertheless, in the five-year\nperiod analysed, which included harvests with lower and higher prices, the\nCommission observes that injury (e.g. in the form of financial losses) occurs\nirrespectively of these fluctuations and therefore the economic results of the\nUnion industry are not directly correlated to such seasonal fluctuations. \n8.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quality differences\n(130)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties claimed that\nthe Chinese product was of a higher quality than the Union production. However,\nany price differences resulting therefrom were not sufficiently substantiated,\nand there is no evidence that the alleged consumer preference for Chinese\nproducts would be so intense as to be the cause of the deteriorated situation\nfor the Union industry. In any case such alleged price differences would favour\nthe Chinese product, increasing the undercutting/underselling level. In the\nabsence of any further new and\nsubstantiated information or argument, recital (99) of the provisional\nRegulation is hereby confirmed. \n8.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cost increases \n(131)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties argued that\nextraordinary cost increases by some producers were at the root of the injury.\nThese allegations were not sufficiently substantiated. The Commission analysis\ndid not detect any such events which could reverse the assessment of causation\nor affect the calculation of the injury elimination level. \n(132)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties submitted\ncomments on the increased costs of production and inability of the Union\nindustry to reduce them. Certain cost items (such as energy) have increased,\nbut their impact is not such as to break the causal link in a context where a\nvery significant amount of dumped Chinese exports are depressing sales and\nproduction (thereby increasing the Union industry\u2019s unit costs) and suppressing\nand depressing Union industry prices.\n8.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Aid schemes \n(133)\u00a0\u00a0 It was alleged that the EC\naid schemes caused artificial growth of processing in the EC and then\nencouraged reduced levels of raw material supply for the product concerned.\nThis allegation was of a general nature and was not sufficiently substantiated.\nIn any event, the schemes in question were modified in 1996 when the aid was\nallowed to the farmers instead than to the processors of the product concerned.\nThe Commission's analysis has not detected any residual effects during the\ninvestigation period which could break the causal link. Regarding supply,\nreference is made to recitals (128) and (129) above. \n8.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on causation\n(134)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther new and substantiated information or arguments, recitals (87) to (101)\nof the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n(135)\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the above,\nthe provisional finding of the existence of a causal link between the material\ninjury suffered by the Union industry and the dumped Chinese imports is\nconfirmed.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UNION INTEREST\n9.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Developments after the\ninvestigation period\n(136)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nfrom 9 November 2007 imports from the PRC were subject to registration pursuant\nto the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1295/2007 of 5 November 2007 making\nimports of certain prepared or preserved citrus fruits (namely mandarins, etc.)\noriginating in the People\u2019s Republic of China subject to registration\n('Registration Regulation').[14] This\nwas done with a view to the possible retroactive imposition of anti-dumping\nduties. Consequently and exceptionally, developments after the IP have also\nbeen analysed. Eurostat data confirms that\nimports from China remain significant and this has been corroborated by certain\nimporters. The volume for the last ten months after the IP reached a level of\n74.000 tonnes at stable low prices.\n9.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ability of Union producers\nto supply the Union market\n(137)\u00a0\u00a0 A number of parties\ncommented on the low level of the Spanish production, which they claimed is\nunable to fully supply the Union market. While it is correct to state that in\nthe present situation the Union industry does not supply the overall EU market,\nit should be noted that this fact is linked to the effect of injurious imports,\nas explained above. In any event, the intended effect of the measures is not to\nclose the Union market to Chinese imports, but to remove the effects of\ninjurious dumping. Given inter alia, the existence of only two sources\nof supply of these products, it is considered that in the event definitive\nmeasures are imposed, Chinese products would continue to enjoy a significant\ndemand in the Union.\n9.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the Union\nindustry and suppliers\n(138)\u00a0\u00a0 One\nimporters' association alleged that any anti-dumping measures without any\nlimitation of quantities would not help protect the Spanish industry but would\nautomatically trigger illegal trading activities. This is an argument which\nrather points to the need for the institutions to ensure proper monitoring of\nthe enforcement of measures, rather than against the benefit measures could\nhave for Union producers. \n(139)\u00a0\u00a0 Another\nimporter argued that imposition of anti-dumping measures would not improve the\nsituation of the Spanish producers, due to the existence of large stocks built\nby the importers in the EU, which would be able to satisfy the market demand in\nthe nearest future. The size of the stocks and the phenomenon of stockpiling\nwere supported by another importer. These comments confirm the Commission\nanalysis in the provisional Regulation and elsewhere in this Regulation.\nHowever, it is recalled that measures are intended to provide relief from\ninjurious dumping over a period of five years\u2014not only one.\n(140)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\nnew and substantiated information or argument in this respect, the conclusion\nmade in recitals (103) to (106) and (115) of the provisional Regulation\nregarding the interest of the Union industry are hereby confirmed.\n9.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of unrelated\nimporters/traders in the Union\n(141)\u00a0\u00a0 Cooperating importers\nexpressed a general interest in maintaining two sources of supply of the\nproduct concerned, namely Spain and China, in order to maintain the security of\nsupply at competitive prices.\n(142)\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless the majority of\nthe importers, should definitive measures be imposed, would prefer a measure\nwhich contains also quantitative elements. This is not considered adequate, as\nexplained below in recital (156).\n(143)\u00a0\u00a0 Data from the sampled\ncooperating importers were verified and confirmed that the canned mandarins\nsector represents less than 6% of their total turnover and that they achieved,\non average, a level of profitability exceeding 10% during both the\ninvestigation period and the period of 2004-2008.\n(144)\u00a0\u00a0 The foregoing underlines\nthat, on balance, the potential impact of measures on importers/traders would\nnot be disproportional to the positive effects emanating therefrom. \n9.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of users/retailers\n(145)\u00a0\u00a0 One user, representing less\nthan 1% of consumption, submitted generic comments on the reduced availability\nof mandarins in the EU and on the superior quality of the Chinese product. He\nwas invited to further cooperate providing individual data but declined and did\nnot substantiate his allegations. Another retailer, a member of the main\nimporter's association, generally opposed a price increase. No other submission\nconcerning the interest of users/retailers was received in the course of the\ninvestigation. In this situation and in\nabsence of any substantiated comments from users/retailers, the conclusions\nmade in recitals (109) to (112) of the provisional Regulation are hereby\nconfirmed.\n9.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of consumers\n(146)\u00a0\u00a0 Contrary to what was claimed\nby one importer, the interest of consumers was taken into consideration at the\nprovisional stage. The Commission's findings were outlined in recitals (113)\nand (114) of the provisional Regulation. Other parties suggested that the\nimpact on consumers would be significant. However, no information was provided\nthat could cast doubt on the findings in the aforementioned recitals. Even if\nduties were to lead to an increase in consumer prices, no party has disputed\nthe fact that this product is a very small part of household food expenditure.\nTherefore in the absence of any comments from consumers and of any further new\nand substantiated information these recitals are confirmed. \n9.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on Union\ninterest\n(147)\u00a0\u00a0 The additional analysis\nabove concerning the interests at stake has not altered the provisional\nconclusions in this respect. Data of the sampled cooperating importers were\nverified and confirmed that the canned mandarins sector represents for them\nless than 6% of their total turnover and that they achieved, in average terms a\ncomfortable result during both the investigation period and the period of\n2004-2008 examined, so the impact of the measures on importers will be minimal.\nIt has been also ascertained that the financial impact on the final consumer\nwould be negligible, considering that marginal quantities per capita are bought\nin the consumer countries. It is considered that the conclusions regarding the\nUnion interest as set out in the provisional Regulation have not changed. In\nthe absence of any other comments, these conclusions set out in the provisional\nRegulation are therefore definitively confirmed.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DEFINITIVE MEASURES\n10.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injury elimination level\n(148)\u00a0\u00a0 One importer claimed that\nthe profit margin at the level 6,8% used as reference at the provisional stage\nis overestimated. In this respect it should be noted that the same level was\nused and accepted for safeguard measures as the actual profit achieved by the\nUnion industry in the period 1998/ 99 to 2001/02. It refers to profits of the\nUnion producers in a normal trading situation before the increase in imports which\nled to injury in the industry. The argument is therefore rejected.\n(149)\u00a0\u00a0 Union producers claimed that\nprovisional duties did not take into account the peculiar situation of the\ncanned mandarins market, where the production is concentrated in only one country\nand the vast majority of sales and of imports are concentrated in another\nEuropean country. For that it was requested that final calculations take into\naccount the transport cost from the producer country to the consumer country.\nThe claim was justified and warranted and calculations were adapted accordingly\nto reflect the concentration of sales in the relevant areas of the Union.\n(150)\u00a0\u00a0 One party made comments on\nthe undercutting and underselling calculation. Where warranted adjustments were\nmade at definitive stage.\n(151)\u00a0\u00a0 The resulting injury\nmargins, taking into account, when warranted, the requests from interested\nparties, expressed as a percentage of the total cif import value of each\nsampled Chinese exporter were less than dumping margins found, as follows: \n\u2013              \nYichang Rosen Foods Co., Ltd., Yichang, Zhejiang: 100,1%,\n\u2013              \nHuangyan No. 1 Canned Food Factory, Huangyan, Zhejiang: 48,4%,\n\u2013              \nZhejiang Xinshiji Food Co., Ltd., Sanmen,\nZhejiang and related producer Hubei Xinshji Foods Co., Ltd., Dangyang City,\nHubei Province: 92,0%,\n\u2013              \nCo-operating exporting producers not included in\nthe sample: 90,6%,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All other companies: 100,1%.\n10.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retroactivity\n(152)\u00a0\u00a0 As specified in recital (4),\non 9 November 2007 the Commission made imports of the product concerned\noriginating in the PRC subject to registration on the basis of a request by the\nUnion industry. This request has been withdrawn and therefore the matter has\nnot been further examined.\n10.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive measures\n(153)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\nreached with regard to dumping, injury, causation and Union interest, and in\naccordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, a definitive anti-dumping\nduty should be imposed at the level of the lowest of the dumping and injury\nmargins found, in accordance with the lesser duty rule. In this case, the duty\nrate should accordingly be set at the level of the injury found.\n(154)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above\nand in line with corrigendum published in the Official Journal L 258[15] the definitive duty should\namount as follows:\n\u2013              \n Yichang Rosen Foods Co., Ltd., Yichang, Zhejiang: 531,2 Eur/ton,\n\u2013              \n Huangyan No.1 Canned Food Factory Huangyan, Zhejiang:361,4 Euro/ton,\n\u2013              \n Zhejiang Xinshiji Foods Co., Ltd., Sanmen,\nZhejiang and its related producer Hubei\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Xinshiji Foods Co., Ltd., Dangyang\nCity, Hubei Province: 490,7 Euro/Ton,\n\u2013              \n Co-operating exporting producers not included\nin the sample: 499,6 Euro/Ton,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All other companies: 531,2\nEuro/Ton.\n10.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Form of the measures\n(155)\u00a0\u00a0 A number of parties\nrequested measures which combined price and quantity elements, whereby for an\ninitial import volume no duty or a reduced duty would be paid. In certain\ncases, this was linked to a license system. \n(156)\u00a0\u00a0 This\noption was considered but rejected for, in particular, the following reasons.\nAnti-dumping duties are imposed because the export price is lower than the\nnormal value. The amounts exported to the Union are relevant for the analysis whether dumped imports cause injury.\nHowever, these amounts are, normally, irrelevant for the level of the duty that\nshould be imposed. In other words, if it is found that dumped imports cause\ninjury, the dumping may be offset by a duty which applies as of the first\nshipment imported after the entry into force of the duty. Finally, to the\nextent that it would be found that it is in the Union's interest that during a\ncertain period, products may be imported without imposing anti-dumping duties, Art.\n14(4) of the basic Regulation allows for suspension under certain conditions. \n(157)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties have alleged that\nany form of measures without a quantitative limitation will lead to duty\navoidance. Parties made reference again to the stockpiling which occurred in\nthe wake of the enlargement of the European Union on 1st May 2004. The\nCommission services' analysis has confirmed that this was a clear attempt to\navoid the duties. Given these statements and the facts described in the\nprovisional Regulation in recitals (123) and (125), the Commission will monitor\ndevelopments in order to take the necessary actions to ensure proper\nenforcement of measures. \n(158)\u00a0\u00a0 Other parties have argued\nthat measures should exclude volumes already subject to existing sales\ncontracts. This would in practice amount to an exemption of duties which would\nundermine the remedial effect of measures, and is therefore rejected. Reference\nis also made to recitals (138) and (139) above. \n(159)\u00a0\u00a0 The provisional Regulation\nimposed an anti-dumping duty in the form of a specific duty for each company\nresulting from the application of the injury elimination margin to the export\nprices used in the calculation of the dumping during the IP. This methodology\nis confirmed at the level of definitive measures.\n10.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Undertakings\n(160)\u00a0\u00a0 At a late stage in the\ninvestigation several exporting producers in the PRC offered price\nundertakings. These were not considered to be acceptable given the significant\nprice volatility of this product, the risk of duty avoidance and circumvention\nfor this product (see recitals (124) and (125) of the provisional Regulation),\nand the fact that no guarantees were contained in the offers on the part of the\nChinese authorities to allow for adequate monitoring in a context of companies\nnot having been granted market economy treatment.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 REGISTRATION\n(161)\u00a0\u00a0 Imports of the product\nconcerned were made subject to registration by Regulation 572/2012. That\nregistration should cease. The possibility of collecting retroactive duties\nwill be decided upon at a later stage, when full statistical data will be\navailable.\n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DISCLOSURE\n(162)\u00a0\u00a0 All parties were informed of\nthe essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to\nimpose a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of the product concerned\noriginating in the People's Republic of China. The parties were also granted a\nperiod within which they could make representations subsequent to the\ndisclosure. The parties who so requested were granted the opportunity to be\nheard. Two groups of importers requested and were afforded hearings in the\npresence of the Hearing Officer of the Directorate-General for Trade. \n(163)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the Xinshiji\njudgment, the arguments brought forward had already been analysed and addressed\nin the general disclosure document. None of these arguments led consequently to\nthe alteration of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which\nit was decided to confirm the injury margin determined in the original\ninvestigation. With regard to the analogue country judgement, a group of\nimporters repeated comments already made during the investigation regarding the\nscope of the partial reopening, the use of IP data and the determination of the\nnormal value. Those comments are addressed, respectively, in recitals (43),\n(46) and (54) above. The same group of importers expressed the view that they\nwere in favour of a system of safeguard measures with quotas instead of\nanti-dumping duties. The reason for rejecting a quota system is explained above\nin recital (156). Furthermore it should be noted that safeguard measures can\nonly be imposed in certain situations with very specific conditions, in\ncompliance with Council Regulation 260/2009 of 26 February 2009. It is\nconsidered that anti-dumping duties are the most appropriate way of addressing\ninjurious dumping. This group of importers also pointed out that, in relation with\nthe issues raised in recital (44) and (85) above, the Commission did not open\nan interim review when requested to do so. It is reiterated that, as of the\ndate of the analogue country judgement, it was no longer possible to conduct an\ninterim review, as there was no more duty in force. The Commission should\nresume the analysis of the pending request for interim review as of the date of\nentry into force of this Regulation. If the analysis of the request shows that\nthe conditions set out in Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation are respected,\nan interim review should be initiated as soon as possible.\n(164)\u00a0\u00a0 In summary, after having\nconsidered all the comments after disclosure to interested parties of the\nfindings of the investigation, it was concluded that none of them was of such a\nnature as to change the conclusions reached during the investigation.\n13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DURATION OF MEASURES\n(165)\u00a0\u00a0 In derogation of Article 11\n(2) of the basic Regulation, this Regulation shall expire 5 years after the\nentry into force of the original Regulation.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A
