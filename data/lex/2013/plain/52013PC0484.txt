(TFEU) makes a distinction between the powers which may be delegated\r\nto the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to\r\nsupplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act, as\r\nlaid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts), and the implementing powers\r\nwhich shall be conferred on the Commission where uniform conditions for\r\nimplementing legally binding Union acts are needed, as laid down in Article\r\n291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts).\nIn connection with the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and\r\ngeneral principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the\r\nCommission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers[1], the Commission has committed itself[2] to reviewing, in light of the criteria\r\nlaid down in the TFEU, and in particular in Article 290, legislative acts which\r\nwere not adapted to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny before the entry\r\ninto force of the Lisbon Treaty. \nIn the context of the alignment of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1365/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6\r\nSeptember 2006 on statistics of goods transport by inland waterways[3] to the new rules of the TFEU, implementing\r\npowers currently conferred upon the Commission by that Regulation should be\r\nprovided for by powers to adopt delegated and/or implementing acts.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\r\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThere was no need for consultation of\r\ninterested parties or for impact assessment. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nAs regards Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006, it\r\nis proposed to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts in order to adapt\r\nthe threshold for statistical coverage of inland waterways transport, to adapt\r\nthe definitions and adopt additional definitions, as well as to adopt delegated\r\nacts in order to adapt the data collection scope and the content of the Annexes.\r\n\nFurthermore, it is proposed to confer implementing\r\npowers on the Commission with a view to ensuring uniform conditions concerning\r\nthe arrangements for transmitting data to the Commission (Eurostat) including\r\ndata interchange standards and for the dissemination of results by the\r\nCommission (Eurostat), and to developing and publishing\r\nmethodological requirements and criteria designed to ensure the quality of the\r\ndata produced, in accordance with the examination\r\nprocedure laid down in Article\r\n5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. \n\u00b7      Legal basis\nArticle 338(1) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union. \n\u00b7      Choice of instrument\nRegulation (EU) of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council.

concerns an EEA matter and\r\nshould therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n2013/0226 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006 on\r\nstatistics of goods transport by inland waterways as regards conferring of\r\ndelegated and implementing powers upon the Commission for the adoption of\r\ncertain measures\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338 (1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the entry into force of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union (\"the Treaty\u201d), the powers conferred\r\nupon the Commission need to be aligned to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In connection with the\r\nadoption of Regulation (EU) No\r\n182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011\r\nlaying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control\r\nby Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers[4], the Commission has committed\r\nitself[5]\r\nto reviewing, in the light of\r\nthe criteria laid down in the Treaty,\r\nlegislative acts which were not adapted to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny\r\nbefore the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n1365/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on\r\nstatistics of goods transport by inland waterways[6] confers powers upon the\r\nCommission in order to implement some of the provisions of this Regulation. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of the\r\nalignment of Regulation (EC) No1365/2006\r\nto the new rules of the TFEU, implementing powers currently conferred upon the\r\nCommission should be provided for by powers to adopt delegated and implementing\r\nacts.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1365/2006, in order to take account of economic and technical trends, the\r\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be\r\ndelegated to the Commission concerning the adaptation of the threshold for\r\nstatistical coverage of inland waterways transport, adaptation of the\r\ndefinitions and the adoption of additional definitions. In addition, the\r\nCommission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in order to adapt the\r\ndata collection scope and the content of the Annexes. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\r\nensure that these delegated acts do not impose a significant additional\r\nadministrative burden on the Member States or on the respondent units.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is of particular importance\r\nthat the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory\r\nwork, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up\r\ndelegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\r\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the\r\nCouncil.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006, implementing\r\npowers should be conferred upon the Commission to adopt arrangements for\r\ntransmitting data including data interchange standards, for the dissemination\r\nof results by the Commission (Eurostat) and also to develop and publish\r\nmethodological requirements and criteria designed to ensure the quality of the\r\ndata produced. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation\r\n(EU) No 182/2011. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nprinciple of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the\r\nachievement of the basic objective of the alignment of the powers conferred\r\nupon the Commission to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty to lay down rules on\r\nsuch alignment in the domain of transport statistics. This Regulation does not\r\ngo beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective, in accordance\r\nwith Article 5(4) of the Treaty on the European Union.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure legal\r\ncertainty, it is necessary that the procedures for the adoption of measures\r\nwhich have been initiated but not completed before the entry into force of this\r\nRegulation are not affected by this Regulation.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n1365/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle\r\n1\nRegulation (EC) No 1365/2006 is amended as\r\nfollows:\n(1)                   \r\nIn Article 2, the following paragraph 5 is\r\nadded:\n'5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall be\r\nempowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 9, taking account\r\nof economic and technical trends, concerning the adaptation of the threshold\r\nfor statistical coverage of inland waterways transport.' \n(2)                   \r\nIn Article 3, the following subparagraph is\r\nadded:\n'The Commission shall be empowered to adopt\r\ndelegated acts in accordance with Article 9, taking account of economic and\r\ntechnical trends, concerning the adaptation of the definitions and the adoption\r\nof additional definitions.' \n(3)                   \r\nIn Article 4, the following paragraph 4 is\r\nadded:\n'4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with\r\nArticle 9, taking account of economic and technical\r\ntrends, concerning the adaptation of the data collection scope and the\r\ncontent of the Annexes.' \n(4)                   \r\nIn Article 5, paragraph 2 is replaced by the\r\nfollowing:\n'2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Arrangements\r\nfor transmitting data to the Commission (Eurostat), including data interchange\r\nstandards, shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the\r\nexamination procedure referred to in Article 10(2).'\n(5)                   \r\nIn Article 6, the following subparagraph is\r\nadded:\n'Arrangements for the\r\ndissemination of results shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with\r\nthe examination procedure referred to in Article 10(2).'\n(6)                   \r\nIn Article 7, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n'1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall adopt the methodological\r\nrequirements and criteria designed to ensure the quality of the data produced in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\r\n10(2).'\n(7)                   \r\nArticle 9 is replaced by the following: \n'Article\r\n9\r\nExercise of delegated powers\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The power to adopt delegated\r\nacts is conferred upon the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in\r\nthis Article.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When exercising the powers\r\ndelegated in Article 2(5), Article 3 and Article 4(4), the Commission shall\r\nensure that the delegated acts do not impose a significant additional\r\nadministrative burden on the Member States and on the respondents.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The power to adopt delegated\r\nacts referred to in Article 2(5), Article 3 and Article 4(4) shall be conferred\r\non the Commission for an indeterminate period of time from (Publication office\r\n: please insert the exact date of the entry into force of the amending\r\nRegulation).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The delegation of power referred\r\nto in Article 2(5), Article 3 and Article 4(4) may be revoked at any time by\r\nthe European Parliament or by the Council.\nA decision to revoke shall put an end to\r\nthe delegation of the power specified in that decision.
