On the basis of that agreement, the EU-Morocco European Neighbourhood\nPolicy (ENP) Action Plan was approved by both sides in July 2005 for a period\nof five years.\nWithin this framework, EU-Morocco relations\nhave developed and matured substantially. The adoption of the joint document on\nadvanced status in October 2008[1]\ngave a further impetus to these relations and marked a significant deepening in\nthe areas of political relations, security, economics, trade and various\nsectors, and in people-to-people contacts.\nWhen the current ENP Action Plan expired in\nJuly 2010, it was deemed appropriate to negotiate and conclude a new Action\nPlan, based on the objectives and ambitions of the joint document on advanced\nstatus. However, pending the conclusion of the new Action Plan, both sides\nagreed to continue to apply the 2005 Action Plan.\nEU-Morocco relations are set against the\nbackground of a region where the overall political situation has been in a\nstate of flux since early 2011.\nThe Joint Communication to the Parliament\nand the Council entitled \u2018A new response to a changing neighbourhood\u2019 outlined\na new approach which aims at a higher level of differentiation, allowing each\npartner to develop its links with the EU based on its own aspirations, needs\nand capacities, but also on mutual accountability and the degree of commitment\nto the universal values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and the\ncapacity to implement jointly agreed priorities. This new Action Plan clearly\noutlines the priority objectives of the EU-Morocco special partnership while\ntaking full account of the advanced status and of the comprehensiveness of\nEU-Morocco relations.\nThe European External Action Service (EEAS), in\nclose cooperation with the European Commission and EU Member States, has held\nexploratory talks with Morocco which have resulted in an agreement on the draft\nAction Plan, including the list of priority measures to be carried out under\nthe Plan. At the last EU-Morocco Association\nCouncil on 23 April 2012 both sides noted that they were close to an agreement,\nwhich was then reached in November 2012. The finalisation of technical consultations on each side was notified\nthrough an exchange of letters on 28 November 2012 (EEAS) and 10 January 2013\n(Morocco).\nThe new EU-Morocco Action Plan implementing\nthe advanced status (2013-2017) will be an essential point of reference that\nwill guide our bilateral relations with Morocco in the coming years and thus\nprovide a road map for a deeper association between Morocco and the EU. The ENP\nwill continue to act as a catalyst by providing a single policy framework,\nbased inter alia on partnership, joint ownership, performance-driven\ndifferentiation and tailor-made assistance.\nThe European Commission and the High\nRepresentative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy ('High\nRepresentative') attach hereto the text of a joint proposal for a Council\nDecision on the position to be taken by the European Union within the\nEU-Morocco Association Council on the adoption of a recommendation on the\nimplementation of the Action Plan.\nThe European Commission and the High\nRepresentative therefore request the Council to adopt the attached joint\nproposal for a Council Decision.\n2013/0107 (NLE)\nJoint Proposal for a\nCOUNCIL

[...]\nFor the Association Council\nThe President\nANNEX\n\nEUROPEAN\nNEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY\nDRAFT\nMOROCCO ACTION PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADVANCED STATUS (2013-2017)\nI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\nThe European neighbourhood policy (ENP) sets ambitious goals based\non shared responsibility and the acceptance of mutually recognised common\nvalues such as democracy, the rule of law, good governance, respect for human\nrights, market economics, free trade, sustainable development, poverty\nreduction and the implementation of political, economic and institutional\nreforms. The establishment of an area of peace\nand stability, including crisis management and the prevention and resolution of\nconflicts in the region, also form part of the ENP. Morocco\nshares these values and principles, which underlie the formulation of its\nnational and international policies. \nThe EU-Morocco partnership, which started\nwith the 1969 Trade Agreement, reached a turning-point with the Association\nAgreement signed in 1996, then with the ENP. They have helped to strengthen\npolitical, economic and trade ties and resulted in the sustained development of\nhuman and cultural exchanges. On the basis of the Association Agreement,\nrelations between Morocco and the EU have gradually and steadily grown into a\ngenuine EU\u2011Morocco partnership, making Morocco one of the EU\u2019s leading\npartners. \nThe adoption in October 2008 of the joint\ndocument on reinforcing bilateral relations/advanced status marked the start of\na new phase in bilateral relations. This document strengthens the key\npartnership between the EU and Morocco by setting ambitious new goals for\ndeeper political, economic and human relations. The EU-Morocco summit in\nGranada in March 2010 confirmed these goals by underlining the special nature\nof the EU-Morocco partnership. Today, on the basis of the very advanced status\nof their relations, the two sides are seeking to further strengthen this\nexemplary and mutually beneficial partnership in order to confront shared\npolitical, economic and social challenges together and in a spirit of\nsolidarity.\nProgress towards good governance and\npolitical and socioeconomic reforms are common principles for implementing the\nadvanced status. The partnership requires a stronger commitment to the\nintroduction of the major reforms instigated by Morocco and to their extension\nboth in the political sphere, principally in the areas of democracy, human\nrights and the rule of law, and in the economic and social spheres, in\nparticular with a view to tangible progress on human development. The level of\nEU support will be adapted to Morocco's goals and progress on the reforms it\nhas embarked on, and to the country\u2019s needs and capacities. The EU and Morocco\nwill continue to work towards that end, which is in keeping with Morocco\u2019s new\nConstitution adopted on 1 July 2011 and with the new EU strategy developed in\nthe context of the partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the\nsouthern Mediterranean.\nThe EU recognises that, for Morocco,\nrapprochement with the EU represents a fundamental foreign policy choice. Its aim is to move as close as possible to the EU\nin order to underpin and support its drive towards political modernisation, an\nopen economy and social cohesion. Morocco also sees this goal as the best way\nof promoting its alignment and coordination with the EU on strategic issues of\ncommon interest. Both sides consider that the benefits of such a process will\nbe magnified by regional integration in the Maghreb and reiterate their desire\nto work together to give this movement fresh impetus. Moreover, in accordance\nwith Article 8 of the EU Treaty and with Morocco\u2019s hopes of reaching a new\nagreement governing reciprocal relations, the two sides agree to further\nreflection on the possible nature and form of such an agreement. \nThe EU-Morocco ENP Action Plan has made for\na more targeted implementation of the instruments provided for in the\nAssociation Agreement and supported Morocco's objective of bringing its\neconomic and social structures more into line with those of the Union. \nThe new Action\nPlan for implementing the advanced status represents a key step in the ongoing\nprocess of strengthening relations between Morocco and the EU in which all the\ntools, mechanisms and instruments of the advanced status will be brought into\naction.\nThis instrument\nwill encourage the development and implementation of policies and measures to\npromote the consolidation of the rule of law, democracy and human rights,\neconomic growth, employment and social cohesion, poverty reduction and\nprotection of the environment, thereby contributing in the long term to\nsustainable development. Implementation\nof the new instrument will take account of the necessary balance between\nspeeding up the process of opening and modernising the Moroccan economy and the\nimperative of sustainable socioeconomic development.\nBoth sides will in addition continue\nimplementation of economic integration by opening negotiations on a deep and\ncomprehensive free trade agreement. These negotiations will further the\nsectoral negotiations that have already been completed or those that are still\nin progress, particularly on liberalising trade in services and establishment,\nand will examine ways of improving on a reciprocal basis the preferential\nconcessions adopted under the free trade agreement on agricultural products,\nprocessed agricultural products and fishery products, in the light of the\nspecific circumstances of each party.\nThe new instrument\nis an amalgam of the former Action Plan and the joint document on the advanced\nstatus. It includes the reforms agreed and the\nmeasures provided for in the Action Plan that have yet to be implemented, and\nthe new features contained in the joint document. Also,\nin line with Morocco\u2019s reform programme, the new instrument reflects the\nprinciples of differentiation and ownership. By\nrequiring the Moroccan government to introduce a strategy of regulatory\nalignment based on an evaluation of the existing differences, the establishment\nof priorities for convergence and an implementation timetable, the new document\nputs the advanced status roadmap on an operational footing. This strategy will be underpinned by the EU\u2019s\nsupport programmes.\nThe instrument\nprovides, amongst other things, for a gradual, phased process for bringing\nMoroccan legislation into line with the Community acquis with a view to the\nMoroccan economy's gradual integration into the EU internal market and\npromotion of trade, investment and growth. Both\nparties accordingly undertake to begin a systematic analysis of the differences\nbetween Moroccan legislation and the European acquis based on the references\nindicated in the Action Plan. An evaluation of the priorities and means\nrequired to ensure convergence will be carried out for each sector in the\nAction Plan. Regulatory approximation may consist of (i) the gradual full\nadoption of the acquis in certain sectors in the short or long term, (ii) the\ntransposal of part of the acquis, or (iii) the adoption of the main principles\nof the acquis or of best practices in a given field. At the end of the first\ntwo years of the Action Plan, the Moroccan government will adopt a national\nprogramme of regulatory convergence with the EU designed to establish the\npriorities, the scope and the pace of such a process, as requested in the\nKing\u2019s speech from the throne in 2010.\nThe\nnew Action Plan will provide a framework for programming, implementing and\nmonitoring EU aid, taking account of the needs expressed and intermediate\nresults achieved. Resources will be made available by Morocco and the EU for\nthe implementation of the priorities agreed. In\nthe EU\u2019s case, the aid will mainly be provided through national indicative\nprogrammes agreed with Morocco, which will set out the aid priorities and the\nindicative financial package. This aid will be\ndelivered in strict compliance with the relevant rules and procedures for the\nimplementation of EU external aid.\nA variety of instruments may be used to\nimplement the EU\u2019s aid to Morocco, including those resulting from the\ndiscussions on the new strategy for ENP countries. These\ninclude exchanges of advice, technical assistance, best practice and know-how,\nsupport for capacity\u2011and institution-building, support for sectoral\nreform, support for promoting integration and social and economic cohesion and\nlessening the development gap between regions, and support to civil society.\nLoans from European financial institutions\nwill also play a key role in the implementation of the new Action Plan. The\nNeighbourhood Investment Facility and the Facility for Euro\u2011Mediterranean\nInvestment and Partnership (FEMIP), financed by the EU, should provide\nsubstantial leverage in the implementation of loans for the construction of\ninfrastructure, development and partnership with the private sector. This will\nenable, inter alia, the full mobilisation of the European Investment\nBank funds guaranteed under FEMIP.\nThe parties have also agreed to examine\ntogether how best to use the new instruments for implementing financial\ncooperation, for instance those introduced in the light of the new strategy for\nENP countries, and how to access adequate means of funding to support Morocco\nas it embarks on these reforms and its rapprochement with the EU. This is done with the aim of improving efficiency\nand enhancing the degree of integration that Morocco and the EU can achieve. \nThe implementation of the Action Plan\ncovers a period of five years (2013-2017). Particular attention will be paid to\nthe priority measures identified in the table which forms an integral part of\nthe Action Plan (see Annex III). During implementation, the two parties may\nadjust the Plan to new priorities of the Moroccan government and/or of the EU\nwithout the need to adopt a new one. \nThe introduction of reforms in several key\nsectors will require the setting of clear targets to be set and the\navailability of adequate means. The Association Committee and the subcommittees\nset up under the Association Agreement will ensure regular monitoring of the\nimplementation of the Action Plan, particularly in terms of the progress\nachieved and support provided. Either party may also prepare progress reports.\nCivil society should contribute actively to monitoring.\nThe Action Plan forms part of the process\nof implementing the advanced status and marks an important step in developing\nrelations between the two parties into a special partnership.\nThe ad hoc Advanced Status Group will\ncontinue its deliberations on this basis with a view to formulating new\nperspectives for the new partnership and identifying its scope, instruments and\npurpose.\nII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Action
