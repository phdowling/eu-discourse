Latvia substantially amended this request via\na letter registered with the Commission on 27 August 2012. In accordance with\nArticle 395(2) of the VAT Directive, the Commission informed the other Member\nStates by letter dated 26 November 2012 of the request made by Latvia. By letter 30 November 2012, the Commission notified Latvia that it had all the\ninformation it considered necessary for appraisal of the request.\nGeneral context\nArticles 168 and 168a of the VAT Directive provide\nthat a taxable person is entitled to deduct the VAT charged on purchases made\nfor the purpose of taxed transactions. Article 26(1)(a) of the same Directive\nrequires the use of goods forming part of the assets of a business for private\npurposes to be a supply of services for consideration if the VAT on the goods\nwas eligible for deduction. This system allows for the recovery of initially\ndeducted VAT in relation to the private use.\nIn the case of passenger cars, this system\nis difficult to apply, in particular because it is difficult to identify the\nsplit between private and business use. Where records are kept, they add an\nadditional burden to both the business and the administration in maintaining\nand checking them; even in case Latvia would make use of the option provided\nfor in Article 168a(2) of the VAT Directive to limit the deduction on\nexpenditure related to company cars to the proportion of the taxable person's\neffective business use.\nTherefore, Latvia has requested to be\nallowed to restrict the right of deduction at a set percentage of the initial\ndeduction and in turn to relieve the business from accounting for tax on the\nprivate use. This has the benefit of simplifying the system for all concerned\nand prevents, at the same time, tax evasion or avoidance because of incorrect\nrecord keeping.\nOn the basis of information provided by Latvia, it appears that, on average, 20% of the use of business passenger cars is for\nprivate purposes. The percentage restriction should therefore be set at 20%.\nThe new system will apply to all passenger\ncars with a maximum of eight seats and under a certain weight that are not used\nexclusively for business purposes. However, passenger cars which are used for\ncertain specific activities would be excluded from the restriction on the right\nto deduct and would be treated under the normal rules: cars purchased for\nresale, hire or lease; cars used for transportation of passengers (such as\ntaxis) or goods; cars used for driving lessons; cars used for guard or\nemergency services; cars used as car sales demonstration vehicle.\nOn 29 October 2004, the Commission\npresented a proposal for a Council Directive that includes a harmonisation of\nthe categories of expenses for which Member States may apply exclusions to the\nright to deduct (the so-called VAT simplification proposal (COM(2004)728 final)).\nAs expenses in relation to passenger cars are included in this proposal, any\nextension in the period of validity should not go beyond adoption and entry\ninto force of the proposed Directive. The derogation should in any case be\nlimited to 31 December 2015 if the proposed Directive has not come into force\nby that date, in order to be able to assess whether the 20% restriction is still\na correct reflection of the overall apportionment between business and private\nuse. Any extension request should be accompanied by a report which includes a\nreview of the percentage applied and should be sent to the Commission with that\nrequest by 31 March 2015.\nExisting provisions in the area of the\nproposal\nSimilar derogations in relation to right of\ndeduction have been granted to other Member States.\nArticle 176 of Directive 2006/112/EC\nstipulates that the Council shall determine the expenditure on which the VAT is\nnot deductible. Until such time, it authorises Member States to maintain\nexclusions which were in place on 1 January 1979. There are therefore a number\nof \"stand still\" provisions restricting the right to deduct in\nrelation to passenger cars.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nNot relevant.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThe Decision proposal aims in the first\nplace at simplifying the collecting of VAT in relation to passenger cars partly\nused for non-business purposes and has therefore a potential positive impact.\nAt the same time, tax evasion via incorrect record keeping is countered.\nHowever, because of the narrow scope of the\nderogation and the limited application in time, the impact will in any case be\nlimited.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nAuthorisation for Latvia to restrict the right of deduction to 80% of VAT incurred on expenditure in relation\nto business passenger cars not exclusively used for business purposes. Where\nthat right to deduct has been limited, the taxable person is relieved from\naccounting for VAT on the private use of the car.\nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive.\nSubsidiarity principle\nIn accordance with Article 395 of the VAT\nDirective, a Member State wishing to introduce measures derogating from the\nsaid Directive must obtain an authorisation from the Council, which will take\nthe form of a Council Decision. Therefore, the proposal complies with the\nsubsidiarity principle.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle for the following reason(s).\nThe Decision concerns an authorisation\ngranted to a Member State upon its own request and does not constitute any\nobligation.\nGiven the limited scope of the derogation,\nthe special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued.\nChoice of instruments\nUnder Article 395 of the VAT Directive,\nderogation from the common VAT rules is only possible with the authorisation of\nthe Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission. Moreover, a\nCouncil Decision is the most suitable instrument since it can be addressed to\nindividual Member States.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\nunion budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nReview/revision/sunset clause\nThe proposal includes a sunset clause.\n2013/0043 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nauthorising Latvia to introduce a special\nmeasure derogating from Article 26(1)(a) and Articles 168 and 168a of Directive\n2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Directive\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax[1], and in particular Article\n395(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letters registered at\nthe Commission on 17 June 2011 and 27 August 2012, Latvia requested\nauthorisation to derogate from the provisions of Directive 2006/112/EC\ngoverning the right to deduct input tax in relation to passenger cars.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission informed\nthe other Member States by letter dated 26 November 2012 of the request made by\n  Latvia. By letter dated 30 November 2012, the Commission notified Latvia that it had all the information it considered necessary for appraisal of the\nrequest.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Articles 168 and 168a of\nDirective 2006/112/EC establish a taxable person's right to deduct value added\ntax (VAT) charged on supplies of goods and services received by him for the use\nof his taxed transactions. Article 26(1)(a) of that Directive contains a\nrequirement to account for VAT when a business asset is put to non-business use.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The non-business use is\noften very difficult to identify accurately and even where it is possible, the\nmechanism for doing so is often burdensome. Under the requested authorisation,\nthe amount of VAT on expenditure eligible for deduction in respect of passenger\ncars which are not used entirely for business purposes should, with some\nexceptions, be set at a flat percentage rate. Based on information provided by Latvia, a rate of 80% is justifiable. At the same time, in order to avoid double taxation,\nthe requirement of accounting for VAT on the non-business use of passenger cars\nshould be suspended where they have been subject to limitation authorised by\nthis Decision. This simplification measure removes the need to keep records on private\nuse of business cars and, at the same time, prevents tax evasion through incorrect\nrecord keeping.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The limitation of the\nright of deduction under the authorisation should apply to VAT paid on the purchase,\nleasing, intra-Community acquisition and importation of specified passenger\ncars and on expenditure related thereto, including the purchase of fuel.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The authorisation should\nonly apply to passenger cars with a maximum authorised weight not exceeding\n3500 kilograms and having not more than eight seats in addition to the driver's\nseat. Any non-business use of passenger cars exceeding 3500 kilograms or having\nmore than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat is negligible due to\ntheir nature or the type of business they are used for. A detailed list of\nspecific passenger cars excluded from that authorisation should also be\nprovided, based on their particular use.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 29 October 2004, the\nCommission adopted a Proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive\n77/388/EEC with a view to simplifying value added tax obligations[2]. Directive 77/388/EEC has in\nthe meanwhile been replaced by Directive 2006/112/EC. That proposal includes\nthe harmonisation of the categories of expenses for which exclusions of the\nright of deduction may apply. Under that proposal, exclusions to the right to\ndeduct may be applied to motorised road vehicles. It is therefore appropriate\nto restrict the application period of this Decision until that Directive comes\ninto force. However, it is necessary to provide for a specific expiry date of the\nauthorisation if that Directive has not come into force by that date, as it is\nnecessary to review this authorisation and the percentage of overall\napportionment between business and private use.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where Latvia would consider that an extension of the authorisation beyond 2015 is necessary, it\nshould submit to the Commission a report which includes a review of the percentage\napplied together with the request for the extension no later than 30 March 2015.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogation will only\nhave a negligible effect on the overall amount of tax revenue collected at the\nstage of final consumption and will have no adverse impact on the Union's own\nresources accruing from VAT,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nBy way of derogation from Articles 168 and\n168a of Directive 2006/112/EC, Latvia is authorised to limit to 80% the right\nto deduct the value added tax (VAT) on expenditure on passenger cars not wholly\nused for business purposes.\nArticle 2\nBy way of derogation from point (a) of Article\n26(1) of Directive 2006/112/EC, Latvia shall not treat as supplies of services\nfor consideration the use for private purposes of a passenger car included in\nthe assets of a taxable person's business, where that car has been subject to a\nlimitation authorised under Article 1 of this Decision.\nArticle 3\nThe expenditure referred to in Article 1 shall\ncover the purchase, leasing, intra-Community acquisition and importation of\nsuch cars as well as expenditure related to the maintenance, repair and fuel.\nArticle 4\nArticles 1 and 2 shall only apply to\npassenger cars with a maximum authorised weight not exceeding 3500 kilograms\nand having not more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat.\nArticle 5\nArticles 1 and 2 shall not apply to the\nfollowing categories of passenger cars:\n(a) cars purchased for resale, hire or lease;\n(b) cars used for transportation of\npassengers for a fee, including taxi services;\n(c) cars used for the provision of\ntransportation of goods;\n(d) cars used for the provision of driving\nlessons;\n(e) cars used for the provision of guard\nservices;\n(f) cars used as an emergency vehicle;\n(g) cars used as a car sales demonstration\nvehicle.\nArticle 6\nAny request for the extension of the authorisation\nprovided for in this Decision shall be submitted to the Commission by 30 March\n2015.\nAny request for extension of that authorisation\nshall be accompanied by a report which includes a review of the percentage set\nout in Article 1.\nArticle 7\nThis Decision shall expire on the date of\nentry into force of Union rules determining the expenditure relating to\nmotorised road vehicles that is not eligible for full deduction of VAT, or on\n31 December 2015, whichever is the earlier.\nArticle 8\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Latvia.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2004) 728 final\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
