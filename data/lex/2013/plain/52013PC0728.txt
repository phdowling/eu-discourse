However, Article 15(7) provides for the possibility of\r\nre-examining this provision by common accord.\nFurther to a request from the PLO, in 2010\r\nthe Commission proposed extending the application period of this provision\r\nuntil 31 December 2012[2].\r\nHowever, the EU\u2011PLO Joint Committee never adopted that\r\ndecision. On 6 December 2012 the PLO requested in writing a further\r\nfour-year extension of the application period of this provision. \nIn accordance with Article 39 of Protocol\r\nNo 3, the provisions of the Protocol may be amended by decision of the Joint\r\nCommittee.\nThe text of the decision will amend the\r\nexisting provision laid down in Article 15(7). \nThe parties have agreed to extend by six\r\nyears the application period of Article 15(7) with effect from 1 January\r\n2010 in order to provide clarity, long-term economic predictability and legal\r\ncertainty for economic operators, to ensure consistency with similar\r\nrequests from other Mediterranean countries and to establish the period\r\ncovered by the Commission proposal following the PLO's initial request.\nPending formal adoption of the present\r\ndecision, it was agreed, in the Pan\u2011Euro\u2011Med working group,\r\nthat this decision will apply from 1 January 2010.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe parties concerned have been consulted\r\nin the Pan-Euro-Med working group and the Customs Code Committee's Origin\r\nSection.\nNo recourse to external expertise has been\r\nnecessary.\nIt has not been necessary to conduct an\r\nimpact assessment, since the proposed amendments are technical in nature and do\r\nnot affect the substance of the protocol on rules of origin currently in\r\neffect.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe amended provision on drawback of duties\r\nshould apply retroactively from 1 January 2010.\nThe legal basis for the amendment of this\r\nprovision is the first subparagraph of Article 207(4) in conjunction with\r\nArticle 218(9) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union.
