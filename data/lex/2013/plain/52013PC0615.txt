In Europe, around 22% of short-term debt securities issued either\r\nby governments or by the corporate sector are held by MMFs. MMFs hold 38% of\r\nshort-term debt issued by the banking sector.\nOn the demand side, MMFs offer a short-term\r\ncash management tool that provides a high degree of liquidity, diversification,\r\nstability of value combined with a market-based yield. MMFs are mainly used by\r\ncorporations seeking to invest their excess cash for a short time frame, for\r\nexample until a major expenditure, such as the payroll, is due. \nMMFs, therefore, represent a crucial link\r\nbringing together demand and offer for short-term money. With assets under\r\nmanagement of around 1000 billion Euros, MMFs represent a category of funds\r\nthat is distinct from all other mutual funds. The majority of MMFs, around 80%\r\nof the assets and 60% of the funds, operate under the rules of the Directive\r\n2009/65/EC on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities\r\n(UCITS). The rest of MMFs should been operating, since July 2013, under the\r\nrules of the Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM) Directive 2011/61/EU.\r\nThe average size of a MMF by far exceeds the average size of a UCITS fund. For\r\nexample, an individual MMF can reach the size of \u20ac50 billion. MMFs are\r\ndomiciled in a few Member states with FR, IE and LU representing more than 95%\r\nof the market. The market is nevertheless highly interconnected with other\r\ncountries due to the high proportion of cross border investments and investors,\r\nand the cross border contagion links between the MMF and their sponsor, in the\r\npreponderance of cases domiciled in a country different from the domicile of\r\nthe MMF. \nBecause of the systemic interconnectedness\r\nof MMFs with the banking sector on the one hand and with corporate and\r\ngovernment finance, on the other hand, the operation of MMFs has been at the\r\ncore of the international work on shadow banking. The Financial Stability Board\r\n(FSB) and other institutions, such as the International Organisation of\r\nSecurities Commissions (IOSCO) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) have\r\nanalysed the financial sector and concluded that certain activities and\r\nentities were of systemic importance but had not been addressed by regulators\r\nto a sufficient degree. In the asset management sector, MMFs were singled as\r\nsystemically relevant. The European Parliament adopted a resolution on shadow banking\r\nin November 2012 where it invites the Commission to submit a proposal with\r\nparticular focus on the MMF issue[1].\r\n\nThe ESRB provided a sound analysis of the\r\nsystemic risks inherent in the operation of MMFs. In particular, its\r\nrecommendations pertained to the stability and the liquidity of MMFs and also\r\ncontain additional transparency and reporting rules. Those recommendations have\r\nbeen largely reflected in the Commission's proposal while taking into account\r\nalso their possible negative impacts on the financing of the European economy.\nMMFs represent a convenient tool for\r\ninvestors because they offer features analogous to bank deposits: instantaneous\r\naccess to liquidity and relative stability of value. In light of these\r\ncharacteristics, investors view MMFs as a safe and more diversified alternative\r\nto bank deposits. But in reality the MMFs are classic investment funds with the\r\ninherent market risks attached to any fund investment. Therefore when the\r\nprices of the assets in which the MMFs are invested in start to decrease,\r\nespecially during stressed market conditions, a MMF cannot always maintain the\r\npromise to redeem immediately and to preserve the value of the unit or share\r\nissued by the MMF to investors. Some fund sponsors (mostly banks) may be able\r\nto \u2018prop up\u2019 share values by granting sponsor support, while others (mostly\r\nasset managers) may not have the capital to do so. Due to the maturity mismatch\r\nbetween the daily liquidity that an MMF offers to investors and the liquidity\r\nof assets held in the MMF portfolio, immediate redemption might not always be\r\npossible. The promise of stable redemption prices is often underlined by an AAA\r\nrating. The downside is that investors, as soon as they perceive a risk that\r\nthe MMFs may fail to live up the promise of liquidity and stable redemptions at\r\nany time, will redeem, possibly leading to a so-called investor\r\n\"run\".\nInvestor runs are characterized by massive\r\nand sudden redemption requests by a large group of investors aiming to avoid\r\nlosses and be able to redeem at the highest possible price. Investor runs are\r\nsystemically relevant as they force MMFs to sell their assets rapidly in order\r\nto meet outstanding redemption requests. The spiral of redemptions itself\r\naccelerates the decline in the fund's net asset value (NAV), thus exacerbating\r\ndeclines in the NAV and the fear that the money market as a whole is unstable.\r\nBecause MMFs play a central role in the short term funding of entities like\r\nbanks, corporations or governments, investor runs on MMFs may cause broader macroeconomic\r\nconsequences. While banks account for the largest part (85%) of the 1000\r\nbillion EUR of financial instruments issued to MMFs, governments represent a\r\nshare of around 10% whereas corporates account for roughly 5%. Governments and\r\nvery large corporates use the money market as a means to obtain short term\r\nfinancing, alongside bank credit lines.\nThe problems linked to investor runs are of\r\na systemic nature due to: (1) MMFs close links to the real economy (the role\r\nthat MMFs play in satisfying the short-term financing needs of entities using\r\nthe money market as a funding tool), (2) their link to sponsors. In addition,\r\nruns on MMFs also have an investor protection angle, since those that redeem\r\nlate (usually private investors) are at an inherent disadvantage when compared\r\nto early redeemers.\nThe proposed Regulation addresses these\r\nproblems. It introduces common standards to increase the liquidity of MMFs as\r\nwell as to ensure the stability of their structure. Uniform rules will be\r\nintroduced to ensure a minimum level of daily and weekly liquid assets. A\r\nstandardized policy will be established to permit the fund manager to gain a\r\nbetter understanding of its investor base. Common rules are also introduced to\r\nguarantee that MMFs invest in high quality and well diversified assets of good\r\ncredit quality. These measures shall ensure that the liquidity of the fund is\r\nadequate to face investors\u2019 redemption requests.\nThe stability of the MMF will be ensured\r\nthrough the creation of clear and harmonized valuation rules for the assets in\r\nwhich the MMFs invest in. These valuation rules will restore the evident truth\r\nthat MMFs are normal mutual funds whose investment assets are subject to price\r\nfluctuations. \nCertain MMFs will have the possibility to\r\nmaintain the accounting methodology permitting a stable subscription and\r\nredemption price on condition that they build up appropriate cash reserves.\r\nThis so-called \u201cNAV buffer\u201d shall serve to absorb the market movements inherent\r\nin the capital markets. This should also prevent that sponsors be unprepared\r\nshould their MMFs require external support. The buffer will amount to 3% of the\r\nassets under management of the MMF. According to the observed events of sponsor\r\nsupport during the crisis (123 instances on US MMFs), only 3 times the support\r\nwas higher than 3%. When the Reserve Primary Fund defaulted in 2008, it lost 3%\r\non 1.5% exposure to Lehman assets. The buffer will not provide a full guarantee\r\nto the holders of CNAV shares but the level strikes the balance between the\r\nneed to have a robust and safe CNAV model and the financing capacities of the\r\nmanagers. The costs for the MMF will depend on the financing costs of each\r\nmanager. These costs may vary between 3% and 10% annually. Applied to a buffer\r\nof 3%, this would result in an increase of the management fees of 0.09% to\r\n0.30% annually. It is expected that a portion of this cost increase will be\r\npaid by the manager while the rest will be passed on to the investors. The fee\r\nincrease will have an impact on the yield that investors can achieve in\r\ninvesting in MMFs but on the other hand they will benefit from a product with\r\nan additional layer of insulation against market movements in the underlying\r\nassets.\nIn addition to these provisions, a common\r\nrule on rating will ensure that fund managers and investors stop relying on\r\nexternal credit ratings that could be detrimental to the functioning of the\r\nmoney market when downgrades occur. These measures will be accompanied by\r\nincreased transparency requirements to ensure that the investor correctly\r\nunderstands the risk and reward profile of its investment.\nThe proposed regulation will rely on the\r\nexisting authorisation procedures for UCITS which are harmonised by the UCITS\r\nDirective. It will introduce a harmonised authorisation procedure for AIF MMFs,\r\nas the AIFM Directive leaves authorisation of AIFs at the discretion of Member\r\nStates. The harmonised procedure for AIF MMFs will mirror the harmonised\r\nauthorisation procedure foreseen for UCITS. Managers will continue to be\r\nregulated by either the UCITS or AIFM Directive but managers and funds falling\r\nunder the scope of this Regulation will have to comply with this additional\r\nlayer of specific MMF product rules.\nThese uniform rules intend to safeguard the\r\nintegrity of the internal market and increase its robustness to minimise the\r\neffects of a new crisis. Investors will gain awareness over the risks attached\r\nto these regulated products and certainty about the homogenous investment\r\nproposition associated with money market funds in the Union. Managers will\r\nbenefit from harmonized product rules all over Europe. Issuers of money market\r\ninstruments will profit from a more stable environment that will preserve the role\r\nof MMFs as a financing tool. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation with\r\ninterested parties\nAs of the beginning of 2012 the Commission\r\nhas engaged in extensive consultation with representatives from a wide range of\r\norganizations. The interaction has taken the form of bilateral and multilateral\r\nmeetings, one public consultation on shadow banking, one public consultation on\r\nasset management issues including MMFs and a public conference on shadow\r\nbanking. Through this process the Commission has obtained a wealth of\r\ninformation about the functioning of the MMF market and its various segments,\r\nas well as views on the issues to be solved and how to solve them. \n2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Green paper on shadow\r\nbanking\nThe responses to the Green Paper offered a\r\nbroad picture of the European shadow banking sector. This allowed for the\r\ndevelopment of more targeted questions specific to the operation of MMFs in a public\r\nconsultation on asset management that was launched in July 2012. A public\r\nconference in April 2012, attended by stakeholders from the EU and the US, also contained a section devoted to MMFs. Representatives from the regulatory and\r\nindustry sides, forming the panel on MMFs, presented their views on the need to\r\nreform the EU MMF market. \n2.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation on asset\r\nmanagement \nA MMF chapter has been introduced in a\r\nbroader public consultation on various asset management issues published on 26\r\nJuly 2012 (this consultation closed on 18 October 2012). The Commission\r\nservices received 56 responses related to the MMF section. \n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nIn line with its policy on \"better\r\nregulation\", the Commission conducted an impact assessment examining\r\nvarious policy alternatives. In order to ensure the liquidity and the stability\r\nof MMFs, a total of 16 options were analysed. All these options were analysed\r\nagainst the general objectives, namely to enhance the financial stability in\r\nthe single market and to increase the protection of MMF investors, but also\r\nagainst the more specific objectives of this initiative: (i) to prevent the\r\nrisk of contagion to the real economy, (ii) to prevent the risk of contagion to\r\nthe sponsor and, (iii) to reduce the disadvantages for late redeemers,\r\nespecially with respect to redemptions in stressed market conditions.\nThe impacts including the costs and\r\nbenefits on the various stakeholders, investors, asset managers, issuers of\r\nshort term debt, sponsors were analysed. Such analysis concluded in favour of\r\nthe creation of a more robust framework for MMFs: increased liquidity levels\r\nand more stable structure. The impact of the preferred options is expected to\r\nbenefit the MMFs and the money market in general by improving their resilience\r\nagainst stressed market conditions. This shall result in a more stable money\r\nmarket environment in Europe that will profit to investors, issuers of short\r\nterm debt and banks sponsoring MMFs.\nDG MARKT services met the Impact Assessment\r\nBoard on 16 January 2013. The Board analysed this Impact Assessment and\r\ndelivered its positive opinion on 18 January 2013. During the meeting the\r\nmembers of the Board provided DG MARKT services with comments to improve the\r\ncontent of the Impact Assessment that led to some changes to the final draft.\r\nThe problem definition has been improved to provide greater detail on the MMF\r\nmarkets and its description was enriched with further examples in the Union illustrating, in particular, the cross-border dimension of the problems. The\r\nobjectives and the options with the identified problems have been better linked\r\nand more quantifiable operational objectives have been used. The impacts on\r\ninvestors as well as the compliance costs that the envisaged measures would\r\nentail have been explained in more detail. The impacts on Member States and on\r\ninternational regulatory coherence have also been better described. Finally the\r\nstakeholder\u2019s views, in particular in the sections analysing and comparing the\r\noptions, have been systematically introduced.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis and choice of\r\nthe legal form\nArticle 114(1) TFEU provides the legal\r\nbasis for a Regulation creating uniform provisions aimed at the functioning of\r\nthe internal market. Prudential product rules establish the limits of the risks\r\nlinked to MMFs. As such, they do not regulate access to asset management\r\nactivities but govern the way such activities are carried out in order to\r\nensure investor protection and financial stability. They underpin the correct\r\nand safe functioning of the internal market.\nIn pursuit of the objective of the internal\r\nmarket integrity the proposed legislative measure will create a regulatory\r\nframework for MMFs in view of ensuring an increased protection of investors in\r\nMMFs, as well as enhancing financial stability by preventing contagion risk.\r\nThe proposed provisions will specifically target to ensure that the liquidity\r\nof the fund is adequate to face investor redemption requests and to render the\r\nstructure of MMFs safe enough to withstand adverse market conditions. A Regulation\r\nis considered to be the most appropriate legal instrument to introduce uniform\r\nrequirements that will deal, amongst others with the scope of eligible assets,\r\nwith diversification rules, rules related to exposures to credit, interest rate\r\nand liquidity risks, as well as rules regarding the authorisation of the funds\r\nintending to engage in money market investment. These are essentially prudential\r\nproduct rules that aim to render the European MMFs more secure and efficient,\r\nmitigating hereto related systemic risk concerns.\nThe taking up of activities as fund manager\r\nis regulated either by the UCITS Directive or by the AIFM Directive. The\r\nactivities of the managers will continue to be subject to AIFMD and UCITS\r\nDirective but the product rules contained under UCITS framework will be\r\nsupplemented by the product rules contained in this new Regulation. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality\nNational regulatory approaches are\r\ninherently limited to the Member State in question. Regulating the product and\r\nliquidity profile of a MMF at national level only entails a risk of different\r\nproducts all being sold as MMFs. This would create investor confusion and would\r\nimpede the emergence of a Union wide level playing field for those who offer\r\nMMFs to either professional or retail investors. Equally, different national\r\napproaches concerning the essential characteristics of a MMF would increase the\r\nrisk of cross-border contagion, especially when issuers and the MMF are located\r\nin different Member States. As MMFs invest in a broad range of financial\r\ninstruments across the EU, the failure of one MMF (due to insufficient\r\nregulation at national level) would have repercussions on Government and\r\ncorporate financing across the EU. \nIn addition, as many operators that offer\r\nMMFs in Europe are domiciled in Member States other than those where the funds\r\nare marketed, the creation of a robust framework is essential to avoid\r\ncross-border contagion. Cross-border contagion should also be avoided between a\r\nMMF and its sponsor that is often located in a different Member State. This is especially acute when the sponsor is located in a Member State that may not have\r\nthe budgetary resources to bail out a defaulting sponsor. \nAs regards proportionality, the proposal\r\nstrikes the appropriate balance between the public interest at stake and the\r\ncost-efficiency of the measure. The requirements imposed on the different\r\nparties have been carefully calibrated. Whenever possible, requirements have\r\nbeen crafted as minimum standards (e.g., daily or weekly liquidity, issuer\r\nconcentration limits) and regulatory requirements have been tailored so as not\r\nto unnecessarily disrupt existing business models (e.g., providing for\r\nappropriate transitional periods before the NAV of a MMF has to be floated or\r\nleaving operators the choice between stringent capital requirements and\r\nfloating the NAV of their MMF). In particular, the need to balance investor\r\nprotection, avoidance of cross-border contagion, efficiency of the markets, the\r\nfinancing of the European industry and costs for the industry have all been\r\nbalanced in laying out these requirements.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact on fundamental\r\nrights issues\nThe proposal has relevance for the impact\r\non two fundamental rights of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, namely\r\nthe freedom to conduct business (Article 16 and 22) and consumer protection\r\n(Article 38).\nThe general interest objective of the proposal,\r\nwhich justifies certain limitations of the above-mentioned fundamental rights,\r\nis the objective of ensuring market integrity and stability. The freedom to\r\nconduct business may be impacted by the necessity to follow the specific\r\nobjectives of ensuring sufficient liquidity, preventing the risk of contagion\r\nand enhancing safeguarding of investors\u2019 interests. However, the proposal fully\r\nrespects the essence of this fundamental freedom. The proposed new rules will\r\noverall reinforce the right to consumer protection (Art. 38), whilst respecting\r\nthe fundamental rights and observing the principles recognised in the Charter\r\nof Fundamental Rights of the European Union as enshrined in the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed explanations of\r\nthe proposal\nThe proposal for a Regulation on Money\r\nMarket Funds (MMF) is structured in nine chapters. \n3.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter I \u2013General\r\nprovisions (Articles 1-6)\nChapter I deals with general rules, such as\r\nthe subject matter and scope of the proposed rules, definitions, the\r\nauthorisation of MMFs and the interplay of the proposed Regulation with\r\nexisting rules contained in Directives 2009/65/EC (UCITS) and 2011/61/EU\r\n(AIFMD). \nArticle 1 specifies the subject matter and\r\nspecifies the scope of the proposed Regulation as applying to all MMFs\r\nestablished, managed and/or marketed in the Union and specifies that the\r\nrequirements contained in the Regulation are intended to be exhaustive, that is\r\nthat they are conceived as leaving no scope for additional 'gold-plating' at\r\nnational level. MMFs are either UCITS or AIFs that invest in short-term financial\r\ninstruments and have specific objectives. Article 2 contains essential\r\ndefinitions necessary for the uniform application of the proposed Regulation. Article\r\n3 requires that collective investment undertakings be authorised explicitly as\r\nMMF either as part of the harmonised authorisation procedure of UCITS or\r\nfollowing the new harmonised procedure laid down in Article 4 for AIFs. Article\r\n5 reserves the designation 'MMF' only to funds that comply with the Regulation.\r\nArticle 6 describes the interaction between the existing UCITS and AIFMD rules\r\nand the new MMF Regulation, essentially specifying that compliance with the\r\nRegulation shall be incumbent on the manager of the MMF. \n3.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter II \u2013 Obligations\r\nconcerning the investment policies of MMFs (Articles 7-20)\nChapter II contains the rules on\r\npermissible investment policies to be pursued by an MMF, such as eligible\r\nassets, diversification, concentration and credit quality of investment assets.\r\n\nArticle 7 describes the relationship with\r\nthe UCITS rules on investment policies and the proposed rules on investment\r\npolicies of MMF, considering that the MMF constitutes a lex specialis in\r\nrelation to the UCITS rules specifically enumerated in Article 7. Article 8 describes\r\nfour categories of financial assets that an MMF can invest in: money market\r\ninstruments, deposits with credit institutions, financial derivatives and\r\nreverse repurchase agreements. On the other hand, a MMF may not invest in any\r\nother assets, engage in short selling of money market instruments, gain\r\nexposure to equities or commodities, enter into securities lending or\r\nsecurities borrowing agreements, enter into repurchase agreements or borrow or\r\nlend cash, as these asset classes and practices would undermine the liquidity\r\nprofile of an MMF. Articles 9 to 13 further describe the eligibility conditions\r\nfor the four categories of assets that a MMF can invest in. In particular\r\nArticle 13 contains rules aimed at ensuring that the collateral received in\r\nexchange of a reverse repurchase agreement is sufficiently liquid to permit its\r\nrapid sale when needed.\nArticle 14 contains detailed rules on the\r\ndiversification of eligible investment assets that each MMF has to respect, such\r\nas upper limits on how much a single issuer can represent (as a percentage of\r\nthe MMFs assets under management) and rules on maximum risk exposure that an\r\nMMF can have vis-\u00e0-vis a single counterparty. Article 15, on the other hand,\r\naddresses the maximum limits that an MMF (as investor) can hold in a single\r\nissuer (concentration limits). In order to reduce mechanistic reliance on\r\nexternal ratings, Articles 16 to 19 contain detailed rules on an internal\r\nassessment of the credit quality of MMF investment instruments. Article 20 describes\r\nthe governance requirements governing the internal credit rating process, in\r\nparticular the role of senior management. \n3.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter III \u2013 Obligations\r\nconcerning the risk management of MMFs (Articles 21-25)\nChapter III deals with risk management\r\naspects, such as the maturity and the liquidity profile of MMFs\u2019 assets, soliciting\r\nof ratings, and so-called 'know-your-customer' policies and stress testing that\r\nan MMF is obliged to introduce. \nThe new rules on weighted average maturity\r\n(WAM) and weighted average life (WAL), combined with the requirements on\r\nholdings of daily and weekly maturing assets are essential planks in increasing\r\nthe liquidity profile of an MMF and thus its ability to satisfy investor\r\nredemptions. Article 21 contains the important provision on the maturity\r\nprofile that short-term MMF have to comply with. Article 22 contains\r\ncorresponding rules for standard MMFs which invest in longer term instruments\r\nthan a short-term MMF. Standard MMFs have different maturity limits, such as\r\nWAL and WAM, and can use a lower diversification limit for the investments in\r\nmoney market instruments issued by the same entity. These features are coherent\r\nwith the objectives of standard MMFs to offer slightly higher returns than money\r\nmarket rates. The characteristics of this MMF category are also coherent with\r\nthe fact that standard MMFs cannot be managed as a constant NAV MMF (Article 22(5))\r\nand are therefore less prone to massive outflows. \nArticle 23 prevents an MMF from soliciting\r\nor financing an external credit rating and thus complements the rules on\r\ninternal ratings contained in Articles 16 to 19. Article 24 introduces\r\nrequirements on 'knowing-your-customer'. The aim of these rules is to allow MMFs\r\nto better anticipate redemption cycles. Article 25 contains rules on stress\r\ntesting. \n3.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter IV \u2013 Valuation\r\nrules (Articles 26-28)\nChapter IV deals with the valuation of an\r\nMMF's investment assets and the calculation of the MMF's net asset value per\r\nunit or share. \nArticles 26 to 28 contain rules on how an\r\nMMF has to value its individual investment assets, calculate the net asset\r\nvalue (NAV) per unit or share of the MMF, as well as the frequency of both sets\r\nof valuations. While there is a general rule favouring mark-to-market\r\nvaluation, MMFs may also use marking to model, where marking to market is not\r\npossible or market data are not of sufficient quality. Only CNAV MMFs may also\r\nvalue assets at amortised cost. The method chosen for calculating the NAV is\r\nparticularly important when issuing and redeeming shares or units in a MMF\r\n(Article 26). \n3.4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter V \u2013 Specific\r\nrequirements for CNAV MMFs (Articles 29-34)\nChapter V contains specific requirements\r\nfor MMFs that value their assets at amortised cost or advertise a constant NAV\r\nper unit or share or round the constant NAV per unit or share to the nearest\r\npercentage point\u2013 so-called constant NAV or CNAV MMF. \nArticle 29 contains specific authorisation\r\nrequirements that apply only to MMFs that use amortised cost to value their assets\r\nor advertise a constant NAV per unit or share or round the constant NAV per\r\nunit or share to the nearest percentage point. These CNAV MMFs must establish\r\nand maintain at all times a buffer amounting to at least 3% of the total value\r\nof their assets. Article 30 describes the constitution of the buffer (the\r\n\"NAV buffer\"), while Article 31 describes its operation. Most\r\nimportantly, Article 31 contains the rule that the NAV buffer can only be used\r\nto compensate the difference between the constant NAV per unit or share and the\r\n'real' value of a unit or share. In addition, Article 31 contains rules on when\r\nthe NAV buffer must be debited and when it can be credited. Finally, Articles 32\r\nto 34 contain the obligation to replenish the buffer and the consequences of a\r\nfailure to replenish the NAV buffer. \n3.4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter\r\nVI \u2013 External support (Articles 35-36)\nChapter VI contains rules on external\r\nsupport. It lays down the rule that CNAV MMFs may receive external support only\r\nthrough the NAV buffer, whereas other MMFs are as a rule prohibited from\r\nreceiving external support \nArticle 35 describes what needs to be\r\nunderstood by external support and contains a non-exhaustive enumeration of\r\ninstances of external support. The aim of this Article is twofold: to ensure\r\nthat all 'sponsor' support is granted to CNAV MMFs via the transparent\r\nmechanism provided for in Article 31 by having recourse to a pre-established\r\nNAV buffer or, if sponsor support is granted to other MMFs, that the competent\r\nauthorities allow such support only if exceptional circumstances linked to the\r\nmaintenance of financial stability justify the ad hoc grant of sponsor support\r\n(Article 36). \n3.4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VII \u2013 Transparency\r\nrequirements (Articles 37-38)\nChapter VII contains transparency rules\r\nwhen MMFs are advertised to investors and reporting requirements to competent\r\nauthorities. \nArticle 37 contains special transparency\r\nrequirements. Article 38 establishes reporting requirements on all MMFs that\r\napply in addition to the requirements under Directives 2009/65 and 2011/61. \n3.4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VIII \u2013 Supervision (Articles\r\n39-42)\nChapter VIII contains the applicable rules\r\non supervision of MMFs: Article 39 explains the respective roles of the\r\ncompetent authorities of the MMF and of the manager of the MMF. Article 40 states\r\nthat the powers of competent authorities under the UCITS and AIFM Directives\r\nshould be exercised also by reference to the proposed Regulation. Article 41 refers\r\nto ESMA\u2019s powers, whereas Article 42 provides for the cooperation between\r\nauthorities.\n3.4.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter\r\nIX \u2013 Final provisions (Articles 43-46)\nChapter IX contains rules on the treatment\r\nof existing UCITS and AIFs acting as MMFs to ensure their compliance with the\r\nnew rules on MMFs and a review clause for the application of NAV buffers to certain\r\nCNAV MMFs In particular, Article 43 states how existing UCITS and AIFs that\r\nmeet the criteria of the definition of a CNAV MMF should build progressively\r\nthe NAV buffer. Article 45 states that the application of NAV buffers to CNAV\r\nMMF that concentrate their portfolios on debt issued or guaranteed by Member\r\nStates should be reviewed by three years after the entry into force of this\r\nregulation. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nWork on the reform of MMFs has been closely\r\ncoordinated with the European Securities Market Authority (ESMA). Commission\r\nexperts in the area of fund management have been in regular contact with their\r\ncounterparts at ESMA; both in the context on the operational working group on\r\nMMFs and in the Standing Committee on Investment Management Services\r\nestablished at ESMA.\nIndeed, ESMA suspended on-going work on\r\nMMFs because the Commission announced its intention to propose legislation in\r\nthe area, amongst other issues, enshrining certain principles contained in\r\npre-existing CESR and ESMA guidelines on MMFs into the corpus of primary law.\r\nThis suspension came against the background of ESMA having already started a\r\nwork-stream on 'alternative rating methodologies'. This work-stream was\r\ninstituted in order to substitute credit ratings issued on money market\r\ninstruments by credit rating agencies. ESMA has suspended this work-stream in\r\norder to await the formal mandate that this work would receive by virtue of\r\nproposed legislation. In addition, as part of its efforts on establishing\r\nconvergence in the field of MMFs, ESMA is already engaged in creating a\r\ndatabase on supervisory practices and adherence to its existing guidelines.\nHence, ESMA is already well equipped to\r\nfulfil the mandate in the proposed Regulation; indeed all of this work had\r\nalready commenced prior to the Commission's proposal on MMF. \nIn these circumstances, the Commission has\r\nnot identified implications for the EU budget. In light of the above, no\r\nadditional funding and no additional posts will be required for ESMA to perform\r\nthe tasks that the proposed legislation will entrust to it: developing an\r\nalternative rating methodology and setting up a database of approved MMF. As\r\nexplained above, these tasks are already part of well-established work-streams\r\nwithin ESMA. \nWork on defining operational rules in the\r\narea of MMF furthermore already fall within the scope of existing\r\nresponsibilities of ESMA: As part of its overall task of supervising and\r\ncreating regulatory convergence in the field of UCITS funds, ESMA has already\r\ndedicated staff resources to developing policy and supervisory tools with\r\nrespect to MMFs, a special category of funds that are regulated either as UCITS\r\nor as AIFs. \nIn pursuance of these efforts CESR, the\r\npredecessor of ESMA has, in May 2010, issued extensive guidelines on MMF (CESR\r\n10/049). \nIn 2012 ESMA conducted a resource-intensive\r\npeer review to assess how Member States applied the guidelines in practice (12\r\nMember States applied the guidelines while eight had not transposed them into\r\ntheir regulatory practice). \nIn 2013, the MMF Guidelines were\r\nsupplemented by detailed Q&A. \n2013/0306 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non Money Market Funds\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[2],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Money market funds (MMF) provide\r\nshort-term finance to financial institutions, corporates or governments. By providing\r\nfinance to these entities, money market funds contribute to the financing of\r\nthe European economy. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the demand side, MMFs are\r\nshort-term cash management tools that provide a high degree of liquidity,\r\ndiversification, stability of value of the principal invested combined with a\r\nmarket-based yield. MMFs are mainly used by corporations seeking to invest\r\ntheir excess cash for a short time frame. MMFs, therefore, represent a crucial\r\nlink bringing together demand and offer of short-term money.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Events that occurred\r\nduring the financial crisis have shed light on several features of MMFs that make\r\nthem vulnerable when there are difficulties in financial markets and therefore\r\nmay spread or amplify risks through the financial system. When the prices of\r\nthe assets in which the MMFs are invested in start to decrease, especially\r\nduring stressed market situations, the MMF cannot always maintain the promise\r\nto redeem immediately and to preserve the principal value of a unit or share\r\nissued by the MMF to investors. This situation may trigger massive and sudden\r\nredemption requests, potentially causing broader macroeconomic consequences.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Large redemption requests\r\nforce MMFs to sell some of their investment assets in a declining market,\r\nfuelling a liquidity crisis. In these circumstances, money market issuers can\r\nface severe funding difficulties if the market of commercial papers and other\r\nmoney market instruments dries up. Any contagion to the short term funding\r\nmarket could then also represent direct and major difficulties for the\r\nfinancing of the financial institutions, corporations and governments, thus the\r\neconomy.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Asset managers, helped by\r\nsponsors, may decide to provide discretionary support to maintain the liquidity\r\nand the stability of their MMFs. Sponsors are often forced to support their\r\nsponsored MMFs when losing value due to the reputational risk and fear that panic\r\ncould spread into the sponsor other businesses. Depending on the size of the\r\nfund and the extent of redemption pressure, sponsor support may reach\r\nproportions that exceed their readily available reserves. Therefore, it is\r\nimportant to provide for a framework of uniform rules in order to prevent the\r\nfailure of the sponsor and risk contagion to other entities that sponsor MMFs.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to preserve the\r\nintegrity and stability of the internal market by promoting more resilient MMFs\r\nand limiting contagion channels, it is necessary to lay down rules regarding\r\nthe operation of MMFs, in particular on the composition of the portfolio of MMFs.\r\nUniform rules across the Union are necessary to ensure that MMFs are able to\r\nimmediately redeem investors, especially during stressed market situations.\r\nUniform rules on the portfolio of a money market fund are also required to\r\nensure that MMFs are able to face massive and sudden redemption requests by a\r\nlarge group of investors. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Uniform rules on MMFs are\r\nalso necessary to ensure smooth operation of the short term funding market for\r\nfinancial institutions, corporate issuers of short term debt and governments. They\r\nare also required to ensure equal treatment among MMF investors and to avoid\r\nthat late redeemers have to support additional inconvenience when redemptions\r\nare temporarily suspended or when the MMF is liquidated. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to provide\r\nfor the harmonisation of prudential requirements related to MMFs by setting out\r\nclear rules that impose direct obligations on MMFs and their managers\r\nthroughout the Union. This would enhance stability of MMFs as a source of short-term\r\nfinance for government and the corporate sector across the Union. It would also\r\nensure that MMFs remain a reliable tool for the cash management needs of the Union's industry.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The MMF Guidelines adopted\r\nby the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) to create a minimum\r\nlevel playing field for MMFs in the Union were implemented one year after their\r\nentry into force only by 12 Member States thus demonstrating the persistence of\r\ndivergent national rules. Different national approaches fail to address the\r\nvulnerabilities of the Union money markets, as evidenced during the financial\r\ncrisis, and to mitigate the contagion risks thereby endangering the functioning\r\nand stability of the internal market. These common rules on MMFs should\r\ntherefore provide for a high level of protection of investors and should\r\nprevent and mitigate any potential contagion risks resulting from possible runs\r\nby investors in MMFs.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of a\r\nRegulation setting out rules on MMFs, diverging measures might continue to be\r\nadopted at national level, which would continue to cause significant\r\ndistortions of competition resulting from important differences in essential\r\ninvestment protection standards. Diverging requirements on portfolio\r\ncomposition, eligible assets, their maturity, liquidity and diversification, as\r\nwell as on credit quality of issuers of money market instruments lead to\r\ndifferent levels of investor protection because of the different levels of risk\r\nattached to the investment proposition associated with a money market fund. The\r\nfailure to adopt strict common rules applicable to MMFs in the internal market\r\nprevents uniform investor protection and gives investors different incentives\r\nto redeem their investments and thereby trigger a run. It is therefore\r\nessential to avoid contagion into the short term funding market and to the\r\nsponsors of the MMF which would largely put at risk the stability of the Union\u2019s financial market by adopting a uniform set of rules.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The new rules on MMFs are\r\nclosely linked to Directive 2009/65/EC[3]\r\nand Directive 2011/61/EU[4]\r\nsince they form the legal framework governing the establishment, management and\r\nmarketing of MMFs in the Union.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Union, collective\r\ninvestment undertakings may operate as undertakings for collective investment\r\nin transferable securities (UCITS) managed by UCITS managers or investment\r\ncompanies authorised under Directive 2009/65/EC or as alternative investment\r\nfunds (AIFs) managed by alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs) authorised\r\nor registered under Directive 2011/61/EU. The new rules on MMFs supplement the\r\nprovisions of those Directives. Hence the new uniform rules on MMFs should\r\napply in addition to those laid down in Directives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU.\r\nAt the same time, a number of rules concerning the investment policies of UCITS\r\nlaid down in Chapter VII of Directive 2009/65/EC should be explicitly\r\ndis-applied and specific product rules should be laid down in these new uniform\r\nprovisions on MMFs.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harmonised rules should\r\napply to collective investment undertakings whose characteristics correspond to\r\nthose associated with a MMF. For UCITS and AIFs that invest in short term\r\nassets such as money market instruments or deposits, or enter reverse\r\nrepurchase agreements, or certain derivative contracts with the only purpose of\r\nhedging risks inherent to other investments of the fund, and that have the\r\nobjective of offering returns in line with money market rates or of preserving\r\nthe value of the investment, compliance with the new rules on MMFs should be\r\nmandatory. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The specificity of MMFs results\r\nfrom a combination of the assets in which they invest and the objectives they\r\npursue. The objective to offer a return in line with money market rates and the\r\nobjective to preserve the value of an investment are not mutually exclusive. A MMF\r\nmay have either one of these objective or both objectives jointly.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of offering\r\nreturns in line with money market rates should be understood in a broad sense.\r\nThe anticipated return does not need to be perfectly aligned with EONIA, Libor,\r\nEuribor or any other relevant money market rate. An objective to outperform the\r\nmoney market rate by a slight margin should not be considered to take a UCITS\r\nor AIF outside the scope of the new uniform rules. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of preserving\r\nthe value of the investment should not be understood as a capital guarantee\r\npromised by the fund. It should be understood as an aim that the UCITS or AIF\r\nseeks to pursue. A decrease in value of the investments should not imply that\r\nthe collective investment undertaking has changed the objective to preserve the\r\nvalue of an investment.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important that UCITS\r\nand AIFs that have the characteristics of MMFs be identified as MMFs and that\r\ntheir capacity to comply on an on-going basis with the new uniform rules on\r\nMMFs be explicitly verified. For this purpose competent authorities should\r\nauthorise MMFs. For UCITS the authorisation as MMF should be part of the\r\nauthorisation as UCITS in accordance with the harmonised procedures envisaged\r\nin Directive 2009/65/EC. For AIFs, as they are not subject to harmonised\r\nauthorisation and supervision procedures under Directive 2011/61/EU, it is\r\nnecessary to provide for common basic rules on authorisation that mirror the\r\nexisting UCITS harmonised rules. Such procedures should ensure that an AIF\r\nauthorised as a MMF has as manager an alternative investment fund manager\r\n(AIFM) authorised in accordance with Directive 2011/61/EU.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to make sure that\r\nall collective investment undertakings displaying the characteristics of MMFs\r\nare subject to the new common rules on MMFs, it is necessary to prohibit the\r\nuse of the designation \u2018MMF\u2019 or any other term that suggests that a collective\r\ninvestment undertaking shares the characteristics of MMFs unless this Regulation\r\nis complied with. To prevent circumvention of the MMF rules, competent\r\nauthorities should monitor the market practices of collective investment\r\nundertakings established or marketed in their jurisdiction to verify that they\r\ndo not misuse the MMF designation or suggest that they are a MMF without\r\ncomplying with the new regulatory framework. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The new rules applicable to\r\nMMFs should build on the existing regulatory framework established through\r\nDirective 2009/65/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU and the acts adopted for their\r\nimplementation. Therefore, the product rules concerning MMFs should apply in\r\naddition to the product rules laid down in the existing Union legislation\r\nunless they are explicitly dis-applied. Furthermore, the management and\r\nmarketing rules laid down in the existing framework should apply to MMFs taking\r\ninto account whether they are UCITS or AIFs. Equally, the rules on the\r\ncross-border provision of services and freedom of establishment laid down in\r\nDirectives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU should apply accordingly to the\r\ncross-border activities of MMFs.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that UCITS and AIFs\r\nmay take different legal forms that do not necessarily endow them with legal\r\npersonality, the provisions requiring MMFs to take action should be understood\r\nto refer to the manager of the MMF in cases where the MMF is constituted as a\r\nUCITS or an AIF that is not in a position to act by itself because it has no\r\nlegal personality of its own.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rules on the portfolio of\r\nMMFs would require a clear identification of the categories of assets that\r\nshould be eligible for investment by MMFs and of the conditions under which\r\nthey are eligible. To ensure the integrity of MMFs is also desirable to\r\nprohibit a MMF from engaging in certain financial transactions that would\r\nendanger its investment strategy and objectives.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Money market instruments\r\nare transferable instruments normally dealt in on the money market, as treasury\r\nand local authority bills, certificates of deposits, commercial papers,\r\nbankers\u2019 acceptances or medium- or short-term notes. They should be eligible\r\nfor investment by MMFs only insofar as they comply with maturity limits and are\r\nconsidered by the MMF to be of high credit quality.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Asset Backed Commercial\r\nPapers (ABCPs) should be considered eligible money market instruments to the\r\nextent that they respect additional requirements. Due to the fact that during\r\nthe crisis certain securitisations were particularly unstable, it is necessary\r\nto impose maturity limits and quality criteria on the underlying assets. Not\r\nall categories of underlying assets should be eligible because some were more\r\nconfronted to instability than others. For this reason the underlying assets\r\nshould be exclusively composed of short-term debt instruments that have been\r\nissued by corporates in the course of their business activity, such as trade\r\nreceivables. Instruments such as auto loans and leases, equipment leases,\r\nconsumer loans, residential mortgage loans, credit card receivables or any\r\nother type of instrument linked to the acquisition or financing of services or\r\ngoods by consumers should not be eligible. ESMA should be entrusted with drafting regulatory technical standards to\r\nbe submitted for endorsement by the Commission with regard to the conditions\r\nand circumstances under which the underlying exposure or pool of exposures is\r\nconsidered to exclusively consist of corporate debt and the conditions and\r\nnumerical thresholds determining when corporate debt is of high credit quality\r\nand liquid.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A MMF should be allowed to\r\ninvest in deposits to the extent that it is able to withdraw the money at any\r\ntime. The effective possibility of withdrawal would be impaired if the\r\npenalties associated with the early withdrawal are so high as to exceed the\r\ninterest accrued prior to withdrawal. For this reason the MMF should take due\r\ncare not to make deposits with a credit institution that requires above average\r\npenalties or to engage in too long deposits where this results in too high\r\npenalties. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial derivative\r\ninstruments eligible for investment by a MMF should only serve the purpose of\r\nhedging interest rate and currency risk and should only have as an underlying\r\ninstrument interest rates, exchange currencies or indices representing these\r\ncategories. Any use of derivatives for another purpose or on other underlying\r\nassets should be prohibited. Derivatives should only be used as a complement to\r\nthe fund strategy but not as the main tool for achieving the fund\u2019s objectives.\r\nShould a MMF invest in assets labelled in another currency than the currency of\r\nthe fund, it is expected that the MMF manager would hedge the entire currency\r\nrisk exposure, including via derivatives.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reverse repurchase\r\nagreements could be used by MMFs as a means to invest excess cash on a very\r\nshort-term basis, provided that the position is fully collateralized. In order\r\nto protect the interests of the investors it is necessary to ensure that the\r\ncollateral provided in the framework of reverse repurchase agreements be of\r\nhigh quality. All other efficient portfolio management techniques, including\r\nsecurities lending and borrowing, should not be used by the MMF as they are\r\nlikely to impinge on achieving the investment objectives of the MMF. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to limit\r\nrisk-taking by MMFs it is essential to reduce counterparty risk by subjecting\r\nthe portfolio of MMFs to clear diversification requirements. To this effect it\r\nis also necessary that the reverse repurchase agreements be fully\r\ncollateralized and that, for limiting the operational risk, one reverse\r\nrepurchase agreement counterparty cannot account for more than 20% of the MMF\u2019s\r\nassets. All over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives should be subject to Regulation\r\n(EU) No 648/2012[5].\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For prudential reasons and\r\nfor avoiding the exercise of significant influence over the management of an\r\nissuing body by the MMF, it is necessary to avoid excessive concentration by a\r\nMMF in investments issued by the same issuing body. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The MMF should have a responsibility\r\nto invest in high quality eligible assets. Therefore, a MMF should have a\r\nprudent and rigorous internal assessment procedure for determining the credit\r\nquality of the money market instruments in which it intends to invest. In\r\naccordance with Union legislation limiting over-reliance on credit ratings, it\r\nis important that MMFs avoid any mechanistic reliance on ratings issued by\r\nrating agencies when assessing the quality of eligible assets. For this purpose\r\nthe MMF should establish an internal rating system based on a harmonised rating\r\nscale and an internal assessment procedure. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of avoiding\r\nthat MMF managers use different assessment criteria for evaluating the credit\r\nrisk of a money market instrument and thus attribute different risk\r\ncharacteristics to the same instrument, it is essential that managers rely on\r\nthe same criteria. To this effect the rating criteria should be precisely\r\ndefined and harmonized. Examples of internal rating criteria are quantitative\r\nmeasures on the issuer of the instrument, such as financial ratios, balance\r\nsheet dynamics, profitability guidelines, which are evaluated and compared to\r\nthose of industry peers and groups; qualitative measures on the issuer of the\r\ninstrument, such as management effectiveness, corporate strategy, which are\r\nanalysed with a view to determining that the issuer\u2019s overall strategy does not\r\nimpede on its future credit quality. The highest internal ratings should reflect\r\nthe fact that the creditworthiness of the issuer of the instruments is\r\nmaintained at all times at the highest possible levels.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to develop a\r\ntransparent and coherent internal rating system, the manager should document\r\nthe procedures used for the internal assessment. This should ensure that the\r\nprocedure follows a clear set of rules that can be monitored and that the\r\nmethodologies employed are communicated upon request to the interested\r\nstakeholders.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To reduce MMF portfolio\r\nrisk it is important to set maturity limitations, providing for a maximum\r\nallowable weighted average maturity (WAM) and weighted average life (WAL). \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 WAM is used to measure the\r\nsensitivity of a MMF to changing money market interest rates. When determining\r\nthe WAM, managers should take into account the impact of financial derivative\r\ninstruments, deposits and reverse repurchase agreements and reflect their effect\r\non the interest rate risk of the MMF. When a MMF enters into a swap transaction\r\nin order to gain exposure to a fixed rate instrument instead of a floating rate\r\nthis should be taken into account for determining the WAM.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 WAL is used to measure the\r\ncredit risk, as the longer the reimbursement of principal is postponed, the\r\nhigher is the credit risk. WAL is also used to limit the liquidity risk.\r\nContrary to the calculation of the WAM, the calculation of the WAL for floating\r\nrate securities and structured financial instruments does not permit the use of\r\ninterest rate reset dates and instead only uses a financial instrument\u2019s stated\r\nfinal maturity. The maturity used for calculating the WAL is the residual\r\nmaturity until legal redemption, since this is the only date at which the\r\nmanagement company can be assured that the instrument will have been\r\nreimbursed. Features of an instrument, such as the possibility to redeem at\r\nspecific dates, the so-called put options, cannot be taken into account for\r\ncalculating the WAL.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to strengthen\r\nMMFs\u2019 ability to face redemptions and prevent MMFs assets from being liquidated\r\nat heavily discounted prices, MMFs should hold on an on-going basis a minimum\r\namount of liquid assets that mature daily or weekly. To calculate the\r\nproportion of daily and weekly maturing assets, the legal redemption date of\r\nthe asset should be used. The possibility for the manager to terminate a\r\ncontract on a short term basis can be taken into consideration. For instance, if\r\na reverse repurchase agreement can be terminated with a one day prior notice,\r\nit should count as a daily maturing asset. If the manager has the possibility\r\nto withdraw money from a deposit account with a one day prior notice, it can\r\ncount as a daily maturing asset. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that MMFs may invest\r\nin assets with different maturity ranges, investors should be able to\r\ndistinguish between different categories of MMF. Therefore, MMFs should be\r\nclassified as either short-term MMF or as standard MMF. Short-term MMFs have\r\nthe objective of offering money market rate returns while ensuring the highest\r\npossible level of safety for the investors. With short WAM and WAL, the\r\nduration risk and credit risk of short-term MMFs are kept at low levels.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Standard MMFs have the\r\nobjective of offering returns slightly higher than money market returns, and\r\ntherefore they invest in assets that have an extended maturity. Moreover, to\r\nachieve this outperformance, this category of MMFs should be permitted to employ\r\nextended limits for the portfolio risk such as weighted average maturity and\r\nweighted average life. \n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the rules laid down\r\nin Article 84 of Directive 2009/65/EC, the managers of UCITS MMFs have the\r\npossibility to temporarily suspend redemptions in exceptional cases where\r\ncircumstances so require. Under the rules laid down in Article 16 of Directive\r\n2011/61/EU and in Article 47 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 231/2013[6],\r\nthe managers of AIF MMFs may use special arrangements in order to cope with a\r\nsupervening illiquidity of the funds\u2019 assets.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important that the\r\nrisk management of MMFs not be biased by short-term decisions influenced by the\r\npossible rating of the MMF. Therefore, it is necessary to prohibit a MMF or its\r\nmanager from requesting that the MMF is rated by a credit rating agency in\r\norder to avoid that this external rating is used for marketing purposes. The\r\nMMF or its manager should also refrain from using alternative methods for\r\nobtaining a rating of the MMF. Should the MMF be awarded an external rating,\r\neither on the own initiative of the credit rating agency or following request by\r\na third party that is independent of the MMF or the manager and does not act on\r\nbehalf of any of them, the MMF manager should refrain from relying on criteria\r\nthat would be attached to that external rating. For ensuring appropriate\r\nliquidity management it is necessary that the MMFs establish sound policies and\r\nprocedures to know their investors. The policies that the manager has to put in\r\nplace should help understanding the MMF\u2019s investor base, to the extent that\r\nlarge redemptions could be anticipated. In order to avoid that the MMF faces\r\nsudden massive redemptions, particular attention should be paid to large\r\ninvestors representing a substantial portion of the MMF\u2019s assets, as with one\r\ninvestor representing more than the proportion of daily maturing assets. In\r\nthis case the MMF should increase its proportion of daily maturing assets to\r\nthe proportion of that investor. The manager should whenever possible look at\r\nthe identity of the investors, even if they are represented by nominee\r\naccounts, portals or any other indirect buyer.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As part of a prudent risk\r\nmanagement, MMFs should periodically conduct stress testing. The managers of\r\nMMFs are expected to act in order to strengthen the MMF\u2019s robustness whenever\r\nthe results of stress testing point to vulnerabilities.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reflect the\r\nactual value of assets, the use of marking to market should be the preferred\r\nmethod for valuing the assets of MMFs. A manager should not be allowed to use\r\nthe marking to model valuation method when marking to market provides a\r\nreliable value of the asset, as the mark to model method is prone to provide\r\nless accurate valuation. Assets such as treasury and local authority bills,\r\nmedium- or short-term notes are generally the ones that are expected to have a\r\nreliable marking to market. For valuing commercial papers or certificates of\r\ndeposit, the manager should check if accurate pricing is provided by a\r\nsecondary market. The buy-back price offered by the issuer should also be\r\nconsidered to represent a good estimate of the value of the commercial paper.\r\nIn all other cases the manager should estimate the value, for example using\r\nmarket data such as yields on comparable issues and comparable issuers. \n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Constant Net Asset Value\r\nMMFs (CNAV MMFs) have the objective of preserving the capital of the investment\r\nwhile ensuring a high degree of liquidity. The majority of CNAV MMFs have a net\r\nasset value (NAV) per unit or share set, for example, at 1 \u20ac, $ or \u00a3 when they\r\ndistribute the income to the investors. The others accumulate income in the NAV\r\nof the fund while maintaining the intrinsic value of the asset at a constant\r\nvalue.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To allow for the specificities\r\nof CNAV MMFs it is necessary that CNAV MMFs be permitted to use also the amortised\r\ncost accounting method for the purpose of determining the constant net asset\r\nvalue (NAV) per unit or share. This notwithstanding, for the purpose of\r\nensuring at all times the monitoring of the difference between the constant NAV\r\nper unit or share and the NAV per unit or share, a CNAV MMF should also\r\ncalculate the value of its assets on the basis of the marking to market or\r\nmarking to model methods.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a MMF should publish a\r\nNAV that reflects all movements in the value of its assets, the published NAV\r\nshould be rounded at maximum to the nearest basis point or its equivalent. As a\r\nconsequence, when the NAV is published in a specific currency, for example \u20ac1,\r\nthe incremental change in value should be done every \u20ac0.0001. In the case of a\r\nNAV at \u20ac100, the incremental change in value should be done every \u20ac0.01. Only\r\nif the MMF is a CNAV MMF, the MMF can publish a price that does not follow entirely\r\nthe movements in the value of its assets. In this case the NAV can be rounded\r\nto the nearest cent for a NAV at \u20ac1 (every \u20ac0.01 move).\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to be able to\r\nabsorb day-to-day fluctuations in the value of a CNAV MMF\u2019s assets and allow it\r\nto offer a constant NAV per unit or share, the CNAV MMF should have at all times\r\na NAV buffer amounting to at least 3% of its assets. The NAV buffer should\r\nserve as an absorbing mechanism for maintaining the constant NAV. All\r\ndifferences between the constant NAV per unit or share and the NAV per unit or\r\nshare should be neutralized by using the NAV buffer. During stressed market\r\nsituations, when the differences can rapidly increase, a procedure should ensure\r\nthat the whole chain of management is involved. This escalation procedure\r\nshould permit the senior management to take rapid remedy actions. \n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a CNAV MMF that does not\r\nmaintain the NAV buffer at the required level is not capable of sustaining a\r\nconstant NAV per unit or share, it should be required to fluctuate the NAV and\r\ncease to be a CNAV MMF. Therefore, where despite the use of the escalation\r\nprocedure the amount of the NAV buffer remains for one month below the required\r\n3% by 10 basis points, the CNAV MMF should automatically convert into a MMF\r\nthat is not allowed to use amortised cost accounting or rounding to the nearest\r\npercentage point. If before the end of the one month allowed for the\r\nreplenishment a competent authority has justifiable reasons demonstrating the\r\nincapacity of the CNAV MMF to replenish the buffer, it should have the power to\r\nconvert the CNAV MMF into a MMF other than a CNAV MMF. The NAV buffer is the\r\nonly vehicle through which external support to a CNAV MMF can be provided.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 External support provided to\r\na MMF other than a CNAV MMF with the intention of ensuring either liquidity or stability\r\nof the MMF or de facto having such effects increases the contagion risk between\r\nthe MMF sector and the rest of the financial sector. Third parties providing\r\nsuch support have an interest in doing so, either because they have an economic\r\ninterest in the management company managing the MMF or because they want to\r\navoid any reputational damage should their name be associated with the failure\r\nof a MMF. Because these third parties do not commit explicitly to providing or guaranteeing\r\nthe support, there is uncertainty whether such support will be granted when the\r\nMMF needs it. In these circumstances, the discretionary nature of sponsor\r\nsupport contributes to uncertainty among market participants about who will\r\nbear losses of the MMF when they do occur. This uncertainty likely makes MMFs\r\neven more vulnerable to runs during periods of financial instability, when\r\nbroader financial risks are most pronounced and when concerns arise about the\r\nhealth of the sponsors and their ability to provide support to affiliated MMFs.\r\nFor these reasons, MMFs should not rely on external support in order to\r\nmaintain their liquidity and the stability of their NAV per unit or share unless\r\nthe competent authority of the MMF has specifically allowed the external\r\nsupport in order to maintain stability of financial markets.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investors should be clearly\r\ninformed, before they invest in a MMF, if the MMF is of a short-term nature or\r\nof a standard nature and if the MMF is of a CNAV type or not. In order to avoid\r\nmisplaced expectations from the investor it must also be clearly stated in any\r\nmarketing document that MMFs are not a guaranteed investment vehicle. CNAV MMFs\r\nshould clearly explain to investors the buffer mechanism they are applying to maintain\r\nthe constant NAV per unit or share.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure that competent\r\nauthorities are able to detect, monitor and respond to risks in the MMF market,\r\nMMFs should report to their competent authorities a detailed list of\r\ninformation, in addition to reporting already required under Directives\r\n2009/65/EC or 2011/61/EU. Competent authorities should collect these data in a\r\nconsistent way throughout the Union in order to obtain a substantive knowledge\r\nof the main evolutions of the MMF market. To facilitate a collective analysis\r\nof potential impacts of the MMF market in the Union, such data should be\r\ntransmitted to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) who should\r\ncreate a central database for MMFs.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The competent authority of the\r\nMMF should verify whether a MMF is able to comply with this Regulation on an on-going\r\nbasis. As the competent authorities are already provided with extensive powers\r\nunder Directives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU, it is necessary that such powers be\r\nextended in order to be exercised by reference to the new common rules on MMFs.\r\nThe competent authorities for the UCITS or AIF should also verify compliance of\r\nall collective investment undertakings that display the characteristics of MMFs\r\nthat are in existence at the time this Regulation enters into force.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should adopt\r\nthe delegated acts in the area of the internal assessment procedure pursuant to\r\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It is of\r\nparticular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations\r\nduring its preparatory work, including at expert level.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should also\r\nbe empowered to adopt implementing technical standards by means of implementing\r\nacts pursuant to Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010[7].\r\nESMA should be entrusted with\r\ndrafting implementing technical standards for submission to the Commission with\r\nregard to a reporting template containing information on\r\nMMFs for competent authorities.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESMA should be able to\r\nexercise all the powers conferred under Directives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU\r\nwith respect to this Regulation. It is also entrusted with developing draft\r\nregulatory and implementing technical standards.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is essential to carry\r\nout a review of this Regulation in order to assess the appropriateness of\r\nexempting certain CNAV MMFs that concentrate their investment portfolios on\r\ndebt issued by the Member States from the requirement to establish a capital\r\nbuffer that amounts to at least 3 % of the total value of the CNAV MMF\u2019s\r\nassets. Therefore, during the three years after the entry into force of this\r\nRegulation, the Commission should analyse the experience acquired in applying\r\nthis Regulation and the impacts on the different economic aspects attached to\r\nthe MMFs. The debt issued or guaranteed by the Member States represents a\r\ndistinct category of investment displaying specific credit and liquidity\r\ntraits. In addition, sovereign debt plays a vital role in financing the Member\r\nStates. The Commission should evaluate the evolution of the market for\r\nsovereign debt issued or guaranteed by the Member States and the possibility to\r\ncreate a special framework for MMF that concentrate their investment policy on\r\nthat type of debt. \n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The new uniform rules on\r\nMMFs should comply with the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC[8] and with Regulation (EC) No\r\n45/2001[9].\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of\r\nthis Regulation, namely to ensure uniform prudential requirements that apply to\r\nMMFs throughout the Union, while taking full account of the need to balance\r\nsafety and reliability of MMFs with the efficient operation of the money\r\nmarkets and the cost for its various stakeholders, cannot be sufficiently\r\nachieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and\r\neffects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in\r\naccordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the\r\nTreaty on the European Union. In accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond\r\nwhat is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The new uniform rules on\r\nMMFs respect the fundamental rights and observe the principles recognised in\r\nparticular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and\r\nnotably consumer protection, the freedom to conduct a business and the\r\nprotection of personal data. The new uniform rules on MMFs should be applied in\r\naccordance with those rights and principles,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nChapter I\r\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 1\r\nSubject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation lays down\r\nrules concerning the financial instruments eligible for investment by a money\r\nmarket fund (MMF), its portfolio and valuation, and the reporting requirements\r\nin relation to a MMF established, managed or marketed in the Union.\nThis Regulation applies to collective investment\r\nundertakings that require authorisation as UCITS under Directive 2009/65/EC or are\r\nAIFs under Directive 2011/61/EU, invest in short term assets and have as\r\ndistinct or cumulative objectives offering returns in line with money market\r\nrates or preserving the value of the investment. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States shall not\r\nadd any additional requirements in the field covered by this Regulation.\nArticle 2\r\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the\r\nfollowing definitions apply:\n(1)                   \r\n\u201cshort term assets\u201d means financial assets with\r\na residual maturity not exceeding two years;\n(2)                   \r\n\u201cmoney market instruments\u201d means money market\r\ninstruments as defined in Article 2(1)(o) of Directive 2009/65/EC;\n(3)                   \r\n\u201ctransferable securities\u201d means transferable\r\nsecurities as defined in Article 2(1)(n) of Directive 2009/65/EC;\n(4)                   \r\n\u201crepurchase agreement\u201d means any agreement in\r\nwhich one party transfers securities or any rights related to that title to a counterparty,\r\nsubject to a commitment to repurchase them at a specified price on a future\r\ndate specified or to be specified;
