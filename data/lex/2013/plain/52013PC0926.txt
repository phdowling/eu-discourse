The World Health Organisation\nestimates that 285 million people worldwide are visually impaired: 39 million\nare blind and 246 million have low vision.[1]\nThe World Blind Union reports that in Europe only 5% of published books are\navailable in an accessible format for visually impaired persons, while in\ndeveloping countries \u2013 where approximately 90% of visually impaired people live\n\u2013 this rate is as low as 1%.[2]\n\nAccessible format copies of books are now usually\nproduced and distributed at national level, by specialised entities, for example\nlibraries for the blind, either under licences or under limitations or\nexceptions to copyright. However, the lack of an international legal framework\nallowing for the cross-border exchange of accessible formats produced under a\nlimitation or exception leads to a duplication of effort in the making of such\ncopies, even across countries sharing the same language. This constitutes a\nproblem because of the costs of producing accessible format copies and the\nlimited resources available to the entities serving the blind.\nSince January 2011 the European Union has\nbeen bound by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with\nDisabilities which enshrines the right of access to information (Article 21)\nand the right of persons with disabilities to participate in cultural life on\nan equal basis with others (Article 30). The Convention has become an integral\npart of the EU legal order. 25 Member States are parties to the Convention and\nthree countries are finalising the ratification.\nIn 2009 negotiations started in the World\nIntellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) on a possible international treaty introducing\nlimitations and exceptions to copyright for the benefit of persons who are\nblind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled, with the objective of\nfacilitating the cross-border exchange of accessible format copies. \nOn 26 November 2012 the Council adopted a\nDecision authorising the Commission to participate in these negotiations, on\nbehalf of the European Union.[3]\nThe negotiations in WIPO were successfully concluded at the Diplomatic\nConference held in Marrakesh from 17 to 28 June 2013, leading to the adoption\nof the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who\nare Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled \u00a0(hereinafter \u2018the\nTreaty\u2019) on 27 June 2013.\nThe Treaty establishes a set of international\nrules which ensure that there are limitations or exceptions to copyright at\nnational level for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired, or\notherwise print disabled and enable the cross-border exchange of accessible\nformat copies of published works that have been made under an exception or\nlimitation to copyright in any of the Contracting Parties to the Treaty. \nWith this proposal for a Council Decision,\nthe Commission seeks authorisation from the Council to sign the Treaty, on\nbehalf of the European Union, subject to its conclusion at a later date.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe beneficiaries of the Treaty are persons\nwho are blind, have a visual impairment or a perceptual or reading disability,\nor are otherwise unable, through physical disability, to hold or manipulate a\nbook or focus or move eyes to the extent that would be normally acceptable for\nreading. \nThe Treaty obliges every Contracting Party\nto provide, in their national copyright laws, for a limitation or exception to\nthe right of reproduction, the right of distribution and the right of making\navailable to the public in order to facilitate the availability of works in\naccessible format copies for such beneficiaries.[4]\nContracting Parties may decide to limit such limitations or exceptions to cases\nwhere the accessible format copies are not commercially available under\nreasonable terms for the beneficiaries in their territory. In the EU, Article\n5(3)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of\ncopyright and related rights in the information society[5] already provides for an\noptional exception or limitation to these rights as regards uses, for the\nbenefit of people with any disability, which are directly related to the\ndisability and are of a non-commercial nature, to the extent required by the\nspecific disability. Unlike the Treaty, Article 5(3)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC\n\u00a0is not limited to any particular disability. In addition, Member States are\nfree to choose whether they implement this limitation or exception. However, it\nis now settled case law that any discretion which Member States enjoy when they\nmake use of any of the exceptions or limitations under Article 5 of Directive\n2001/29/EC must be exercised within the limits imposed by EU law.[6]\nThe Treaty defines \u2018works\u2019 as literary and\nartistic works within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Berne Convention for\nthe Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (hereinafter \u2018the Berne\nConvention\u2019), in the form of text, notation and/or related illustrations,\nwhether published or otherwise made publicly available in any media. It also\nspecifies that the definition covers audiobooks.\nAn \u2018accessible format copy\u2019 is a copy in an\nalternative manner and form compared to the format in which the work has been\npublished and that it gives beneficiaries access to the work as comfortably as\nsighted persons could access it. The accessible format copy must be used\nexclusively by beneficiaries and it must respect the integrity of the original\nwork.\nAccessible format copies made under a\nlimitation or exception to copyright may be exported by \u2018authorised entities\u2019\ndefined as government institutions or other organisations that provide education,\ninstructional training, adaptive reading or information access to blind,\nvisually impaired, or otherwise print disabled persons on a non-profit basis.\nThese entities must ensure that they only distribute accessible formats to\nbeneficiaries, that they discourage the reproduction, distribution and making\navailable of unauthorised copies and that they maintain due care in, and\nrecords of, their handling of the copies.\nContracting Parties may only allow the\nexportation of accessible format copies, if they ensure that their limitations or\nexceptions to the rights of reproduction, distribution and making available to\nthe public are subject to the \u2018three-step test\u2019 requirement either via being a\nparty to the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) or by ensuring otherwise that the\nrelevant limitations or exceptions are limited to certain special cases which\ndo not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and do not\nunreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder.\nThe Treaty clarifies that to the extent a\nContracting Party permits a beneficiary person or an authorised entity to make\nan accessible format copy of a work, it should also permit the importation of\nsuch copies. \nContracting Parties are obliged to take\nappropriate measures, if necessary, to ensure that\nwhen they provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies\nagainst the circumvention of effective technological measures, this legal\nprotection does not prevent the beneficiaries from enjoying the limitations and\nexceptions provided for in the Treaty. An equivalent obligation is already\nestablished in the EU under Article 6(4) of Directive 2001/29/EC. \nThe Treaty also requires Contracting\nParties to protect the privacy of beneficiary persons and to cooperate in order\nto facilitate the cross-border exchange of accessible format copies. WIPO will\nestablish an information access point to assist authorised entities in\nidentifying one another. Moreover, the Treaty encourages authorised entities to\nprovide information on their policies and practices to interested parties and\nto members of the public.\nThe Treaty confirms that Contracting\nParties are free to determine the appropriate method of implementing the Treaty\nwithin their own legal system and practice. However, they must comply with\nexisting international obligations under the Berne Convention, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual\nProperty Rights and the WCT. The Treaty recognises the possibility of the\nContracting Parties to maintain or implement other limitations and exceptions,\noutside the scope of the Treaty, for the benefit of beneficiary persons and\npersons with other disabilities.\nArticles 13 to 22 contain administrative\nand procedural provisions that are very similar to those in the Beijing Treaty\non Audiovisual Performances adopted on 24 June 2012. The Treaty will enter into\nforce once twenty Contracting Parties have ratified it.\nThe European Union may become party to the\nTreaty having made the declaration during the Marrakesh Diplomatic Conference,\nthat it is competent in respect of, and has its own legislation binding on all\nits Member States on matters covered by this Treaty and that it has been duly\nauthorised, in accordance with its internal procedures, to become party to the\nTreaty. The European Union also signed the final act of the Diplomatic\nConference on 28 June 2013. The Treaty is open for signature by any eligible\nparty for one year after its adoption. \nThe Commission is satisfied with the\nresults of the negotiations and requests the Council to authorise the\nsignature, on behalf of the European Union, of the Marrakesh Treaty to\nFacilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually\nImpaired, or otherwise Print Disabled. \nConsidering the subject matter of the\nTreaty, the decision of the Council should be based on Articles 114 and 207, as\nwell as on Article 218(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion.\n2013/0444 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the European\nUnion, of the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for\nPersons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 114 and 207 in\nconjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since 22 January 2011 the\nEuropean Union has been bound by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of\nPersons with Disabilities; its provisions have become an integral part of the\nEuropean Union legal order.[7]\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 26 November 2012 the\nCouncil authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the European\nUnion, an international agreement within the World Intellectual Property\nOrganisation on improved access to books for print impaired persons.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The negotiations were\nsuccessfully concluded at the Diplomatic Conference held in Marrakesh from 17\nto 28 June 2013 and the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works\nfor Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled\n(hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Treaty\u2019) was adopted on 27 June 2013.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Treaty establishes a\nset of international rules which ensure that there are limitations or\nexceptions to copyright at national level for the benefit of persons who are\nblind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled and enable the\ncross-border exchange of accessible format copies of published works that have\nbeen made under limitations and exceptions to copyright.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Treaty shall be open\nfor signature by any eligible party for one year after its adoption.
