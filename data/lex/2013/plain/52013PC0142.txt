Its present version was negotiated in parallel with the\nUruguay Round in 1994, and entered into force on 1 January 1996 (the \"1994\nGPA\").\nThe Parties to the 1994 GPA are: Armenia, Canada, European Union with respect to its 27 Member States, Hong Kong-China, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands with respect to Aruba, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, Chinese Taipei, United States. The GPA is administered by the\nCommittee on Government Procurement (hereinafter the \u201cCommittee\u201d).\nThe 1994 GPA has contain a built-in\ncommitment to negotiations on both the text and coverage of the Agreement since\nits adoption in 1994 (Article XXIV:7(b)). Negotiations to that end were\nlaunched in 1999.\nNegotiations have been conducted by the\nCommission on behalf of the EU. The Council was regularly informed orally and\nin writing about the state of play of the negotiations via the Trade Policy\nCommittee. In addition, co-ordination meetings with Member States were held\nprior to each negotiating session in Geneva. The European Parliament has been\ninformed regularly in writing via the INTA Committee.\nOn 30 March 2012 the negotiators adopted a Decision\non the Outcomes of the Negotiations whereby they adopted the elements of the\nresults of the negotiations (\u201cDecision on the Outcomes of the Negotiations\u201d)\nconsisting of: i) the Protocol amending the Agreement on Government Procurement\n(hereinafter the \"Protocol\") and ii) seven Decisions (hereinafter\n\u201cthe Decisions\u201d) of the Committee. By means of the Decision on the Outcomes of\nthe Negotiations, the GPA Parties adopted the Protocol, and opened it for\nacceptance by the Parties to the 1994 GPA. The Protocol will enter into force\nfor those Parties to the 1994 GPA that have deposited their respective\ninstruments of acceptance of this Protocol, on the 30th day\nfollowing such deposit by two thirds of the Parties to the 1994 GPA. Furthermore,\nthe Decision on the Outcomes of the Negotiations sets out the Decisions of the\nCommittee establishing future work programmes of the Committee and detailing\nnotification requirements pursuant to Articles XIX and XXII of the Agreement.\nThe Decisions form part of the negotiated package\nand reflect the GPA Parties commitment to start implementing certain provisions\nof the revised GPA, as soon as the Protocol enters into force.\nIn view of their substance it was not considered\nappropriate to include the Decisions in the Protocol itself, thereby subjecting\nthem to the same amendment procedures. Nor was it possible to adopt them prior\nto the entry into force of the provisions of the Protocol they would be\nimplementing. The GPA parties therefore reached an agreement on the substance\nof the Decisions, which would have to be given effect at the first meeting of\nthe Committee following the entry into force of the Protocol, when the\nCommittee would take a decision confirming the political commitment to adopt\nthe decisions with an effect as of the date of entry into force of the\nProtocol.\nAs both the Protocol and the Decisions are\nthe object of the agreement adopted in March 2012, they form part of the same\npackage for the purpose of the EU ratification of the GPA revision. As the Union will be required to take a position with regard to the Decisions at the first meeting\nof the Committee following the entry into force of the Protocol, the Decisions are\nsubject to a different internal decision-making procedure than the Protocol.\nTherefore a separate Council Decision is needed with regard to the Decisions, in\naddition to the one concerning the conclusion of the Protocol. \nIf the Council, after obtaining the consent\nof the European Parliament, adopts a decision to conclude the Protocol Amending\nthe Agreement on Government Procurement on behalf of the European Union, the Union should be in a position to take a position with regard to the Decisions within the\nCommittee.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE OUTCOME OF THE\nNEGOTIATION\nThe Decisions to\nbe adopted are the following:\ni) Decision of\nthe Committee on Government Procurement on Notification requirements under\nArticle XIX and XXII of the Agreement: it aims at facilitating notification\nrequirements, by clarifying the modalities of notification by a Party with\nregard to the changes to its laws and regulations and its list of entities.\nii) Decision of\nthe Committee on Government procurement on adoption of work programmes:\nidentifies some specific work programmes on which the Parties commit to conduct\nfuture work.\niii) Decision of\nthe Committee on Government procurement on a Work programme on SMEs: sets out a\nwork programme on SMEs, aimed at facilitating SMEs participation in government\nprocurement, avoidance of discriminatory SMEs measures and increasing\ntransparency.\niv) Decision of\nthe Committee on Government Procurement on a work programme on collection and\nreporting of statistical data: aims at facilitating the compliance with the\nobligation to collect statistical data.\nv) Decision of\nthe Committee on Government Procurement on a work programme on sustainable\nprocurement: sets out a work programme aimed at ensuring that sustainable procurement\npolicies are compatible with the principles of non-discrimination and transparency.\nvi) Decision of\nthe Committee on Government Procurement on a work programme on exclusions and\nrestriction in parties\u2019 Annexes: adopts a work programme aimed at progressively\nreducing the exclusions and restrictions that the Parties have foreseen in\ntheir Annexes.\nvii) Decision on\na work programme on safety standards: adopts a work programme aimed at making\nsure that public safety concerns are applied in a way not to create arbitrary\nand unjustified discriminations or disguised restrictions.\nIn so far as\nthey facilitate the implementation of GPA principles and contribute to the\nelimination of discriminatory practises, the adoption of the Decisions will\ncreate a favourable environment for further openings of government procurement.\n2013/0077 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be taken by\nthe European Union within the Committee on Government Procurement with respect\nto decisions implementing certain provisions of the Protocol Amending the\nAgreement on Government Procurement\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(4) first\nsubparagraph, in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The negotiations on the revision\nof the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) were launched in January\n1999, based on a commitment built-in to Article XXIV:7(b) of the GPA.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Negotiations have been\nconducted by the Commission in consultation with the Committee established by\nArticle 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of these\nnegotiations the negotiators reached on 30 March 2012 an agreement on a Protocol\nAmending the Agreement on Government Procurement (\u201cthe Protocol\u201d), as well as\non seven decisions to be adopted by the Committee on Government procurement that\nwould start the implementation of certain provisions of the Protocol\nimmediately upon its entry into force.

elimination of discriminatory\npractises, the adoption of the Decisions will facilitate further openings of\ngovernment procurement.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate,\ntherefore, to establish the position to be taken by the Commission on behalf of\nthe Union within the Committee on Government Procurement in relation to the\nDecisions.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS
