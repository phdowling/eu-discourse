In the Joint Declaration on the occasion of\nthe EU-Republic of Moldova Cooperation Council meeting on 21 December 2009, it\nwas agreed to launch a dialogue examining the conditions for future visa-free\ntravel of Moldovan citizens to the EU.\nGeneral context and grounds for the\nproposal\nIn 2001, in accordance with Article 62 (2)\n(b) (i) of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, the Council adopted\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals\nmust be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders (the\nso-called negative list) and those whose nationals are exempt from that\nrequirement (the so-called positive list). Article 61 of the EC Treaty cited\nthose lists among the flanking measures which are directly linked to the free\nmovement of persons in an area of freedom, security and justice.\nAs stated in Recital 5 of Regulation\n539/2001, \"the determination of those third countries whose nationals are\nsubject to the visa requirement, and those exempt from it, is governed by a\nconsidered, case-by-case assessment of a variety of criteria relating inter\nalia to illegal immigration, public policy and security, and to the European\nUnion's external relations with third countries, consideration also being given\nto the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity\". In view of the\ncriteria of public order and illegal immigration, particular attention should\nbe paid also to the security of travel documents issued by the third countries\nconcerned.\nAs the criteria set out in Regulation (EC)\nNo 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries, the\ncomposition of the negative and positive lists should be reviewed when\nappropriate.\nRegulation (EC) No 539/2001 was last\namended in 2010 (twice) reflecting, on the one hand, the outcome of the visa\nliberalisation dialogues with the Western Balkan countries by transferring\nAlbania and Bosnia Herzegovina to Annex II; and, on the other hand, the regular\nrevision of the lists of countries by transferring Taiwan to Annex II. The\nCommission proposed in November 2012[3]\nanother regular revision of the lists of countries. Negotiations are on-going\non this proposal. The next regular revision is planned for early 2014 and will\ntake into consideration economic impacts of visa liberalisation, as announced\nby the Commission in its November 2012 Communication about visas and growth[4]. \nThe present review of the Regulation aims\nat ensuring that the composition of the lists of third countries complies with\nthe criteria set out in recital (5) of the Regulation in the light of progress\nachieved by the Republic of Moldova in the framework of its visa liberalisation\ndialogue.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Elements of the proposal\nFollowing explanatory talks in Chisinau on 2 March 2010, a Visa\nDialogue was formally opened on 15 June 2010, at the margins of the EU-Republic\nof Moldova Cooperation Council meeting in Luxembourg. During September 2010,\nexpert visits to the Republic of Moldova have been carried out to conduct a\ndetailed \"gap analysis\" which provided a comprehensive assessment of\nthe situation in each block of issues covered by the Visa Dialogue (Document\nsecurity, including biometrics; Irregular immigration, including readmission;\nPublic order and security; External relations and fundamental rights) and was\npresented to the Council, at working group level, in October 2010. In line with\nthe Council (Foreign Affairs) Conclusions of 25 October 2010 on the Republic of   Moldova and on the Eastern Partnership, a draft Action Plan on Visa\nLiberalisation for the Republic of Moldova (VLAP) has been discussed and was endorsed\nby the Council on 16 December 2010.\nThe Moldovan Government adopted the\nNational Annotated Action Plan on 17 February and presented it at the Senior\nOfficials Meeting on 18 February 2011.\nThe First Progress Report[5] on the implementation by the Republic of   Moldova of the Visa Liberalisation Action Plan was presented on 16 September\n2011. \nThe Second Progress Report[6] on the implementation by the Republic of   Moldova of the Action Plan on Visa Liberalisation was issued on 9 February\n2012. A Senior Officials Meeting took place on 27 February 2012 during which\nthe Second Progress Report was presented and the next steps in the process were\ndiscussed.\nThe Third Progress Report[7] on the implementation by the Republic of   Moldova of the Action Plan on Visa Liberalisation was issued on 22 June 2012.\nIt was the third and final progress report on the first phase of the VLAP and\nit presented a consolidated assessment by the Commission of the progress made\nby the Republic of Moldova in meeting the first phase benchmarks of the VLAP\nrelated to the establishment of the legislative, policy and institutional\nframework.\nThe wider assessment of possible migratory\nand security impacts of future visa liberalisation for Moldovan citizens\ntravelling to the EU was issued on 3 August 2012 by the Commission involving\nrelevant EU agencies and stakeholders.[8]\nOn 19 November 2012 the Council adopted\nConclusions in line with the Commission's assessment that the Republic of Moldova has fulfilled all the benchmarks under the first phase of the Action Plan\non Visa Liberalisation. The required legislative, policy and institutional framework\nhas been put in place. Subsequently, the assessment of the benchmarks set out\nunder the second phase was launched. \nA Senior Officials Meeting took place on 28\nJanuary 2013 during which the objectives of the second phase were presented\nalongside the preparation of the next evaluation missions. Evaluation missions\non Blocks 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the VLAP were organised from 18 February to 15 March\n2013. The evaluation missions were unparalleled in terms of scope and details\nof the assessment \u2013 4 weeks involving 12 experts from Member States accompanied\nby officials of the Commission and the EEAS. The purpose of these expert\nmissions was to assess the state of fulfilment of the second phase benchmarks\nof the Action Plan on Visa Liberalisation and assess the state of implementation\nof the legislative, policy and institutional framework, in compliance with the\nEuropean and international standards. The expert reports were finalised in May\n2013. The Fourth Progress Report was issued on 21 June 2013[9] and it presented the state of\nthe implementation of the legislative and institutional framework, the\nfunctioning of the institutions and the level of inter-agency coordination. \nThe Fifth Progress Report[10] adopted on 15 November 2013 presents\nthe level to which recommendations issued in the Fourth Report have been\nimplemented and the overall fulfilment of the second phase VLAP benchmarks.\nSpecial attention was paid to the sustainability of the reforms and the results\nachieved, including through meaningful staffing, capacity and funding. It\nincludes an assessment on the state of the fulfilment of the recommendations\naddressed to the Republic of Moldova contained in the Assessment of Impacts Report\nof August 2012. The Commission concluded in the report that the Republic of\nMoldova met all the benchmarks set in the four blocks of the second phase of\nthe VLAP, and that the Republic of Moldova has\nallocated appropriate financial and human resources to ensure that the reforms\nare sustainable. \nSince the launching of the EU-Republic of\nMoldova Visa Dialogue in June 2010 and the presentation to the Moldovan\nauthorities of the Action Plan on Visa Liberalisation in January 2011, the\nCommission has been regularly reporting to the European Parliament and to the\nCouncil on the progress made by the Republic of Moldova in fulfilling the\nbenchmarks identified under the four blocks of the first and second phase of\nthe VLAP.\nOver and above this extensive reporting\nprocess related to the VLAP, the Commission has also continued to monitor the\nprogress made by the Republic of Moldova in relevant areas of the VLAP through:\n\u00b7      the Senior Officials Meeting of the EU-Republic of Moldova Visa Dialogue;\n\u00b7      the EU-Republic of Moldova Joint Sub-Committee n\u00b03;\n\u00b7      the Senior Officials Meeting of the EU-Republic of Moldova Mobility Partnership;\n\u00b7      the EU-Republic of Moldova Human Rights Dialogue; \n\u00b7      the EU-Republic of Moldova Joint Readmission Committee; and\n\u00b7      the EU-Republic of Moldova Joint Visa Facilitation Committee.\nIn each of these committees and dialogues\nthe state of the cooperation between the EU and the Republic of Moldova is regularly addressed. During the last Visa Facilitation and Readmission Joint\nCommittees that took place on 12 June 2013 in Brussels, with the participation\nof Member States, the Commission registered an overall very satisfactory\nimplementation of both agreements.\nThe original EU-Republic of Moldova Visa Facilitation Agreement entered into force on 1 January 2008. It provided all the\ncitizens of the Republic of Moldova (hereinafter 'Moldovan citizens') with a reduced\nvisa fee and accelerated issuing procedures and specific categories of Moldovan\napplicants with a visa fee waiver, wider issuance of multiple-entry visas with\na long period of validity, and simplified supporting document requirements to\nprove the purpose of travel. It also contained a visa waiver for holders of\ndiplomatic passports.\nOn 1 July 2013, an upgraded Visa Facilitation Agreement with the Republic of   Moldova entered into force. This new agreement offers\nadditional facilitations and tangible benefits to Moldovan citizens: in\nparticular, (1) more categories of visa applicants benefit from the\nfacilitations foreseen in the initial agreement, (2) the provisions on the\nissuing of multiple-entry visas with a long period of validity to certain categories\nof bona fide travellers leave less discretion to the consuls, (3) the\ncooperation of Member States with external service providers is subjected to a\nclear legal framework, and (4) holders of biometric service passports are\nexempted from the visa obligation.\nThe Mobility Partnership with the Republic of Moldova was officially\nlaunched in September 2008 in Chisinau. It involves 15 Member States (Bulgaria,\nCzech republic, Germany, Greece, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary,\nPoland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia and Sweden) and two EU agencies\n(FRONTEX and the European Training Foundation), who have worked together to\npresent a coherent approach to cooperation with a partner country. There is a\nwide range of initiatives implemented in the context of the Partnership and it\nfully reflects the four dimensions of the Global Approach to Migration and\nMobility (GAMM): enhancing legal migration and facilitating mobility,\npreventing and combatting irregular migration and trafficking in human beings,\nmaximising the development impact of migration and mobility, and promoting\ninternational protection.\nThe settlement of the Transnistrian issue is not a condition for\nvisa liberalisation under the VLAP. Furthermore, in the\nVLAP there is no reference to territorial application. Visa liberalisation will\nbenefit the citizens that are holders of a biometric passport of the Republic of   Moldova. \nThe present proposal reflects the outcome\nof the above-mentioned processes: taking into account also that the Visa\nFacilitation and Readmission Agreements with the Republic of Moldova have been\nimplemented in a satisfactory way, the Commission proposes to transfer the\nRepublic of Moldova, which is meeting all the VLAP benchmarks, from the\nnegative to the positive list, however with a limitation of this visa waiver to\nthe holders of biometric passports issued in accordance with ICAO standards.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Next Steps\nThe EU-Republic of Moldova Visa Dialogue proved to be an important and particularly effective tool for advancing\nfar-reaching and difficult reforms in the Justice and Home Affairs area, but\nalso beyond impacting areas such as rule of law and justice reform, including\nsound party financing, review of immunities and administrative modernisation.\nThe progress achieved by the Republic of Moldova during the last three years in\nall the areas covered by the four blocks of the VLAP is steady and effective.\nIt demonstrates the commitment and the constant efforts made by the successive\nMoldovan governments and all State institutions in making the fulfilment of the\nVLAP benchmarks a national top priority. \nIt is relevant to recall that the reforms\nin several key areas covered by the VLAP were achieved in the first half of\n2013 despite an unstable political situation that lasted for several months, which\nindicate an appropriate level of good governance and maturity of the public\nadministration. \nImminent amendments to\nthe EU visa rules introduce a new visa waiver suspension mechanism, which\ncontributes to preserving the integrity of the visa liberalisation process and\nensures as a measure of last resort that visa free travel shall not lead to\nirregularities or abuse.\nThe Commission considers that since last\nJune the Republic of Moldova has made the necessary progress to\nensure the effective and sustainable implementation of the reforms it had to conduct in order to meet the VLAP benchmarks. All actions\nrequired following the 4th VLAP progress report have been\naccomplished. The functioning of the legislative and policy framework, the\nset-up of the institutional and organisational principles, and the\nimplementation of the procedures throughout the four blocks are in compliance\nwith the relevant European and international standards. \nBuilding upon the\npresent assessment, and referring to the outcome of the continuous monitoring\nand reporting made since the launch of the EU-Republic\nof Moldova Visa Dialogue, the Commission considers\nthat the Republic of Moldova meets all the benchmarks set in the four blocks of the\nsecond phase of the VLAP. Taking into account the overall relations between the\nEU and the Republic of Moldova and their dynamics, the Commission therefore presents\nthe necessary legislative proposal to amend EC Regulation 539/2001, in\naccordance with the agreed methodology under the VLAP.[11] \nIn this context, it is also worth looking\nat the available statistical data. About 230,000 Moldovans were legally\nresiding at the end of 2012 in the EU[12],\naccording to data on valid residence permits. Statistical data show that the\nrisk of irregular migration to the EU from Moldovan citizens has decreased in\nrecent years: since 2008, when 6,830 irregular Moldovan immigrants were\napprehended, the number of apprehensions has decreased every year, to reach\n3,070 in 2012, i.e. a decrease of 55%. Asylum applications have also halved (- 48%)\nover that period: 435 asylum applications were made by Moldovan citizens in\n2012 down from 837 in 2008. The ratio of effected returns compared to the\nnumber of return decisions issued is improving and reached 73% in 2012, compared\nto about 50% over the four previous years. Finally, while the number of\nshort-stay Schengen visa applications has remained stable over the past three\nyears (oscillating between 50,000 and 55,000), the refusal rate for visa\napplications has decreased sharply from 11.4% in 2010 to 6.5% in 2012. These\ndata confirm altogether that the migratory risk represented by Moldovan citizens\nhas substantially decreased. The amendments to the EU visa rules will introduce\na new visa waiver suspension mechanism in Regulation 539/2001, which\ncontributes to preserving the integrity of the visa liberalisation process and\nensures, as a measure of last resort, that visa-free travel will not lead to\nirregularities or abuse. \nThe Commission will\ncontinue actively to monitor the continuous implementation by the Republic of\nMoldova of all benchmarks under the four blocks of the VLAP in the framework of\nthe existing Partnership and Cooperation structures and dialogues, and, if\nnecessary, through ad hoc follow-up mechanisms. \nAs with the transfers of Western Balkan\ncountries to the visa-free regime, there is no reason to condition the\nimplementation of the visa waiver for the Republic of Moldova on the conclusion\nof a visa waiver agreement with the EU, taking into account the fact that the\nRepublic of Moldova has already exempted all EU citizens from the visa\nrequirement and that, should the visa-free regime be abused, the suspension\nmechanism would provide an effective solution.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Main organisations/experts\nconsulted\nMember States were consulted.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nNot necessary.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nIn view of the TFEU, this proposal\nconstitutes a development of the common visa policy in accordance with Article\n77 (2) (a) of the TFEU. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality and\nsubsidiarity principles\nRegulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third\ncountries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the\nexternal borders (the negative list) and those whose national are exempt from\nthat requirement (the positive list).\nThe decision to change the lists, to\ntransfer countries from the negative to the positive list or vice versa falls\nwithin the competence of the European Union in accordance with Article 77 (2)\n(a) of the TFEU.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instruments\nRegulation (EC) No 539/2001 is to be amended\nby a Regulation.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary implication\nThe proposed amendment has no implication\non the European Union budget.\n2013/0415 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001\nlisting the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when\ncrossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that\nrequirement\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the functioning\nof the European Union, and in particular Article 77(2)(a) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative\nprocedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The composition of the lists of third countries in Annexes\nI and II to Council Regulation (EC) N\u00b0 539/2001[13] should be, and should remain,\nconsistent with the criteria laid down therein.
