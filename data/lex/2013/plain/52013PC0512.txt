With some 1.8 million businesses, mostly SMEs, employing 5.2% of\nthe total workforce, the European tourism industry is an engine for growth in\nthe EU. The total contribution of European travel & tourism, including\nrelated sectors, accounts for around 10% of EU GDP[1] .\nThe adoption of Directive 90/314/EEC on\npackage travel[2]\nin 1990 created important rights for European travellers purchasing package\nholidays, typically consisting of passenger transport and accommodation. A 2002\nruling by the European Court of Justice[3]\nclarified that the notion of \"pre-arranged combination\" covers also\ntravel services combined by a travel agent at the customer's express request\njust before the conclusion of a contract between the two. \nDirective 90/314/EEC ensures that consumers\nreceive essential information before and after signing a package travel\ncontract. It provides that organisers and/or retailers are responsible for the\nproper performance of the package, even if the services are provided by\nsub-contractors, and regulates what happens if there are changes to the package\ntravel contract. It also ensures that travellers receive a refund of pre-payments\nand are repatriated in the event of the organiser's and/or retailer's\ninsolvency. \nHowever, in 1990 the structure of the\ntravel market was much simpler than today and the Internet did not exist.\nDespite the abovementioned CJEU ruling, it remains unclear to what extent\nmodern ways of combining travel services are covered by the Directive.\nAs highlighted in the 1999 Commission's\nreport[4]\non the implementation of the Directive, significant differences remain in the\nlaws transposing the Directive, due to its minimum harmonisation approach, the\nbroad discretion given to Member States, e.g. with regard to the liable party\nor parties, and ambiguities in the text. \nThe modernisation of Directive 90/314/EEC\nresponds to requests from the co-legislators, the European Economic and Social\nCommittee, as well as the European Consumer Consultative Group[5]. A large part of the industry\nand consumer organisations have also asked for a revision. A revision of the\nDirective is explicitly mentioned in the European Citizens' Reports[6], the European Consumer Agenda[7] and in the Single Market Act II[8].\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the proposal\n1.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of Internet\ndistribution and liberalisation in the airline sector\n73% of EU households had access to the\nInternet in 2011[9].\nAlmost two-thirds of EU citizens use the Internet at least once a week, more\nthan half of them every day or almost every day. Travel services are among the\nmost popular products purchased on-line. \nThe development of online sales and the\nliberalisation in the airline sector have changed the way in which consumers\norganise their holidays, having led to different ways in which traders assist\nconsumers in customising combinations of travel services, in particular online.\nThe relevant traders include travel agents, tour operators, airlines, cruise\nlines, etc. There is ambiguity in many Member States as to whether such\ncombinations fall under the scope of the Directive and whether traders involved\nin putting together such combinations are liable for the performance of the relevant\nservices, especially in the online environment.\nThis is causing uncertainty for traders and\nconsumers. \nIt also implies that market players which\nare today explicitly covered by the Directive are subject to different rules\nand different costs compared to those businesses which are not covered or do\nnot consider themselves to be covered by the Directive, although they are\ncompeting for the same customers. \n1.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unnecessary compliance\ncosts and obstacles to cross-border trade\nSome of the provisions of the Directive\nhave become outdated or otherwise create unnecessary burden for companies, such\nas information requirements for brochures and the inclusion of managed business\ntrips. \nLegal fragmentation through numerous\ndiscrepancies in the laws of the Member States generates additional costs for\nbusinesses wishing to trade cross-border. \n1.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumer detriment -\nunclear and outdated rules\nThe \"Consumer Detriment Study in the\narea of Dynamic Packages\"[10]\nestimated the yearly personal consumer detriment[11] in relation to combined travel\narrangements where the applicability of the Directive is uncertain. The study\nshowed that problems with such travel arrangements are more frequent and more\ndetrimental to consumers than problems related to traditional packages which\nare clearly covered by the Directive. \nTo a certain extent also consumers who buy\ntraditional pre-arranged packages suffer detriment, because some provisions of\nthe Directive are outdated, unclear or leave gaps, e.g. the absence of a right\nfor consumers to cancel the package before the departure.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objectives of the proposal\nIn accordance with Article 114 of the\nTreaty, the overall objective of the revised proposal is to enhance the\nfunctioning of the Internal Market and achieve a high level of consumer\nprotection through the approximation of rules on packages and other\ncombinations of travel services. \nThe proposal seeks to establish a level\nplaying field between operators, remove legal obstacles to cross-border trade\nand reduce compliance costs for businesses.\nAt the same time, it aims to achieve a high\nlevel of consumer protection and reduce consumer detriment by clarifying which\ncombinations of travel services are protected under EU package travel rules and\nreplacing unclear and outdated provisions. It contains mandatory rules for the\nprotection of travellers, which Member States or traders may not derogate from\nto the detriment of consumers.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with other\npolicies and objectives of the Union \nDuring the last decade the Commission undertook\na comprehensive review of the consumer acquis leading to the adoption of\nDirective 2008/122/EC on timeshare and Directive 2011/83/EU on consumer rights.\nThe revision of Directive 90/314/EEC is part of this exercise.\nThe proposal is complementary to existing\nEU law, in particular the Unfair Contract Terms Directive (93/13/EEC), the\nUnfair Commercial Practices Directive (2005/29/EC), the Consumer Rights\nDirective (2011/83/EU), the Regulations in the area of passenger rights\n(Regulations (EC) No. 2004/261, (EC) No. 1371/2007, (EC) No. 1177/2010 and (EC)\nNo. 181/2011) as well as Directives 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce and\n2006/123/EC on services in the internal market.\nFurthermore, the proposal is complementary\nto Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 (Rome I) on the law applicable to contractual\nobligations, and to Regulation 44/2001 (Brussels I) on the law on jurisdiction\nand the recognition and enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial\nmatters.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of interested\nparties\nIn 2008, in a public consultation on its\n2007 working document, the Commission received more than 80 contributions from\nbusiness stakeholders, consumer organisations, lawyers, academics and 14 Member\nStates. In January 2009, the Commission launched the Consumer Detriment Study,\nwhich covered 17 EU countries and was based on interviews with a sample of 500\nconsumers.\nIn a second public consultation of October\n2009, consisting of five on-line questionnaires targeted at consumers, consumer\norganisations, businesses, industry associations and Member States/public\nauthorities, 89% of public authorities, 70% of business associations, 64% of\nbusinesses and 96% of consumer organisations supported a revision of the\nDirective. \nIn a workshop for Member States of 27\nOctober 2009 particular problems and policy options were discussed. A subgroup\nof the European Consumer Consultative Group (ECCG) adopted its opinion on 21\nApril 2010.\nOn 22 April 2010 a stakeholder workshop\ndiscussed the impacts of the identified policy options. From September 2009 to\nOctober 2010 more than 15 interviews with key industry representatives were\nconducted. \nIn March 2012 the Commission commissioned a\nstudy to test a Package Travel Label and consumer behaviour when purchasing\nso-called dynamic packages. In June 2012 the Commission organised a workshop\nfor Member States and a stakeholder conference to further discuss the revision\nprocess. On 8 February 2013 the ECCG again requested a revision of the\nDirective.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact Assessment \nThe Impact Assessment (IA) analysed eight\npolicy options plus certain sub-options. \nOption 1 - Maintaining the status quo, i.e. maintaining the Directive in its present form \nOption 2 \u2013 Guidelines, i.e. maintaining the Directive in its current form and preparing\nguidelines, including CJEU rulings and clarification on the scope and liability\nOption 3 - Package Travel Label and/ or\nrequirement on traders selling assisted travel arrangements to state that the\nservices in question do not constitute a package (add-on options)\nSub-option A - introduction of a\n\"Package Travel Label\" \u2013 an obligatory logotype to be presented to\nconsumers when purchasing a package \nSub-option B - introduction of an\nobligation, for traders offering combined travel arrangements which are not\npackages, to clarify that they are not selling a package \nOption 4 - Repeal of the Directive and\nself-regulation by industry\nOption 5 - Modernisation of the\nDirective and coverage of \"one-trader packages\" \nOption 5 involves a legislative revision\nwhich would keep the main structure of the existing Directive, while clarifying\nits scope through the explicit inclusion of \"one-trader packages\" and\nrevising several provisions. The revised Directive would apply to travel\nservices which are combined for the same trip or holiday on one website or at\none high street agent.\nOption 6 \u2013 Graduated approach -\nmodernisation of the Directive and coverage of both \"one-trader\" and\n\"multi-trader\" packages while applying a lighter regime to\n\"multi-trader\" assisted travel arrangements \nThis option corresponds to Option 5\nsupplemented with a graduated extension of the scope of the Directive aimed to\ncover:\n- \"multi-trader\" packages,\ni.e. combinations of travel services through different traders showing certain\nfeatures associated with packages, which would be subject to the same regime as\nother packages (including full liability for the proper contractual performance\nand the obligation to procure insolvency protection),\n-\"multi-trader\" assisted travel\narrangements, i.e. those combinations of travel services which do not\ndisplay the typical features of packages and are hence less likely to mislead\nconsumers. They would be subject to a lighter regime consisting of insolvency\nprotection and an obligation to state in a clear and prominent manner that each\nindividual service provider is responsible for the correct performance of the\nservices.\nOption 7 \u2013 Modernisation of the\nDirective covering both \"one-trader\" packages and \"multi-trader\"\ntravel arrangements \nThis option includes Option 5 and 6, whilst\nsubjecting all \"multi-trader\" assisted travel arrangements to the\nsame obligations as packages. \nOption 8 \u2013 \u201cTravel Directive\u201d \nThis option includes Option 7 plus an\nextension of the scope to stand-alone travel services, e.g. car rental,\naccommodation or flights, containing in principle the same rules for all travel\nservices irrespective of whether they are part of a package or not.\nThe IA comes to the conclusion that the\nidentified problems will be resolved most appropriately by Option 6, which this\nproposal is based upon.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of the proposed\naction\nThe proposed Directive will clarify and\nmodernise the scope of travellers' protection when purchasing combinations of\ntravel services for the same trip or holiday by bringing within its scope\ndifferent forms of on-line packages and assisted travel arrangements.\nThe proposal will ensure that travellers\nare better informed about the services they are buying and grant them clearer\nremedies if something goes wrong. \nAt the same time, by reducing legal\nfragmentation and strengthening mutual recognition of insolvency protection,\nthe proposal will minimise obstacles to cross-border trade and reduce compliance\ncosts for traders wishing to operate cross-border, and ensure a level\nplaying-field in the travel market.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThis proposal is based on Article 114\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\nIt lays down largely uniform rules in the\narea of packages and assisted travel arrangements in the Union, giving traders\nand travellers certainty about the content of their rights and obligations\nirrespective of the national law applicable to the contract, thereby removing\nunnecessary costs for cross-border transactions and giving more choice to\nconsumers. \nIn accordance with Article 114 (3) TFEU,\nthe proposal guarantees a high level of consumer protection by maintaining or\nimproving the level of consumer protection compared with Directive 90/314/EEC. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal complies with the subsidiarity\nprinciple as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).\nThe objective of improving the functioning\nof the internal market, through removing differences between the laws of the\nMember States, and improving consumers' access to services from other Member\nStates, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting in an\nun-coordinated manner. \nTherefore, the Union is best placed to\naddress the identified problems by a legislative measure which approximates the\nnational rules. \n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the principle of\nproportionality as set out in Article 5 TEU. \nLike Directive 90/314/EEC, it does not\ncover all aspects of travel law, but only certain aspects of packages and other\ncombinations of travel services, where coordinated action by the Union is\ndeemed necessary. For instance, it does not interfere with general national\ncontract law and authorisation and licensing regimes. \nAccording to the IA, non-binding measures\nsuch as recommendations, guidelines or self-regulation cannot achieve the\nabovementioned objectives. \nA directive ensures a coherent set of\nrights and obligations, whilst allowing Member States to integrate these rules\ninto their national contract law. \nFurthermore, it will enable the Member\nStates to implement the most appropriate means of enforcement and the necessary\nsanctions for breaches of its rules. In certain areas the proposal gives Member\nStates the possibility to impose stricter rules. \n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact on Fundamental\nRights\nIn accordance with the Strategy for the\neffective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the European\nUnion[12],\nthe Commission has ensured that the proposal complies with the rights set out\nin the Charter and further promotes their application. In particular, the\nproposal respects the freedom to conduct a business laid down in Article 16 of\nthe Charter, while ensuring a high level of consumer protection, in accordance with\nArticle 38 of the Charter.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review clause\nThe proposal obliges the Commission to\npresent a report on the application of the Directive at the latest five years\nafter its entry into force and to submit it to the European Parliament and the\nCouncil, where necessary accompanied by legislative proposals. \n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European Economic Area\nThe proposed Directive concerns an EEA\nmatter and should therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n3.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Explanatory documents\nIn view of the complexity of the proposal and\nthe different ways in which the Member States have transposed Directive\n90/314/EEC, the Commission considers the transmission of documents explaining\nthe relationship between the components of this Directive and the corresponding\nparts of national transposition instruments to be justified.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Explanation of the\nproposal\nThe proposal consists of 29 articles and\ntwo annexes (a table relating articles of Directive 90/314/EEC to articles of\nthis proposal and the Legislative financial statement). \n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subject-matter, scope and\ndefinitions (Articles 1-3)\nArticle 1 sets out the subject-matter of\nthe Directive. In conjunction with the definitions of 'package' and 'assisted travel\narrangement' contained in Article 3, Article 2 determines its scope, taking\ninto account the different ways in which travel services can be combined. \nBased on the way in which travel services\nare presented to the traveller, combinations which meet any of the alternative\ncriteria laid down in Article 3 (2) will be considered as packages with the\nassociated legal consequences for information requirements, liability and\ninsolvency protection. \nCombinations where retailers, through\nlinked booking processes, facilitate the procurement of additional travel\nservices in a targeted manner or where the traveller concludes contracts with\nthe individual service providers and where the defining features of a package,\ne.g. an inclusive or total price, are not present, are defined as 'assisted\ntravel arrangements'. Retailers who are in the business of facilitating the\npurchase of 'assisted travel arrangements' are subject to the requirement to\nexplain clearly to travellers that only the individual service providers are\nliable for the performance of the travel services concerned. Furthermore, with\na view to ensuring a certain layer of additional, Union-wide protection\ncompared to the one stemming from rules on passenger rights or general consumer\nacquis also for travellers buying more than one travel service through them, it\nis appropriate to provide that such retailers have to ensure that, in case of\ntheir own insolvency or the insolvency of any of the service providers, travellers\nwill receive a refund of their pre-payments and, where relevant, will be\nrepatriated. \nSince it is not appropriate to grant the\nsame level of protection to business travellers whose travel arrangements are\nmade on the basis of a framework contract concluded between their employers and\nspecialised operators often offering, on a business-to-business basis, a level\nof protection similar to the one stemming from this Directive (so-called\nmanaged business travel), such travel arrangements are excluded from the scope.\nOther limitations of the scope are\nmaintained, including for so-called occasionally organised packages.\nApart from 'packages' and 'assisted travel\narrangements' Article 3 defines other key terms of the Directive, including\n'traveller', 'organiser', 'retailer' and 'unavoidable and extraordinary\ncircumstances'. The 'organiser' is defined as a trader who combines and sells/\noffers for sale packages, either directly or through/together with another\ntrader. Organisers are liable for the performance of the package (Articles 11 and\n12), for providing assistance to the traveller (Article 14) and procuring\ninsolvency protection (Article 15). Retailers and organisers are both liable\nfor providing pre-contractual information (Article 4). Retailers are\nliable for booking errors (Article 19). Retailers facilitating the procurement\nof assisted travel arrangements are obliged to procure insolvency protection\n(Article 15).\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information obligations,\nconclusion and content of the package travel contract (Articles 4 -6)\nArticle 4 lists specific pre-contractual\ninformation which organisers and, where applicable, retailers have to provide\nto travellers wishing to buy a package. These requirements apply in addition to\ninformation requirements under other applicable directives or regulations. \nArticle 5 regulates the conclusion of the\npackage travel contract.\nArticle 6 contains provisions on the content\nand the presentation of the contract or its confirmation as well as on\ndocuments and information to be provided before the start of the package.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Changes to the contract\nbefore the start of the package (Articles 7-10)\nSimilarly to Article 4 (3) of Directive\n90/314/EEC, Article 7 lays down the conditions under which the traveller's\nright to transfer the package to another person may be exercised. \nStarting from the principle that agreed\nprices are binding, Article 8 lays down rules on the possibility and\nconsequences of price changes, given that package travel contracts are often\nconcluded a long time in advance. These rules are based on the same principles as\nArticle 4 (4) \u2013 (6) of Directive 90/314/EEC. \nArticle 8 (2) maintains the right to impose\nprice increases related to cost of fuel, taxes and exchange rate fluctuations,\nbut clarifies the conditions compared with Directive 90/314/EEC. If an\norganiser reserves the right to price increases, it is now also obliged to\ngrant travellers price reductions. Prices may not be increased by more than 10%\nof the price of the package. \nWith regard to changes other than price\nchanges, distinct rules are set out for insignificant (Article 9(1)) and\nsignificant changes (Article 9 (2) and (3)).\nCompared with Directive 90/314/EEC, Article\n10 contains additional termination rights for travellers before the start of\nthe package. The right for travellers to terminate the contract against an\nappropriate compensation (Article 10 (1)) corresponds to rules and practices found\nin the Member States. Article 10 (2) grants travellers the right to terminate\nthe contract without compensation in the event of unavoidable and extraordinary\ncircumstances.\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Performance of the package\n(Articles 11-14)\nThese articles contain rules on the\norganiser's liability for the performance of the package (Articles 11-13) and\nthe obligation to provide assistance to the traveller (Article 14). \nIn contrast to Directive 90/314/EEC, only\nthe organiser is liable for the performance of the package. This aims to avoid\na doubling of costs and litigation. At the same time, uniform rules on\nliability will facilitate cross-border transactions by organisers and\nretailers. \nArticles 11 and 12 provide for the remedies\navailable to the traveller in the event of lack of conformity, including the\nlack of performance and the improper performance of the services. These rules\nare based on the same principles as Articles 5 and 6 of Directive 90/314/EEC,\nbut are presented in a more systematic fashion, providing certain\nclarifications and closing certain gaps. \nArticle 11 lays down the obligations to\nremedy the lack of conformity and to make suitable alternative arrangements for\nthe continuation of the package where a significant proportion of the services\ncannot be provided as agreed in the contract. It is clarified that the latter\nobligation applies also where the traveller's return to the place of departure\nis not provided as agreed. However, where it is impossible to ensure the\ntraveller's timely return because of unavoidable and extraordinary\ncircumstances, the organiser's obligation to bear the cost for the continued\nstay is limited to EUR 100 per night and three nights per traveller in line\nwith the proposed amendment to Regulation (EC) No 261/2004.\nArticle 12 contains provisions on price\nreductions related to lack of conformity and to alternative arrangements resulting\nin a package of lower quality, as well as on damages. In accordance with the\nCourt's ruling in Case C-168/00 Simone Leitner, paragraph 2 clarifies that also\nnon-material damage has to be compensated. Paragraph 4 regulates the\nrelationship with compensation based on other legal grounds. \nSince for many travellers the first point\nof contact is the retailer through which they booked the package, Article 13 provides\nthat travellers may address messages, complaints or claims also to the\nretailer, the receipt of such notifications being decisive for compliance with\nany time-limits or prescription periods. \nUnder Article 14, organisers are obliged to\nprovide assistance to travellers who are in difficulty. \n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Insolvency protection\n(Articles 15 and 16)\nDirective 90/314/EEC created a general\nobligation for 'the organiser and/or retailer' to provide insolvency protection\nso as to ensure the repatriation of passengers and the refund of advance\npayments in the event of insolvency. Due to different legal solutions chosen by\nthe Member States, this often led to duplication of costs for organisers and\nretailers. According to Article 15 of this proposal, only package organisers and\nretailers who facilitate the purchase of 'assisted travel arrangements' are\nsubject to this obligation. At the same time, it lays down more specific\ncriteria on the effectiveness and the scope of the required protection. \nTo facilitate cross-border operations,\nArticle 16 (1) explicitly provides for the mutual recognition of insolvency\nprotection procured under the law of the organiser's/relevant retailer's Member\nState of establishment. To ensure administrative cooperation, Article 16 obliges\nMember States to designate central contact points. \n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information requirements\nfor assisted travel arrangements (Article 17)\nTo ensure legal certainty and transparency\nfor the parties, retailers offering assisted travel arrangements have to\nexplain to travellers in a clear and prominent manner that only the relevant\nservice providers are liable for performance of the services and that\ntravellers will not benefit from any of the Union rights granted to package\ntravellers, except the right to a refund of pre-payments and, where relevant,\nto repatriation in case the retailer itself or any of the service providers\nbecomes insolvent. \n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General provisions\n(Articles 18 \u2013 26)\nArticle 18 contains particular rules for\npackages where the organiser it established outside the EEA.\nUnder Article 19, retailers involved in the\nbooking of packages and assisted travel arrangements are liable for booking\nerrors.\nArticle 20 clarifies that this Directive\ndoes not affect the organiser's right to seek redress from third parties.\nArticle 21 confirms the imperative nature\nof the Directive. \nArticle 22 on enforcement is a standard\nprovision in the consumer acquis.\nArticle 23 is a standard provision on\npenalties for infringements of the national provisions transposing this Directive.\nSimilar provisions can be found in the Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU)\nand in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (2005/29/EC).\nArticle 24 obliges the Commission to submit\na report on the application of this Directive to the European Parliament and\nthe Council.\nArticle 25 (2) amends Directive 2011/83 on\nconsumer rights to ensure that that Directive applies fully to assisted travel\narrangements and that certain general consumer rights apply also to packages.\n4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Final provisions (Articles\n27 - 29)\nArticle 26 repeals Directive 90/314/EEC. Article 27 is a standard provision on transposition and fixes a\ntransposition time-limit of 18 months. Articles 28 and 29 are standard\nprovisions.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS \nThe\nproposal has very limited budgetary implications. The only operational costs\nrelate to the preparation of the report on the\napplication of this Directive, covering the preparatory work of an external\ncontractor, i.e. operational appropriation of \u20ac0.2 million under the Rights and\nCitizenship programme, as well as administrative expenditure of around \u20ac0,184\nmillion during seven years after the adoption of the Directive. This\nexpenditure will be borne by internal redeployment and not entail an increase\nin the funds.\n2013/0246 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non package travel and assisted travel\narrangements, amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004,\u00a0 Directive 2011/83/EU and\nrepealing Council Directive 90/314/EEC\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[13],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[14],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive\n90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package\ntours[15]\nlays down a number of important consumer rights in relation to package travel,\nin particular with regard to information requirements, the liability of traders\nin relation to the performance of a package and protection against the\ninsolvency of an organiser or a retailer. However, it is necessary to adapt the\nlegislative framework to market developments, in order to make it more suitable\nfor the internal market, remove ambiguities and close legislative gaps. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tourism plays an important\nrole in the economies of the Union and packages represent a significant\nproportion of that market. The travel market has undergone considerable changes\nsince the adoption of Directive 90/314/EEC. In addition to traditional\ndistribution chains, the Internet has become an increasingly important medium\nto offer travel services. Travel services are not only combined in the form of\ntraditional pre-arranged packages, but are often combined in a customised\nfashion. Many of these travel products are either in a legal grey zone or are\nclearly not covered by Directive 90/314/EEC. This Directive aims to adapt the\nscope of protection to those developments, enhance transparency and increase\nlegal certainty for travellers and traders.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 169 of the Treaty\non the Functioning of the European Union (the Treaty) provides that the Union\nis to contribute to the attainment of a high level of consumer protection\nthrough measures adopted pursuant to Article 114 of the Treaty.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 90/314/EEC gives\nbroad discretion to the Member States as regards transposition; therefore,\nsignificant divergences between the laws of the Member States remain. Legal\nfragmentation leads to higher costs for businesses and obstacles for those\nwishing to operate cross-border, thus limiting consumers' choice. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n26(2) of the Treaty, the internal market is to comprise an area without\ninternal frontiers in which the free movement of goods and services and the\nfreedom of establishment are ensured. The harmonisation of certain aspects of\npackage contracts and assisted travel arrangements is necessary for the\ncreation of a real consumer internal market in this area, striking the right\nbalance between a high level of consumer protection and the competitiveness of businesses.\n\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The cross-border potential\nof the package travel market in the Union is currently not fully exploited.\nDisparities in the rules protecting travellers in different Member States are a\ndisincentive for travellers in one Member State from buying packages and assisted\ntravel arrangements in another Member State and, likewise, a disincentive for\norganisers and retailers in one Member State from selling such services in\nanother Member State. In order to enable consumers and businesses to benefit fully\nfrom the internal market, while ensuring a high level of consumer protection\nacross the Union, it is necessary to further approximate the laws of the Member\nStates relating to packages and assisted travel arrangements. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The majority of travellers\nbuying packages are consumers in the sense of Union consumer law. At the same\ntime, it is not always easy to distinguish between consumers and representatives\nof small businesses or professionals who book trips related to their business\nor profession through the same booking channels as consumers. Such travellers\noften require a similar level of protection. In contrast, larger companies or\norganisations often make travel arrangements for their employees on the basis\nof a framework contract with companies which specialise in the arrangement of\nbusiness travel. The latter type of travel arrangements do not require the\nlevel of protection designed for consumers. Therefore, this Directive should\napply to business travellers only insofar as they do not make travel\narrangements on the basis of a framework contract. To avoid confusion with the\ndefinition of the term 'consumer' in other consumer protection directives, persons\nprotected under this Directive should be referred to as 'travellers'.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since travel services may\nbe combined in many different ways, it is appropriate to consider as packages\nall combinations of travel services that display features which travellers typically\nassociate with packages, notably that separate travel services are bundled\ntogether into a single travel product for which the organiser assumes\nresponsibility for proper performance. In accordance with the case law of the\nCourt of Justice of the European Union[16],\nit should make no difference whether travel services are combined before any\ncontact with the traveller or at the request of or according to the selection\nmade by the traveller. The same principles should apply irrespective of whether\nthe booking is made through a high street travel agent or online. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the sake of\ntransparency, packages should be distinguished from assisted travel\narrangements, where online or high street agents assist travellers in combining\ntravel services leading the traveller to conclude contracts with different\nproviders of travel services, including through linked booking processes, which\ndo not contain those features and in relation to which it would not be\nappropriate to apply all obligations applying to packages. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of market\ndevelopments, it is appropriate to further define packages on the basis of\nalternative objective criteria which predominantly relate to the way in which\nthe travel services are presented or purchased and where travellers may\nreasonably expect to be protected by the Directive. This is the case, for\ninstance where different travel services are purchased for the same trip or\nholiday within the same booking process from a single point of sale or where\nsuch services are offered or charged at an inclusive or total price. It should\nbe considered that travel services are procured within the same booking process\nif they are selected before the traveller has agreed to pay. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time, assisted travel\narrangements should be distinguished from travel services which travellers book\nindependently, often at different times, even for the purpose of the same trip\nor holiday. Online assisted travel arrangements should also be distinguished\nfrom links through which travellers are simply informed about further travel\nservices in a general fashion, for instance where a hotel or an organiser of an\nevent includes on its website a list of all operators offering transport\nservices to its location independently of any booking or if cookies or meta\ndata are used to place advertisements on websites. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purchase of an air\ntravel service on a stand-alone basis as a single travel service constitutes\nneither a package nor an assisted travel arrangement.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Particular rules should be\nlaid down for both high street and on-line retailers which assist travellers, on\nthe occasion of a single visit or contact with their own point of sale, in concluding\nseparate contracts with individual service providers and for online retailers\nwhich, through linked online booking processes, facilitate the procurement of\nadditional travel services from another trader in a targeted manner, at the\nlatest when the booking of the first service is confirmed. These rules would\napply for example, where, along with the confirmation of the booking of a first\ntravel service such as a flight or a train journey, a consumer receives an\ninvitation to book an additional travel service available at the chosen travel\ndestination, for instance hotel accommodation, with a link to the booking site\nof another service provider or intermediary. While those arrangements do not\nconstitute packages within the meaning of this Directive as there can be no\nconfusion that a single organiser has assumed the responsibility for the travel\nservices, such assisted arrangements constitute an alternative business model\nthat often competes closely with packages. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure fair\ncompetition and to protect consumers, the obligation to provide sufficient\nevidence of security for the refund of pre-payments and the repatriation of\ntravellers in the event of insolvency should also apply to assisted travel\narrangements.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To increase clarity for\ntravellers and enable them to make informed choices as to the different types\nof travel arrangements on offer, it is appropriate to require traders to state the\nnature of the arrangement clearly and inform travellers of their rights. A\ntrader's declaration as to the legal nature of the travel product being\nmarketed should correspond to the true legal nature of the product concerned. The\nenforcement authorities should intervene where traders do not provide accurate\ninformation to travellers. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Only the combination of\ndifferent travel services, such as accommodation, carriage of passengers by\nbus, rail, water or air, as well as car rental, should be considered for the\npurposes of identifying a package or an assisted travel arrangement.\nAccommodation for residential purposes, including for long-term language\ncourses, should not be considered as accommodation within the meaning of this\nDirective. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other tourist services,\nsuch as admission to concerts, sport events, excursions or event parks are\nservices that, in combination with either carriage of passengers, accommodation\nand/or car rental, should be considered as capable of constituting a package or\nan assisted travel arrangement. However, such packages should only fall within\nthe scope of this Directive if the relevant tourist service accounts for a\nsignificant proportion of the package. Generally, the tourist service should be\nconsidered as a significant proportion of the package if it accounts for more\nthan 20% of the total price or otherwise represents an essential feature of the\ntrip or holiday. Ancillary services, such as travel insurance, transport of\nluggage, meals and cleaning provided as part of accommodation, should not be\nconsidered as tourist services in their own right.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should also be clarified\nthat contracts by which a trader entitles the traveller after the conclusion of\nthe contract to choose among a selection of different types of travel services,\nsuch as in the case of a package travel gift box, should constitute a package. Moreover,\na combination of travel services should be considered as a package where the\ntraveller's name or particulars needed to conclude the booking transaction are\ntransferred between the traders at the latest when the booking of the first\nservice is confirmed. Particulars needed to conclude a booking transaction relate\nto credit card details or other information necessary to obtain a payment. On\nthe other hand, the mere transfer of particulars such as the travel destination\nor travel times should not be sufficient. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since there is less need to\nprotect travellers in cases of short-term trips, and in order to avoid\nunnecessary burden for traders, trips lasting less than 24 hours which do not\ninclude accommodation as well as occasionally organised packages, should be\nexcluded from the scope of this Directive. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main characteristic of\npackage travel is that at least one trader is responsible as an organiser for\nthe proper performance of the package as a whole. Therefore, only in cases\nwhere another trader is acting as the organiser of a package should a trader,\ntypically a high-street or on-line travel agent, be able to act as a mere\nretailer or intermediary and not be liable as an organiser. Whether a trader is\nacting as an organiser for a given package should depend on its involvement in\nthe creation of a package as defined under this Directive, and not on the\ndenomination under which it carries out its business. Where two or more traders\nmeet a criterion which makes the combination of travel services a package and\nwhere those traders have not informed the traveller which of them is the\norganiser of the package, all relevant traders should be considered as\norganisers. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In relation to packages, retailers\nshould be responsible together with the organiser for the provision of\npre-contractual information. At the same time it should be clarified that they\nare liable for booking errors. To facilitate communication, in particular in\ncross-border cases, travellers should have the possibility of contacting the\norganiser also via the retailer through which they bought the package. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The traveller should\nreceive all necessary information before purchasing a package, whether it is\nsold through means of distance communication, over the counter or through other\ntypes of distribution. In providing this information, the trader should take\ninto account the specific needs of travellers who are particularly vulnerable\nbecause of their age or physical infirmity, which the trader could reasonably\nforesee.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Key information, for\nexample on the main characteristics of the travel services or the prices,\nprovided in advertisements, on the organiser's website or in brochures as part\nof the pre-contractual information, should be binding, unless the organiser\nreserves the right to make changes to those elements and unless such changes\nare clearly and prominently communicated to the traveller before the contract\nis concluded. However, in light of new communication technologies, there is no\nlonger any need to lay down specific rules on brochures, while it is\nappropriate to ensure that, in certain circumstances, changes impacting the\ncontract performance are communicated between the parties on a durable medium\naccessible for future reference. It should always be possible to make changes\nto that information where both parties to the contract expressly agree on that.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The information\nrequirements laid down in this Directive are exhaustive, but should be without\nprejudice to the information requirements provided for in other applicable\nUnion legislation[17].\n\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\nspecificities of package travel contracts, rights and obligations of the\nparties should be laid down, for the time before and after the start of the\npackage, in particular if the package is not properly performed or if\nparticular circumstances change.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since packages are often\npurchased a long time before their performance, unforeseen events may occur.\nTherefore the traveller should, under certain conditions, be entitled to\ntransfer a package to another traveller. In such situations, the organiser\nshould be able to recover his expenses, for instance if a sub-contractor\nrequires a fee for changing the name of the traveller or for cancelling a\ntransport ticket and issuing a new one. Travellers should also have the\npossibility of cancelling the contract at any time before the start of the\npackage against paying appropriate compensation, as well as the right to\nterminate the contract without paying compensation where unavoidable and\nextraordinary circumstances like warfare or a natural disaster will\nsignificantly affect the package. Unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances\nshould in particular be deemed to exist where reliable and publicly available\nreports, such as recommendations issued by Member State authorities, advise\nagainst travelling to the place of destination.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In specific situations,\nalso the organiser should be entitled to terminate the contract before the\nstart of the package without paying compensation, for instance if the minimum\nnumber of participants is not reached and where this possibility has been\nreserved in the contract. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In certain cases organisers\nshould be allowed to make unilateral changes to the package travel contract.\nHowever, travellers should have the right to terminate the contract if the\nproposed alterations change significantly any of the main characteristics of\nthe travel services. Price increases should be possible only if there has been\na change in the cost of fuel for the carriage of passengers, in taxes or fees\nimposed by a third party not directly involved in the performance of the\nincluded travel services or in the exchange rates relevant to the package and\nif both an upward and downward revision of the price is expressly reserved in\nthe contract. Price increases should be limited to 10% of the price of the\npackage.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to set\nout specific rules on remedies as regards the lack of conformity in the\nperformance of the package travel contract. The traveller should be entitled to\nhave problems resolved and, where a significant proportion of the services\ncontracted for cannot be provided, the traveller should be offered alternative\narrangements. Travellers should also be entitled to a price reduction and/or\ncompensation for damages. Compensation should also cover any immaterial damage,\nin particular in case of a spoilt holiday, and, in justified cases, expenses\nwhich the traveller incurred when resolving a problem himself.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\nconsistency, it is appropriate to align the provisions of this Directive with\ninternational conventions covering travel services and with the Union\nlegislation on passenger rights. Where the organiser is liable for failure to\nperform or improper performance of the services included in the package travel\ncontract, the organiser should be able to invoke the limitations of the\nliability of service providers set out in such international conventions as the\nMontreal Convention of 1999 for the Unification of certain Rules for\nInternational Carriage by Air[18],\nthe Convention of 1980 concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF)[19] and the Athens Convention of\n1974 on the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea[20]. Where it is impossible,\nbecause of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances, to ensure the\ntraveller's return to the place of departure, the organiser's obligation to\nbear the cost of the travellers' continued stay at the place of destination\nshould be aligned with the Commission's proposal[21] aimed to amend Regulation (EC)\nNo 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004\nestablishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the\nevent of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights[22].\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should not\naffect the rights of travellers to present claims both under this Directive and\nunder any other relevant Union legislation, so that travellers will continue to\nhave the possibility to address claims to the organiser, the carrier or any\nother liable party, or, as the case may be, to several parties. It should be\nclarified that they may not cumulate rights under different legal bases if the\nrights safeguard the same interest or have the same objective. The organiser's\nliability is without prejudice to the right to seek redress from third parties,\nincluding service providers.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the traveller is in\ndifficulty during the trip or holiday, the organiser should be obliged to give\nprompt assistance. Such assistance should consist mainly in providing, where\nappropriate, information on aspects such as health services, local authorities\nand consular assistance, as well as practical help, for instance with regard to\ndistance communications and alternative travel arrangements.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Communication on\npassenger protection in the event of airline insolvency,[23] the Commission set out\nmeasures to improve the protection of travellers in the event of an airline\ninsolvency, including better enforcement of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 on\ncommon rules for the operation of air services in the Community[24], of Regulation No 261/2004 on\nair passenger rights and engagement with industry stakeholders, failing which a\nlegislative measure could be considered. That Communication concerns the\npurchase of an individual component, namely air travel services, and therefore is\nwithout prejudice to existing rules on packages and does not prevent the legislators\nto provide for insolvency protection also for buyers of other modern\ncombinations of travel services.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should ensure\nthat travellers purchasing a package or an assisted travel arrangement are\nfully protected against the insolvency of the organiser, of the retailer having\nfacilitated the assisted travel arrangement or of any of the service providers.\nMember States in which package organisers and retailers facilitating assisted\ntravel arrangements are established should ensure that traders offering such\ncombinations of travel services provide security for the refund of all payments\nmade by travellers and for their repatriation in the event of insolvency. While\nretaining discretion as to the way in which insolvency protection is granted,\nMember States should ensure that their national insolvency protection schemes\nare effective and able to guarantee prompt repatriation and the refund of all\ntravellers affected by the insolvency. The required insolvency protection\nshould take into account the actual financial risk of the activities of the\norganiser, relevant retailer or service provider, including the type of combination\nof travel services they sell, foreseeable seasonal fluctuations as well as the\nextent of pre-payments and the way in which these are secured. In accordance\nwith Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\nDecember 2006 on services in the internal market[25], in cases where insolvency\nprotection may be provided in the form of a guarantee or an insurance policy,\nsuch security may not be limited to attestations issued by financial operators\nestablished in a particular Member State. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\nfree movement of services, Member States should be obliged to recognise\ninsolvency protection under the law of the Member State of establishment. To\nfacilitate the administrative cooperation and supervision of businesses which\nare active in different Member States with regard to insolvency protection,\nMember States should be obliged to designate central contact points.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards assisted travel\narrangements, beyond the obligation to provide insolvency protection and to\ninform travellers that individual service providers are solely responsible for\ntheir contractual performance, the relevant contracts are subject to general Union\nconsumer protection legislation and sector-specific Union legislation. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\nprotect travellers in situations where a retailer arranges the booking of a\npackage or an assisted travel arrangement and where the retailer makes mistakes\nin the booking process. \n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also appropriate to\nconfirm that consumers may not waive rights stemming from this Directive and\norganisers or traders facilitating assisted travel arrangements may not escape\nfrom their obligations by claiming that they are simply acting as a service\nprovider, an intermediary or in any other capacity.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary that Member\nStates lay down penalties for infringements of national provisions transposing\nthis Directive and ensure that they are enforced. The penalties should be\neffective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The adoption of this\nDirective makes it necessary to adapt certain consumer protection acts. Taking\ninto account that Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and the\nCouncil of 25 October 2011 on consumer rights[26]\nin its current form does not apply to contracts covered by Directive 90/314/EEC,\nit is necessary to amend Directive 2011/83/EU to ensure that it applies to assisted\ntravel arrangements and that certain consumer rights laid down in that\nDirective also apply to packages.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should be\nwithout prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and\nof the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations\n(Rome I)[27]\nand national contract law for those aspects that are not regulated by it. Since\nthis Directive aims to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal\nmarket and to the achievement of a high level of consumer protection, its objectives\ncannot be achieved by the Member States and can be better achieved at Union\nlevel. Therefore, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the\nprinciple of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that\nArticle, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\nachieve its objectives. \n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects the\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of\nFundamental Rights of the European Union. The proposal, in particular, respects\nthe freedom to conduct a business laid down in Article 16 of the Charter, while\nensuring a high level of consumer protection within the Union, in accordance\nwith Article 38 of the Charter.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nJoint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September\n2011 on explanatory documents, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in\njustified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or\nmore documents explaining the relationship between the components of a\ndirective and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With\nregard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such\ndocuments to be justified,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nChapter I\nSubject matter, scope and definitions\nArticle 1\nSubject matter \nThis Directive is to contribute to the proper\nfunctioning of the internal market and to the achievement of a high level of consumer\nprotection by approximating certain aspects of the laws, regulations and\nadministrative provisions of the Member States in respect of contracts on\npackage travel and assisted travel arrangements concluded between travellers\nand traders. \nArticle 2\nScope \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive shall apply\nto packages offered for sale or sold by traders to travellers, with the\nexception of Article 17, and to assisted travel arrangements with the exception\nof Articles 4 to 14, Articles 18 and Article 21(1).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive shall not\napply to: \n(a)         \npackages and assisted travel arrangements\ncovering a period of less than 24 hours unless overnight accommodation is\nincluded;\n(b)         \nancillary contracts covering financial services;\n\n(c)         \npackages and assisted travel arrangements purchased\non the basis of a framework contract between the traveller's employer and a\ntrader specialising in the arrangement of business travel; \n(d)         \npackages where not more than one travel service\nas referred to in points (a), (b), and (c) of Article 3(1) is combined with a\ntravel service as referred to in point (d) of Article 3(1) if this service does\nnot account for a significant proportion of the package;

\n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term \n\u2013              \nClarify and modernise the scope of travellers'\nprotection when purchasing combinations of travel services for the same trip or\nholiday by bringing in particular on-line packages and assisted travel\narrangements within the scope of the revised Directive, whilst clarifying, in a\ntargeted manner, the scope of protection for bookings through traditional brick\nand mortar travel agents. This will lead to increased transparency for all\nmarket players.\n\u2013              \nEnsuring that travellers are better informed\nabout the travel products they are buying and grant them access to clearer\nremedies if something goes wrong, thus substantially reducing the detriment\nthey suffer. \n\u2013              \nMinimise obstacles to cross-border trade and\nreduce compliance costs for traders who want to sell packages across borders;\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\n\u00b7              \nThe proposal will eliminate internal market\nfragmentation causing obstacles to cross-border trader and distortions of\ncompetition, as well as enhance the protection of consumers, taking into\naccount new market developments. \n\u00b7              \nThis objective cannot be sufficiently achieved\nby the Member States, given the disparities between national laws that are the\nreason for internal market barriers and distortions of competition. If the\nMember States addressed new market developments as well as regulatory gaps and\ninconsistencies in EU law in an uncoordinated manner, this would create even\nmore fragmentation in the Internal Market and exacerbate the problem.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\n\u00b7              \nThe adoption of the Package Travel Directive in\n1990 made a significant contribution to the development of the Single Market,\nincreasing competition and improving the overall quality of offers. The\nmodernised Directive should bring the similar positive outcomes for consumers\nand businesses.\n\u00b7              \nThe Consumer Rights Directive has similar\nobjectives as the current revision i.e. reducing obstacles to cross-border\ntrade and ensuring a high level of consumer protection. However, as the\nDirective will be applied in all Member States only at the latest by 13\nJune 2014 the lessons learnt are limited.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\n\u00b7              \nThis proposal is consistent with the objective\nof attaining a high level of consumer protection as it contains mandatory rules\nof protection of the traveller which Member States or traders cannot derogate\nfrom to the detriment of the consumer. \n\u00b7              \nThe proposal is complementary to existing EU\nlaw, in particular the Unfair Contract Terms Directive (1993/13/EEC), the\nUnfair Commercial Practices Directive (2005/29/EC), the Consumer Rights\nDirective (2011/83/EU), the Regulations in the area of Passenger Rights (Regulations\n(EC) No. 2004/261, (EC) No. 1371/2007, (EC) No. 1177/2010 and (EC) No.\n181/2011) as well as Directives 2000/31/EC on Electronic Commerce and\n2006/123/EC on Services in the internal market.\n\u00b7              \nFurthermore, the proposal is also complementary\nto Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 (Rome I) on the law applicable to contractual\nobligations, and to Regulation 44/2001 (Brussels I) on the law on jurisdiction\nand the recognition and enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial\nmatters; in particular, it does not alter their references to travel packages\nas further outlined in Joined Cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 ('Pammer' and\n'Alpenhof') by the CJEU. \n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \nX Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from n to\nn+3,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged[36]\n\nX Centralised direct management by the\nCommission \n\u00a8 Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[37]\n\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third\ncountries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international\norganisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\n\"Comments\" section.\nComments \nThe\nimplementation is not expected to require significant funds.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules \nSpecify frequency\nand conditions.\n\u00b7              \nBy 5 years after its entry into force, the\nCommission shall submit a report on the application of this Directive to the\nEuropean Parliament and the Council.
