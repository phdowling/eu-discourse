The amendments concern in particular the extension\nof the average maturity of the overall facility from \u201cup to 12.5 years\u201d to \u201cup\nto 19.5 years\u201d by extending the maturities of the individual disbursements.\nAt the request of Ireland and market\nconditions permitting, the Commission may refinance all or part of its initial\nborrowing in order to extend the maturity of an instalment or a tranche,\nprovided that the maximum average maturity of 19.5 years is respected. Any\namounts borrowed by the Commssion in advance shall be kept on an account with\nthe ECB that the Commission has opened for the administration of the financial\nassistance. The Commission will also make sure that the maturity at which the\nrefinancing operations are made caters for the proper management of the margin\nunder the EU Own Resouces ceiling, including the redemption profile of the EU\nbonds.. The refinancing operations are expected to take place from 2015 and all\ncosts incurred by the EU in concluding and carrying out each operation will be\nborne by Ireland.\nIt should be\nnoted that such decision will enhance the sustainability and improve the\nliquidity outlook of the programme. This results in improved borrowing\nconditions for the sovereign as well as spill-over effects to the private\nsector. These effects are beneficial for both creditor and debtor countries and\ntherefore contributes to the stability of the euro area.\nTaking into account the above explanations,\nthe Commission considers that the changes consisting in the extension of the\naverage maturity of the EFSM loan to Ireland are beneficial to securing the\nprogramme's objectives. \n2013/0167 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\namending Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU\non granting Union financial assistance to Ireland\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EU) No\n407/2010 of 11 May 2010 establishing a European financial stabilisation\nmechanism[1],\nand in particular Article 3(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon\na request by Ireland, the Council granted financial assistance to Ireland (Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU[2])\nin support of a strong economic and reform programme\naiming at restoring confidence, enabling the return of\nthe economy to sustainable growth, and safeguarding financial stability in Ireland,\nthe euro area and the Union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission completed\nthe\u00a0 ninth review of the Irish economic reform programme on 22 April 2013.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An extension of the\nmaximum average maturity of the EU loan would be beneficial as it would support\nIreland\u2019s efforts to regain full market access and successfully exit its\nprogramme.
