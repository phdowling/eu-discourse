This Internal Agreement will\r\nonly enter into force after ratification by all the Member States. This process will most probably not be concluded before January\r\n2014.\nThe Commission has proposed transitional\r\nmeasures (\u2018Bridging Facility\u2019) to\r\nensure the availability of funds for cooperation with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and\r\nwith Overseas Countries and Territories, as well as for support expenditure, between\r\nJanuary 2014 and the entry into force of the Internal Agreement establishing\r\nthe 11th EDF. This Facility shall be financed from balances and decommitted funds\r\nof the 10th and previous EDFs. The funds committed under this Bridging Facility\r\nshall be accounted for under the 11th EDF.\nThe Commission has also adopted a proposal\r\nfor a Regulation providing for implementation rules for the 11th EDF that\r\nintegrate the new orientations of the EU development policy in particular those\r\nlaid down in the Communication \u2018Increasing the impact of EU Development Policy:\r\nan Agenda for Change\u2019[1],\r\nand of the latest modifications of the Cotonou Agreement. This Regulation\r\ncannot be adopted by the Council before the entry into force of the 11th\r\nEDF Internal Agreement or before the adoption by the Council of a decision\r\nallowing for a provisional application of some of its provisions. In the light\r\nof the latest discussions in the Council, it is not expected that any of these\r\nprocesses will be concluded before January 2014.\nIt is appropriate that actions supported under\r\nthe Bridging facilityare as soon as possible implemented using the same rules\r\nas those foreseen for the 11th EDF. Therefore, the Commission\r\nproposes that the Council Regulation on the\r\nimplementation of the 10th EDF be modified in such a way that the implementing rules which will apply to the\r\n11th EDF also apply for the operational and financial management of\r\nthe Bridging Facility.\nThe negotiations for the 11th\r\nEDF implementation regulation are not yet concluded in the Council (and\r\ntherefore the 11th EDF implementing rules are not yet stabilized). Hence,\r\nthis proposal will include in its annex the text of the provisions for the 11th\r\nEDF once fixed, as soon as the abovementioned negotiations are over. In doing\r\nso, the unicity of rules for the implementation of the 11th EDF from\r\n2014 to 2020 will be ensured.\nThe Commission therefore suggests that the Council\r\nadopts the attached Regulation, to be technically complemented in its annex in\r\naccordance with the previous paragraph.\n2013/0429 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n617/2007 of 14 May 2007 on the implementation of the 10th EDF European Development\r\nFund under the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement for the implementation of the\r\nBridging Facility\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to the Partnership Agreement between\r\nthe members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States of the one\r\npart, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part,\r\nsigned in Cotonou on 23 June 2000[2]\r\n(hereinafter referred to as the Cotonou Agreement),\nHaving regard to the Internal Agreement\r\nbetween the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting\r\nwithin the Council, on the financing of Community aid under the multiannual\r\nfinancial framework for the period 2008 to 2013 in accordance with the ACP-EC\r\nPartnership Agreement and on the allocation of financial assistance for the\r\nOverseas Countries and Territories to which Part Four of the EC Treaty applies[3] (hereinafter referred\r\nto as the Internal Agreement), and in particular Article 10(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Investment Bank,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nDecision of\u00a0 [xx/xx/2013] establishes transitional EDF management measures\r\n(Bridging Facility) to ensure the availability of funds for cooperation with\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific countries and with Overseas Countries and\r\nTerritories, as well as for support expenditure, from 1 January 2014 until the\r\nentry into force of the 11th European Fund,\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is\r\nnecessary to modify the implementing rules of the 10th EDF for the\r\noperational and financial management of the transitional measures (\u2018Bridging\r\nFacility\u2019) financing the transition period between the\r\n10th and the 11th EDF until the\r\nentry into force of the 11th EDF Internal Agreement and its\r\nimplementing rules, in line with the latter, \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\norganisation and functioning of the European External Action Service are\r\ndescribed in Council Decision 2010/427/EU,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nFor the purpose of implementing the\r\nBridging Facility, the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 617/2007 are\r\nreplaced by those laid down in the Annex to this Regulation. \nArticle 2\nThe application of this Regulation shall\r\nbe in accordance with Council Decision 2010/427/EU, establishing the\r\norganisation and functioning of the European External Action Service. \nArticle 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of\r\nthe European Union.\nIt shall apply from its date of entry into\r\nforce and until the entry into application of the Implementation Regulation of\r\nthe 11th EDF.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2011)637\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 317, 15.12.2000, p. 3.
