The amendments were a result of an accelerated review initiated pursuant to Article\n20 of the basic Regulation.\nFollowing an expiry review, the Council by\nRegulation (EC) No 193/2007 imposed a definitive countervailing duty for a\nfurther period of five years on imports of PET originating in India.\nThe countervailing measures were subsequently\namended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1286/2008 and Council Regulation (EU) No\n906/2011, following interim reviews. \nA later interim review was terminated without\namending the measures in force by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No\n559/2012.\nBy Decision 2000/745/EC[3] the Commission accepted\nundertakings setting a minimum import price offered by three exporting\nproducers in India. \nConsistency with other policies and\nobjectives of the Union\nNot applicable.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nInterested parties concerned by the proceeding\nhave had the possibility to defend their interests during the investigation, in\nline with the provisions of the basic Regulation.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThis proposal is the result of the\nimplementation of the basic Regulation.\nThe basic Regulation does not provide for a\ngeneral impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that\nhave to be assessed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nOn 24 February 2012, the Commission announced\nby a notice, published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the\ninitiation of an expiry review of the countervailing measures applicable to\nimports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in India.\nThe review was initiated following a request\nlodged by the Committee of Polyethylene Terephthalate Manufacturers in Europe\n(CPME) on behalf of Union producers representing nearly\n95% of the Union production of PET.\nThe review investigation found continued\nsubsidisation of the product concerned which would result in the recurrence of\ninjury to the Union industry in case countervailing measures were lifted. It\nwas further established that the continuation of measures was not against the\ninterest of the Union.\nTherefore it is suggested that the Council\nadopts the attached proposal for a Regulation in order to extend the existing\nmeasures.\nLegal basis\nThis proposal concerns the application of\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against\nsubsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality\nprinciple for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and administrative\nburden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local\nauthorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to\nthe objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason:\nThe basic Regulation does not provide for\nalternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union\nbudget.\n2013/0123 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a definitive countervailing duty\non imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate (PET) originating in India following an expiry review pursuant to Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 597/2009\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[4]\n('the basic Regulation') and in particular Article 18 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\nthe European Commission ('the Commission') after consulting the Advisory\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\nA. PROCEDURE\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures in force\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation (EC) No\n2603/2000[5],\nthe Council imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of polyethylene\nterephthalate ('PET') originating, inter alia, in India. By Council Regulation\n(EC) No 1645/2005[6],\nthe Council amended the level of countervailing measures in force against\nimports of PET from India. The amendments were a result of an accelerated\nreview initiated pursuant to Article 20 of the basic Regulation. Following an\nexpiry review, the Council by Regulation (EC) No 193/2007[7] imposed a definitive\ncountervailing duty for a further period of five years. The countervailing\nmeasures were subsequently amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1286/2008[8] and Council Implementing\nRegulation (EU) No 906/2011[9],\nfollowing partial interim reviews. A later partial interim review was\nterminated without amending the measures in force by Council Implementing\nRegulation (EU) No 559/2012[10].\nBy Decision 2000/745/EC[11]the\nCommission accepted undertakings setting a minimum import price offered by\nthree exporting producers in India.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The countervailing\nmeasures consist of a specific duty. The rate of the duty is between 0 and\n106.5 EUR per tonne for individually named Indian producers with a residual\nrate of 69.4 EUR per tonne imposed on imports from all other producers.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing anti-dumping\nmeasures\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation (EC) No\n2604/2000[12],\nthe Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of PET\noriginating, inter alia, in India. Following an expiry review, the\nCouncil, by Regulation (EC) No 192/2007[13],\nimposed a definitive anti-dumping duty for a further period of five years. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Request for an expiry\nreview\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the publication\nof a Notice of impending expiry[14]\nof the definitive countervailing measures in force, the Commission, on 25\nNovember 2011, received a request for the initiation of the review, pursuant to\nArticle 18 of the basic Regulation ('the expiry review'). The request was\nlodged by the Committee of Polyethylene Terephthalate Manufacturers in Europe ('the applicant') on behalf of producers representing nearly 95% of the Union\nproduction of certain polyethylene terephthalate.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request was based on\nthe grounds that the expiry of the measures would be likely to result in a\ncontinuation or recurrence of subsidisation and injury to the Union industry.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prior to the initiation of\nthe expiry review, and in accordance with Articles 22(1) and 10(7) of the basic\nRegulation, the Commission notified the Government of India ('GOI') that it had\nreceived a properly documented review request and invited the GOI for\nconsultations with the aim of clarifying the situation as regards the contents\nof the review request and arriving at a mutually agreed solution. However, the\nCommission did not receive any answer from the GOI regarding its offer for\nconsultations. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation of an expiry\nreview\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined, after\nhaving consulted the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed for\nthe initiation of an expiry review, the Commission announced on 24 February\n2012, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union\n[15] ('the notice of initiation'),\nthe initiation of an expiry review pursuant to Article 18 of the basic\nRegulation.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parallel investigation\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 24 February 2012, the\nCommission also opened a review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 on the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of PET originating\nin India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand[16]. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation\n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review investigation period\nand the period considered\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation of the\nlikelihood of a continuation or recurrence of subsidisation covered the period\nfrom 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011 (hereinafter referred to as the 'review\ninvestigation period' or 'RIP'). The examination of the trends relevant for the\nassessment of the likelihood of a continuation or recurrence of injury covered the\nperiod from 1 January 2008 to the end of the RIP (hereinafter referred to as\nthe 'period considered').\n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the\ninvestigation\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the applicant, the exporting producers in the country concerned, the\nimporters, the users known to be concerned, and the representatives of the\ncountry concerned of the initiation of the expiry review.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties were\ngiven the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a\nhearing within the time limit set in the Notice of initiation. All interested\nparties, who so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why\nthey should be heard, were granted a hearing.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the apparent\nlarge number of exporting producers in India as well as Union producers and\nimporters it was considered appropriate to examine whether sampling should be\nused in accordance with Article 27 of the basic Regulation. In order to enable\nthe Commission to decide whether sampling would be necessary and, if so, to\nselect a sample, the exporting producers and unrelated importers were requested\nto make themselves known within 15 days of the initiation of the review and to\nprovide the Commission with the information requested in the Notice of\ninitiation.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seven exporting producers\nresponded to the sampling exercise and indicated a willingness to cooperate\nwith the review investigation. On this basis, a sample of three exporting\nproducers was selected based on the volume of exports to the Union. No objections\nwere made to this sample either by the sampled producers themselves,\nnon-sampled producers or the relevant authorities in India.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The three sampled exporting\nproducers were duly sent questionnaires to complete and replies were received\nfrom them all. However the questionnaire reply of one Indian sampled producer\nrevealed that it only exported insignificant volumes of the product concerned during\nthe RIP and therefore it was not relevant to calculate subsidy rates for that\ncompany. Verification visits were eventually completed in the two remaining\nexporting producers which together represented 99% of total imports in volume\nfrom India to the Union during the RIP.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure of\nthe essential facts and considerations (\u2018disclosure\u2019), one Indian cooperating\nproducer requested a calculation of a subsidy margin. In this respect it was\nreconfirmed that the exports from this company were insignificant and\nconsequently had no impact on the determination of the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence of subsidisation in the present expiry review. Therefore, this\nrequest was rejected. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission announced in the notice of initiation that it had\nprovisionally selected a sample of Union producers. This sample consisted of\nfour companies, out of the thirteen Union producers that were known prior to\nthe initiation of the investigation, selected on the basis of the largest\nrepresentative volume of production and sales that can reasonably be investigated\nwithin the time available. The sample represented over 50% of the total\nestimated Union production and sales during the RIP. Interested parties were\ninvited to consult the file and to comment on the appropriateness of this\nchoice within 15 days of the date of publication of the notice of initiation. All interested parties, who so requested and showed that there were\nparticular reasons why they should be heard, were granted a hearing.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain\ninterested parties raised objections concerning the sampling of Union producers.\nThey claimed that: (i) the Commission should not resort to sampling, in\nparticular, since no sampling was used in the previous investigation; (ii) the\nmethod used for the selection of the sample was contested on the grounds that\nit 'confuses three different steps', namely, standing exercise, definition of\nthe Union industry and sampling exercise; (iii) the provisional sample was set\nup on the basis of incorrect and incomplete information; (iv) selected\nprovisional sample is not representative because it includes entities rather\nthan groups; it was also claimed that including companies that in one case went\nthrough a recent divestment or in another case have related sales diminishes\nthe representativity of the sample. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The arguments raised by the parties were addressed as follows: \n\u2013              \nThe decision to use a sample of Union producers\nis made for each investigation independently depending on the particular\ncircumstances of each case and Article 22(6) of the basic Regulation does not\ngovern the use of such a sample for the determination of injury in the context\nof an expiry review. Unlike the previous investigations, where the\ninvestigation of all companies that came forward and cooperated was feasible,\nthe Commission considered in the current review that, in view of their large number,\nnot all Union producers could be reasonably investigated in the time available\nand that the conditions of Article 27 were therefore met.\n\u2013              \nThe Commission did not 'confuse' the\ndetermination of the standing, the determination of the Union industry and the\nselection of the provisional sample as these steps remained independent from\neach other and were decided upon separately. It was not demonstrated to what\nextent the use of the production and sales data provided by the Union producers\nin the context of the standing exercise had affected the representativity of\nthe sample.\n\u2013              \nThe sample was set up on the basis of the\ninformation available at the time of selection in accordance with Article 27 of\nthe basic Regulation. The representativity of the sample was reviewed following\nthe comments of the parties concerning specific company data. None of the\ncomments made were considered founded.\n\u2013              \nAs required by Article 27 of the basic\nRegulation the sample was established to represent the largest representative\nvolume of production and sales that can be reasonably investigated within the\ntime available. The entities belonging to larger groups that were found to\noperate independently from other subsidiaries of the same group were considered\nrepresentative of the Union industry and there was therefore no need to\ninvestigate the entire group on a consolidated basis. At the same time, the\ncompanies were sampled as economic entities, ensuring that all relevant data\ncould be verified. Moreover, the divestments and existence of related sales\nwere part of the characteristics of the sector in the period considered and\ntherefore none of these elements was considered to diminish the\nrepresentativity of the sample. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe disclosure the parties reiterated the above-mentioned arguments which have\nalready been addressed. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sampling for unrelated\nimporters was foreseen in the notice of initiation. None of the twenty four\ncontacted unrelated importers cooperated in the present investigation.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All five known suppliers of\nraw material were contacted upon the initiation and received relevant\nquestionnaire. Two suppliers came forward and replied to the questionnaire. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All known users and users'\nassociations were contacted upon the initiation. Seventeen users submitted a\nquestionnaire reply. Twenty associations of users from 16 Member States made\nthemselves known and made submissions. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Verification of\ninformation received\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sought and\nverified all the information it deemed necessary for a determination of the\nlikelihood of a continuation or recurrence of subsidisation and resulting\ninjury and of the Union interest. Verification visits were carried out at the\npremises of the GOI in Delhi and the following interested parties: \n(a)         \nExporting producers\n\u2013              \nDhunseri Petrochem and Tea Limited, Kolkata, India; \n\u2013              \nReliance Industries Limited, Navi Mumbai, India; \n(b)         \nUnion producers \n\u2013              \nIndorama Polymers Europe, UAB, Netherlands;\n\u2013              \nEquipolymers, Italy, Germany;\n\u2013              \nNeo Group, UAB, Lithuania;\n\u2013              \nNovapet SA, Spain;\n(c)         \nUsers in the Union \n\u2013              \nCoca-Cola Europe, Belgium;\n\u2013              \nNestle Waters France, France.\nB.

It is currently falling within CN code 3907 60 20.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like product\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nin the original and in the review investigations, it was found that the product\nconcerned, i.e. PET produced and sold on the domestic market of the country concerned, and PET produced and sold by\nUnion producers had the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and\nuses. They were therefore considered to be like products according to Article 2(c)\nof the basic Regulation.\nC.

The Foreign Trade Act authorises the GOI to issue\nnotifications regarding the export and import policy. These are summarised in\n\u2018Foreign Trade Policy\u2019 documents, which are issued by the Ministry of Commerce\nevery five years and updated regularly. The Foreign Trade Policy document\nrelevant to the RIP of this investigation is the 'Foreign Trade Policy\n2009-2014' ('FTP 09-14'). In addition, the GOI also sets out the procedures\ngoverning FTP 09-14 in a \u2018Handbook of Procedures, Volume I\u2019 (\u2018HOP I 09-14\u2019).\nThe Handbook of Procedures is also updated on a regular basis.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scheme specified under point\n(b) above is based on section 75 of the Customs Act of 1962, on section 37 of\nthe Central Excise Act of 1944, on sections 93A and 94 of the Financial Act of\n1994 and on the Customs, Central Excise Duties and Service Tax Drawback Rules\nof 1995. Drawback rates are published on a regular basis; those applicable to\nthe RIP were the All Industry Rates (AIR) of Duty Drawback 2011-12, published\nin notification No. 68 / 2011- Customs (N.T.), dated 22.09.2011. The duty\ndrawback scheme is also referred to as a duty remission scheme in chapter 4 of\nFTP 2009-2014.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scheme specified under\npoint (i) above is based on sections 21 and 35A of the Banking Regulation Act\n1949, which allow the Reserve Bank of India (\u2018RBI\u2019) to direct commercial banks\nin the field of export credits.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scheme specified under\npoint (j) above is based on the Income Tax Act of 1961, which is amended by the\nyearly Finance Act.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scheme specified under\npoint (k) above is administered by the Government of West Bengal and set out in\nGovernment of West Bengal Commerce & Industries Department notification No\n580-CI/H of 22 June 1999, replaced by notification No\n134-CI/O/Incentive/17/03/I of 24 March 2004.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scheme specified under\npoint (l) above is administered by the Government of Gujarat and is based on Gujarat\u2019s industrial incentive policy.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nscheme specified under point (m) above is administered by the Government of\nGujarat and based on its industrial incentive policy\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nscheme specified under point (n) above is based on the Bombay Electricity Duty\nAct of 1958.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scheme specified under\npoint (o) above is managed by the state of Maharashtra and is based on\nresolutions of the Government of Maharashtra Industries, Energy and Labour\nDepartment.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation revealed\nthat, during the RIP, the following schemes conferred benefits upon the sampled\nexporting producers in respect of the product concerned:\nNationwide scheme \n(a)         \nDuty Entitlement Passbook Scheme ('DEPBS')\n(b)         \nDuty Drawback Scheme ('DDS')\n(c)         \nFocus Market Scheme ('FMS')\n(d)         \nStatus Holder Incentive Scrip ('SHIS')\n(e)         \nAdvance Authorisation Scheme ('AAS')\nRegional schemes\n\u00b7              \nWest Bengal Incentive\nScheme ('WBIS').\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duty Entitlement Passbook\nScheme ('DEPBS')\n(a)         \nLegal Basis \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The detailed description of\nthe DEPBS is contained in chapter 4.3 of FTP 09-14 as well as in chapter 4 of\nHOP I 09-14.\n(b)         \nEligibility \n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any manufacturer-exporter\nor merchant-exporter is eligible for this scheme. \n(c)         \nPractical implementation\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An exporter can apply for\nDEPBS credits which are calculated as a percentage of the value of products\nexported under this scheme. Such DEPBS rates have been established by the\nIndian authorities for most products, including the product concerned. They are\ndetermined on the basis of Standard Input Output Norms ('SIONs') taking into\naccount a presumed import content in the export product and the customs duty\nincidence on the presumed import content, regardless of whether import duties\nhave actually been paid or not. The DEPBS rate for the product concerned during\nthe RIP of the current investigation was 8 % with a value cap of 58 INR/kg.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To be eligible for benefits\nunder this scheme, a company must export. At the time of the export\ntransaction, a declaration must be made by the exporter to the Indian\nauthorities indicating that the export is taking place under the DEPBS. In\norder for the goods to be exported, the Indian customs authorities issue,\nduring the dispatch procedure, an export shipping bill. This document shows,\ninter alia, the amount of DEPBS credit which is to be granted for that export\ntransaction. At this point in time, the exporter knows the benefit it will\nreceive. Once the customs authorities issue an export shipping bill, the GOI\nhas no discretion over the granting of a DEPBS credit. The relevant DEPBS rate\nto calculate the benefit is that which applied at the time the export\ndeclaration was made. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was found that in\naccordance with Indian accounting standards, DEPBS credits can be booked on an\naccrual basis as income in the commercial accounts, upon fulfilment of the\nexport obligation. Such credits can be used for payment of customs duties on\nsubsequent imports of any goods, except capital goods and goods where there are\nimport restrictions. Goods imported against such credits can be sold on the\ndomestic market (subject to sales tax) or used otherwise. DEPBS credits are\nfreely transferable and valid for a period of 24 months from the date of issue.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Applications for DEPBS\ncredits are electronically filed and can cover an unlimited amount of export\ntransactions. The deadline to submit applications is 3 months after\nexportation, but as clearly provided in paragraph 9.3 of the HOP I 09-14,\napplications received after the expiry of submission deadlines can always be\nconsidered with the imposition of a minor penalty fee (i.e. 10 % of the\nentitlement).\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was found that both\nsampled companies used this scheme during the first three quarters of the RIP.\n(d)         \nConclusion on DEPBS\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The DEPBS provides\nsubsidies within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) and Article 3(2) of the\nbasic Regulation. A DEPBS credit is a financial contribution by the GOI, since\nthe credit will eventually be used to offset import duties, thus decreasing the\nGOI\u2019s duty revenue which would be otherwise due. In addition, the DEPBS credit\nconfers a benefit upon the exporter, because it improves its liquidity.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the DEPBS is\ncontingent in law upon export performance, and is therefore deemed to be\nspecific and countervailable under Article 4(4), first subparagraph, point (a)\nof the basic Regulation. \n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme cannot be\nconsidered as permissible duty drawback system or substitution drawback system\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation. It does not\nconform to the strict rules laid down in Annex I point (i), Annex II\n(definition and rules for drawback) and Annex III (definition and rules for\nsubstitution drawback) of the basic Regulation. An exporter is under no\nobligation to actually consume the goods imported free of duty in the\nproduction process and the amount of credit is not calculated in relation to\nactual inputs used. Moreover, there is no system or procedure in place to\nconfirm which inputs are consumed in the production process of the exported\nproduct or whether an excess payment of import duties occurred within the\nmeaning of point (i) of Annex I and Annexes II and III of the basic Regulation.\nLastly, an exporter is eligible for the DEPBS benefits regardless of whether it\nimports any inputs at all. In order to obtain the benefit, it is sufficient for\nan exporter to simply export goods without demonstrating that any input\nmaterial was imported. Thus, even exporters which procure all of their inputs\nlocally and do not import any goods which can be used as inputs are still\nentitled to benefit from the DEPBS.\n(e)         \nAbolishment of the DEPBS and transition to DDS\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\nmeans of Public Notice No 54 (RE-2010)/2009-2014 of 17 June 2011, the DEPBS\nreceived a final three months extension which prolonged its applicability until\n30 September 2011. As no further extension was published subsequently, the\nDEPBS has effectively been withdrawn from 30 September 2011 onwards. Therefore\nit was necessary to verify whether measures could be imposed with regard to\nArticle 15(1) of the basic Regulation.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOI explained to the Commission that upon withdrawal of the DEPBS scheme,\ncompanies could opt for other duty exemption/remission schemes defined under\nchapter 4 of FTP 09-14, i.e. the Advance Authorisation Scheme (AAS) or the Duty\nDrawback Scheme (DDS). \n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation revealed that both sampled companies started availing of DDS\nimmediately after the DEPBS was withdrawn. It must\nbe noted that DDS has been introduced in 1995 and coexisted with DEPBS during\nthe three first quarters of the RIP and for a number of years before the RIP. DDS\ncould however not be availed simultaneously with DEPBS on the same exports. During\nthe first three quarters of the RIP, the DDS rate amounted to 2.2% with a cap\nof 1.5 INR/kg, making the DDS less generous and hence less attractive than the\nDEPBS. It must be noted that the GOI took steps to organise a smooth transition\nfrom DEPBS to DDS, as demonstrated in circular No. \u2013 42 /2011-Customs, dated\n22/09/2011. In this circular it is explained that \"the [duty] drawback\nschedule this year incorporates items which were hitherto under the DEPB[S]\nscheme\". The same circular states that for sectors operating under DEPBS,\nit \"has been decided to provide a smooth transition for items in these sectors\nwhile incorporating these in the drawback schedule. As a transitory\narrangement, these items will suffer a modest reduction from their DEPB[S]\nrates, ranging from 1% to 3% for most items.\" In other words, this\ncircular indicates that the duty drawback rates in force w.e.f. 01/10/2011 were\ndetermined so that they would confer a similar benefit as the withdrawn DEPBS.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nof 1 October, the DDS rate applicable to the product concerned was increased\nfrom 2.2% to 5.5% of FOB value and the associated cap was raised from 1.5\nINR/kg to 5.5 INR/kg. This new rate was found to confer similar levels of\nsubsidiation as the DEPBS was until the 30 September 2011 with its 8% rate and\n58 INR/kg cap. In function of PET prices prevailing during the RIP, the DEPBS\ncap was generally applicable resulting in a theoretical benefit of 4.64 INR/kg\nor 5.8%. In the case of the DDS, the cap was not applicable so that the\ntheoretical benefit amounted to 5.5%.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation confirmed\nthe reasoning of the previous recital. The average annualised subsidy margins\nof the sampled companies were 5.5% and 6% for DEPB and DDS, respectively.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\ncomparison of both schemes also shows that they share numerous implementation\ncharacteristics. \n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recitals (47)(48) to (51) above\ndemonstrate that, even though the DEPBS scheme was withdrawn, the underlying\nbenefits continued to be conferred without discontinuation and at an almost\nidentical level by providing a seamless transition to the duty drawback scheme.\nFor that reason, it is concluded that the subsidies have not been withdrawn\nwithin the meaning of Article 15(1) and that DEPBS is countervailable.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure of\nthe essential facts and considerations, one exporting producer argued that the\nDEPBS has been withdrawn and therefore should not be countervailed. In reply to\nthis, it is noted that, as also explained above in recital (47) above, the\nDEPBS has ceased on 30 September 2012. However, the subsidisation continued and\nexporters have the possibility as an alternative to the DEPBS to apply for and\nreceive benefits under e.g. the DDS or the AAS. Consequently, this argument was\nrejected.\n(f)           \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n3(2) and 5 of the basic Regulation, the amount of countervailable subsidies was\ncalculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the recipient, which is found\nto exist during the review investigation period. In this regard, it was\nconsidered that the benefit is conferred on the recipient at the time when an\nexport transaction is made under this scheme. At that moment, the GOI is liable\nto forego the customs duties, which constitutes a financial contribution within\nthe meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation. Once the customs\nauthorities issue an export shipping bill which shows, inter alia, the amount\nof DEPBS credit which is to be granted for that export transaction, the GOI has\nno discretion as to whether or not to grant the subsidy. In the light of the\nabove, it is considered appropriate to assess the benefit under the DEPBS as\nbeing the sums of the credits earned on export transactions made under this\nscheme during the RIP.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where justified claims were\nmade, fees necessarily incurred to obtain the subsidy were deducted from the\ncredits so established to arrive at the subsidy amounts as numerator, pursuant\nto Article 7(1)(a) of the basic Regulation. In accordance with Article 7(2) of\nthe basic Regulation these subsidy amounts have been allocated over the total\nexport turnover of the product concerned during the RIP as appropriate\ndenominator, because the subsidy is contingent upon export performance and it\nwas not granted by reference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported\nor transported. \n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the above, the\nsubsidy rates established in respect of this scheme for the sampled companies\namounted to 3.78% and 4.42% respectively.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duty Drawback Scheme\n('DDS')\n(a)         \nLegal Basis\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The detailed description of\nthe DDS is contained in the Custom & Central Excise Duties Drawback Rules,\n1995 as amended by successive notifications.\n(b)         \nEligibility\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any manufacturer-exporter\nor merchant-exporter is eligible for this scheme. \n(c)         \nPractical implementation\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An eligible exporter can\napply for drawback amount which is calculated as a percentage of the FOB value\nof products exported under this scheme. The drawback rates have been\nestablished by the GOI for a number of products, including the product\nconcerned. They are determined on the basis of the average quantity or value of\nmaterials used as inputs in the manufacturing of a product and the average\namount of duties paid on inputs. They are applicable regardless of whether\nimport duties have actually been paid or not. The DDS rate for the product\nconcerned during the RIP was 5.5% of FOB value, subject to a cap of 5.5 INR/kg.\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To be eligible to benefits\nunder this scheme, a company must export. At the moment when shipment details\nare entered in the Customs server (ICEGATE), it is indicated that the export is\ntaking place under the DDS and the DDS amount is fixed irrevocably. After the\nshipping company has filed the Export General Manifest (EGM) and the Customs\noffice has satisfactorily compared that document with the shipping bill data,\nall conditions are fulfilled to authorise the payment of the drawback amount by\neither direct payment on the exporter's bank account or by draft. \n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exporter also has to\nproduce evidence of realisation of export proceeds by means of a Bank\nRealisation Certificate (BRC). This document can be provided after the drawback\namount has been paid but the GOI will recover the paid amount if the exporter\nfails to submit the BRC within a given delay. \n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The drawback amount can be\nused for any purpose. \n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was found that in\naccordance with Indian accounting standards, the duty drawback amount can be\nbooked on an accrual basis as income in the commercial accounts, upon\nfulfilment of the export obligation.\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sampled companies were\nfound to use the DDS during the last quarter of the RIP.\n(d)         \nConclusion on DDS\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The DDS provides subsidies\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) and Article 3(2) of the basic\nRegulation. A duty drawback amount is a financial contribution by the GOI. In\naddition, the duty drawback amount confers a benefit upon the exporter, because\nit improves its liquidity.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the DDS is\ncontingent in law upon export performance, and is therefore deemed to be\nspecific and countervailable under Article 4(4), first subparagraph, point (a)\nof the basic Regulation. \n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme cannot be\nconsidered as permissible duty drawback system or substitution drawback system\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation. It does not\nconform to the strict rules laid down in Annex I point (i), Annex II\n(definition and rules for drawback) and Annex III (definition and rules for\nsubstitution drawback) of the basic Regulation.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is no system or\nprocedure in place to confirm which inputs are consumed in the production\nprocess of the exported product or whether an excess payment of import duties\noccurred within the meaning of point (i) of Annex I and Annexes II and III of\nthe basic Regulation. Lastly, an exporter is eligible for the DDS benefits\nregardless of whether it imports any inputs at all. In order to obtain the\nbenefit, it is sufficient for an exporter to simply export goods without\ndemonstrating that any input material was imported. Thus, even exporters which\nprocure all of their inputs locally and do not import any goods which can be\nused as inputs are still entitled to benefit from the DDS.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is confirmed by GOI's\ncircular n\u00b0 24/2001 which clearly states that \"[duty drawback rates] have\nno relation to the actual input consumption pattern and actual incidence\nsuffered on inputs of a particular exporter or individual consignments\n[\u2026]\" and instructs regional authorities that \"no evidence of actual\nduties suffered on imported or indigenous nature of inputs [\u2026] should be\ninsisted upon by the field formations along with the [drawback claim] filed by\nexporters\".\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, it is\nconcluded that DDS is countervailable.\n(e)         \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n3(2) and 5 of the basic Regulation, the amount of countervailable subsidies was\ncalculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the recipient, which is found\nto exist during the review investigation period. In this regard, it was\nconsidered that the benefit is conferred on the recipient at the time when an\nexport transaction is made under this scheme. At this moment, the GOI is liable\nto the payment of the drawback amount, which constitutes a financial\ncontribution within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation.\nOnce the customs authorities issue an export shipping bill which shows, inter\nalia, the amount of drawback which is to be granted for that export\ntransaction, the GOI has no discretion as to whether or not to grant the\nsubsidy. In the light of the above, it is considered appropriate to assess the\nbenefit under the DDS as being the sums of the drawback amounts earned on\nexport transactions made under this scheme during the RIP.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where justified claims were\nmade, fees necessarily incurred to obtain the subsidy were deducted from the\ncredits so established to arrive at the subsidy amounts as numerator, pursuant\nto Article 7(1)(a) of the basic Regulation. In accordance with Article 7(2) of\nthe basic Regulation these subsidy amounts have been allocated over the total\nexport turnover of the product concerned during the review investigation period\nas appropriate denominator, because the subsidy is contingent upon export\nperformance and it was not granted by reference to the quantities manufactured,\nproduced, exported or transported. \n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the above, the\nsubsidy rates established in respect of this scheme for the sampled companies concerned\namounted to 1.65% and 1.32%, respectively.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Focus Market Scheme (FMS)\n(a)         \nLegal basis\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The detailed description of\nFMS is contained in paragraph 3.14 of FTP 09-14 and in paragraph 3.8 of HOP I\n09-14.\n(b)         \nEligibility\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any manufacturer-exporter\nor merchant-exporter is eligible for this scheme.\n(c)         \n Practical implementation\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under this scheme exports\nof all products to countries notified under tables 1 and 2 of Appendix 37(C) of\nHOP I 09-14 are entitled to duty credit equivalent to 3% of the FOB value. As\nof 1 April 2011, exports of all products to countries notified under table 3 of\nAppendix 37(C) ('Special Focus Markets') are entitled to a duty credit\nequivalent to 4% of the FOB value. Certain types of export activities are excluded\nfrom the scheme, e.g. exports of imported goods or transhipped goods, deemed\nexports, service exports and export turnover of units operating under special\neconomic zones/export operating units. Also excluded from the scheme are\ncertain types of products, e.g. diamonds, precious metals, ores, cereals, sugar\nand petroleum products. \n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nduty credits under FMS are freely transferable and valid for a period of 24\nmonths from the date of issue of the relevant credit entitlement certificate.\nThey can be used for payment of custom duties on subsequent imports of any\ninputs or goods including capital goods.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The credit entitlement\ncertificate is issued from the port from which the exports have been made and\nafter realisation of exports or shipment of goods. As long as the applicant\nprovides to the authorities copies of all relevant export documentation (e.g.\nexport order, invoices, shipping bills, bank realisation certificates), the GOI\nhas no discretion over the granting of the duty credits.\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was found that the sampled\ncompanies used this scheme during the RIP.\n(d)         \nConclusion on FMS\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The FMS provides subsidies\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) and Article 3(2) of the basic\nRegulation. A FMS duty credit is a financial contribution by the GOI, since the\ncredit will eventually be used to offset import duties, thus decreasing the\nGOI\u2019s duty revenue which would be otherwise due. In addition, the FMS duty\ncredit confers a benefit upon the exporter, because it improves its liquidity. \n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, FMS is\ncontingent in law upon export performance, and therefore deemed to be specific\nand countervailable under Article 4(4), first subparagraph, point (a) of the\nbasic Regulation.\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme cannot be\nconsidered a permissible duty drawback system or substitution drawback system\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation. It does not\nconform to the strict rules laid down in Annex I point (i), Annex II\n(definition and rules for drawback) and Annex III (definition and rules for\nsubstitution drawback) of the basic Regulation. An exporter is under no\nobligation to actually consume the goods imported free of duty in the\nproduction process and the amount of credit is not calculated in relation to\nactual inputs used. There is no system or procedure in place to confirm which\ninputs are consumed in the production process of the exported product or\nwhether an excess payment of import duties occurred within the meaning of point\n(i) of Annex I and Annexes II and III of the basic Regulation. An exporter is\neligible for FMS benefits regardless of whether it imports any inputs at all.\nIn order to obtain the benefit, it is sufficient for an exporter to simply\nexport goods without demonstrating that any input material was imported. Thus, even\nexporters which procure all of their inputs locally and do not import any goods\nwhich can be used as inputs are still entitled to benefit from FMS. Moreover,\nan exporter can use FMS duty credits in order to import capital goods although\ncapital goods are not covered by the scope of permissible duty drawback\nsystems, as set out in Annex I point (i) of the basic Regulation, because they\nare not consumed in the production of the exported products.\n(e)         \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of countervailable\nsubsidies was calculated on the basis of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipient, which is found to exist during the RIP as booked by the cooperating\nexporting producer on an accrual basis as income at the stage of export\ntransaction. In accordance with Article 7(2) and 7(3) of the basic Regulation\nthis subsidy amount (nominator) has been allocated over the export turnover\nduring the RIP as appropriate denominator, because the subsidy is contingent\nupon export performance and it was not granted by reference to the quantities\nmanufactured, produced, exported or transported.\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate\nestablished with regard to this scheme during the RIP for the sampled companies\nconcerned amounted to respectively 0.19% and 0.87%.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Status Holder Incentive\nScrip (SHIS)\n(a)         \nLegal basis\n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The detailed description of\nSHIS is contained in chapter 3.16 of FTP 09-14 and in paragraph 3.10 of HOP I\n09-14. The detailed description of the Status categories is contained in\nparagraphs 3.10.1 to 3.10.4 of FTP 09-14 and in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.5 of HOP I\n09-14.\n(b)         \nEligibility\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Manufacturer-exporters or\nmerchant-exporters which are recognised as so-called Status holders are\neligible for this scheme. \n(c)         \nPractical implementation\n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Merchant as well as\nmanufacturer exporters are eligible for Status. Depending on their export\nperformance during current year plus a number of previous years, applicants are\ngranted one of the following statuses: Export House, Star Export House, Trading\nHouse, Start Trading House, Premier Trading House.\n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the SHIS, status\nholders are entitled to a duty credit equivalent to 1% of the FOB value of\nexports in sectors specified in paragraph 3.16.4 of FTP 09-14 i.e. leather\n(excluding finished leather), textile and jute sector, handicrafts, engineering\nsector (excluding some sub-sectors), plastics and basic chemicals (excluding\npharmaceutical products). The product concerned, being a type of plastic, is\ncovered by the scheme.\n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The SHIS duty credits are\nnot transferrable and must be used to pay duty on import of capital goods used\nto manufacture products falling into one of the covered sectors.\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\ncase an applicant has availed Zero Duty EPCG during a year, it shall not be\neligible for SHIS for export made that year.\n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scheme was introduced\nin 2009 for exports made during 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 and has been extended\non a yearly basis since then. The last extension (cfr. notification No 07/2012\n\u2013 Customs dated 9 March 2012) prolonged the validity of the scheme until 31\nMarch 2013.\n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was found that in\naccordance with Indian accounting standards, the SHIS duty credit can be booked\non an accrual basis as income in the commercial accounts, upon fulfilment of\nthe export obligation.\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation revealed that\none sampled company used this scheme during the RIP while the other one was not\neligible as a result of the provision described in recital (90).\n(d)         \nConclusion on SHIS\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The SHIS provides subsidies\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) and Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation.\nA SHIS duty credit is a financial contribution by the GOI, since the credit\nwill eventually be used to offset import duties, thus decreasing the GOI\u2019s duty\nrevenue which would be otherwise due. In addition, the SHIS duty credit confers\na benefit upon the exporter, because it improves its liquidity. \n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, SHIS is\ncontingent in law upon export performance, and therefore deemed to be specific\nand countervailable under Article 4(4), first subparagraph, point (a) of the\nbasic Regulation.\n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme cannot be\nconsidered a permissible duty drawback system or substitution drawback system\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation. It does not\nconform to the strict rules laid down in Annex I point (i), Annex II (definition\nand rules for drawback) and Annex III (definition and rules for substitution\ndrawback) of the basic Regulation. The duty credit will eventually be used to\npay duties on imports of capital goods which are not covered by the scope of\npermissible duty drawback as set out in Annex I point (i) of the basic\nRegulation, because they are not consumed in the production of the exported\nproducts.\n(e)         \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidies was calculated on the basis of the benefit conferred\non the recipient, which is found to exist during the RIP as booked by the\ncooperating exporting producer on an accrual basis as income at the stage of the\nexport transaction. In accordance with Article 7(2) and 7(3) of the basic\nRegulation this subsidy amount (nominator) has been allocated over the export\nturnover during the RIP as appropriate denominator, because the subsidy is\ncontingent upon export performance and it was not granted by reference to the\nquantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported.\n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate\nestablished with regard to this scheme during the RIP for the sole sampled company\nusing that scheme amounted to 1%.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export Promotion Capital\nGoods scheme (\u2018EPCGS\u2019)\n(a)         \nLegal basis\n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 The detailed description of\nEPCGS is contained in chapter 5 of FTP 09-14 as well as in chapter 5 of HOP I\n09-14. \n(b)         \nEligibility\n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 Manufacturer-exporters,\nmerchant-exporters \u201ctied to\u201d supporting manufacturers and service providers are\neligible for this scheme. \n(c)         \nPractical implementation\n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 Under the condition of an\nexport obligation, a company is allowed to import capital goods (new and\nsecond-hand capital goods up to 10 years old) at a reduced rate of duty. To\nthis end, the GOI issues, upon application and payment of a fee, an EPCGS\nlicence. The scheme provides for a reduced import duty rate of 3% applicable to\nall capital goods imported under the scheme. In order to meet the export\nobligation, the imported capital goods must be used to produce a certain amount\nof export goods during a certain period. Under FTP 09-14 the capital goods can\nbe imported with a 0% duty rate under the EPCGS but in such case the time\nperiod for fulfilment of the export obligation is shorter.\n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 The EPCGS licence holder can\nalso source the capital goods indigenously. In such case, the indigenous\nmanufacturer of capital goods may avail himself of the benefit for duty free\nimport of components required to manufacture such capital goods. Alternatively,\nthe indigenous manufacturer can claim the benefit of deemed export in respect\nof supply of capital goods to an EPCGS licence holder.\n(d)         \nConclusion on EPCGS\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nEPCGS provides subsidies within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) and Article\n3(2) of the basic Regulation. The duty reduction constitutes a financial\ncontribution by the GOI, since this concession decreases the GOI\u2019s duty revenue\nwhich would be otherwise due. In addition, the duty reduction confers a benefit\nupon the exporter, because the duties saved upon importation improve the\ncompany\u2019s liquidity.\n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, EPCGS is\ncontingent in law upon export performance, since such licences cannot be\nobtained without a commitment to export. Therefore it is deemed to be specific\nand countervailable under Article 4(4), first subparagraph, point (a) of the\nbasic Regulation. \n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 EPCGS cannot be considered a\npermissible duty drawback system or substitution drawback system within the\nmeaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation. Capital goods are not\ncovered by the scope of such permissible systems, as set out in Annex I point\n(i), of the basic Regulation, because they are not consumed in the production\nof the exported products.\n(e)         \nCalculation of the subsidy amount \n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy amount was\ncalculated, in accordance with Article 7(3) of the basic Regulation, on the\nbasis of the unpaid customs duty on imported capital goods spread across a\nperiod which reflects the normal depreciation period of such capital goods in\nthe industry concerned. The amount so calculated, which is attributable to the RIP,\nhas been adjusted by adding interest during this period in order to reflect the\nfull value of the benefit over time. The commercial interest rate during the\ninvestigation period in India was considered appropriate for this purpose.\nWhere justified claims were made, fees necessarily incurred to obtain the\nsubsidy were deducted in accordance with Article 7(1)(a) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n7(2) and 7(3) of the basic Regulation, this subsidy amount has been allocated\nover the appropriate export turnover during the RIP as the appropriate\ndenominator because the subsidy is contingent upon export performance and was\nnot granted by reference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported or\ntransported.\n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate established\nwith regard to this scheme during the RIP for the sampled companies concerned amounted\nto respectively 0.55% and 0.56%.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Advance Authorisation\nScheme ('AAS')\n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 It was found that only one sampled\ncompany availed of this scheme during the RIP. However, the investigation\nestablished that the benefit obtained by the company was insignificant and,\nthus AAS was not analysed further.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 West Bengal Incentive\nScheme 1999 ('WBIS 1999')\n(a)         \n Legal basis\n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 The detailed description of\nthis scheme as applied by the Government of West Bengal ('GOWB') is set out in\nNotification No 580-CI/H of 22 June 1999 of the GOWB Commerce & Industries\nDepartment.\n(b)         \nEligibility\n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 Companies setting up a new\nindustrial establishment or making a large-scale expansion of an existing\nindustrial establishment in backward areas are eligible to avail benefits under\nthis scheme. Nevertheless, an exhaustive list of ineligible industries\n(negative list of industries) exists preventing companies in certain fields of\noperations from benefiting from the incentives.\n(c)         \nPractical implementation\n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 The State of West Bengal\ngrants to eligible industrial enterprises incentives in the form of a number of\nbenefits, including an exemption of central sales tax ('CST') and a remission\nof central value added tax ('CENVAT') on sales of finished goods, in order to\nencourage the industrial development of economically backward areas within this\nState.\n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 Under this scheme, companies\nmust invest in backward areas. These areas, which represent certain territorial\nunits in West Bengal are classified according to their economic development\ninto different categories while at the same time there are developed areas\nexcluded from the application of the incentive schemes. The main criteria to\nestablish the amount of the incentives are the size of the investment and the\narea in which the enterprise is or will be located.\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 It was found that one sampled\ncompany availed of this scheme during the RIP.\n(d)         \nConclusion\n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme provides\nsubsidies within the meaning of Articles 3(1)(a)(ii) and 3(2) of the basic\nRegulation. It constitutes a financial contribution by the GOWB, since the\nincentives granted, in the present CST exemption and CENVAT remission on sales\nof finished goods, decrease tax revenue which would be otherwise due. In\naddition, these incentives confer a benefit upon a company, because they\nimprove its financial situation since taxes otherwise due are not paid.\n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, this scheme is\nregionally specific in the meaning of Articles 4(2)(a) and 4(3) of the basic\nRegulation since it is only available to certain companies having invested\nwithin certain designated geographical areas within the jurisdiction of the\nState concerned. It is not available to companies located outside these areas\nand, in addition, the level of benefit is differentiated according to the area\nconcerned.\n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 The WBIS 1999 is therefore\ncountervailable.\n(e)         \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsubsidy amount was calculated on the basis of the amount of the sales tax and\nCENVAT on sales of finished goods normally due during the review investigation\nperiod but which remained unpaid under this scheme. In accordance with Article\n7(2) of the basic Regulation, the amount of subsidy (numerator) have then been\nallocated over total sales during the review investigation period as\nappropriate denominator, because the subsidy is not export contingent and it\nwas not granted by reference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported\nor transported. The subsidy rate obtained amounted to 1,36%. \n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amount of countervailable\nsubsidies\n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidies in accordance with the provisions of the basic\nRegulation, expressed ad valorem, for the sampled exporting producers\nwas 7.53% and 8.17%, respectively.\n SCHEME || DEPB || DDS || FMS || SHIS || EPCGS || WBIS || Total \n COMPANY || % || % || % || % || % || % || % \n Dhunseri Petrochem & Tea Limited || 3.78 || 1.65 || 0.19 || nil || 0.55 || 1.36 || 7.53 \n Reliance Industries Limited || 4.42 || 1.32 || 0.87 || 1.0 || 0.56 || Nil || 8.17 \n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusions on the\nlikelihood of a continuation or recurrence of subsidisation\n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n18(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether the expiry of the\nmeasures in force would be likely to lead to a continuation or recurrence of\nsubsidisation.\n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 As set out under recitals (26)\nto (118) above, it was established that during the RIP Indian exporters of the\nproduct concerned continued to benefit from countervailable subsidisation by\nthe Indian authorities. \n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy schemes give\nrecurring benefits and there is no indication that these benefits will be\nphased out in the foreseeable future. Moreover, each exporter is eligible to\nseveral of the subsidy schemes. \n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 It was also examined whether\nexports to the Union would be made in significant volumes should the measures\nbe lifted. \n(125)\u00a0\u00a0 India is a large producer of the product concerned.\nOn the basis of data collected during the investigation, India had a production capacity of about 700,000-900,000 tonnes during the RIP and\nexpansion plans bringing the total country capacity to 1,600,000 \u2013 1,800,000\ntonnes by 2014. As a result, the excess of capacity over domestic demand is\nestimated to reach about 600,000-700,000 tonnes in 2014, which would represent 21-25%\nof the total Union consumption in RIP.\n(126)\u00a0\u00a0 Under\nthese circumstances, Indian producers of the product concerned are heavily\ndependent on export sales and there is a likelihood that exports volumes to the\nUnion, which were already significant during the RIP, would increase should the\nmeasures be repealed. \n(127)\u00a0\u00a0 An exporting producer submitted\nthat the excess capacity would decrease after 2014 and therefore the excess\ncapacity situation would only be temporary. It is noted that the alleged\ndecrease of excess capacity after 2014 was found in line with the projections\nof the market intelligence report Therefore it was concluded that this\nsubmission was not of a nature to modify the analysis with regard to the\ndevelopment of excess capacities.\n(128)\u00a0\u00a0 After the disclosure, an\nexporting producer claimed that important temporary excess capacities were\ninevitable due to the fact that generally production capacity increases can be\ndone only in large increments due to the minimum size of modern PET plants. In\nreply to this it should be noted that during RIP and the following year,\nproduction capacity extensions in the range of at least 150,000 to 200,000\ntonnes were made. It follows that the invoked reasoning cannot justify alone\nthe excess capacity available for exports quoted in recital (125). In any\nevent, in this context the cause of the excess capacity available for exports\nis irrelevant. Therefore the claim was rejected. \n(129)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties claimed that\nthe excess capacity available for exports developing in India could be absorbed also by other third countries and that therefore the excess\ncapacity available for exports as calculated by the Commission was not properly\nassessed. It was not assume in any way that the entirety of any excess capacity\navailable for exports would be directed to the Union. Therefore the claim was rejected.\n\n(130)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, it can\nbe concluded that there is a likelihood of a continuation of subsidisation.\nD. DEFINITION OF THE UNION INDUSTRY\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union production and Union\nindustry\n(131)\u00a0\u00a0 The like product is\nmanufactured by 13 known producers in the Union. They represent the Union\nindustry within the meaning of Articles 9(1) of the basic Regulation and will\nthereafter be referred as 'the Union industry'.\n(132)\u00a0\u00a0 Twelve known Union producers,\nrepresented by the complainant in the present case, cooperated and supported\nthe investigation. One more known Union producer did not cooperate in the\npresent review. \n(133)\u00a0\u00a0 All available information\nconcerning Union industry, such as questionnaire replies, Eurostat and request\nfor review, was used in order to establish the total Union production for the RIP.\n(134)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union\nmarket for PET is characterised by a relatively high number of producers,\nbelonging usually to bigger groups with headquarters outside the Union. Between 2000 and 2012 the Union PET industry\nhas undergone through several transitions. The market is in a process of\nconsolidation with a number of recent takeovers and closures. New products,\nsuch as recycled PET and bio PET continue to be developed together with a\nrelatively recent spinoff of a recycling industry.\n(135)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome parties argued that the description of the situation of the Union industry\nwas inaccurate as five producers were in fact belonging to one large\ntransnational group and another three producers were related to PET packaging\ncompanies. None of these facts contradict the description provided in recital (134)\nexplicitly stating that the Union producers are usually belonging to bigger\ngroups as disclosed. The impact of this concentration is addressed in recital (207)\nbelow. The assessment of the impact of captive market is analysed in recitals (202)\nto (204) below.\n(136)\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated above, given\nthe relatively high number of cooperating Union producers a sample of four Union\nproducers was selected, representing over 50% of the production and sales of\nthe total Union production of the like product in the RIP. \nE.

The latter was acquired\nby another Union producer. Since the analysis of macro-economic indicators is based\non data collected from all Union producers the divestment had no impact on the scope\nor individual indicators of the injury analysis. \n(155)\u00a0\u00a0 As a\npreliminary point to the analysis it should be explained that certain global\neconomic events in late 2010 and early 2011 had an impact on the situation on the\nUnion market, in particular on the prices and sales volumes of the like product.\nIn this period the cotton supply fell resulting in an increased demand for\npolyester fibre on the Asian market. PET and polyester fibre are largely\ndependent upstream on the same raw material, i.e. purified terephthalic acid\n(PTA). The increased demand for polyester fibre resulted in insufficient supply\nof PTA, pushing the prices of PET up. Since the producers of PET in the Middle\nEast also depend on PTA from Asia, this caused sudden fall in imports of PET in\nthe Union. At the same\ntime, the main PTA suppliers in the Union declared a 'force majeure'\nresulting in additional restrictions of the domestic PET production.\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of the parties\n(156)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties challenged the validity\nof the injury analysis on the grounds that it was based on deficient\ninformation, which in turn also affected the rights of defence of interested\nparties. In particular, the below-mentioned arguments were raised.\n(157)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties claimed that\nthe information collected from Union producers did not comply with the instructions\nfor completion of the questionnaire, which requested data from different\ncompanies not to be aggregated. It was therefore claimed that the collected\ninformation was inaccurate and incomplete given that the reported figures were\naggregated per sampled entity. It is to be noted that the information was duly collected\nand verified on-spot. The information collected was found to provide\nsufficiently accurate picture of the Union industry and therefore the above-mentioned\nclaim had to be rejected. Following disclosure the parties reiterated their\nclaim. No new arguments or evidence were presented. Same parties reiterated\ntheir claim that the data provided by one sampled company were incomplete as\nthey did not relate to the entire group but selected entity within the group.\nThis comment was addressed at the sampling stage as explained in recital (18)\nabove.\n(158)\u00a0\u00a0 The same parties argued that\nthe Commission attempted to fix the claimed insufficiencies of the collected\ninformation by sending additional questionnaires. In this respect it should be\nclarified that the Commission indeed sent additional questionnaires, but\naddressed them only to the non-sampled Union producers in order to collect\ninformation on macro-economic indicators relevant to the injury assessment\ntherefore this was done to supplement the information provided by the sampled\nUnion producers. Following disclosure some parties reiterated the claim without\nbringing any new arguments or presenting new evidence. The claim of the parties\nhad to be therefore dismissed. \n(159)\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the same parties\nalso claimed that the information provided by the sampled producers was\ncontrary to the obligations in Article 29 of the basic Regulation because\ninformation which was not confidential in nature had been provided as\nconfidential information and thus excluded from the open file. In this respect\nit is to be noted that the information was classified as limited in line with\nthe request of the submitting party. Upon the request of the parties the\nconfidentiality status of the submitted information was reconsidered and, where\nappropriate, the information was reclassified as open for inspection by\ninterested parties after approval by the companies concerned. Also this claim was\ntherefore dismissed.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Macro-economic indicators\n(a)         \nProduction\n(160)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nline with the loss of market share by the Union industry (discussed in recital (164)\nbelow) the Union production decreased by 11% between 2008 and the RIP. The decline\nof the Union production was only interrupted in 2010 when it raised in\ncomparison to 2009 but remained nevertheless 4% below its level of 2008. It\nfurther decreased in the RIP.\n Table 6 \n Total Union production   \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Production (tonnes) || 2,327,169 || 2,107,792 || 2,239,313 || 2,068,717 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 91 || 96 || 89 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, review request ||   ||   \n(b)         \nProduction capacity and capacity utilisation\n(161)\u00a0\u00a0 The production capacity of\nthe Union industry decreased by 23% between 2008 and the RIP. This trend\nrelates to the closure of several manufacturing facilities which was partly\noffset by the launch of new factories. \n(162)\u00a0\u00a0 Capacity utilisation\nincreased from 75% in 2008 to 86% in the RIP. Increased capacity utilisation is\nto be seen in the context of the restructuring efforts of the Union industry explained\nin recital (134) above. \n Table 7 \n Production capacity and capacity utilisation   \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Production capacity (tonnes) || 3,118,060 || 2,720,326 || 2,625,244 || 2,393,516 \n Index || 100 || 87 || 84 || 77 \n Capacity utilisation || 75% || 77% || 85% || 86% \n Index || 100 || 104 || 114 || 116 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, review request \n(c)         \nSales volume\n(163)\u00a0\u00a0 The sales volume of the\nUnion industry on the Union market followed the same development as production,\nwith a contraction of 6% over the period considered. \n Table 8 \n Total sales of the Union industry in the Union   \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Sales (tonnes) || 2,288,283 || 2,047,305 || 2,169,423 || 2,160,807 \n Index || 100 || 89 || 95 || 94 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, review request \n(d)         \nMarket share\n(164)\u00a0\u00a0 After\nan initial drop of 13% in 2009, the Union industry regained part of the market\nshare lost by UAE, South Korea, Iran and Pakistan despite increasing volumes of\nimports from India, Oman and other third countries (Russia, Mexico and Saudi\nArabia) over the same period. Overall, the market share of the Union industry declined\nby 3% during the period considered. \n Table 9 \n Union industry market share   \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Union industry market share || 80% || 70% || 74% || 77% \n Index || 100 || 87 || 93 || 97 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, review request and Eurostat \n(e)         \nGrowth\n(165)\u00a0\u00a0 The market stagnated over\nthe period considered. There was no growth for the Union industry to benefit\nfrom, on the contrary, despite the restructuring efforts, the Union industry\nlost further market share to the growing imports, in particular, from the\ncountries without any measures. The slight decline of the consumption the RIP is\nto be seen against the background of temporary shortage of the raw material\n(PTA) in the Union as well as in the global market.\n(f)           \nEmployment and productivity\n(166)\u00a0\u00a0 The employment level of the\nUnion industry showed a decrease of 41% between 2008 and the RIP. The decline\nwas constant over the period concerned, including in 2010 when the production\nincreased (see recital (160) above). In the light of the growing productivity,\nthis drop is a reflection of the restructuring efforts by a number of Union\nproducers.\n(167)\u00a0\u00a0 Productivity\nof the Union industry\u2019s workforce, measured as output (tonnes) per person\nemployed per year, increased by 50% in the period considered. This reflects the\nfact that production decreased at a slower pace than the employment level and\nis an indication of increased efficiency of the Union industry. This is\nparticularly evident in 2010 when production increased while the employment\nlevel decreased and the productivity was 37% higher than in 2008.\n Table 10 \n Employment and productivity   \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Number of employees || 2,060 || 1,629 || 1,449 || 1,218 \n Index || 100 || 79 || 70 || 59 \n Productivity (tonne/employee) || 1,130 || 1,294 || 1,545 || 1,698 \n Index || 100 || 115 || 137 || 150 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, review request ||   ||   \n(g)         \nMagnitude of the actual margin of subsidy\n(168)\u00a0\u00a0 As concerns the impact on\nthe Union industry of the magnitude of the actual margin of subsidy of Indian\nimports, given the price sensitivity of the market for this product, this\nimpact cannot be considered to be negligible. It should be noted that this\nindicator is more relevant in the context of the likelihood of recurrence of\ninjury analysis. Should measures lapse, it is likely that subsidised imports\nwould come back at such volumes and prices that the impact of the magnitude of\nthe subsidy margin would be significant.\n(h)         \nRecovery from the effects of past subsidisation\n(169)\u00a0\u00a0 While the indicators\nexamined above show an improvement in some economic indicators of the Union\nindustry, further to the imposition of definitive countervailing measures in\n2001, they also provide evidence that the Union industry is still vulnerable.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Micro-economic indicators\n(a)         \nStocks\n(170)\u00a0\u00a0 The level of stocks was 24% higher\nin the RIP in relation with their levels in 2008. However, the stocks have\nremained at previously established levels in relation to the output, i.e. between\n5% and 6%.\n Table 11 \n Stocks   \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Closing stocks || 51,495 || 54,808 || 54,314 || 64,069 \n Index || 100 || 106 || 105 || 124 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n(b)         \nPrice development\n(171)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nregards the price development, after an initial drop in 2009 (-16%), mainly\ncaused by the economic crisis, the prices came close to 2008 level in 2010.\nThis was followed by a sharp rise of the average unit price in the RIP,\nbringing the increase over the period considered to 25%. \n(172)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsudden price increase in the RIP should be read in the context of the\nunexpected market developments at the end of 2010 and in the first quarter of\n2011 on the cotton market. As mentioned above (recital (155) above), the record\ncotton prices caused a switch to polyester fibre that competes for the same raw\nmaterial as PET. The increased demand for the raw material, in particular, PTA, pushed up the prices of PET in Asia and\nMiddle East with a spill over effect on the prices of PET in the Union. The price increase in the Union at that time was further amplified by the short term\nscarcity of PTA in the Union due to the declared force majeure of one of\nthe PTA producers in the Union. \n Table 12 \n Unit Sales Price in the Union   \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Unit Sales Price in the Union (EUR/tonne) || 1,066 || 891 || 1,045 || 1,330 \n Index (2008 = 100) || 100 || 84 || 98 || 125 \n Source: Questionnaire replies ||   ||   ||   ||   \n(c)         \nFactors affecting sales prices\n(173)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsales prices of PET normally follow the price trends of its main raw materials\n(mainly PTA and monoethylene glycol \u2014 MEG) as they constitute up to 90% of the\ntotal cost of PET. PTA is an oil derivative, the price of which fluctuates on\nthe basis of the price of crude oil. This causes high volatility of the prices\nof PET.\n(174)\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, PET competes\nfor the same raw material with polyester fibre, the production of which relies\nto the same extent as PET on the availability of PTA. Since polyester fibre is\nan alternative to cotton for the textile industry, the price of PET is\ntherefore also sensitive to the developments on the cotton market.\n(d)         \nWages\n(175)\u00a0\u00a0 The average wages declined\nby 7% over the period considered. This reduction occurred in the RIP and\namplified the productivity gains observed above (see recital (167) above). \n Table 13 \n Wages   \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Wages (average per person) || 54,512 || 56,014 || 54,876 || 50,784 \n Index || 100 || 103 || 101 || \u00a093 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n(e)         \nProfitability and return on investment\n(176)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nprofitability and returns on investment improved significantly between 2008 and\nthe RIP. The profit on sales in the Union market increased from -7.9% in 2008\nto 5.3% in the RIP, while return on investment improved from -9.6% to 10.6%.\nThe year 2008 was affected by the particularly poor performance of one Union producer.\nNevertheless, the improvement of the financial situation of the Union industry in\n2009 and 2010, when prices were below their 2008 levels, evidences the loose\nrelationship between prices and profitability. On the contrary, the improvement\nof profitability appears closely correlated to the improvements in capacity\nutilisation and to the productivity gains observed above. \n(177)\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks to the global market\ndevelopments at the break of 2010/2011, coupled with the restructuring efforts\nand efficiency gains described above, the Union industry was able to improve\nits profitability in 2010 and to reach the level of 5.3% in the RIP. \n(178)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat this development was unexpected and extraordinary, not to be considered\nrepresentative of the overall situation of the Union industry. \n(179)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect it is to be noted that the Union industry\nwas able to benefit from the PET price increase at the end of 2011 and\nbeginning of 2012 as it had fixed the PTA price before the described market\nevents occurred. Based on the statistical sources concerning the post-RIP\ndevelopment, submitted by the parties, the profit margins of PET producers went\nsubstantially down in 2012. This confirms that the profitability in 2011 (RIP)\nwas indeed largely influenced by unexpected and temporary global economic\nevents (recital (155)) that are unlikely to recur and cannot be considered\npermanent and representative of the situation of the Union industry. \n Table 14 \n Profitability and Return on Investments   \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Profitability Union sales || -7.9% || 1.6% || 4.8% || 5.3% \n Index || 100 || 221 || 261 || 267 \n Return on investment || -9.6% || 2.3% || 8.9% || 10.6% \n Index || 100 || 224 || 292 || 310 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n(f)           \nCash flow and ability to raise capital\n(180)\u00a0\u00a0 The cash flows improved\nsignificantly over the period considered reflecting the recent improvement of\nthe profitability of the Union Industry. \n Table 15 \n Cash flow   \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Cash flow (EUR) || - 59,419,394 || 40,940,883 || 96,614,649 || 103,761,169 \n Index (2008 = 100) || 100 || 269 || 363 || 375 \n In % of turnover || -5.9% || 4.5% || 8.3% || 7.5% \n Index (2008 = 100) || 100 || 176 || 242 || 229 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n(181)\u00a0\u00a0 There were no particular\nindications that the Union industry would have encountered difficulties in\nraising capital, mainly as the Union producers are incorporated in larger\ngroups.\n(g)         \nInvestments\n(182)\u00a0\u00a0 The level of investments was\noverall reduced by 35% over the period considered. The initial investments made\nin 2008 were cut sharply in 2009 and have not fully recovered since. \n Table 16 \n Investments   \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Investments (EUR '000) || 72,341,598 || 5,404,705 || 15,994,659 || 47,217,003 \n Index || 100 || 7 || 22 || 65 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the\nsituation of the Union industry\n(183)\u00a0\u00a0 The analysis of the macro-economic\ndata showed that the Union industry decreased its production and sales volumes during\nthe period considered. The Union industry's market share has not fully\nrecovered since the initial drop in 2009 and it showed an overall decrease of 3\npercentage points over the period considered (to 77% in RIP). The decline in\nemployment and capacity is a result of the on-going restructuring and is to be\nseen in the context of increasing capacity utilisation and productivity.\n(184)\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time most of the\nrelevant micro-economic indicators showed signs of improvements. The\nprofitability, return on investment and cash flow rose significantly, in\nparticular in 2010 and in the RIP. The investments, on the other hand,\nplummeted in 2009 and have not recovered since.\n(185)\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, the economic situation of the\nindustry has improved. However, these improvements are\nrelatively recent and to some extent based on\nunforeseen and temporary market developments at the break of 2010/2011 (see\nrecital (155) above). This appears to be supported by the information available on the developments of the margin of the\nUnion industry in 2012 (see recital (179) above) that show a decline as\ncompared to RIP. \n(186)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above\nanalysis, the situation of the Union industry has improved and no material injury\nappears to be taking place. Nevertheless, despite apparent positive trends and\nthe significant restructuring efforts, the situation of the Union industry is\nstill fragile. \n(187)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe disclosure some parties contested the conclusion\nthat the Union industry was still fragile claiming that the Union industry was\nin a healthy state and has substantially transformed since 1999. It is noted\nthat as explained above (recital (184)), despite the overall improvement and\nconsolidation, not all economic indicators developed positively over the period\nconsidered. For example, production and sales volumes as well as market share\ndecreased. Moreover, the improvements were relatively recent and with a fall of\nprofitability in 2012 appeared short-lived. On this basis it was considered\nthat while no material injury proved to exist in RIP, the Union industry was\nstill in a fragile state. The argument was therefore rejected.\n(188)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome parties contested the use of data referring to period beyond RIP for the\nanalysis of the economic situation of the Union industry. In response to this\nclaim it is confirmed that the situation of the Union industry was assessed for\nthe period considered and on this basis no material injury was established. However,\nthe development of profitability of the Union industry beyond RIP is in this\ncase relevant mainly in the context of the extraordinary nature of the global\nmarket developments at the break of 2010/2011. It also illustrates the\nvolatility typical for this sector. The argument is therefore rejected.\nE. LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENCE OF\nINJURY \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact of the projected\nvolume of imports and price effects in case of repeal of measures\n(189)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation has shown that the imports from India continued to be subsidised and that there\nare no indications that the subsidisation would be reduced or discontinued in\nthe future. \n(190)\u00a0\u00a0 A prospective analysis of\nthe likely import volumes in the Union from India revealed that, given the\nexcess capacity available for exports (see recital (125) above), the price\nlevels in the Union and the attractiveness of the Union market, the imports\nfrom India are likely to increase to levels above those reached in the RIP, if the\nmeasures were repealed. With the planned capacity expansions, the excess\ncapacity available for exports is estimated to reach about 600,000-700,000 tonnes\nin the near future, which would represent around 21-25% of the total Union\nconsumption in RIP.\n(191)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the continuation of\nsubsidisation, the prices of imports from India are expected to further\ndecrease, should the measures against India be lifted. Also, as the exporters\nwill have to compete against low priced imports from other countries, they are\nlikely to lower their prices further in order to increase market share on the Union\nmarket.\n(192)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, the Union industry\nis likely to be exposed to substantial volumes of imports from India at subsidised\nprices below the average prices of the Union industry, undermining the recently\nimproved economic situation of the latter. As a result, the material injury is\nlikely to recur should the measures against India be lifted.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production capacity and excess\ncapacity available for exports\n(193)\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated above (see\nrecital (125) above), the exporting producers in India have the potential to\nincrease their export volumes to the Union market. India had a significant\ngrowth in its production capacity over the period considered (see recital (125)\nabove). According to the information available it is expected to increase its\ncapacity further, creating a gap between domestic consumption and production\ncapacity available for exports of 600,000-700,000 tonnes in the near future. Such\nexcess capacity available for exports has to be considered as significant as it\nrepresents around 21-25% of the current Union consumption in RIP. \n(194)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, although the\nimports to the Union were relatively low, they more than doubled over the\nperiod considered and there is a risk that significant exports from India could be diverted to the Union.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Loss of export markets\n(195)\u00a0\u00a0 Trade defence measures are currently\nin place against Indian imports in Turkey and South Africa. The consequent\npossible loss of these export markets for India is another indicator that the Union\nmarket is likely to be targeted if the measures were allowed to lapse. \n(196)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome parties contested the conclusions regarding the loss of export markets for\n  India. It was claimed that both markets were marginal export market,\ntherefore no significant export volumes from these markets could be redirected\nto the Union if the measures were lifted. It is noted that only the existence\nof the trade defence on some markets excludes any meaningful comparison of the\nrelative importance of the markets with and without measures for a given\ncountry. In addition, contrary to the claim, it was not considered that the\nexport volumes from India placed on these markets would be redirected to the\nUnion market. Instead, it was considered that the existence of the trade\ndefence measures on other third markets restricts the absorption capacity of\nthird markets as regards the foreseen increase in excess capacities available\nfor exports in India. This argument was therefore rejected. \n(197)\u00a0\u00a0 The existence of trade\ndefence measures in third countries is also an indication that the pricing\nbehaviour of Indian exports is likely to replicate on the Union market.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the\nUnion market\n(198)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union PET market is\nattractive in terms of its size and prices, being the third largest market in\nthe world, with a structural\nneed for imports and higher prices as compared to other markets. In the case of\n India, the import prices to the Union tend to be higher than the prices to\nother third countries, which points to the attractiveness of the Union market\nfor the Indian exports. This is well illustrated by the fact that the imports\nfrom India have doubled over the period considered despite the measures in\nforce. \n(199)\u00a0\u00a0 The attractiveness of the Union\nmarket for exporters is also confirmed by the fact that the Union industry\ncontinued to lose market share to the rising imports from the countries without\nmeasures. This is in particular true in the case of South Korea that\nsignificantly increased its exports to the Union market in 2012 after the\nmeasures against the country have expired. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other factors\n(200)\u00a0\u00a0 The impact of the imports\nfrom other third countries with measures on the situation of the Union industry\nwas not considered significant, due to the relevant low import volumes and\nsubstantial decrease of their market share in the RIP. \n(201)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nvolume of imports from\nother third countries without any measures increased during the period\nconsidered, however, the respective average import price remained close to the\nUnion industry average price. Therefore, the impact of the imports from these\ncountries on the situation of the Union industry is considered limited. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Captive market \n(202)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure some parties claimed that\ndue to the vertical integration between PET producers and converters, a\nconsiderable part of PET was sold for captive use that did not compete with imports.\nIt was also claimed that share of captive market was significant, affecting the\nresults of the analysis.\n(203)\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the information\ncollected at the level of sampled Union producers the proportion of captive\nsales was found not to be significant (below 10%). It has to be underlined that\nthe parties in question expressed the presence of PET producers in the\npackaging business in terms of the installed production capacity of PET and not\nin terms of their market share in packaging. Therefore, the claim on\nsignificant proportion of captive use was found unsubstantiated. As regards the\nprice levels, the prices of related and unrelated sales were found to be within\nthe same range. \n(204)\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthese grounds it was concluded that the distinctive analysis of the impact of\ncaptive sales was not necessary and the claims of the parties were rejected. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of the parties\n(205)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties argued that the\ninjury due to imports from India did not exist during the RIP as evidenced by the\nrelative economic health and profits of the Union industry. It has to be note\nthat, indeed, no continuation of injury has been established in the present\ncase, and therefore the claim of the parties corresponds to the investigation\nfindings. \n(206)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties claimed that\nother factors, such as structural inefficiencies of the Union industry and lack of investment as well as seasonal and\nconjunctural factors (e.g. bad weather, economic crises) could have an impact\non the situation of the Union industry. Concerning the first point raised, it\nis to be noted that the restructuring of the Union industry is already taking\nplace and the efficiency gains obtained suggest that the claim of the parties are\nunfounded. As to the conjunctural factors, although the economic crises did\nhave an impact on the situation of the Union industry in 2009, as mentioned\nabove (recital (171) above), the relevant effects do not appear to be currently\npresent anymore. Concerning the effect of bad weather, this could partly\nexplain the shrinking consumption in the RIP, however, on the one hand, its\nalleged impact on the situation of the Union industry has not been\nsubstantiated and, on the other hand, the slight drop in 2011 appears to be\nrather linked to temporary scarcity of raw materials due to the global market\ndevelopments in 2011. Therefore, none of these claims is justified in view of\nthe findings of the investigation.\n(207)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\nsome parties argued that the recurrence of injury in this case is unlikely if\nthe measures were to expire, given that thanks to its structure (concentration\nand vertical integration) the Union industry is shielded from the effects of\nthe imports. Moreover, it has been argued that a shift to imported PET is\nneither desired nor possible in the near future, in particular as purchasing\ncontracts and policies as well as homologation process of large brand owners\n(downstream users) makes changes of PET suppliers cumbersome. It is to be noted\nthat based on the findings of the investigation the Union industry continued to\nlose market share to the benefit of imports during the period considered; this shows,\non the one hand, that the Union industry is not shielded from the effects of\nthe imports and, on the other hand, that the switch to imports is not\nhypothetical but is actually already taking place. The arguments had to be\ntherefore dismissed. \n(208)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure some parties reiterated the claim\nthat the Union industry was shielded from the potential competition of imports\ndue to its structure. Firstly, as regards the claim on dominant position of one\nof the producing groups in the Union market controlling five producers, it is\nnoted that the Union market is an open market with other eight producers operating\noutside this group and growing competition of imports from third countries \u2013\nwith and without any measures in place. Secondly,\nconcentration is typical for this type of business based on commodity product\nthat relies on economies of scale for its competitiveness. Thirdly, no price\nleader was found to exist on the Union market. Finally, parties reiterated that\nthe impact of the imports from the three countries concerned in the light of the\nvertical integration of some Union producers with the packaging industry or\nwith producers of PTA was not analysed. As established in recital (205) above these\naspects were indeed analysed and found unsubstantiated. Moreover, the\nverification of companies concerned by vertical integration with producers of\nraw materials confirmed there was no comparative advantage as the transfers\nwere made at market price. Based on the above, the claim that the Union industry\nwould be shielded from the competition was rejected. \n(209)\u00a0\u00a0 Last, some parties argued\nthat no elements support a conclusion that the Indian export capacity may\ntarget the Union market at \u2018cheap prices\u2019 given that (i) the domestic demand in\nIndia is growing and is expected to continue to grow; (ii) PET in excess of\ndomestic consumption exists, yet competition in export markets has not resulted\nin exports at abnormally low prices; (iii) increases in production capacity in\nAsia responds to the increase in demand expected worldwide. It is to be noted\nthat the findings in the present investigation demonstrate that the projected growth\nof capacity shows a growing excess of the production capacity over domestic\ndemand. In addition, the Indian prices on third markets were lower as compared\nto the Indian imports prices to the Union. Based on the findings described\nabove in recitals (189) to (199) it is likely that the subsidised Indian imports\nwill target the Union market at substantial volumes and below the average price\nof the Union industry should the countervailing measures be allowed to lapse. On\nthese grounds the arguments of the parties are dismissed.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the\nrecurrence of injury\n(210)\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthe basis of the foregoing it is concluded that it is likely that substantial volumes\nof subsidised import from India would be redirected to the Union should the countervailing\nmeasures be repealed. Thanks to the continued subsidisation, the prices of the imports\nwould most likely undercut the Union industry prices. Also, the prices of these\nimports are likely to decrease even further should the Indian exporting producers try to increase their market\nshares. This would in all likelihood have the effect of reinforcing the price\npressure on the Union industry, with an expected negative impact on its situation.\n(211)\u00a0\u00a0 During the period considered\nthe situation of the Union industry improved, in particular in terms of\nproductivity and capacity utilisation as well as profit margins that has reached\nin the RIP a level close to the target profit established in the original\ninvestigation. It can therefore be concluded that the Union industry, albeit\nstill in a fragile situation, did not suffer material injury during the RIP.\nHowever, given the likely substantial increase of subsidised imports from India, which are likely to undercut the Union industry\u2019s sales prices, it is concluded that\nthe situation would very likely deteriorate and the material injury would\nrecur, should measures be allowed to lapse.\nF. UNION INTEREST\n(212)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n31 of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether the maintenance of the\nexisting countervailing measures would be against the interest of the Union as a whole. The determination of the Union interest was based on an appreciation of\nall the various interests involved. All interested parties were given the\nopportunity to make their views known pursuant to Article 31(2) of the basic\nRegulation. \n(213)\u00a0\u00a0 It should be recalled that the\nadoption of measures was considered not to be against the interest of the Union neither in the original investigation nor in the last expiry review. Furthermore, the\nanalysis in the last expiry review was carried out in the situation where the\nmeasures had been already in place and thus the assessment took into account\nany undue negative impact on the parties concerned by the measures in question.\n\n(214)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, it was\nexamined whether despite the conclusions on the continuation of subsidisation\nand likelihood of recurrence of injury, any compelling reasons existed which\nwould lead to the conclusion that it is not in the Union interest to maintain\nmeasures in this particular case.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the Union\nindustry\n(215)\u00a0\u00a0 The continuation of the countervailing\nmeasures on imports from India would help the Union industry to continue the\non-going restructuring and enhance its only recently improved economic\nsituation, as it would help avoiding that the Union industry is exposed to the\nsubstantial volumes of subsidized imports from India, which the Union industry\ncould not withstand. The Union industry would therefore continue to benefit\nfrom the maintenance of the current countervailing measures. \n(216)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, it is concluded\nthat the maintenance of countervailing measures against India would be in the interest of the Union industry. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of unrelated\nimporters in the Union\n(217)\u00a0\u00a0 None of the unrelated\nimporters cooperated in the present review. Despite the measures in force the\nimports from India continued and nearly doubled over the period considered. \n(218)\u00a0\u00a0 The imports from other third\ncountries without any measures were also available and reached significant\nmarket share during the RIP (see recital (149) above). Therefore, even with the\nmeasures in place, importers had access to alternative sources of supply. \n(219)\u00a0\u00a0 Bearing in mind that there\nis no evidence suggesting that the measures in force considerably affected\nimporters, it is concluded that the continuation of measures will not be\nagainst the interest of the Union importers.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the suppliers\nof the raw materials in the Union\n(220)\u00a0\u00a0 The raw material for the\nmanufacturing of the product concerned is PTA/MEG. Two out of five known\nsuppliers of raw material (one supplier of PTA and one of MEG) cooperated with\nthe investigation by submitting the questionnaire reply. Both suppliers of the\nraw material expressed their support for the continuation of the measures. \n(221)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed that\nthe cooperating PTA producer represented a substantial part of the PTA\npurchases of the sampled Union producers in the RIP. Given that PTA has no\nother use in the Union than the production of PET, it is reasonable to assume\nthat PTA producers are largely dependent on the PET industry. \n(222)\u00a0\u00a0 As to the cooperating MEG\nsupplier, MEG represented relatively small part of its total turnover in the RIP.\nWith regard to MEG, PET is not its only or major possible application and MEG\nproducers are less dependent on the situation of the PET industry. Consequently,\nit is considered that the continuation of measures against subsidised imports\nof PET from India would have a positive, although likely limited, impact on the\nsuppliers of MEG. \n(223)\u00a0\u00a0 It was alleged that the\nsuppliers of raw material do not depend on the Union producers of PET; in\nparticular, as it was argued that two out of four sampled Union producers were\nin fact importing the raw materials.\n(224)\u00a0\u00a0 In relation to this claim\nthe investigation has shown that the imported material was predominantly MEG\nthat can also be used for other than PET applications. No indications were\ngathered showing more than negligible imports of PTA to the Union. Therefore,\nthis claim does not affect the conclusions taken as regards the dependency of\nPTA producers on PET production in the Union. \n(225)\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, it is\nconsidered that the continuation of measures against subsidised imports of PET\nfrom India would benefit the PTA producers and also, although to a lesser extent,\nthe MEG suppliers. As a consequence the continuation of measures against\nimports from India would not be against the interest of the raw material\nsuppliers.\n(226)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome parties claimed that PTA was exported and therefore the PTA producers were\nclaimed not to be dependent on Union industry. No evidence supporting this\nclaim was presented. Therefore the argument of the parties was dismissed as\nunsubstantiated.\n(227)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the same parties\nclaimed that lifting the measures will not have any impact on the PTA producers\nas the cooperating users will allegedly not switch to imports and will continue\nto source PET from the Union industry. Therefore, the level of PTA consumption\nin the Union will remain the same. Based on the findings of the investigation\nthe Union industry continued to lose market share to the benefit of imports\nduring the period considered. This shows that the switch to imports is not\nhypothetical (see recital (164) above). The argument of the parties was\ntherefore dismissed.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of PET recycling industry\n(228)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry argued\nthat the situation of the recycling industry depends on the sustainable price\nof virgin PET (non-recycled PET) on the Union market. Their claim was\nsubstantiated by a press release of an association of plastic recyclers in Europe, according to which a potential lifting of the measures on virgin PET could further worsen\nthe situation of the recycling industry.\n(229)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\ncontested that the situation of the recycling industry depends on the\nsustainable price of virgin PET on the Union market arguing that the prices of\nvirgin PET and recycled PET were unrelated. It was claimed that recycled PET is\nmainly used for the production of polyester fibre and therefore cannot be\nlinked to the price developments of virgin PET. In addition, it was noted that the\nrecycled PET is entirely supported by bottle-fillers and thus the industry does\nnot depend on PET producers. Finally, it was also noted that recycling industry\ndid not come forward as an interested party in the present investigation.\n(230)\u00a0\u00a0 Since the recycling industry\ndid not come forward in this investigation, none of the above-mentioned\nallegations could have been verified against the actual figures. Therefore, it\nis considered that in overall the measures in force would not be against the\ninterest of the recycling industry in the Union.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the users\n(231)\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned is\npredominantly used to produce bottles for water and other soft drinks. Its use\nfor the production of other packages (foodstuff, sheets, etc.) remains\nrelatively limited. Bottles of PET are produced in two stages: (i) first a\npre-form is made by mould injection of PET, and (ii) later the pre-form is\nheated and blown into a bottle. Bottle making can be an integrated process\n(i.e. the same company buys PET, produces a pre-form and blows it into the\nbottle) or limited to the second stage (blowing the pre-form into a bottle).\nPre-forms can be relatively easily transported as they are small and dense,\nwhile empty bottles are unstable and due to their size very expensive to\ntransport.\n(232)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, two main\ngroups of downstream users have been established for studying of the impact of\nthe measures in force: (i) converters and/or bottle makers, converting PET\nchips into pre-forms (or bottles) and selling them for downstream processing;\nand (ii) bottlers, filling (and blowing) the bottles out of pre-form; this\ngroup represents mostly the producers of mineral water and soft drinks. The\nbottlers are often involved in the PET business either via integrated bottle\nmaking operations or via tolling agreements with subcontracted converters\nand/or bottle makers for whom they negotiate the PET price with the producer\n(soft tolling) or even buy the PET for their own bottles (hard tolling). \n(233)\u00a0\u00a0 Seventeen\n(five converters and twelve bottlers) cooperated in the investigation and provided\ninformation collected by the questionnaire. The cooperating converters represented\n22.7% and bottlers 13% of the total consumption of PET in the Union. The replies of bottlers came from various\nbranches of the multinational companies (known as brand-owners). \n(234)\u00a0\u00a0 It has been established that\nthe cooperating users sourced PET predominantly from the Union producers and\nonly a small proportion was sourced from imports. The imports from India represented roughly half of these imports and thus a minimal proportion of the\nsourced PET. Nevertheless, the imports from other third countries without any\nmeasures were also available and reached significant market share during the\nRIP (see recital (149) above). Therefore, even with the measures in place, the\nusers had access to alternative sources of supply. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Arguments of the users'\nindustry\n(235)\u00a0\u00a0 Users claimed to be significantly\naffected by substantial increases in the price of PET in recent years which cannot be transferred to retailers and consumers in\nthe current economic environment. It is claimed that these price\nincreases have resulted from accumulation of many years\nof application of trade defence measures, which have protected the Union producers\nfrom the competition of imports at the time when the Union PET industry became\nmore concentrated and integrated. As a result, the users claimed that the\nmeasures in place, through their alleged impact on the price of PET, are\nresponsible for the deterioration of the downstream industry's employment,\nR&D and competitiveness on export markets, with a more acute impact on\nSMEs. It was also claimed that the job losses due to the measures in force\nexceeded the number of people currently employed by the Union PET industry.\n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Price sensitivity and cost\nstructure of the users\n(236)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nregards the PET price sensitivity of converters, PET was found to represent around\n80% of the total costs. PET is therefore considered a critical cost component\nfor this type of activity. In addition, the converters' industry was found to\nbe rather fragmented with a relatively weak negotiating position against large bottlers\nand inherent structural problems typical for the commodity based industry. As a\nresult, this sector showed an increasing tendency to vertical integration with\nbottlers and the use of tolling agreements on the basis of which the conversion\nfees are guaranteed and the PET price is ultimately negotiated and paid by the\nbottlers. It is estimated that substantial part of PET purchases on the Union\nmarket is controlled directly by the large bottlers. Since the contracts for\npre-forms often include a mechanism for reflecting the variation of PET prices,\nthe convertors are increasingly neutral towards the developments of PET prices. \n(237)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome users contested the conclusion on the increased use of tolling and price\nformulas. The information in the file confirmed existence of such trend. The\nclaim was therefore dismissed.\n(238)\u00a0\u00a0 It was claimed that the\nmeasures in place would not cause damage to the converters, if similar measures\nwere applied on imports of preforms into the Union. It was argued that in the\nareas close to the Union border with third countries, in which there are no\nmeasures against imports of PET from India, there are incentives to delocalise\nthe production of preforms and import them free of countervailing measures on\nPET into the Union. It is acknowledged that to some extent there is an economic\nrationale for this process to be happening. However, given the transportation\ncost, the delocalisation is likely to occur only within limited distances. In\noverall, the claimed negative impact of the measures in question on some\nconverters is therefore considered to be marginal.\n(239)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the PET price\nimpact on bottlers, based on the reported figures, the PET is estimated to\nrepresent on a weighted average basis 9% of total costs of bottled soft drinks\nand 12% of the total costs of bottled mineral water. This shows that PET is not\nthe main cost component for the bottling industry. \n(240)\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the\ninvestigation has established that PET was the preferred although not the\nexclusive packaging material of bottlers. PET products represented 75% of the\nturnover of water bottlers and 50% of the turnover of producers of soft drinks.\nFurthermore, the investigation showed that contracts between many large bottlers\n(brand owners) and PET\nproducers were based on a formula whereby the price was adjusted to reflect\nfluctuation of prices of raw materials for PET. This confirms the existing negotiating power of the large and\nthus the most representative bottlers over the conversion margin of the PET\nproducers. \n(241)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome users reiterated their argument that PET is a basic cost component for converters,\nsoft drink and bottled water industries and the findings in this respect were\ninaccurate and not based on the reported data. It is noted that the situation\nof converters was analysed separately and this comment is in their case\nunfounded (see recital (236) above). As regards the assessment of the situation\nof the bottlers it is confirmed that the cost ratios established in the\ninvestigation are based on the figures reported by the cooperating bottlers\nfollowing a methodology available to all parties. The established cost ratios were\nin line with the findings of previous investigations concerning the same\nproduct concerned[17]. The claims of the parties were therefore considered\nunsubstantiated.\n(242)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome users claimed that the essence of the company specific data and\ninformation provided by them was not reflected in the analysis of the Union\ninterest. It is confirmed that the data was used as reported by the users in\ntheir questionnaire replies. The calculation methodology was made available to\nall parties concerned. On this ground the claim was rejected.\n(243)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has also established\nthat based on the expected and/or desired decrease of PET prices estimated by\nthe verified bottlers themselves, if the measures would result in negligible cost\nreduction for the bottlers. Based on these estimates of PET price decrease and\nthe established cost ratios, the respective cost reduction was calculated to be\nwithin the range of 0.3-0.7% of the total costs of the bottlers for their PET-related\nactivities.\n(244)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome users disputed this conclusion arguing that any saving in costs would be\nsignificant. Some users put forward new estimates in their submissions without\nproviding any new evidence. It is emphasised that the prospective savings are\nhypothetical, as was also admitted by some users themselves. As regards the\nconverters, no quantification of prospective saving was put forward for this\nsegment. As regards the bottlers, it was considered that should the alleged PET\nprice decrease materialise, in the light of the costs structure of the\nbottlers, saving within 0.3%-0.7% of total costs cannot be considered\n'significant'. Since no new evidence was provided, the claim was dismissed as\nunsubstantiated.\n(245)\u00a0\u00a0 It was claimed that some\nbottled-water producers have inherent vulnerabilities stemming from legal\nrequirements imposed for the source water to be bottled at the source and\nlimited extraction volumes. The sector is being dominated by SMEs, which has an\nimpact on the cost structure of the companies in questions. Also, variations\nhave been observed in the price levels of final products across Member States\ndepending on the purchasing power of the local population. On these grounds it\nis considered that the impact of an eventual decrease of PET prices, if the\nmeasures were lifted, would be more pronounced for this part of the bottling\nindustry.\n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alleged premium prices and\nprofits of Union industry\n(246)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties alleged the existence\nof premium prices and premium margins practised by PET producers in the Union, claiming that these would be at the origin of the price increases in 2011. This\nclaim was also supported by the comparison made between PET prices and spread\nover the raw materials in the Union to the situation on Asian market and in the\n  USA. It was claimed that this situation results from the accumulation of\ntrade remedies. \n(247)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis to be noted that the increase of the prices of PET in 2011, as well as its\ndecline in 2009, was a worldwide phenomenon driven by the evolution of the cost\nof raw materials (see recital (155)). Data submitted by the parties\nsystematically showed a very close correlation between the evolution of PET\nprices in Europe, Asia and the USA. Nevertheless, there are indeed differences in the prices of PET\nacross the world which are related to various reasons, in particular, the specific\ncost structure in each region,. As regards the argument on existing premium\nmargin in the Union, it is noted that even under exceptional circumstances in\nlate 2010 and beginning of 2011 the Union industry has merely reached the\nprofitability considered reasonable for this type of industry. No evidence of\npremium profit was found. Therefore, the argument on existing 'premium' prices\nand 'premium' margins on the PET in the Union that are due to the existence of\nthe measures in question has to be rejected. \n(248)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome parties reiterated their argument that the prices in the Union were\nunjustifiably high reflecting the impact of accumulation of anti-dumping\nmeasures operating in a market with concentration among Union producers, vertical\nintegration and limited production unable to satisfy the consumption. It was\nalso claimed that the price data also showed that the higher prices in the Union are not reflecting the higher costs of raw materials. It is noted that the arguments\non concentration, vertical integration and production capacity of Union\nindustry were addressed in recitals (207) and (259) respectively. As regards\nthe claimed impact of these factors on the PET price in the Union it is\nrecalled that the PET price development is driven by the price of raw materials\nthat account for up to 90% of cost of PET (see recital (173) above). Also, the\nincrease in PET prices in 2010/2011 was a worldwide phenomenon (see recital (172)\nabove). The claims of the parties were therefore unsubstantiated.\n(249)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the argument concerning\nthe gap between the Union PET price and prices in Asia and US, and in addition\nto findings already stated in recital (244) above, it was found that the\ndifference in prices between US and Union market was volatile, yet moderate. Union\nprices were not systematically higher as claimed. Union and Asian market were\nfound to be very different in terms of cost structures linked in particular to\nthe size of the market and economies of scale, access to the raw materials and\ncapacity. Therefore, comparing the average prices between these two markets was\nnot meaningful. The argument of the parties was therefore found\nunsubstantiated.\n(250)\u00a0\u00a0 Also, some parties claimed\nthat the prices in the Union reflect a higher spread over the cost of raw\nmaterials as compared to US or Asia. The comparison of spreads follows the same\nlogic as comparison on prices on various regional markets with the difference\nthat the variations of prices of raw materials between various regional markets\nare accounted for. Nevertheless, the existing structural differences between\nthe markets can justify the difference in conversion fees. The extraordinary\nprofits made by Union industry at the break of 2010/2011 were explained in\nrecital (179) above. In none of the situations the measures were found to play\na role. Therefore the argument of the parties was rejected.\n(251)\u00a0\u00a0 The same parties also\nclaimed that the largest producer in the Union charged higher prices in the\nUnion than on other markets and recorder higher revenues in 2010 in the Union than elsewhere. In this context, it is considered that it is economically justifiable\nthat a transnational company would have different cost structures and thus\ndifferent prices on different regional markets. The exceptional profitability\nlevels at the break of 2010/2011 were explained in recital (179) above. On\nthese grounds the argument was rejected.\n6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic situation of users\nand claimed impact of the measures\n(252)\u00a0\u00a0 Further claims were made as\nregards the worsening economic situation of the user's industry, such as\nclosing facilities and reducing employment. It was alleged that this was the result\nof the PET price increase. In addition, it was claimed that the competitiveness of European leading brands has\nbeen eroded as their exports in third countries were in direct competition with\nbottled-products that benefit from PET at international prices. \n(253)\u00a0\u00a0 It should be noted, that based\non the information submitted by the cooperating users, the users segment was\nnot found to be loss-making even though there was a decline in the overall\nprofitability level in RIP. The profit margin of the\nusers' industry established on the basis of the questionnaire replies according\nto the methodology made available to all parties was found to be at similar\nlevel as the profitability established for the Union industry in RIP. The two verified companies (bottlers) reported further expansions in\nproduction volumes and increased profitability over the period considered. Some\nconverters were found operating on tight margins, in some cases facing\nstructural and financial difficulties. However, no direct the link with the measures\nin place could have been established in this respect. Similarly, certain\ndecline in the economic situation of the bottlers was linked to the squeeze\ncaused in 2011 by the sudden increase of PET price that could have not been\npassed on to retailers under the current economic downturn. However, while it\nhas been established that the situation of the users industry deteriorated to\ncertain extent in 2011, the link between the decline and the existence of the\nmeasures was not demonstrated, especially given that the measures were in places\nsince 2000. \n(254)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome parties disagreed with the conclusion that the users' industry was not\nloss making. The parties also claimed that the profit margins of users were\nlower than those of the Union industry. As regards the assessment of\nprofitability of the users' industry, the information collected from the\ncooperating users contradicted this claim. The methodology was made available\nto the parties. Although some cooperating users could have been loss making,\nthe user's industry was overall found to be profitable. In any event, if the\nincrease of PET prices was found to be one element affecting the profitability\nof the users, no link between the measures and the profitability of the\ncompanies in question was demonstrated. As regards the comparison of profit\nmargins of users and the Union industry, this claim was not substantiated. Due\nto the volatility of the profitability of the Union industry (see recitals (176)\nto (179) above) the comparison between the two segments was not considered\nconclusive. In any event, the both segments showed similar profitability levels\nduring the RIP (see recital (253). In this light, the comments of the parties were\nrejected as unsubstantiated. \n(255)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the alleged\nerosion of the competitiveness of the exports of the Union producers of bottled\nmineral water/soft drinks, this claim was neither substantiated, nor has a link\nto the existence of the measures in place been in this context demonstrated.\n(256)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe disclosure the parties reiterated that the rising\nPET prices have a negative impact on the competitiveness of exports of bottled\nwater. It is recognised that the PET price increase,\namong other things, can have a negative impact on the competitiveness of exports of bottled water. Nevertheless, since no link between\nthe PET price increase and the measures in question was found as the PET prices\nprimarily derive from the prices of raw materials, the claimed impact of the\nmeasures on the eroded competitiveness was rejected. \n(257)\u00a0\u00a0 Finally,\nas to the claimed effect of the measures on the employment, the investigation\nrevealed that the verified job losses of the users industry were predominantly linked\nto the productivity and efficiency gains and a part concerned the reduction of\nthe temporary staff. \n(258)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure some\nparties disputed this finding on the grounds that it did not reflect the\nsituation of the entire sector. In addition to the findings described in\nrecital (254) above, it is noted that total jobs reported by the converters significantly increased and none of them\nreported job losses. Bottlers claimed job losses as a result of increased PET\nprice. However, the increase in PET price being a worldwide phenomenon, no link\nbetween job losses and the measures was established. Furthermore, 90% of the\njob losses reported by the users\u2019 questionnaires replies were concentrated on three\ncompanies. One of them, a verified user representing substantial part of the\nreported job losses, increased substantially its volumes over the period considered\nand such losses are therefore associated to productivity gains. As for the\nremaining two companies, they were found to have the profitability margins among\nthe highest of the cooperating parties in their segment and above the target\nprofit of the Union industry in this case. The claims were therefore dismissed.\n6.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other arguments\n(259)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe disclosure some parties argued that the Union producers do not have\nsufficient capacities to meet the existing demand. It is noted that the Union\nindustry operated at 86% of its production capacity in RIP and has sufficient\nspare capacity to cover total domestic consumption of PET. In addition, imports\nfrom other countries with and without measures continue to exist and have an\nincreasing tendency. Also, the current measures expired in case of South Korea and are lifted for imports of\nthe product concerned from Malaysia and Indonesia. In addition, PET recycling\nindustry may constitute further source of PET to cover the PET demand in the Union. For these reasons, the alleged problems faced by users due to the claimed\ninsufficient production in the Union were not considered substantiated. \n(260)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome users claimed the analysis did not address the claimed adverse impact of\nthe accumulation of measures on the product concerned under the present review.\nIn response to this argument it is noted that the countervailing measures\nmerely remedy the injurious effect of established subsidisation. The existence\nof the claimed 'accumulated' effect was not demonstrated. On the contrary,\ndespite the measures in place, the imports from countries with measures\ncontinue and their volumes even increased during the period considered. Also,\nimports from countries without any measures are available with a growing trend\nand at substantial volumes. The argument of the parties was therefore\ndismissed.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the Union\ninterest\n(261)\u00a0\u00a0 To conclude, it is expected\nthat the extension of the countervailing measures on imports from India would\nprovide an opportunity for the Union industry to improve and to stabilise its\neconomic situation following the investments and consolidation made in the\nrecent years. \n(262)\u00a0\u00a0 It is also considered that an\nimproved economic situation of the Union industry may be in the interest of PTA\nproducers and, to a lesser extent, MEG producers in the Union. \n(263)\u00a0\u00a0 The economic situation of some\nusers has worsened since the last review and in particular smaller bottle-water\nproducers were found, among other reasons, to be negatively affected, especially\nit seems, by the recent PET price increase since they were unable to pass it on\nto retailers under the current economic climate. However, the exceptional price\nand margin developments of Union industry in 2011 were found to be a global phenomenon primarily driven by the increase in the prices\nof raw materials. Therefore, the allegations on\nexisting 'premium' prices and 'premium' margins linked to existence of the\nmeasures in question were found unjustified. At the same time, Union market\ncontinues to be an open market with existing alternative sources of supply from\nother third countries without any measures. \n(264)\u00a0\u00a0 Against this background, no\nlink between the PET price increase and the existing measures was demonstrated.\nEconomic situation of converters was found to be stable despite the measures in\nforce. The weight of PET in the total cost of the bottlers was found to be\nlimited. Furthermore, no link between the PET price variations and the measures\nwas demonstrated. On these grounds, the measures were found not have\ndisproportionate effect on the users. \n(265)\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account all of\nthe factors outlined above, it cannot be clearly concluded that it is not in the\nUnion interest to maintain the current countervailing measures.\nG. RELATION BETWEEN ANTI_DUMPING\nAND COUNTERVAILING MEASURES\n(266)\u00a0\u00a0 A parallel investigation on\nthe expiry of anti-dumping measures has been carried out (see recital (8)\nabove). That investigation confirmed the necessity to continue the application\nof such measures at unchanged levels. The present investigation also concluded\nthat countervailing measures on exports from India should be kept in force at\nunchanged levels. In that respect, reference is made to recital (125) of\nRegulation (EC) No 2604/2000. As the measures currently proposed for exports of\nPET from India remain unchanged, it follows that Article 14(1) of the Council Regulation\n(EC) No 1225/2009 and Article 24(1) of the Regulation are complied with.\nH. COUNTERVAILING MEASURES\n(267)\u00a0\u00a0 All parties were informed of\nthe essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to\nrecommend that the existing measures be maintained. They were also granted a\nperiod within which they could make representations subsequent to this disclosure.\nThe submissions and comments were duly taken into consideration, where\nwarranted. \n(268)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above\nanalyses the countervailing measures applicable to imports of PET originating\nin India should be maintained in compliance with Article 18(1) of the basic\nRegulation. It is recalled that these measures consist of specific duties. \n(269)\u00a0\u00a0 The individual company countervailing\nduty rates specified in this Regulation are solely applicable to imports of the\nproduct concerned produced by these companies and thus by the specific legal\nentities mentioned. Imports of the product concerned manufactured by any other\ncompany not specifically mentioned in Article 1(2) of this Regulation with its\nname and address, including entities related to those specifically mentioned,\ncannot benefit from these rates and shall be subject to the duty rate\napplicable to \u2018all other companies\u2019.\n(270)\u00a0\u00a0 Any claim requesting the\napplication of these individual countervailing duty rates (e.g. following a\nchange in the name of the entity or following the setting up of new production\nor sales entities) should be addressed to the Commission forthwith with all\nrelevant information, in particular any modification in the company\u2019s\nactivities linked to production, domestic and export sales associated with, for\ninstance, that name change or that change in the production and sales entities.\nIf appropriate, the Regulation will then be accordingly amended by updating the\nlist of companies benefiting from individual duty rates.\n(271)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure proper\nenforcement of the countervailing duty, the residual duty level should not only\napply to non-cooperating exporters but also apply to those companies which did\nnot have any exports during the RIP. However, the latter companies are invited\n, when they fulfil the requirements of article 20 of the basic regulation, to\npresent a request for a review pursuant to that Article in order to have their\nsituation examined individually,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A definitive countervailing duty\nis hereby imposed on imports of polyethylene terephthalate having a viscosity number\nof 78 ml/g or higher, according to ISO Standard 1628-5, currently falling\nwithin CN code 3907 60 20 and originating in India.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rate of the definitive countervailing\nduty applicable to the product described in paragraph 1 and manufactured by the\ncompanies listed below shall be as follows:\n Country || Company || Counter-vailing duty (EUR/tonne) || TARIC additional code \n India || Reliance Industries Ltd || 90.4 || A181 \n India || Pearl Engineering Polymers Ltd || 74.6 || A182 \n India || Senpet Ltd || 22.0 || A183 \n India || Futura Polyesters Ltd || 0 || A184 \n India || Dhunseri Petrochem & Tea Limited || 106.5 || A585 \n India || All other companies || 69.4 || A999 \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In cases where goods have been\ndamaged before entry into free circulation and, therefore, the price actually\npaid or payable is apportioned for the determination of the customs value\npursuant to Article 145 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93[18], the amount of countervailing\nduty, calculated on the basis of the amounts set above, shall be reduced by a\npercentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or\npayable.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and\n2, the definitive countervailing duty shall not apply to imports released for\nfree circulation in accordance with Article 2.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unless otherwise specified, the\nprovisions in force concerning customs duties shall apply.\nArticle 2 \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports shall be exempt from the\ncountervailing duties imposed by Article 1 provided that they are produced and\ndirectly exported (i.e. invoiced and shipped) to a company acting as an\nimporter in the Union by the companies whose names are listed in Decision\n2000/745/EC, as from time to time amended, declared under the appropriate TARIC\nadditional code and that the conditions set out in paragraph 2 are met.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the request for release for\nfree circulation is presented, exemption from the duties shall be conditional\nupon presentation to the customs authorities of the Member State concerned of a\nvalid Undertaking Invoice issued by the exporting companies from which\nundertakings are accepted, containing the essential elements listed in the\nAnnex.
