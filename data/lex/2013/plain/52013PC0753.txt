In this respect,\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation\r\nand sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries\r\nPolicy sets out the objectives for the annual proposals for catch and fishing effort\r\nlimitations to ensure that Union fisheries are ecologically, economically and\r\nsocially sustainable. \nThe fishing opportunities exercise\r\nrepresents an annual management cycle (biennial in the case of deep sea\r\nstocks). However, this does not stand in the way of the introduction of\r\nlong-term management approaches. The Union has made good progress in this\r\nregard and key stocks of commercial interest are now subject to multi-annual\r\nmanagement plans. Yearly TACs and effort ceilings must comply with them. \nScope\nFor 2014, the Commission has taken into\r\naccount the wishes of Member States to return to one single text for the\r\nGeneral fishing opportunities regulation, as opposed to the approach taken in\r\n2012 and 2013. In each of those years two separate texts were proposed and\r\nadopted: one for fishing opportunities on which the EU decides alone and\r\nanother one comprising the fishing opportunities that are fixed on the basis of\r\ndecisions taken in the framework of bilateral or multilateral negotiations.\r\nAccordingly, the structure and recurring text of this proposal has been based\r\non merging such separate regulations adopted in 2013 (Council Regulations (EU)\r\nNo 39/2013 and (EU) No 40/2013). \nRegarding the fishing opportunities\r\nresulting from agreed measures in a multilateral or bilateral fisheries\r\nagreement or process, the Union intervenes on the basis of a position stemming\r\nfrom scientific advice and its own policy objectives, which apply equally to\r\ninternal EU decisions. The outcome of such negotiations implies the Union's consent to assume obligations vis-\u00e0-vis third parties. The Union has no substantive\r\nmargin of discretion beyond the internal allocation among Member States when it\r\ncomes to implementing such decisions in Union law. As for internal allocation,\r\nthe principle of relative stability applies. In that respect, the proposal\r\ncovers:\n\u00b7                        \r\nShared stocks, i.e. stocks that are jointly\r\nmanaged with Norway in the North Sea and the Skagerrak, or related to North\r\nEast Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) Coastal State Agreements.\n\u00b7                        \r\nFishing opportunities resulting from agreements\r\nreached in the framework of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations\r\n(RFMOs).\nA number of fishing opportunities are\r\nmarked as \"pm\" (pro memoria) in this proposal. This is\r\ndue to the fact that either:\n\u2013                        \r\nthe advice on some stocks will not be available\r\nby the time the proposal is scheduled for adoption; or\n\u2013                        \r\ncertain catch limitations and other\r\nrecommendations from the relevant RFMOs are pending because their annual\r\nmeetings have not taken place yet; or\n\u2013                        \r\nfor stocks in Greenland waters, as well as\r\nshared stocks or stocks exchanged with Norway and other third countries, the\r\nfigures are not available yet, pending the conclusion of consultations in\r\nNovember and December 2014 with those countries. \nStock overview\nAs usual, the Commission has reviewed the\r\nsituation to which the fishing opportunities proposals must respond via its\r\nannual Communication from the Commission concerning a consultation on Fishing\r\nOpportunities (COM(2013)319 final, hereinafter \"Communication\"). The\r\nCommunication provides an overview of the state of the stocks based on the\r\nfindings of the scientific advice issued in 2012. On the positive side, the\r\nCommunication reports that, among the stocks for which a full analysis is\r\navailable, those fished above sustainable levels have fallen from 86 % in 2009 to\r\n39% in 2013. However, some trends are still observed that give rise to concern.\r\nFor instance, the number of stocks under an advice to reduce catches to the\r\nlowest possible level has increased. Furthermore, in terms of data, Member\r\nStates have not fully complied with their reporting requirements which are key\r\nto facilitating a robust analysis of the status of various stocks. \nIn response to the Commission's request,\r\nthe International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) provided in\r\nJuly its annual advice on most fish stocks covered by this proposal. ICES has\r\ntaken into account the orientations presented by the Commission in its\r\nCommunication. This advice was reviewed by the Scientific, Technical and\r\nEconomic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) at its summer plenary.\nScientific advice delivered by those two\r\nbodies is essentially dependent on data: only stocks for which there is\r\nsufficient and reliable data can be fully assessed, so that stock size\r\nestimates are produced, as well as a forecast of how they will react to the\r\nvarious exploitation scenarios (this is referred to as \"catch options\r\ntables\"). Where sufficient data is available, the Scientific bodies are\r\nable to provide estimates of adjustments to the fishing opportunities that will\r\nbring the stock to produce its maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The advice is\r\nthen referred to as \"MSY advice\". In other cases, the Scientific\r\nbodies rely on the precautionary approach to make recommendations as to what\r\nthe level of fishing opportunities should be. The methodology followed by ICES\r\nto that end is presented in ICES published material pertaining to the\r\nimplementation of advice for data limited stocks[1].\nThe main group of TACs proposed belong to Annex IA. This annex carries 152 TACs for stocks fished in the Skagerrak, Kattegat, ICES\r\nsubareas I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XII and XIV, EU waters\r\nof CECAF and French Guiana waters. Of these TACs, 23 are covered by MSY advice.\r\nAs for the rest:\n\u00b7                        \r\n13 TACs are proposed in line with long-term\r\nmanagement plans e.g.. management plans stemming from specific CFP regulations\r\nin force, Commission proposals for management plans not yet adopted, or\r\nmanagement plans put forward by Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) and evaluated\r\nas precautionary by scientific advisory bodies.\n\u00b7                        \r\n55 TACs concern data-limited stocks, for which a\r\nfull assessment is not available. Of these, 21 TACs are proposed at the same\r\nlevel as in 2012, following a joint statement by the Council and the Commission\r\nwhereby the fishing opportunities would be kept stable unless scientific advice\r\nbecame available showing that the stock is deteriorating. The rationale for\r\nthis decision lies in the fact that most of these stocks are by-catches in\r\nmixed fisheries and there is no real incidence of TAC changes on the evolution\r\nof their status, whereas recurrent TAC cuts may give rise to regulatory\r\ndiscards. \n\u00b7                        \r\nThe remaining TACs are at this stage shown in\r\n\u201cpm\u201d (pro memoria) due to the fact that the related scientific advice is not\r\nyet available or depends on international negotiations or agreements to be\r\nconcluded later in the year. For these stocks, the proposal will need to be\r\nupdated as the advice becomes available.\nAll the proposed fishing opportunities\r\nrespond to the scientific advice received by the Commission as to the state of\r\nthe stocks, which has been used in the manner outlined in the Communication.\nConsistency with other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThe measures proposed are designed in\r\naccordance with the objectives and the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and\r\nare consistent with the Union's policy on sustainable development.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation methods, main\r\nsectors targeted and general profile of respondents\nThe Commission has consulted stakeholders,\r\nin particular through the RACs, and Member States on its proposed approach to\r\nits various fishing opportunities proposals on the basis of its Communication\r\non Fishing Opportunities for 2014.\nIn addition, the Commission has followed\r\nthe orientations outlined in its Communication to the Council and European\r\nParliament on improving consultation on Community fisheries management\r\n(COM(2006)246 final), which sets out the principles for the so called\r\nfront-loading process.\nFurthermore, the Commission organised an\r\nevent for stakeholders in September 2013, at which the outcomes of the\r\nscientific advice and its key implications were presented and discussed.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of responses and how they\r\nwere taken into account\nThe response to the Commission Consultation\r\non Fishing Opportunities mentioned above reflects the views of Member States and stakeholders on the evaluation made by the Commission of the state of the\r\nresources and how to ensure the appropriate management response.\nMember States\nThe only Member State that has reacted to\r\nthe Communication at the time of writing this explanatory memorandum is the United Kingdom. In its response, the United Kingdom appreciates the Commission\u2019s efforts to\r\nensure consistency with the Common Fisheries Policy reform package, as well as\r\nthe Marine Strategy Framework Directive. It supports MSY objectives by 2015\r\nwhere possible and, as regards the precautionary approach, it calls for\r\npragmatism and a case-by-case approach to the setting of TACs.\nNorth Western Waters RAC (NWWRAC)\nThe NWWRAC agrees with the objective\r\nenshrined in the political agreement on the Common Fisheries Policy reform\r\nwhereby stocks should be exploited at MSY level by 2015 where possible and by\r\n2020 at the latest. The NWWRAC recognises that improvements in gear selectivity\r\nare a priority in its area of interest, and takes note of the specific concerns\r\nraised by the Communication regarding whitefish (cod, haddock and whiting) in\r\nthe Irish Sea and the West of Scotland. As regards scientific advice, while the\r\nNWWRAC welcomes the new advisory methodology introduced by ICES in 2012, it\r\nalso expects a more sophisticated solution to be developed for data-limited\r\nstocks, and in order to do so it intends to continue working closely with ICES\r\nand national scientists on data availability and quality.\nCollection and use of expertise\nAs for the methodology used, the Commission\r\nconsulted, as already noted, the International Council for the Exploration of\r\nthe Sea (ICES) and its Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for\r\nFisheries (STECF). Advice from ICES is based on an advice framework developed\r\nby its expert groups and decision-making bodies and issued in accordance with\r\nthe Memorandum of Understanding agreed with the Commission. The STECF gives its\r\nadvice following terms of reference that it receives from the Commission.\nThe ultimate objective\r\nof the Union is to bring the stocks to levels that can deliver Maximum\r\nSustainable Yield (MSY). This objective has been incorporated expressly in the Commission\r\nproposal for a reformed Common Fisheries Policy[2].\r\nIn June 2013, the co-legislators reached a political agreement on this proposal\r\nthat foresees, among others, that the MSY objective \"\u2026shall be achieved by 2015, where possible, and by 2020 for all\r\nstocks at the latest.\" The express inclusion of this objective in the Basic Regulation of\r\nthe CFP reflects the commitment taken by the Union regarding the conclusions of\r\nthe 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and its\r\nrelated Plan of Implementation. Such texts foresee that States commit, where\r\npossible, to maintain or restore depleted fish stocks to maximum sustainable\r\nyield levels not later than 2015. As already noted, for some stocks this\r\ninformation is indeed available. Among these figure very important stocks in\r\nterms of volume of catches and commercial value such as hake, cod, anglerfish,\r\nsole, megrims, haddock and Norway lobster. \nReaching the MSY objective may, in certain\r\ncases, need a reduction in fishing mortality rates and/or a reduction in\r\ncatches. Against this background, this proposal makes\r\nuse of the MSY advice, where available. Some stocks have been already exploited\r\nat MSY levels in the past recent years. The proposed TACs in this case seek to\r\nensure that these levels are maintained, or where the advice shows that\r\nharvesting went beyond MSY in 2012, reduce fishing mortality to return the\r\nstocks to sustainable exploitation rates. For stocks which have not yet reached\r\nMSY rates, the TACs proposed are consistent with MSY 2015. This approach follows\r\nthe principles presented in the Communication on fishing opportunities for\r\n2014. \nFor data-limited\r\nstocks, the scientific advisory bodies issue recommendations as to whether to\r\nreduce, stabilise or allow catches to increase. ICES advice has in many cases\r\nprovided quantitative guidance about such variations, based on their\r\nmethodology of a +/- 20% maximum change in catches from one year to the other,\r\non precautionary grounds. This guidance has been used to set the TACs proposed.\r\nWhere there is no scientific advice at all, the precautionary approach has been\r\nfollowed, meaning precautionary TAC reductions by 20%.\nFor some stocks (mainly\r\nwidely distributed stocks, sharks and rays) the advice will be issued in the\r\nautumn. This proposal will need to be updated as appropriate once that advice\r\nis received. Finally, as mentioned above, for 13 stocks the advice is used for\r\nthe purpose of implementing agreed management plans. \nIn terms of the actual\r\ntrends seen in the evolution of the stocks, the following cases may be\r\nhighlighted:\nIberian waters\nWhile anglerfish and\r\nmegrims are in good condition and exploited sustainably, some of the Norway lobster stocks remain depleted. The southern hake biomass continues to increase,\r\ndespite the fact that the fishing pressure on the stock is still high. The\r\npositive response of the stock may therefore be due to favourable environmental\r\nconditions. In order to maximise the gains from this trend, fishing effort\r\nreductions in accordance with the applicable long-term management plan for this\r\nstock are warranted.\nBay of Biscay\nThe stock of common\r\nsole in the Bay of Biscay remains in suboptimal condition; ICES advises TAC\r\ncuts for the third year in a row. However, the TAC is shown as \u201cpm\u201d (pro\r\nmemoria) in this proposal because the relevant stakeholders have put forward measures\r\nfor the long-term management of this stock, and the Commission awaits\r\nscientific advice on such proposed measures (expected in November 2013).\nCeltic Sea\nLess fish is entering\r\nthe fishery, and biomass has decreased for stocks of high economic importance\r\nin this area. Accordingly, significant TAC cuts are proposed where scientific\r\nadvice calls for them, e.g. for cod and haddock. High levels of discards are a\r\npersistent problem, not just in the whitefish fishery, but also in the flatfish\r\nfishery: sole and plaice are caught together, yet scientific advice calls for\r\nopposite management actions, i.e. a reduction for sole and an increase for\r\nplaice. The problem is compounded by the technical difficulty of achieving\r\nselectivity for sole (i.e. allowing this species to avoid being retained in the\r\nfishing gear, while keeping plaice).\nWest of Scotland\nIn this area, whitefish\r\n(cod, whiting, haddock) is in poor condition, subject to unsustainable levels\r\nof discards. Cod is failing to recover and a 0 TAC is proposed, even though\r\nmanagement by TAC alone may not suffice to stop its decline. In fact, the\r\nsituation may be worsened by the advice, which will be issued in November, for Norway lobster. If, as expected, that advice allows for a Norway lobster TAC increase,\r\nthere will be more fishing for this stock and a risk of ever more unwanted\r\ncatches of whitefish stocks. Selectivity measures will therefore become a\r\npressing issue. ICES has not yet been able to identify any change in cod\r\nmortality resulting from the current selectivity measures adopted by the fleets\r\noperating in this area.\nIrish Sea\nThe state of cod and\r\nwhiting stocks in this area remain of concern. Similarly to the situation in\r\nthe West of Scotland, whitefish discard rates are high and current selectivity\r\nmeasures seem insufficient. The stocks of sole and plaice are in a comparable\r\nsituation to that of the Celtic Sea.\nSTECF confirms, and has in some cases develops on, the\r\nadvice provided by ICES.\nMeans used to make the expert advice\r\npublicly available\nAll STECF reports are available on the DG\r\nMARE website. All ICES reports are available on ICES' website.\nImpact assessment\nThe fishing opportunities regulation is not\r\nan instrument that allows the Council to adopt complex packages of measures,\r\nand must limit itself to the scope set by Article 43(3) of the Treaty. It is\r\ntherefore well adapted to a management by results approach. If the policy, as a\r\nwhole, works better, then the annual fishing opportunities will improve. This\r\nincludes, in particular, technical measures, fleet management, structural\r\nsupport, control and enforcement, markets regulation and integration of management\r\ntools into a comprehensive maritime policy. It remains, however, necessary to\r\nuse the fishing opportunities regulation to make adjustments in order to\r\nconserve the resource base for the European harvesting and processing industry,\r\nand prevent or correct negative impacts of a too high fishing mortality on the\r\nmarine environment.\nThe Union has adopted a number of\r\nmulti-annual management plans for stocks of key economic importance, including\r\nhake, cod, flatfish and others. Before their adoption, such plans are subject\r\nto the requirement of an Impact Assessment. Once in force, they determine the\r\nTAC levels that must be fixed for the given year in order to attain their\r\nlong-term objectives. The Commission is bound to make its proposal for TACs in\r\naccordance with these plans as long as they remain valid and in force. As a\r\nresult, many crucial TACs included in the proposal are the result of the\r\nspecific Impact Assessment carried out for the plan they are based upon. \nFor the remainder, and despite the fact\r\nthat multi-annual plans may not be in place, the proposal seeks to avoid\r\nshort-term approaches in favour of long-term sustainability decisions, taking\r\ninto account initiatives from stakeholders and RACs if they have been\r\npositively reviewed by ICES and/or STECF. In many cases, this entails a more\r\ngradual reduction in fishing opportunities. \nThe policy towards MSY that underlies the\r\nCommission\u2019s long-term management approach has been the subject of a detailed\r\nanalysis and impact assessment in the framework of the reform of the CFP, a\r\nprocess which materialised in the tabling of a package of proposals on 13 July\r\n2011 and has now reached the stage where the co-legislators agree on the\r\ndesirability of setting the MSY objective among those that must guide the implementation\r\nof the CFP over the next decade (see section 2, above). The Commission's reform\r\nproposal was duly developed on the basis of an Impact Assessment (SEC(2011)\r\n891) in the context of which the MSY objective was analysed. Its conclusions\r\nidentify this objective as a necessary condition to achieve environmental,\r\neconomic and social sustainability. The co-legislators have accepted the\r\nrationale underlying the Commission's reform proposal and reached political\r\nagreement in June last whereby the MSY target \"\u2026shall be achieved by\r\n2015, where possible, and by 2020 for all stocks at the latest.\" \nAs regards RFMO fishing opportunites and\r\nstocks which are shared with third countries, this proposal essentially\r\ntransposes internationally agreed measures. Any elements relevant to assess\r\npossible impacts of the fishing opportunities are dealt with in the preparation\r\nand conduct phase of international negotiations in the framework of which the Union's fishing opportunities are agreed with third parties.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis of this proposal is Article\r\n43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. \nThe Union's obligations for sustainable\r\nexploitation of living aquatic resources arise from obligations set out in\r\nArticle 2 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.\nSummary of the proposal\nThe\r\nproposal establishes the catch and effort limitations applicable to Union\r\nfisheries in order to achieve the CFP's objective of ensuring fisheries at\r\nlevels that are environmentally, economically and socially sustainable.\nApplication\nThe\r\nprovisions in the area of the proposal are applicable until 31 December 2014,\r\nwith the exception of certain provisions on effort limitations which are\r\napplicable until 31 January 2015, and certain TACs with specific seasonal\r\ncycles (e.g. Capelin in Greenland waters).\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe\r\nproposal falls under the Union exclusive competence as referred to in Article\r\n3(1)(d) of the Treaty. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reason: the CFP is a common policy.\r\nAccording to Article 43(3) of the Treaty it is incumbent upon the Council to\r\nadopt the measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\nThe proposed Council Regulation allocates\r\nfishing opportunities to Member States. Having regard to Article 20(3) of\r\nRegulation 2371/2002, Member States are free to allocate in turn such\r\nopportunities among regions or operators as they see fit. Therefore, Member\r\nStates have ample room for manoeuvre on decisions related to the\r\nsocial/economic model of their choice to exploit their allocated fishing\r\nopportunities.\nThe proposal has no new financial\r\nimplications for Member States. This Regulation is adopted by Council every\r\nyear, and the public and private means to implement it are already in place.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed\r\ninstrument: Regulation. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nSimplification\nThe proposal provides for simplification of\r\nadministrative procedures for public authorities (Union or national), in\r\nparticular as regards requirements regarding the\r\neffort management.\nReview/revision/sunset clause\nThe proposal concerns an annual Regulation\r\nfor the year 2014 and therefore does not include a revision clause.\nDetailed explanation of the proposal\nThis proposal is limited to the fixing and\r\nallocation of fishing opportunities and conditions functionally linked to the\r\nuse of those opportunities. \nFor a number of stocks, such as hake, sole,\r\nplaice and Norway lobster, the fishing opportunities have been established on\r\nthe basis of the rules laid down in the relevant multi-annual plans. For stocks\r\nfor which the industry has proposed a long-term management strategy which has\r\nbeen assessed as effective and precautionary by scientific advisory bodies (e.g.\r\nherring in the Celtic Sea), the proposal follows the harvest control rules laid\r\ndown therein.\nAs regards cod stocks in the Kattegat, the advice for 2014 is the\r\nsame as the advice for 2013, i.e. that on the basis of precautionary considerations\r\nthere should be no directed fisheries of this species in this area, and bycatch\r\nand discards should be minimised. This data-limited stock thus falls under\r\nArticle 9 of the cod plan[3];\r\nin consequence, a TAC reduction of 20% is proposed. The same provision is\r\napplicable to cod in the Irish Sea, so here a 20% reduction is also proposed.\r\nAs regards cod in the West of Scotland, advice on the basis of the MSY approach\r\nrecommends avoiding directed fisheries and minimising bycatch and discards in\r\n2014; in consequence, as in 2013, the Commission proposes a 0 TAC with a 1,5%\r\nlanding allowance. The predicament of cod in the West of Scotland is extremely\r\nserious: There has been no real reduction in fishing effort in this area, based\r\non alternative measures to avoid cod and reduce cod discards which, in\r\npractice, are not proving effective in light of recurrent high discard\r\nestimates (currently at around 71%). The stock is clearly at impaired\r\nreproductive capacity, with low biomass, and low recruitment. In these\r\nconditions, even a zero TAC \u2013 although the only advisable option \u2013 cannot\r\nensure alone the recovery of the stock. It needs to be complemented with\r\nadditional measures to effectively avoid unwanted catches and reduce discards\r\nsignficantly. \nAs for fishing opportunities set in this\r\nregulation in terms of fishing effort, these concern cod stocks, sole in the\r\nWestern Channel and southern hake and Norway lobster. These stocks are\r\nregulated by their respective management plans. In the case of the three cod\r\nstocks mentioned above (Kattegat, Irish Sea, West of Scotland), a real cut in\r\nfishing effort is imperative, also for the reasons mentioned above, and thus\r\neffort reductions are proposed according to Article 12(4)(b) of the plan. In\r\nthe case of southern hake and Norway lobster and of Western Channel sole, the\r\nsystem of management of days at sea per type of vessel having a track record in\r\nthe fishery will continue to apply during 2014, but the proposed regulation\r\nwill continue to allow Member States to apply a system by kilowatt days in\r\norder to make a more efficient use of fishing opportunities and to stimulate\r\nconservation practices in agreement with the fishing sector. In the case of the\r\nWestern channel sole fishery, the proposal aims to streamline the establishment\r\nof effort ceilings (additional days) applicable to each Member State, in a way\r\nthat has already proven efficient as regards the Southern hake and Norway\r\nlobster fishery in the fishing opportunities since 2011. In this way, from 2014\r\nonwards, the actual figure for each Member State will be specified in the\r\nfishing opportunities regulation. This will allow a more transparent process to\r\nre-allocate days at sea recovered from scrapped vessels in this fishery, and\r\nwhich results in specific figures for each Member State. \nThis regulation empowers, for the fourth\r\ntime in the annual fishing opportunities regulatory exercise, relevant Member\r\nStates to adopt certain TACs by themselves, albeit under an obligation to act\r\nin conformity with the objectives of the CFP. \nAlso, as mentioned above, the proposal also\r\nincludes catch limitations agreed in the context of certain RFMOs and arising\r\nfrom negotiations with third countries (shared stocks), most of which remain\r\n\"pro memoria\" for the time being and until conclusion of the relevant\r\ninternational negotiations.\n2013/0366 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nfixing for 2014 the fishing opportunities\r\nfor certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in EU waters and,\r\nfor EU vessels, in certain non-EU waters\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 2371/2002[4]\r\nrequires that measures governing access to waters and resources and the\r\nsustainable pursuit of fishing activities be established taking into account\r\navailable scientific, technical and economic advice and, in particular, reports\r\ndrawn up by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries\r\n(STECF), as well as in the light of any advice received from Regional Advisory\r\nCouncils.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is incumbent upon the\r\nCouncil to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing\r\nopportunities, including certain conditions functionally linked thereto, as\r\nappropriate. Fishing opportunities should be distributed among\r\nMember States in such a way as to assure each Member State relative\r\nstability of fishing activities for each stock or fishery and having due regard\r\nto the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy established in Regulation\r\n(EC) No 2371/2002.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The total allowable catch\r\n(TACs) should be established on the basis of available scientific advice,\r\ntaking into account biological and socio-economic aspects whilst ensuring fair\r\ntreatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions\r\nexpressed during the consultation of stakeholders, in particular at the\r\nmeetings of the Regional Advisory Councils concerned.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For stocks subject to\r\nspecific multiannual plans, the TACs should be established in accordance with\r\nthe rules laid down in those plans. Consequently, the TACs for stocks of\r\nSouthern hake and Norway lobster, of sole in the Western Channel, of plaice and\r\nsole in the North Sea, of herring to the west of Scotland, of cod in the\r\nKattegat, to the west of Scotland, the Irish Sea, the North Sea, Skagerrak\r\nand the Eastern Channel and of bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the\r\nMediterranean should be established in accordance with the rules laid down in:\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2166/2005[5];\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 509/2007[6];\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 676/2007[7];\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1300/2008[8];\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008[9]\r\n(the \"Cod Plan\") and Council Regulation (EC) No 302/2009[10]. With regard, however, to the\r\nstocks of Northern hake (Council Regulation (EC) No 811/2004[11]) and sole in the Bay of Biscay\r\n(Council Regulation (EC) No 388/2006[12]),\r\nthe minimum targets of the relevant recovery and management plans have been\r\nreached and, therefore, it is appropriate to follow scientific advice provided\r\nin order to achieve or maintain the TACs at maximum sustainable yield levels,\r\nas the case may be.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For stocks for which there\r\nis no sufficient or reliable data in order to provide size estimates,\r\nmanagement measures and TAC levels should follow the precautionary approach to\r\nfisheries management as defined in point (i) of Article 3 of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 2371/2002, while taking into account stock-specific factors,\r\nincluding, in particular, available information on stock trends and mixed\r\nfisheries considerations.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\r\nArticle 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96\r\nof 6 May 1996[13],\r\nthe stocks that are subject to the various measures referred to therein should\r\nbe identified.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a TAC relating to a\r\nstock is allocated to one Member State only, it is appropriate to empower\r\nthat Member State in accordance with Article 2(1) of the Treaty to\r\ndetermine the level of such TAC. Provisions should be made to ensure that, when\r\nfixing that TAC level, the Member State concerned acts in a manner fully\r\nconsistent with the principles and rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to\r\nestablish the fishing effort ceilings for 2014 in accordance with\r\nArticle 8 of Regulation (EC) No 2166/2005, Article 9 of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 676/2007, Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 509/2007,\r\nArticles 11 and 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 and Articles\r\n5 and 9 of Regulation No 302/2009, while taking into account Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 754/2009[14].\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the most\r\nrecent scientific advice from ICES and in accordance with the international\r\ncommitments in the context of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Convention\r\n(NEAFC), it is necessary to limit the fishing effort on certain deep-sea\r\nspecies.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For certain species, such\r\nas certain species of sharks, even a limited fishing activity could result in a\r\nserious risk to their conservation. Fishing opportunities for such species\r\nshould therefore be fully restricted through a general prohibition on fishing\r\nthose species.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of fishing\r\nopportunities available to EU vessels set out in this Regulation is subject to\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009[15],\r\nand in particular to Articles 33 and 34 of that Regulation,\r\nconcerning the recording of catches and fishing effort and the notification of\r\ndata on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities. It is therefore necessary to\r\nspecify the codes to be used by Member States when sending data to\r\nthe Commission relating to landings of stocks subject to\r\nthis Regulation.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For certain TACs\r\nMember States should be allowed to grant additional allocations for\r\nvessels participating in trials on fully documented fisheries. The aim of those\r\ntrials is to test a catch\u2011quota system, i.e. a system where all catches\r\nshould be landed and counted against quotas in order to avoid discards and the\r\nwaste of otherwise usable fish resources they entail. Uncontrolled discards of\r\nfish are a threat to the long term sustainability of fish as a public good and\r\nthus to the Common Fisheries Policy objectives. By contrast, catch\u2011quota\r\nsystems inherently present the fishers with an incentive to optimise the catch\r\nselectivity of their operations. In order to achieve a rational management of\r\ndiscards, a fully documented fishery should cover every operation at sea,\r\nrather than what is landed at port. The conditions for Member States to\r\ngrant such additional allocations should therefore include an obligation to\r\nensure the use of close circuit television cameras (CCTV) associated to a\r\nsystem of sensors (jointly referred to as \"CCTV system\"). This should\r\nenable the recording, in detail, of all retained and discarded parts of\r\ncatches. A system based on human observers operating in real time on board\r\nwould be less efficient, more costly, and less reliable. Consequently, the use\r\nof CCTV systems is, at this time, a prerequisite for the achievement of discard\r\nreduction schemes such as fully documented fisheries. In the use of such\r\nsystem, the requirements of Directive 95/46/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[16]\r\nshould be complied with.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\r\ntrials of fully documented fisheries can effectively evaluate the potential of\r\ncatch-quota systems to control the absolute fishing mortality of the stocks\r\nconcerned, it is necessary for all fish caught in those trials, including those\r\nunder minimum landing size, to be counted against the total allocation assigned\r\nto the participating vessel, and for fishing operations to cease when that\r\ntotal allocation has been fully utilised by that vessel. It is also appropriate\r\nto allow transfers of allocations between vessels participating in the fully documented\r\nfisheries trials and non-participating vessels provided that it can be\r\ndemonstrated that discards by non-participating vessels do not increase.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate,\r\nfollowing advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea\r\n(ICES), to maintain and revise a system to manage sandeel in EU waters of ICES\r\ndivisions IIa and IIIa and ICES subarea IV.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [To be completed after\r\nconsultations with Norway]\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [To be completed after the\r\nannual meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic\r\nTunas (ICCAT)].\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to the Accession\r\nof the Republic of Croatia to the European Union in July 2013, provisions on\r\nfishing opportunities for Croatia are included in this Regulation. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [To be completed after the annual\r\nmeeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living\r\nResources (CCAMLR)].\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its\r\nAnnual Meeting in 2013, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) adopted a\r\nResolution aiming at the protection of oceanic whitetip sharks and applicable\r\nto fishing vessels on the IOTC Record of Authorised\r\nVessels by prohibiting, as an interim pilot measure, to retain on board, tranship, land or store any part or whole carcass\r\nof oceanic whitetip shark. The resolution provides for an\r\nexception for artisanal fisheries, namely fishing vessels engaged in fishing\r\noperations within the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of the Member State whose flag they fly.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [To be completed after the\r\nannual meeting of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation\r\n(SPRFMO)].\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its 84th Annual Meeting\r\nin 2013, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) maintained its\r\nconservation measures for yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna and skipjack tuna. IATTC\r\nalso maintained its resolution on the conservation of oceanic whitetip sharks.\r\nThose measures should continue to be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [To be completed after the\r\nannual meeting of the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (SEAFO)].\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [To be completed after the\r\nannual meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission\r\n(WCPFC)].\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [To be completed after\r\nmeasures are adopted in the context of the Convention on the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Pollock resources in the central Bering Sea].\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its 35th Annual Meeting\r\nin 2013, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) adopted a number\r\nof fishing opportunities for 2014 of certain stocks in Subareas 1-4 of the NAFO\r\nConvention Area. In that context, NAFO adopted a procedure for increase of the\r\nTAC for white hake in NAFO Subdivision 3NO fixed for 2014, if certain\r\nconditions related to the situation of this stock are met. A Contracting Party\r\nto NAFO may notify to the Executive Secretary of NAFO that higher than normal\r\ncatches per unit of effort have been observed for the stock of white hake in\r\nNAFO Subdivision 3NO. If the in-year 2014 TAC increase is confirmed by a\r\npositive vote within NAFO, it should be implemented into the law of the Union and the quotas of the member States concerned should be increased.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain international\r\nmeasures which create or restrict fishing opportunities for the Union are adopted by the relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) at\r\nthe end of the year and become applicable before the entry into force of this\r\nRegulation. It is therefore necessary for the provisions that implement such\r\nmeasures in the law of the Union to apply retroactively. In particular, since\r\nthe fishing season in CCAMLR\r\n(Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources)\r\nConvention Area runs from 1 December to 30 November,\r\nand thus certain fishing opportunities or prohibitions in the CCAMLR Convention\r\nArea are laid down for a period of time starting from 1 December 2013, it is\r\nappropriate that the relevant provisions of this Regulation apply from that\r\ndate. Such retroactive application will be without prejudice to the principle\r\nof legitimate expectations as CCAMLR members are forbidden to fish in the\r\nCCAMLR Convention Area without authorisation.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\ndeclaration by the Union to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\r\n(\"Venezuela\") on the granting of fishing opportunities in EU waters\r\nto fishing vessels flying the flag of Venezuela in the EZZ off the coast of\r\nFrench Guyana[17],\r\nit is necessary to fix the fishing opportunities for snappers available to\r\nVenezuela in EU waters.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation concerning the granting to an individual Member State an authorisation to benefit from the system of managing its fishing effort\r\nallocations in accordance with a kilowatt/days system, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission relating to granting of additional days\r\nat sea for permanent cessation of fishing activities and for enhanced\r\nscientific observer coverage as well as to establishing the formats of\r\nspreadsheet for the collection and transmission of information concerning\r\ntransfer of days at sea between fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member\r\nState. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation\r\n(EU) No 182/2011[18].\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid the\r\ninterruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihood of the\r\nfishermen of the Union, this Regulation should apply\r\nfrom 1 January 2014, except for the provisions concerning\r\nfishing effort limits, which should apply from 1 February 2014,\r\nand certain provisions in particular regions, which should have a specific date\r\nof application.
