When an index is used as a reference price for a financial\r\ninstrument or contract it becomes a benchmark. A wide variety of benchmarks are\r\ncurrently produced using different methodologies by different providers,\r\nranging from public entities to independent dedicated benchmark providers. \nThe settlements reached by several\r\ncompetent authorities with a number of banks concerning the manipulation of the\r\nLIBOR and EURIBOR interest rate benchmarks have highlighted the importance of\r\nbenchmarks and their vulnerabilities. Allegations of attempted manipulation of\r\ncommodity price assessments provided by commodity price reporting agencies\r\n(PRAs) are also under investigation by the competent authorities and IOSCO has\r\ncarried out a review of oil price assessments by PRAs. The integrity of\r\nbenchmarks is critical to the pricing of many financial instruments, such as\r\ninterest rate swaps, and commercial and non-commercial contracts, such as\r\nmortgages. If a benchmark is manipulated this will cause significant losses to\r\nsome of the investors that own financial instruments whose value is determined\r\nby reference to the benchmark. By sending out deceptive signals about the state\r\nof an underlying market it may distort the real economy. More generally\r\nconcerns about the risk of benchmark manipulation undermine market confidence. Benchmarks\r\nare susceptible to manipulation where conflicts of interest and discretion\r\nexists in the benchmark process and these are not subject to adequate\r\ngovernance and controls.\nThe first part of the Commission\u2019s response\r\nto the alleged manipulation of LIBOR and EURIBOR was to amend the existing\r\nproposals for a market abuse Regulation (MAR) and criminal sanctions for market\r\nabuse Directive (CSMAD) to clarify that any manipulation of benchmarks is\r\nclearly and unequivocally illegal and subject to administrative or criminal\r\nsanctions.\nHowever, changing the sanctioning regime\r\nalone will not improve the way in which benchmarks are produced and used;\r\nsanctioning does not remove the risks of manipulation arising from the inadequate\r\ngovernance of the benchmark process where conflicts of interest and discretion\r\nexist. Secondly, in order to protect investors and consumers, it is necessary\r\nthat benchmarks are robust, reliable and fit for purpose. In the light of these\r\nconsiderations, this proposal for a regulation has four main objectives that\r\naim to improve the framework under which benchmarks are provided, contributed\r\nto and used:\n\u2013                        \r\nto improve the governance and controls over the\r\nbenchmark process and in particular ensure that administrators avoid conflicts\r\nof interest, or at least manage them adequately;\n\u2013                   \r\nto improve the quality of the input data and methodologies\r\nused by benchmark administrators and in particular ensure that sufficient and\r\naccurate data is used in the determination of benchmarks;\n\u2013                   \r\nto ensure that contributors to benchmarks are\r\nsubject to adequate controls, in particular to avoid conflicts of interest and\r\nthat their contributions to benchmarks are subject to adequate controls. Where\r\nnecessary the relevant competent authority should have the power to mandate\r\ncontributors to continue to contribute to benchmarks; and\n\u2013                   \r\nto ensure adequate protection for consumers and\r\ninvestors using benchmarks by enhancing transparency, ensuring adequate rights\r\nof redress and ensuring suitability is assessed where necessary.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing provisions in the\r\narea of the proposal\nUnion law currently addresses certain aspects\r\nof the use of benchmarks:\n\u2013                   \r\nThe proposals for a Market Abuse Regulation\r\n(MAR)[1]\r\nin Articles 2(3)(d) and 8(1)(d) and for a Criminal Sanctions for Market Abuse Directive\r\n(CSMAD)[2]\r\n(MAR has been the subject of a political agreement by the European Parliament\r\nand the Council in June 2013) clarify that any manipulation of benchmarks is\r\nclearly and unequivocally illegal and subject to administrative or criminal\r\nsanctions.\n\u2013                   \r\nThe Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and\r\nTransparency (REMIT)[3]\r\nprovides that the manipulation of benchmarks that are used for wholesale energy\r\nproducts is illegal.\n\u2013                   \r\nThe Markets in Financial Instruments Directive[4] requires that any financial\r\ninstruments admitted to trading in a regulated market are capable of being\r\ntraded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner. The Implementing Regulation[5] of that Directive further\r\nspecifies that the price or other value measure of the underlying must be reliable\r\nand publicly available.\n\u2013                   \r\nArticle 30 of the European Commission Proposal on\r\nthe Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR)[6] (which is currently being\r\nnegotiated by the European Parliament and the Council) contains a provision\r\nrequiring the non-exclusive licencing of benchmarks for clearing and trading\r\npurposes. \n\u2013                   \r\nThe Prospectus Directive and Implementing\r\nRegulation[7]\r\nprovide that where a prospectus contains a reference to an index, the issuer\r\nshould set out the type of the underlying and details of where information on\r\nthe underlying can be obtained, an indication of where information about the\r\npast and the further performance of the underlying and its volatility can be\r\nobtained, and the name of the index. If the index in question is composed by\r\nthe issuer, the issuer also needs to include a description of the index. If the\r\nindex is not composed by the issuer, the issuer needs to clarify where\r\ninformation about the index can be obtained, and where the underlying is an interest\r\nrate the issuer needs to provide a description of the interest rate.\n\u2013                   \r\nThe Undertakings for Collective Investment in\r\nTransferable Securities Directive[8]\r\nprovides that UCITS funds may only hold a maximum share of instruments issued\r\nby the same body in their portfolio. Member States may raise the limits that\r\napply to how much of its total portfolio a UCITS may hold to a maximum of 20%\r\nfor investment in shares or debt securities issued by the same body when it\r\nconcerns an index which the UCITS wants to replicate, provided the composition\r\nof the index is sufficiently diversified, the index represents an adequate\r\nbenchmark for the market to which it refers and it is published in an\r\nappropriate manner. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultations\nA three month public consultation was\r\nlaunched on 3 September and closed on 29 November 2012. 84 contributions were\r\nreceived from contributors, benchmark providers and users including exchanges,\r\nbanks, investors, consumer groups, trade bodies and public bodies. Stakeholders\r\nacknowledged the weaknesses in the production and use of benchmarks, and\r\nbroadly supported action at EU level. Respondents also emphasised the need for\r\ninternational coordination, and careful calibration of the scope of any\r\ninitiative. \nESMA and the EBA jointly investigated\r\nshortcomings in the provision of EURIBOR by the EBF-EURIBOR and on 11 January\r\n2013 launched a consultation on the Principles for Benchmarks-Setting Processes\r\nin the EU[9].\r\nIn a letter dated 7 March 2013 the EBA, ESMA and EIOPA provided advice on the\r\ncontent of this proposed legislation in light of this work. The Commission\r\nservices participated in an ESMA-EBA open hearing on 13 February 2013[10] on these Principles for\r\nBenchmarks-Setting Processes. The Commission services also participated in the\r\npublic hearing on tackling the culture of market manipulation - global action\r\npost LIBOR/EURIBOR held by the European Parliament on 29 September 2012.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact Assessment\nIn line with its \"Better\r\nRegulation\" policy, the Commission conducted an impact assessment of\r\npolicy alternatives. The policy options encompassed options to limit incentives\r\nfor manipulation, minimise discretion and ensure benchmarks are based on\r\nsufficient, reliable and representative data, ensure internal governance and\r\ncontrols address risks, ensure effective supervision of benchmarks and enhance\r\ntransparency and investor protection. Each policy option was assessed against\r\nthe following criteria: impact on stakeholders, effectiveness and efficiency.\nThe following fundamental rights of the\r\nCharter of Fundamental Rights are of particular relevance: respect for private\r\nand family life, protection of personal data, freedom of expression and\r\ninformation.\nLimitations on these rights and freedoms\r\nare allowed under Article 52 of the Charter. The objectives as defined above\r\nare consistent with the EU's obligations to respect fundamental rights.\r\nHowever, any limitation on the exercise of these rights and freedoms must be\r\nprovided for by law and respect the essence of these rights and freedoms.\r\nSubject to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if\r\nthey are necessary and genuinely meet the objectives of general interest\r\nrecognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of\r\nothers. In the case of benchmarks, the general interest objective which\r\njustifies certain limitations of fundamental rights is the objective of\r\nensuring market integrity. The need to protect the right to property (Article 17\r\nof the Charter) also justifies certain limitations of fundamental rights, as\r\ninvestors are entitled to see the value of their property (e.g. loans,\r\nderivatives) protected from losses caused by market distortions.\nThe right to freedom of expression and\r\ninformation requires that the freedom of the media shall be respected. This\r\nRegulation should be interpreted and applied in accordance with this\r\nfundamental right. Therefore where a person merely publishes or refers to a\r\nbenchmark as part of his or her journalistic activities but does not have\r\ncontrol over the provision of that benchmark, that person should not be subject\r\nto the requirements imposed on administrators by this Regulation. This\r\ntherefore leaves journalists free when performing journalistic activities to\r\nreport on financial and commodities markets. Accordingly the definition of the\r\nadministrator of a benchmark has been tightly defined to ensure that it\r\nencompasses the provision of a benchmark but does not capture within its scope\r\njournalistic activities.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\u201cTFEU\u201d).\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality\nThe Commission proposal to regulate\r\nbenchmarks is in line with the principle of subsidiarity as laid down in Article\r\n5(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), which requires the Union to take\r\naction only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be\r\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the\r\nscale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Union. \nWhile many benchmarks are national, the\r\nbenchmark industry as a whole is international in both production and use.\r\nWhile action at national level in relation to national indices may help ensure\r\nthat any intervention is appropriately tailored to the problems at a national\r\nlevel, this may lead to a patchwork of divergent rules, could create an\r\nun-level playing field within the single market and result in an inconsistent\r\nand un-coordinated approach. Benchmarks are used to price a wide variety of\r\ncross border transactions, in particular in the interbank funding market and\r\nderivatives. A patchwork of national rules would impede the opportunity to\r\nproduce cross border benchmarks and therefore impede these cross border\r\ntransactions. This problem has been recognised by the G20 and FSB which charged\r\nIOSCO with producing a global set of principles to apply to financial\r\nbenchmarks. An EU initiative will help enhance the single market by creating a\r\ncommon framework for reliable and correctly used benchmarks across different\r\nMember States. \nWhile in most Member States there is\r\ncurrently no regulation at national level on the production of benchmarks, two\r\nMember States have already adopted national legislation on interest rate\r\nbenchmarks in their national currencies. Moreover, IOSCO has recently agreed\r\nprinciples on benchmarks which are to be implemented by its members. However\r\nthese principles provide flexibility as to the scope and means of their\r\nimplementation and in relation to certain terms. In the absence of a harmonised\r\nEuropean framework for benchmarks, some Member States are likely to adopt\r\nlegislation at national level which would be divergent. For example, at this\r\npoint of time, the scope of the legislation of one Member State would appear as\r\nwide as IOSCO\u2019s while the legislation of the other Member State that has\r\nintroduced rules regarding benchmarks only covers interest rate benchmarks. These\r\ndivergent approaches would result in fragmentation of the internal market,\r\nsince administrators and users of benchmarks would be subject to different\r\nrules in different Member States. In the absence of a Union legislative\r\nframework, the individual national actions would also be ineffective, as there\r\nis no obligation or incentive on Member States to cooperate with each other and\r\nthe absence of such cooperation leaves scope for regulatory arbitrage.\nCertain aspects of investor protection in\r\nthis field are generally covered by MiFID. In particular, there is the\r\nrequirement under MiFID for firms to carry out an assessment of\r\nappropriateness. This test shall determine whether the client has the necessary\r\nexperience and knowledge in order to understand the risks involved in relation\r\nto the product or investment service offered or demanded. Thus, it provides a\r\nsufficient level of investor protection.\nConcerning consumer protection, the\r\nConsumer Credit Directive includes rules on the disclosure of adequate\r\ninformation, as well as the soon to be adopted Mortgage Credit Directive which\r\nalso includes the requirement to recommend suitable credit agreements. However,\r\nthose EU consumer protection rules do not address the particular issue of the\r\nsuitability of benchmarks in financial contracts. Furthermore, unequal\r\nbargaining power and the use of standard terms means that consumers may have a\r\nlimited choice about the benchmark used. Consumers lack the necessary knowledge\r\nor experience to appropriately assess benchmark suitability. Therefore this\r\nproposal should complement the existing EU legislation in this area by ensuring\r\nthat the responsibility for assessing the suitability of benchmarks for retail\r\ncontracts rests with the lenders or creditors. This will also ensure harmonised\r\nEU consumer protection rules on the use of benchmarks to reference financial\r\ncontracts. A common regulatory framework for consumers and creditors in\r\nrelation to financial contracts is also required to enable the use of cross\r\nborder benchmarks rather than a fragmented national approach. As a result of\r\nconsumer complaints and litigation relating to the use of unsuitable benchmarks\r\nin several Member States, it is likely that divergent measures on consumer\r\nprotection would be adopted at national level. This could result in\r\nfragmentation of the internal market. \nThe proposed Regulation is also\r\nproportionate, as required by Article 5(4) of TEU. It targets only those indices\r\nthat are used to reference financial instruments, or financial contracts such\r\nas mortgages, because these are the benchmark that may have a direct and\r\ncertain economic impact if they are manipulated. In addition, the proposed Regulation\r\ncontains provisions to tailor its requirements to different sectors and the\r\ndifferent types of benchmark such as commodity, interbank interest rate and\r\nbenchmarks that use exchange data. A proportionate approach is ensured since\r\nthe vast majority of obligations are imposed on the administrator of the\r\nbenchmark. Many administrators of benchmarks already comply with at least some\r\nof these requirements, implying that the administrative burden should not\r\nincrease disporportionately. Moreover, processes for internal governance and\r\ncontrol are only required from supervised contributors, meaning that the impact\r\non non supervised contributors to a benchmark, for example a nonregistered\r\ntrader, will not be substantial. Finally, in all important parts, this\r\nRegulation is aligned with the internationally agreed IOSCO Principles for\r\nfinancial benchmarks published on 17 July 2013, which has been extensively\r\nconsulted with stakeholders. This will limit adaptation costs.\nAgainst this background, EU action is\r\nappropriate in terms of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instrument\nA Regulation is considered to be the most\r\nappropriate legal instrument to introduce uniform rules concerning the\r\nprovision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to those benchmarks,\r\nand the use of benchmarks in the Union. The provisions of this proposal are\r\nlaying down certain requirements for administrators, contributors and users of\r\nbenchmarks. The cross border nature of many benchmarks creates a need for\r\nmaximum harmonisation of these requirements. Since the regulation of benchmarks\r\ninvolves measures specifying precise requirements that relate to data and\r\nmethodologies, even small divergences in the approach taken could lead to\r\nsignificant impediments in the cross border provision of benchmarks. The use of\r\na Regulation, which is directly applicable without requiring national legislation,\r\nwill restrict the possibility of divergent measures being taken by competent\r\nauthorities at national level, and will ensure a consistent approach and\r\ngreater legal certainty throughout the EU. \n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed explanation of\r\nthe proposal\n3.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scope (Article 2)\nThe proposed Regulation applies to all\r\npublished benchmarks that are used to reference a financial instrument traded or\r\nadmitted to trading on a regulated venue, or a financial contract (such as\r\nmortgages) and benchmarks that measure the performance of an investment fund. \nWhere there is discretion in the benchmark\r\nprocess which is subject to a conflict of interest, there is a risk of\r\nmanipulation in the absence of adequate governance and controls. Therefore\r\nindices which involve discretion should be subject to regulatory measures.\r\nWhile the degree of discretion varies, all indices involve some discretion.\r\nTherefore, the scope should include all benchmarks, regardless of the method of\r\ncalculation or the nature of the contributions.\nThe scope should include all indices,\r\nincluding published indices, since any doubts about the accuracy and\r\nreliability of such indices are likely to inflict more damage on a wider\r\npopulation than indices which are not public. \nWhere benchmarks are used as a reference price\r\nfor a financial instrument or contract, any manipulation causes economic loss.\r\nIn the case where the contributor also uses the financial instrument that\r\nreferences it, an inherent conflict of interest exists and there is an\r\nincentive to manipulate. Furthermore, were benchmarks are used to measure the\r\nperformance of financial instruments, they may be subject to conflicts of\r\ninterests and their manipulation will lead to suboptimal investment choices by\r\ninvestors. Therefore, it is important to target all benchmarks that price a\r\nfinancial instrument or consumer contract or that measure the performance of\r\ninvestment funds.\nFor widely used benchmarks, even a minor\r\nmanipulation may have a significant impact but the vulnerability and importance\r\nof a benchmark varies over time. Restricting the scope by reference to\r\nimportant or vulnerable indices would not address the risks that any benchmark\r\nmay pose in the future. \nGiven all these considerations and in order\r\nto ensure a clear and comprehensive application of the Regulation, the scope is\r\nalso not dependent on the nature of the input data i.e. whether the input data\r\nis an economic (e.g. a share price) or non-economic (e.g. a weather parameter)\r\nnumber or value. This is because the critical element when determining the\r\nscope is how the output value determines the value of a financial instrument,\r\nfinancial contract or measures the performance of an investment fund. In this\r\ncontext, once a value is used to reference a financial contract or instrument,\r\nits previous non-economic nature becomes irrelevant. \nAs regards the administrators of benchmarks,\r\nall administrators are potentially subject to conflicts of interest, exercise\r\ndiscretion and may have inadequate governance and control systems in place. Thus,\r\nthey need to be subject to appropriate regulation. Moreover, as they control\r\nthe benchmark process, an authorisation requirement is imposed on all benchmark\r\nadministrators as supervision is the most effective way to ensure the integrity\r\nof benchmarks. \nConcerning contributors to benchmarks,\r\nthese are also potentially subject to conflicts of interest, exercise\r\ndiscretion and so may be the source of manipulation. Contributing to a\r\nbenchmark is a voluntary activity. If any initiative requires contributors to\r\nsignificantly change their business models, they may cease to contribute to the\r\nbenchmark concerned. However, for entities already subject to regulation and\r\nsupervision, (so-called supervised contributors), requiring good governance and\r\ncontrol systems is not expected to lead to substantial costs or\r\ndisproportionate administrative burden. It is therefore appropriate to include\r\nall supervised contributors within the scope of this Regulation. \nFor contributors not subject to regulation\r\nand supervision (non-supervised contributors), authorisation or otherwise\r\nbecoming subject to rules could impose significant costs and administrative\r\nburden. Regulators would also be ineffective supervising firms for which they\r\nhave no expertise. Imposing supervision on currently non-supervised entities\r\nand persons would therefore impose significant costs and provide minimal\r\nbenefits. Nonetheless, certain parts of this Regulation, as for example the\r\nneed to provide accurate and reliable input data are indirectly relevant for\r\nall contributors since they remain subject to the Market Abuse Regulation and\r\nwill be contractually bound to comply with the requirement of the\r\nadministrator\u2019s code of conduct under this Regulation.\nThe proposal exempts from its scope central\r\nbanks that are members of the European System of Central Banks.\nFinally, in some cases a person may produce\r\nan index but not be aware that this index is a benchmark because, for example,\r\nit is used as a reference to a financial instrument without the knowledge of\r\nthe producer. The regulation therefore provides a mechanism to notify the\r\nproducers that their index has or may become a benchmark and give them the\r\npower to refuse that it be used as a benchmark. If the producer consents, he\r\nwill become subject to the proposed Regulation in respect of that benchmark. If\r\nhe refuses, the index may not be used as a benchmark and the administrator\r\nrequirements in this Regulation will not apply.\n3.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Governance and Control of\r\nAdministrators (Article 5-6)\nThe proposal ensures that conflicts of\r\ninterest are avoided and ensures that governance and controls are effective. These\r\nare addressed by requirements on governance and controls, with more detailed\r\nrequirements included in the annex.\n3.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Input Data and Methodology\r\n(Articles 7)\nThe proposal sets out three requirements, detailed\r\nin the annex, in respect of the input data and methodology used to produce a\r\nbenchmark to reduce discretion and enhance integrity and reliability: \n\u2013                   \r\nthe input data should be sufficient and accurate\r\nso that it represent the actual market or economic reality that the benchmark\r\nis intended to measure; \n\u2013                   \r\nthe input data should be obtained from a\r\nreliable and representative panel or sample of contributors; and\n\u2013                   \r\nthe administrator should use robust and reliable\r\nmethodology for determining the benchmark.\n3.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contributor Requirements (Articles\r\n9 and 11)\nThe administrator is required to draw up a\r\ncontributor code of conduct which clearly specifies the obligations and\r\nresponsibilities of the contributors when they provide input data for the\r\ndetermination of the benchmark. Where the contributors are already regulated\r\nentities they are also required to avoid conflicts of interest and implement\r\nadequate controls.\n3.4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sectoral Requirements (Article\r\n10 and 12-14)\nIn order to ensure proportionality and\r\nensure that the proposal is adequately tailored to different benchmark types\r\nand sectors, annexes II and III contain more detailed provisions on commodity\r\nbenchmarks and interest rate benchmarks. Additional requirements are imposed on\r\ncritical benchmarks, including the power for the relevant competent authority\r\nto mandate contributions. Benchmarks whose input data is provided by regulated\r\nvenues are also released from certain obligations to avoid dual regulation.\n3.4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transparency and Consumer Protection\r\n(Articles 15-18)\nInvestor protection is enhanced through\r\ntransparency provisions. Administrators are required to provide a statement\r\nsetting out what the benchmark measures, its vulnerabilities, along with the\r\npublication of underlying data to allow users to choose the most appropriate\r\nand suitable benchmark. This statement also provides notice that the users\r\nshould make adequate provision in the event that the administrator ceases to\r\nprovide the benchmark. Finally a suitability assessment is imposed on banks in\r\ntheir dealings with consumers in financial contracts such as loans secured by\r\nmortgages.\n3.4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Supervision and\r\nAuthorisation Procedure for Administrators (Articles 22 -37)\nThe activity of the provision of benchmarks\r\nwill be subject to prior authorisation and on-going supervision. The proposal\r\nlays down the conditions and the procedure for administrators of benchmarks\r\nlocated in the Union to obtain authorisation from the relevant competent\r\nauthority. The proposal creates a mechanism to ensure effective enforcement of\r\nthe Regulation. It gives competent authorities the necessary powers to ensure\r\nthat administrators comply with the Regulation. \nFor critical benchmarks colleges of\r\nsupervisors should be formed to enhance the exchange of information and ensure\r\nuniform authorisation and supervision. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has implications for the\r\nCommunity budget.\nThe specific budget implications of the\r\nproposal relate to task allocated to ESMA, as specified in the legislative\r\nfinancial statements accompanying this proposal. The new tasks will be carried\r\nout with the human resources available within the annual budgetary allocation\r\nprocedure, in the light of budgetary constraints which are applicable to all EU\r\nbodies and in line with the financial programming for agencies. \nNotably, the resources needed by the agency\r\nfor the new tasks will be consistent and compatible with the human and\r\nfinancing programming for ESMA set by the recent Communication to the European\r\nParliament and the Council \u2013 Programming of human and financial resources for\r\ndecentralised agencies 2014-2020' (COM(2013)519).\nSpecific budgetary implications for the\r\nCommission are also assessed in the financial statement accompanying this\r\nproposal.In summary, the main budgetary implications of the proposal are:\na) DG MARKT staff: 1 AD staff member\r\n(full-time) for drafting delegated acts, as well as for the evaluation,\r\nmonitoring of the implementation and potential review of the initiative. The\r\ntotal estimated costs are \u20ac 0.141 M yearly.\nb) ESMA: \n(i) Staff costs: two\r\ntemporary agents for participating and mediating in the colleges of supervisors\r\nfor critical benchmarks, providing technical advice to the Commission on the\r\nimplementation of this Regulation, coordinating the development of cooperation\r\narrangements with third countries, drafting guidelines to promote convergence\r\nand cross-sector consistency of penalty regimes and maintaining registers of\r\nnotifications on the use of benchmarks and a list of registered benchmark administrators.\nThe total yearly costs of these 2 temporary\r\nagents would be of \u20ac0.326 M, towards which the Commission would contribute 40%\r\n(\u20ac 0.130 M) and Member States 60% (\u20ac 0.196 M) yearly.\n(ii) Operational and infrastructure costs:\r\nan initial expense of \u20ac 0.25 M is also estimated for ESMA, towards which the Commission would contribute 40% (\u20ac 0.1 M) and\r\nMember States 60% (\u20ac 0.15 M) in 2015. This expense relates mainly to IT systems\r\nfor ESMA to fulfil the requirements of:\n- Maintaining a list of administrators\r\nregistered in accordance with this Regulation and third country firms providing\r\nbenchmarks in the Union. \n- Receiving notifications of the use of a\r\nbenchmark in a financial instrument or financial contract within the Union, and\r\nmaintaining a register and ensuring that administrators are aware of this use.\nESMA will also need to produce a report on\r\nthe application of this Regulation by 1 January 2018 with a total cost of \u20ac 0.3\r\nM towards which the Commission would contribute 40% (\u20ac 0.12 M) and Member\r\nStates 60% (\u20ac 0.18 M) in 2017.\n2013/0314 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non indices used as benchmarks in financial\r\ninstruments and financial contracts \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[11],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Central Bank, \nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The pricing of many\r\nfinancial instruments and financial contracts depends on the accuracy and\r\nintegrity of benchmarks. Cases of manipulation of interest rate benchmarks such\r\nas LIBOR and EURIBOR, as well as allegations that energy, oil and foreign\r\nexchange benchmarks have been manipulated, have demonstrated that benchmarks whose\r\nsetting processes share certain characteristics, such as being subject to conflicts\r\nof interest, the use of discretion and weak governance, may be vulnerable to\r\nmanipulation. Failures in, or doubts about, the accuracy and integrity of indices\r\nused as benchmarks may undermine market confidence, cause losses to consumers\r\nand investors and distort the real economy. It is therefore necessary to ensure\r\nthe accuracy, robustness and integrity of benchmarks and the benchmark setting\r\nprocess.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2004/39/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in\r\nfinancial instruments[12]\r\ncontains certain requirements with respect to the reliability of benchmarks\r\nused to price a listed financial instrument. Directive 2003/71/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 on the prospectus to\r\nbe published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading[13] contains certain requirements\r\non benchmarks used by issuers. Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and\r\nadministrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in\r\ntransferable securities (UCITS)[14]\r\ncontains certain requirements on the use of benchmarks by UCITS investment\r\nfunds. Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil of 25 October 2011 on wholesale energy market integrity[15] contains certain provisions\r\nwhich prohibit the manipulation of benchmarks that are used for wholesale\r\nenergy products. However these legislative acts only cover certain aspects of certain\r\nbenchmarks and do not address all the vulnerabilities in the process of\r\nproducing all benchmarks.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Benchmarks are vital in\r\npricing cross-border transactions and thereby facilitating the effective\r\nfunctioning of the internal market in a wide variety of financial instruments\r\nand services. Many benchmarks used as reference rates in financial contracts,\r\nin particular mortgages, are produced in one Member State but used by credit\r\ninstitutions and consumers in other Member States. In addition, these credit\r\ninstitutions often hedge their risks or obtain the funding for granting these\r\nfinancial contracts in the cross border interbank market. Only two Member\r\nStates have adopted national legislation on benchmarks, but their respective\r\nlegal frameworks on benchmarks already show divergences regarding aspects such\r\nas the scope of application. In addition, the International Organisation\r\nSecurities Commissions (IOSCO) has recently agreed principles on benchmarks\r\nand, since these principles provide a certain flexibility as to their exact\r\nscope and means of their implementation and in relation to certain terms,\r\nMember States are likely to adopt legislation at national level which would\r\nimplement such principles divergently.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These divergent approaches\r\nwould result in fragmentation of the internal market since administrators and\r\nusers of benchmarks would be subject to different rules in different Member\r\nStates and benchmarks produced in a Member State could be prevented from being\r\nused in other Member States. In the absence of a harmonised framework to ensure\r\nthe accuracy and integrity of benchmarks used in financial instruments and\r\nfinancial contracts in the Union it is therefore likely that differences in\r\nMember States legislation will create obstacles to the smooth functioning of\r\nthe internal market for the provision of benchmarks.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EU consumer protection\r\nrules do not cover the particular issue of the suitability of benchmarks in\r\nfinancial contracts. As a result of consumer complaints and litigation relating\r\nto the use of unsuitable benchmarks in several Member States, it is likely that\r\ndivergent measures, inspired by legitimate concerns of\u00a0 consumer protection,\r\nwould be adopted at national level, which could result in fragmentation of the\r\ninternal market due to the divergent conditions of competition attached to\r\ndifferent levels of consumer protection. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore to ensure the\r\nproper functioning of the internal market and improve the conditions of its\r\nfunctioning, in particular with regard to financial markets, and to ensure a\r\nhigh level of consumer and investor protection, it is therefore appropriate to\r\nlay down a regulatory framework for benchmarks at Union level.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate and\r\nnecessary for those rules to take the legislative form of a Regulation in order\r\nto ensure that provisions directly imposing obligations on persons involved in benchmark\r\nproduction, contribution and use are applied in a uniform manner throughout the\r\nUnion. Since a legal framework for the provision of benchmarks necessarily\r\ninvolves measures specifying precise requirements on all different aspects\r\ninherent to the provision of benchmarks, even small divergences on the approach\r\ntaken regarding one of these aspects could lead to significant impediments in\r\nthe cross border provision of benchmarks. Therefore, the use of a Regulation,\r\nwhich is directly applicable without requiring national legislation, should\r\nreduce the possibility of divergent measures being taken at national level, and\r\nshould ensure a consistent approach, greater legal certainty and prevent the\r\nappearance of significant impediments in the cross-border provision of\r\nbenchmarks.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scope of this\r\nRegulation should be as broad as necessary to create a preventive regulatory\r\nframework. The production of benchmarks involves discretion in their determination\r\nand is inherently subject to certain types of conflicts of interest, which\r\nimplies the existence of opportunities and incentives to manipulate those\r\nbenchmarks. These risk factors are common to all benchmarks, and all of them\r\nshould be made subject to adequate governance and control requirements. Since the\r\nvulnerability and importance of a benchmark varies over time, restricting the\r\nscope by reference to currently important or vulnerable indices would not\r\naddress the risks that any benchmark may pose in the future. In particular,\r\nbenchmarks that are currently not widely used may be so used in the future, so\r\nthat, in their regard, even a minor manipulation may have significant impact. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The critical determinant\r\nof the scope of this Regulation should be whether the output value of the\r\nbenchmark determines the value of a financial instrument, financial contract or\r\nmeasures the performance of an investment fund. Therefore the scope should not\r\nbe dependent on the nature of the input data. Benchmarks calculated from\r\neconomic input data, such as share prices and non-economic number or values\r\nsuch as weather parameters should thus be included. The framework should cover\r\nthose benchmarks subject to these risks, but should also provide for a\r\nproportionate response to the risks that different benchmarks pose. This\r\nRegulation should therefore cover all benchmarks which are used to price\r\nfinancial instruments listed or traded on regulated venues. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A large number of consumers\r\nare parties to financial contracts, in particular consumer credit agreements\r\nsecured by mortgages, that reference benchmarks that are subject to the same\r\nrisks. This Regulation should therefore cover the indices or reference rates\r\nreferred to in [Directive 2013/\u2026/EU of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil of on credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable\r\nproperty and amending Directive 2008/48/EC.] \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many investment indices\r\ninvolve significant conflicts of interest and are used to measure the\r\nperformance of a fund such as a UCITS fund. Some of these benchmarks are\r\npublished and others are made available, for free or on payment of a fee, to\r\nthe public or a section of the public and their manipulation may adversely\r\naffect investors. This Regulation should therefore cover indices or reference\r\nrates that are used to measure the performance of an investment fund. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All benchmark\r\nadministrators are potentially subject to conflicts of interest, exercise\r\ndiscretion and may have inadequate governance and control systems in place.\r\nFurther, as administrators control the benchmark process, requiring authorisation\r\nand supervision of administrators is the most effective way of ensuring the\r\nintegrity of benchmarks.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contributors are subject to\r\npotential conflicts of interest, exercise discretion and so may be the source\r\nof manipulation. Contributing to a benchmark is a voluntary activity. If any\r\ninitiative requires contributors to significantly change their business models,\r\nthey may cease to contribute. However, for entities already subject to\r\nregulation and supervision, requiring good governance and control systems is\r\nnot expected to lead to substantial costs or disproportionate administrative\r\nburden. Therefore this Regulation imposes certain obligation on supervised\r\ncontributors.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An administrator is the\r\nnatural or legal person that has control over the provision of a benchmark, in\r\nparticular who administers the benchmark, collects and analyses the input data,\r\ndetermines the benchmark and in some cases publishes the benchmark. However,\r\nwhere a person merely publishes or refers to a benchmark as part of his or her\r\njournalistic activities but does not have control over the provision of that\r\nbenchmark, that person should not be subject to the requirements imposed on\r\nadministrators by this Regulation. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An index is calculated\r\nusing a formula or some other methodology on the basis of underlying values. Discretion\r\nexists in constructing this formula, performing the calculation or determining\r\nthe input data. This discretion creates a risk of manipulation and therefore\r\nall benchmarks sharing this characteristic should be covered by this\r\nRegulation. However where a single price or value is used as a reference to a\r\nfinancial instrument, for example where the price of a single security is the\r\nreference price for an option, there is no calculation, input data or\r\ndiscretion. Therefore single price or single value reference prices should not\r\nbe considered benchmarks for the purposes of this Regulation. Reference prices\r\nor settlement prices produced by Central Counterparties (CCPs) should not be\r\nconsidered benchmarks because they are used to determine settlement, margins\r\nand risk management and thus do not determine the amount payable under a\r\nfinancial instrument or the value of a financial instrument.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Benchmarks that are provided\r\nby central banks in the Union are subject to control by public authorities and\r\nmeet principles, standards and procedures which ensure the accuracy, integrity\r\nand independence of their benchmarks as provided for by this Regulation. It is therefore\r\nnot necessary that these benchmarks should be subject to this Regulation.\r\nHowever third country central banks may also provide benchmarks that are used\r\nin the Union. It is necessary to determine that only those central banks of\r\nthird countries that produce benchmarks are exempted from the obligations under\r\nthis Regulation that are subject to similar standards to those established by\r\nthis Regulation. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vulnerabilities in the\r\nprocess of providing a benchmark that are not subject to adequate governance\r\ncreate the possibility to manipulate a benchmark. Where benchmarks are\r\navailable to the public the full extent of these risks may not be taken into\r\naccount and so insufficient controls and governance may be implemented. In\r\norder to ensure the integrity of benchmarks, benchmark administrators should be\r\nrequired to implement adequate governance arrangements to control these\r\nconflicts of interest and to safeguard confidence in the integrity of\r\nbenchmarks. Even where effectively managed, most administrators are subject to\r\nsome conflicts of interest and may have to make judgements and decisions which\r\naffect a diverse group of stakeholders. It is therefore necessary that\r\nadministrators have an independent function to oversee the implementation and\r\neffectiveness of the governance arrangements that provide effective oversight.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The manipulation or\r\nunreliability of benchmarks can cause damage to investors and consumers.\r\nTherefore, this Regulation should set out a framework for retention of records\r\nby administrators and contributors as well as providing transparency about a\r\nbenchmark's purpose and input data which facilitates more efficient and fairer\r\nresolution of any potential claims in accordance with national or Union law.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Auditing and the effective\r\nenforcement of this Regulation requires ex post analysis and evidence and it is\r\ntherefore necessary that benchmark administrators keep adequate records relating\r\nto the calculation of the benchmark for a sufficient period of time. The\r\nreality that a benchmark seeks to measure and the environment in which it is\r\nmeasured are likely to change over time. Therefore it is necessary that the process\r\nand methodology of the provision of benchmarks are audited or reviewed on a periodic\r\nbasis to identify shortcomings and possible improvements. Many stakeholders may\r\nbe impacted by failures in the provision of the benchmark and can help identify\r\nthese shortcomings. It is therefore necessary that an independent complaints\r\nprocedure is established to ensure that those stakeholders are able to notify\r\nthe benchmark administrator of complaints and that the benchmark administrator objectively\r\nevaluates the merits of any complaint. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provision of benchmarks\r\nfrequently involves the outsourcing of important functions such as calculating\r\nthe benchmark, gathering the input data and disseminating the benchmark. In\r\norder to ensure the effectiveness of the governance arrangements, it is\r\nnecessary to ensure that any such outsourcing does not relieve a benchmark\r\nadministrator of any of its obligations and responsibilities, and is done in\r\nsuch a way that it does not interfere with either the administrators ability to\r\nmeet these obligations or responsibilities, or the relevant competent authority\u2019s\r\nability to supervise them.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The benchmark administrator\r\nis the central recipient of the input data and is able to evaluate the\r\nintegrity and accuracy of this input data on a consistent basis. It is\r\ntherefore necessary that the benchmark administrator has adequate controls to\r\nassess accuracy of input data and notifies the relevant competent authority of\r\nsuspicious data. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Employees of the\r\nadministrator may identify possible breaches of this Regulation or potential\r\nvulnerabilities that could lead to manipulation or attempted manipulation. This\r\nRegulation should therefore ensure that adequate arrangements are in place to\r\nenable employees to alert administrators confidentially of possible breaches of\r\nthis Regulation. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any discretion that can be\r\nexercised in providing input data creates an opportunity to manipulate a\r\nbenchmark. Where the input data is transaction based data, there is less\r\ndiscretion and therefore the opportunity to manipulate the data is reduced. As\r\na general rule benchmark administrators should therefore use actual transaction\r\ninput data where possible but other data may be used in those cases where the\r\ntransaction data is insufficient to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the\r\nbenchmark.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The accuracy and\r\nreliability of a benchmark in measuring the economic reality it is intended to\r\ntrack depends on the methodology and input data used. It is therefore necessary\r\nto adopt a methodology that ensures the benchmark\u2019s reliability and accuracy. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It may be necessary to\r\nchange the methodology to ensure the continued accuracy of the benchmark, but\r\nany changes in the methodology have an impact on the users and stakeholders in\r\nthe benchmark. It is therefore necessary to specify the procedures to be\r\nfollowed when changing the benchmark methodology, including the need for\r\nconsultation, so that users and stakeholders can take the necessary actions in\r\nlight of these changes or notify the administrator if they have concerns about\r\nthese changes. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The integrity and accuracy\r\nof benchmarks depends on the integrity and accuracy of the input data provided\r\nby contributors. It is essential that the obligations of the contributors in\r\nrespect of this input data are clearly specified, can be relied on and are\r\nconsistent with the benchmark administrator\u2019s controls and methodology. It is\r\ntherefore necessary that the benchmark administrator produces a code of conduct\r\nto specify these requirements and that the contributors are bound by that code\r\nof conduct. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many benchmarks are\r\ndetermined from input data that is provided by regulated venues, energy\r\nexchanges and emission allowance auctions. These venues are subject to\r\nregulation and supervision that ensures the integrity of the input data,\r\nprovides for governance requirements and procedures for the notification of\r\nbreaches. Therefore these benchmarks are released from certain obligations in\r\norder to avoid dual regulation and because their supervision ensures the\r\nintegrity of the input data used.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contributors may be subject\r\nto conflicts of interest and may exercise discretion in the determination of\r\nthe input data. Therefore it is necessary that contributors are subject to\r\ngovernance arrangements to ensure that these conflicts are managed and that the\r\ninput data is accurate, conforms to the administrator\u2019s requirements and can be\r\nvalidated.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Different types of\r\nbenchmark and different benchmark sectors have different characteristics,\r\nvulnerabilities and risks. The provisions of this Regulation should be further\r\nspecified for particular benchmark sectors and types. Interbank interest rate\r\nbenchmarks are benchmarks that play an important role in the transmission of\r\nmonetary policy and so it is necessary to specify how these provisions would\r\napply to these benchmarks in this Regulation. Commodity benchmarks are widely\r\nused and have sector specific characteristics and so it is necessary to specify\r\nhow these provisions would apply to these benchmarks in this Regulation.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The failure of certain critical\r\nbenchmarks may have a significant impact on financial stability, market\r\norderliness or investors and it is therefore necessary that additional\r\nrequirements apply to ensure the integrity and robustness of these critical\r\nbenchmarks. Where a benchmark references a significant value of financial\r\ninstruments it will have such an impact. It is therefore necessary that the\r\nCommission determines those benchmarks that reference financial instruments\r\nabove a certain threshold and should be considered critical benchmarks.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contributors ceasing to\r\ncontribute may undermine the credibility of critical benchmarks. In order to\r\naddress this vulnerability, it is therefore necessary to include a power for\r\nthe relevant competent authority to require mandatory contributions to critical\r\nbenchmarks. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order for users of benchmarks\r\nto make appropriate choices of, and understand the risks of, benchmarks, they\r\nneed to know what the benchmark measures and their vulnerabilities. Therefore\r\nthe benchmark administrator should publish a statement specifying these\r\nelements as well as publish the input data used to determine the benchmark.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumers may enter into financial\r\ncontracts, in particular mortgages and consumer credit contracts that reference\r\na benchmark, but unequal bargaining power and the use of standard terms mean\r\nthat they may have a limited choice about the benchmark used. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to ensure that the responsibility for assessing the suitability of\r\nsuch a benchmark for the consumer rests with the lenders or creditors who are supervised\r\nentities because they have a greater ability to choose the benchmark. However the\r\nsuitability assessment should not be required by this Regulation for financial\r\ninstruments referencing a benchmark, as it is already provided for in Directive\r\n[MIFID]. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should take\r\ninto account the Principles for financial benchmarks issued by the\r\nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as \u2018IOSCO Principles\u2019) on the 17 July 2013 which serve as a global\r\nstandard for regulatory requirements for benchmarks. It is necessary for\r\ninvestor protection that an assessment that the supervisions and regulation in\r\nany third country are equivalent to Union supervision and regulation of\r\nbenchmarks takes place before any benchmark provided from that third country can\r\nbe used in the Union. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The administrator should be\r\nauthorised and supervised by the competent authority of the Member State where\r\nthat administrator is located.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In some circumstances a\r\nperson may provide an index but be unaware that this index is being used as a\r\nreference for a financial instrument. This is particularly the case where the\r\nusers and benchmark administrator are located in different Member States. It is\r\ntherefore necessary that competent authorities, whenever they become aware of\r\nthe use of a benchmark in a financial instrument, notify a central coordinating\r\nauthority such as ESMA, who should notify the administrator. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A set of effective tools\r\nand powers and resources for the competent authorities of Member States\r\nguarantees supervisory effectiveness. This Regulation therefore should in\r\nparticular provide for a minimum set of supervisory and investigative powers with\r\nwhich competent authorities of Member States should be entrusted in accordance\r\nwith national law. When exercising their powers under this Regulation competent\r\nauthorities and ESMA should act objectively and impartially and remain\r\nautonomous in their decision making.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of\r\ndetecting breaches of this Regulation, it is necessary for competent\r\nauthorities to be able to access, in accordance with national law, the premises\r\nof natural and legal persons in order to seize documents. The access to such\r\npremises is necessary when there is reasonable suspicion that documents and\r\nother data related to the subject matter of an inspection or investigation\r\nexist and may be relevant to prove a breach of this Regulation. Additionally\r\nthe access to such premises is necessary where: the person to whom a demand for\r\ninformation has already been made fails to comply with it; or where there are\r\nreasonable grounds for believing that if a demand were to be made, it would not\r\nbe complied with, or that the documents or information to which the information\r\nrequirement relates, would be removed, tampered with or destroyed. If prior\r\nauthorisation is needed from the judicial authority of the Member State\r\nconcerned, in accordance with national law, such power for access into premises\r\nshall be used after having obtained that prior judicial authorisation. \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing recordings of\r\ntelephone conversations and data traffic records from supervised entities may constitute\r\ncrucial, and sometimes the only evidence to detect and prove the existence of breaches\r\nof this Regulation, notably the compliance with governance and control\r\nrequirements. Such records and recordings can help to verify the identity of\r\nthe person responsible for the submission, those responsible for its approval,\r\nand whether physical separation of employees is maintained. Therefore, competent\r\nauthorities should be able to require existing recordings of telephone\r\nconversations, electronic communications and data traffic records held by supervised\r\nentities, in those cases where a reasonable suspicion exists that such recordings\r\nor records related to the subject-matter of the inspection or investigation may\r\nbe relevant to prove a breach of this Regulation.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some of the provisions of\r\nthis Regulation apply to natural or legal persons in third countries who may\r\nuse benchmarks or be contributors to benchmarks or may be otherwise involved in\r\nthe benchmark process. Competent authorities should therefore enter into\r\narrangements with supervisory authorities in third countries. ESMA should\r\ncoordinate the development of such cooperation arrangements and the exchange\r\nbetween competent authorities of information received from third countries.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation respects\r\nthe fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and in the Charter of Fundamental\r\nRights of the European Union, in particular the right to respect for private\r\nand family, the protection of personal data, the right to freedom of expression\r\nand information, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to property, the\r\nright to consumer protection, the right to an effective remedy, the right of\r\ndefence. Therefore, this Regulation should be interpreted and applied in\r\naccordance with those rights and principles. \n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rights of defence of\r\nthe persons concerned should be fully respected. In particular, persons subject\r\nto proceedings shall be provided with access to the findings upon which the\r\ncompetent authorities has based the decision and shall be given the right to be\r\nheard.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transparency regarding\r\nbenchmarks is necessary for reasons of financial market stability and investor\r\nprotection. Any exchange or transmission of information by competent\r\nauthorities should take place in accordance with the rules on the transfer of\r\npersonal data as laid down in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard\r\nto the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[16]. Any exchange or transmission\r\nof information by ESMA should take place in accordance with the rules on the\r\ntransfer of personal data as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of\r\nindividuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community\r\ninstitutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data[17].\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into consideration\r\nthe principles set out in the Commission\u2019s communication on reinforcing\r\nsanctioning regimes in the financial services sector and legal acts of the\r\nUnion adopted as a follow-up to that Communication, Member States should lay\r\ndown rules on penalties and administrative measures applicable to infringements\r\nof the provisions of this Regulation and should ensure that they are\r\nimplemented. Those penalties and administrative measures should be effective,\r\nproportionate and dissuasive. \n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, a set of\r\nadministrative measures, sanctions and fines should be provided for to ensure a\r\ncommon approach in Member States and to enhance their deterrent effect. Sanctions\r\napplied in specific cases should be determined taking into account where\r\nappropriate factors such as the repayment of any identified financial benefit,\r\nthe gravity and duration of the breach, any aggravating or mitigating factors,\r\nthe need for fines to have a deterrent effect and, where appropriate, include a\r\nreduction in return for cooperation with the competent authority. In\r\nparticular, the actual amount of administrative fines to be imposed in a\r\nspecific case may reach the maximum level provided for in this Regulation, or\r\nthe higher level provided for in national law, for very serious breaches, while\r\nfines significantly lower than the maximum level may be applied to minor\r\nbreaches or in case of settlement. The possibility to impose a temporary ban to\r\nexercise management functions within benchmark administrators or contributors should\r\nbe available to the competent authority. This Regulation should not limit\r\nMember States in their ability to provide for higher levels of administrative\r\nsanctions.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\r\ndecisions made by competent authorities have a deterrent effect on the public\r\nat large, they should normally be published. The publication of decisions is\r\nalso an important tool for competent authorities to inform market participants\r\nof what behaviour is considered constitute a violation of this Regulation and\r\nto promote wider good behaviour amongst market participants. If such\r\npublication risks causing disproportionate damage to the persons involved,\r\njeopardises the stability of financial markets or an on-going investigation the\r\ncompetent authority should publish the sanctions and measures on an anonymous\r\nbasis or delay the publication. Competent authorities should have the option\r\nnot to publish sanctions where anonymous or delayed publication is considered\r\ninsufficient to ensure that the stability of financial markets are not be\r\njeopardised. Competent authorities are also not required to publish measures\r\nwhich are deemed to be of a minor nature where publication would be disproportionate.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Critical benchmarks may\r\ninvolve contributors, administrators and users in more than one Member State.\r\nThus, the cessation of the provision of such a benchmark or any events that may\r\nsignificantly undermine its integrity may have an impact in more than one\r\nMember State meaning that the supervision of such a benchmark by the competent\r\nauthority of the Member State in which it is located alone will not be\r\nefficient and effective in terms of addressing the risks that the critical\r\nbenchmark poses. To ensure the effective exchange of supervisory information\r\namong competent authorities, coordination of their activities and supervisory\r\nmeasures, colleges of competent authorities should be formed. The activities of\r\nthe colleges should contribute to the harmonised application of rules under\r\nthis Regulation and to the convergence of supervisory practices. ESMA's legally\r\nbinding mediation is a key element of the achievement of coordination,\r\nsupervisory consistency and convergence of supervisory practices. Benchmarks\r\nmay reference financial instruments and financial contracts that have a long\r\nduration. In certain cases such benchmarks may no longer be permitted to be\r\nprovided once this Regulation comes into effect because they have\r\ncharacteristics that cannot be adjusted to conform to the requirements of this\r\nRegulation. However, prohibiting the continued provision of such a benchmark\r\nmay result in the termination or frustration of the financial instruments or\r\nfinancial contracts and so harm investors. It is therefore necessary to make\r\nprovision to allow for the continued provision of such benchmarks for a\r\ntransitional period.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation and further specify\r\ntechnical elements of the proposal, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\r\n290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the specification\r\nof technical elements of definitions, governance and control requirements\r\napplied to administrators and to supervised contributors, requirements\r\nconcerning input data and methodology, the code of conduct, specific\r\nrequirements for different types of benchmarks and sectors and the information\r\nto be provided in applications for authorisation of administrators.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should adopt\r\ndraft regulatory technical standards developed by ESMA establishing the minimum\r\ncontent of cooperation arrangements with the competent authorities of third\r\ncountries, by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance\r\nwith Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, in regard to certain of\r\nits aspects implementing powers should be granted to the Commission. Those\r\naspects concern the ascertainment of the equivalence of the legal framework to\r\nwhich central banks and providers of benchmarks of third countries are subject,\r\nas well of the fact that a benchmark is critical in nature.Those powers should\r\nbe exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011[18] laying down the rules and\r\ngeneral principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the\r\nCommission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should also\r\nbe empowered to adopt implementing technical standards developed by ESMA\r\nestablishing procedures and forms for exchange of information between competent\r\nauthorities and ESMA, by means of implementing acts pursuant to Article 291\r\nTFEU and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. Since\r\nthe objectives of this Regulation, namely to lay down a consistent and\r\neffective regime to address the vulnerabilities that benchmarks pose cannot be\r\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States, given that the overall impact of\r\nthe problems relating to benchmarks can be fully perceived only in a Union\r\ncontext, and can therefore be better achieved at Union level, the Union may\r\nadopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\r\n5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond\r\nwhat is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE 1 \r\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1 \r\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation introduces a common\r\nframework to ensure the accuracy and integrity of indices used as benchmarks in\r\nfinancial instruments and financial contracts in the Union.

In the absence of an EU\r\nlegislative framework, individual actions by member states would be\r\nineffective, as there is no obligation or incentive on Member States to\r\ncooperate with each other and the absence of such cooperation leaves scope for\r\nregulatory arbitrage. EU involvement ensures a consistent and co-ordinated\r\nresponse that minimises the inefficiencies that would be created through the\r\ndivergent approaches and possibilities for regulatory arbitrage that would\r\notherwise exist.\nLessons\r\nlearned from similar experiences in the past\nBenchmarks are similar to credit ratings in that\r\nthey are both reference points for investments or financial contracts. In both\r\ncases the financial crisis has revealed how doubts regarding their integrity\r\nand accuracy can undermine markets and cause harm to both the real economy and\r\ninvestors. This proposal draws on the regulatory experience in relation to the\r\nregulation of credit rating agencies, in particular in respect of the most\r\nefficient and effective regulatory and supervisory structures and governance\r\nrequirements.\nCompatibility\r\nand possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\nThis proposal has significant synergies with the\r\nproposal for a Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) in Articles 2(3)(d) and 8(1)(d)\r\nand criminal sanctions for market abuse Directive (CSMAD) which clarify that\r\nany manipulation of benchmarks is clearly and unequivocally illegal and subject\r\nto administrative or criminal sanctions. The regulation on energy market\r\nintegrity and transparency (REMIT) also provides that the manipulation of\r\nbenchmarks that are used for wholesale energy products is illegal. These\r\ninstruments therefore address the behaviour of individuals in respect of the\r\nmanipulation of benchmarks while this proposal addresses the weaknesses in\r\nframework for the production of benchmarks that facilitates the manipulation of\r\nbenchmarks.\nThe Markets in Financial Instruments Directive\r\nand implementing regulation of that directive, the Prospectus Directive and\r\nimplementing regulation and the Undertakings for Collective Investment in\r\nTransferable Securities Directive all regulate the use and transparency of\r\nbenchmarks and so complement the actions of this proposal.\nDuration\r\nand financial impact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \nProposal/initiative in effect from\r\n[DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \nFinancial impact from YYYY to YYYY \nX Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\nManagement\r\nmode(s) envisaged[31] \nX Centralised direct management\r\nby the Commission \nX Centralised indirect management\r\nwith the delegation of implementation tasks to:\nexecutive agencies \nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[32] \nnational public-sector bodies/bodies with\r\npublic-service mission \npersons entrusted with the implementation\r\nof specific actions pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and\r\nidentified in the relevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the\r\nFinancial Regulation \n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\r\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\r\n\"Comments\" section.\nComments \nCombination of centralised direct management (DG MARKT) and\r\ncentralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to\r\na body created by the EC (ESMA)\nMANAGEMENT MEASURES \nMonitoring\r\nand reporting rules \nSpecify\r\nfrequency and conditions.\nArticle 81\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of The European Parliament and of the Council of\r\n24 November 2010 establishing the European Securities and Markets Authority\r\nprovides for evaluation of the experience acquired as a result of the operation\r\nof the Authority every three years from the effective start of its operation.\r\nUnder Article 35 of the Regulation, a report on the application of this\r\nRegulation will be produced by 1 January 2019.\nManagement\r\nand control system \nRisk(s)\r\nidentified \nAn impact\r\nassessment has been carried out for the proposal to reform the financial\r\nsupervision system in the EU to accompany the draft Regulations establishing\r\nthe European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational\r\nPensions Authority and the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA).\nThe\r\nadditional resources for ESMA foreseen as a result of the current proposal are\r\nneeded in order to allow ESMA to carry out its competences, notably its role\r\nin:\n-\r\nParticipating in the colleges of supervisors for critical benchmarks and\r\nestablishing a mediation mechanism, including binding mediation on important\r\nsubjects specified in this Regulation, to assist in reaching a common view\r\namong the competent authorities in the event of any disagreement in relation to\r\nthis Regulation.\n-\r\nCoordinating the development of cooperation arrangements with third counties\r\nand the exchange between competent authorities of information received from\r\nthird countries.\n- Drafting\r\nguidelines to promote convergence and cross-sector consistency of penalty\r\nregimes in respect of breaches of this Regulation.\n-\r\nMaintaining a list of administrators registered in accordance with this\r\nRegulation and third country firms providing benchmarks in the Union. \n- Receiving\r\nnotifications of the use of a benchmark in a financial instrument or financial\r\ncontract within the Union, maintaining a register and ensuring that administrators\r\nare aware of this use.\nWithout the\r\nnecessary resources a timely and efficient fulfilment of the role of the\r\nAuthority cannot be ensured.\nControl\r\nmethod(s) envisaged \nManagement\r\nand control systems as provided for in the ESMA Regulation will also apply with\r\nregard to the role of ESMA in the present proposal.\nThe final\r\nset of indicators to assess the performance of ESMA will be decided by the\r\nCommission at the time of conducting the first required evaluation. For the\r\nfinal assessment, the quantitative indicators will be as important as the\r\nqualitative evidence gathered in the consultations. The evaluation shall be\r\nrepeated every three years.\nCosts and\r\nbenefits of controls and probable non-compliance rate\nCosts are estimated on section 3. The main benefits\r\ncomprise:\n- Reducing the risk of manipulation and therefore\r\nenhancing market stability and restored confidence in financial markets.\n- Enhancing the reliability of benchmarks and\r\nthereby enhanced fairness, integrity and efficiency of financial markets.\n- Ensuring the appropriate use of robust and\r\nrepresentative benchmarks and therefore enhanced consumer and investor\r\nprotection.\nIn consequence, this proposal would contribute to\r\nenhanced market fairness and ensure consumer and investor protection. Such\r\nbenefits are difficult to quantify. However, given the global importance of\r\nrobust and reliable benchmarks for maintaining market stability and restoring\r\nconfidence in markets, the benefits are substantial in relation to the costs.\nA low non-compliance rate is estimated since the\r\ninitiative proposes clear and enforceable rules with incentives to ensure\r\ncompliance.\nMeasures\r\nto prevent fraud and irregularities \nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention\r\nand protection measures.\nFor the purposes of combating fraud, corruption\r\nand any other illegal activity, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning\r\ninvestigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) shall apply\r\nto ESMA without any restriction.\nThe Authority shall accede to the\r\nInterinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament,\r\nthe Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European\r\nCommunities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud\r\nOffice (OLAF) and shall immediately adopt appropriate provisions for all staff\r\nof the Authority.\nThe funding decisions and the agreements and the\r\nimplementing instruments resulting from them shall explicitly stipulate that\r\nthe Court of Auditors and OLAF may, if need be, carry out on-the-spot checks on\r\nthe beneficiaries of monies disbursed by the Authority as well as on the staff\r\nresponsible for allocating these monies.\nESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \nHeading(s)\r\nof the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected\nExisting budget lines\nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Description] || Diff.   || from EFTA countries[33]   || from candidate countries[34]   || from third countries || within the meaning of Article 18(1)(aa) of the Financial Regulation \n   || 12.03.04 European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) || Diff. || YES || YES || NO || NO \nThis legislative initiative will have the\r\nfollowing impacts on expenditures:\na) DG MARKT\r\nfor drafting delegated acts, as well as for the evaluation, monitoring of the\r\nimplementation and potential review of the initiative:\n1 AD staff member (full-time) and related\r\ncosts; estimated yearly costs of \u20ac 0.142 M per year.\nb) ESMA\n(i) HR costs: two temporary agents for participating and mediating in the colleges\r\nof supervisors for critical benchmarks, providing technical advice to the\r\nCommission on the implementation of this Regulation, coordinating the\r\ndevelopment of cooperation arrangements with third countries, drafting\r\nguidelines to promote convergence and cross-sector consistency of penalty\r\nregimes and maintaining registers of notifications on the use of benchmarks and\r\na list of registered benchmark administrators.\nThe total yearly costs of these 2 temporary\r\nagents would be of \u20ac0.326 M, towards which the Commission would contribute 40%\r\n(\u20ac 0.130 M) and Member States 60% (\u20ac 0.196 M).\nIt is not foreseen that the staff members\r\nallocated to ESMA could be reduced in the future (after 2020) as the number of\r\nbenchmarks, including critical benchmarks, is no likely to decrease in the\r\nfuture but rather to increase and ESMA will still need to participate and\r\nmediate in the colleges of supervisors for critical benchmarks and carry out\r\nother relevant tasks set above. \n(ii) Operational and infrastructure\r\ncosts: an initial expense of \u20ac 0.25 M is also\r\nestimated for ESMA, towards which the Commission would contribute\r\n40% (\u20ac 0.1 M) and Member States 60% (\u20ac 0.15 M).

These relate to ESMA participation and mediation in\r\ncolleges of supervisors for critical benchmarks. Also to provision of technical\r\nadvice to the Commission on the implementation of this Regulation, coordination\r\nof cooperation arrangements with third countries, drafting guidelines to\r\npromote convergence and cross-sector consistency of penalty regimes and\r\nmaintaining registers of notifications on the use of benchmarks and a list of\r\nregistered benchmark administrators.\nAccording to current estimations from the\r\nCommission\u2019s own estimates and ESMA estimates the activities will require 2\r\ntemporary agents. This is in addition to the staff members that are currently\r\nworking on benchmarks at ESMA. The additional yearly staff costs estimated for\r\nESMA are of \u20ac 0.326 M towards which the Commission will contribute 40% (\u20ac 0.130\r\nM) and Member States 60% (\u20ac 0.196 M). \nb) Operational and infrastructure costs: an initial operational expense of \u20ac 0.25 M is also estimated for\r\nESMA, towards which the Commission would contribute 40% (\u20ac 0.1 M) and Member\r\nStates 60% (\u20ac 0.15 M) in 2015. This expense relates mainly to IT systems for\r\nESMA to fulfil the requirements of:\n- Maintaining a list of administrators\r\nregistered in accordance with this Regulation and third country firms providing\r\nbenchmarks in the Union. \n- Receiving notifications of the use of a\r\nbenchmark in a financial instrument or financial contract within the Union, and\r\nmaintaining a register and ensuring that administrators are aware of this use.\nThis initiative also requires the\r\nincrease the funding of ESMA by \u20ac 0.3 M in 2017 to cover the costs of producing\r\na report on the application of this Regulation by 1 January 2018. The total cost of producing this report are estimated to be \u20ac0.3 M\r\n(to be committed and paid in 2017) towards which the Commission would\r\ncontribute 40% (\u20ac 0.12M) and Member States 60% (\u20ac 0.18 M). These costs have\r\nbeen estimated based on the average costs of producing similar reports at DG\r\nMARKT and applying a correction to reflect the impact of inflation.\nThe proposal does NOT have financial implications on revenue for\r\nESMA. \nThe detailed breakdown of estimated staff costs by various\r\ncategories is presented in table 1 below. \nOther assumptions:\n\u2013 based on the distribution of FTEs in 2012\r\ndraft budget, the 2 additional FTEs are assumed to be comprised of 2 temporary\r\nagents, with a total cost of \u20ac0.326 M yearly, which would be co-financed by the\r\nCommission (\u20ac 0.130 M) and MS (\u20ac 0.196 M) yearly.\n\u2013 average annual salary costs for different\r\ncategories of personnel are based on DG BUDG guidance of \u20ac 132,000 per year;\n\u2013 salary weighting coefficient for Paris of\r\n1.161;\n\u2013 mission costs of \u20ac10,000, estimated based\r\non 2012 draft budget for missions per headcount;\n\u2013 recruiting-related
