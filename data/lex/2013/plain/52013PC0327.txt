Taking into account the\nconclusions of the European Council of 7/8 February 2013, the Commission is\nproposing a maximum amount of EUR 1 891,936 million for\nexpenditure in relation to food and feed during the whole period 2014-2020. The\nobjective of this Regulation is to modernise the financial provisions for this\narea.\nThe main current financial legal framework used\nfor funding these areas is Council Decision 2009/470/EC for veterinary\neradication programmes and veterinary emergency measures, Council Directive\n2000/29/EC for plant health measures and Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council for funding measures regarding official\ncontrols. Further specific financial provisions exist in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005\non maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and\nanimal origin, in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning the placing of plant\nprotection products on the market, in Directive 2009/128/EC establishing a\nframework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides as\nwell as in numerous other Council Directives related to animal and plant\nhealth.\nThis piecemeal framework is not in line with\nsome provisions of the Financial Regulation and is quite complex. It has\nevolved over time and it needs to be rationalised.\nThis is an opportunity to replace the current\nfinancial provisions in multiple legal bases by one single, clear and modern financial\nframework which optimises the implementation and the functioning of financial\nmanagement of expenditure in the field of food and feed. In particular, the\nfinancial management structures will be simplified on the basis of clear\nobjectives and indicators. Funding rates will also be clearer and more\nsimplified. \nThis proposal is part of the 'Healthier Animals\nand Plants for a Safer Food Chain Package' which includes proposals for:\n\u2013              \nthe animal health policy, which aims to protect\nand raise the health status and the condition of animal in the EU, in\nparticular food-producing animals, whilst permitting intra-EU trade and imports\nof animals and animal products in accordance with the appropriate health\nstandards and international obligations;\n\u2013              \nthe plant health regime, whose objective is to\nprotect EU agriculture and forestry by preventing the entry and spread of\nnon-native plant pests;\n\u2013              \nthe regime for production and making available on\nthe market of plant reproductive material of agricultural, vegetable, forest,\nfruit, vine and ornamental species, which ensures that EU criteria for health,\nidentity, and quality are met;\n\u2013              \nthe rules which govern official controls and\nother official activities performed to ensure the application of food law and\nfeed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant\nreproductive material, plant protection products and pesticides.\n\u00b7              \nFocus of actions/Expenditure\nThe veterinary eradication programmes are\nessential to progressively eliminate a number of listed animal diseases which\nare endemic in certain areas of the Union, by means of a wide range of measures\nincluding vaccination, testing of animals and compensation for slaughtering and\nculling. EU funding to support these measures gives priority to diseases of\npublic health importance and those which have major economic impacts, due to\ntrade implications and income losses for farmers, for the wider livestock\nindustry, as well as adjacent sectors.\nThe EU plant health and plant reproductive\nmaterial regimes give priority to the protection of EU agriculture and forestry\nby preventing the entry and spread of non-native pests of plants and to the\navailability and use of healthy plant material at the beginning of the chain of\nplant production.\nExpenditure for official controls includes the\nfinancing of the Better Training for Safer Food programme, which promotes a\nharmonised approach to the operation of Union and national control systems; and\nof the network of the EU Reference Laboratories, which provide scientific and\ntechnical expertise in those areas where the effectiveness of official controls\ndepends on the quality, uniformity and reliability of the methods of analysis\nor tests, and the results thereof, employed by official laboratories. It also\nincludes other actions intended to improve the effectiveness of official\ncontrols performed by the Member States and the enforcement of the agri-food\nchain acquis in general.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u00b7              \nConsultation of interested parties\nBecause these policies have been under review\nfor some time, they are individually supported by their own impact assessments,\nand details of these policies have been extensively discussed with stakeholders\nin various consultation fora.\n\u00b7              \nAccelerated impact assessment\nAn impact\nassessment was conducted between August and September 2012 by the\nDirectorate-General for Health and Consumers. It considered four options:\n\u2013              \nOption 1: no change. The current legal framework\nwill not be consistent with the Multiannual Financial Framework. Expenditure on\nplant health could not be increased.\n\u2013              \nOption 2: bring existing legislation into one\nlegislative instrument. This will promote a simpler and more understandable\nlegislation, but will not allow the financial framework to be adapted.\n\u2013              \nOption 3 (a): establish a single coherent\nfinancial programme, largely using existing financial provisions but with\nimprovements. The simplification of the system and the harmonisation of rates\nwill reduce the administrative burden on the Commission and on the Member\nStates. New financial management tools such as clear objectives and indicators\nwill use available resources more effectively.\n\u2013              \nOption 3 (b): introduction of aspects of Cost\nand Responsibility Sharing Schemes (CRSS). This option envisages a\nparticipatory approach when public authorities share with the private sector\nthe burden of losses incurred as well as the responsibilities of running the\nsystem. The administrative burden will be expected to rise in the short term\nand the system is expected to be difficult to manage.\n\u2013              \nOption 4: stop all EU actions. This option was\nnot considered appropriate because it will jeopardise the objectives of the\npolicy areas and will have a very negative impact on trade.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposal is based on Articles 43(2) and\n168(4)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\nMeasures adopted under Article 43(2) should be necessary to pursue the\nobjectives of the common agricultural policy. Measures adopted under Article\n168(4)(b) should have as their object a high level of human health protection.\nThis proposal undertakes to financially support EU and Member State actions aiming at ensuring a high level of health for humans, animals and plants along\nthe food chain and a high level of protection and information of food chain\nconsumers. The choice of Articles 43(2) and 168(4)(b) TFEU is thus justified both\nby the objective and the content of the proposal. This proposal is to be\nadopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after\nconsulting the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the\nRegions.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nOn 29 June 2011, the European Commission\npresented its proposal for a multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020[3] which was amended on 6 July\n2012[4]. Taking into account the\nconclusions of the European Council of 7/8 February 2013, the Commission is\nproposing a maximum amount of EUR 1 891,936 million for\nexpenditure in relation to food and feed during the whole period 2014-2020. In\naccordance with the Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 of 19 December 2002\nlaying down the statute for Executive Agencies to be entrusted with certain\ntasks in the management of Community programmes, the Commission has entrusted\nthe Executive Agency for Health and Consumers with implementation tasks for the\nmanagement of the Food and Feed Programme since 2008. The Commission may use,\non the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, an existing executive agency for the\nimplementation of this Programme.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SUMMARY OF CONTENTS OF THIS\nREGULATION\nThis Regulation provides for the scope and\nobjectives for food and feed expenditure up to a maximum ceiling of EUR 1\n891,936 million in current prices. The objectives are a high level of safety of\nfood and food production systems, a higher animal health status and animal\nwelfare, the detection and eradication of pests, to ensure an effective implementation\nof official controls. These objectives are accompanied with their indicators.\nThis Regulation also sets eligible measures and\ncosts.\nThe funding rates for grants are rationalised.\nA standard funding rate is set at 50% of the eligible costs. This rate can be\nraised under certain conditions up to 75% and 100%. In order to avoid the\nadministrative burden of the management of micro-programmes, this Regulation\nsets a minimal amount for grants of EUR 50 000.\nThis Regulation also provides for the access to\nthe Reserve for crises in the agricultural sector in certain circumstances.\nRegarding plant health, in order to protect the\nEU against pests linked inter alia to trade globalisation and climate\nchange, Union financial contribution will also cover survey programmes for the\npresence of pests and phytosanitary support measures for the outermost\nterritories of Member States.\nThis Regulation provides for the possibility to\nsupport Union reference laboratories and projects aimed at improving the\neffectiveness and efficiency of official controls.\nFor the sake of clarity and transparency, this\nRegulation sets the procedures of submission and evaluation of annual and\nmultiannual control programmes and the procedure for setting or updating the\nlist of animal diseases or plant pests eligible for co-funding.\nThe procedures for financing these areas are\nsimplified. In particular the number of decisions the Commission will have to\nadopt will decrease significantly. For example the reimbursement decisions will\nnot be taken by the Commission any more.\n2013/0169 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nlaying down provisions for the management\nof expenditure relating to the food chain, animal health and animal welfare,\nand relating to plant health and plant reproductive material, amending Council\nDirectives 98/56/EC, 2000/29/EC and 2008/90/EC, Regulations (EC) No 178/2002,\n(EC) No 882/2004 and (EC) No 396/2005, Directive 2009/128/EC and Regulation\n(EC) No 1107/2009 and repealing Council Decisions 66/399/EEC, 76/894/EEC and\n2009/470/EC\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 43(2) and 168(4)(b)\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission[5],\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[6],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[7],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union legislation provides\nfor requirements regarding food and food safety and feed and feed safety, at\nall stages of production, including rules aimed at guaranteeing fair practices in\ntrade and the provision of information to consumers. It also provides for requirements\nregarding the prevention and control of transmissible diseases in animals and\nzoonoses, and requirements regarding animal welfare, animal by-products, plant\nhealth and plant reproductive material, the protection of plant varieties,\ngenetically modified organisms and the placing on the market and use of plant\nprotection products and the sustainable use of pesticides. Union legislation\nalso provides for official controls and other control activities aimed at\nensuring the effective implementation of and compliance with those requirements.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The general objective of\nUnion legislation in those areas is to contribute to a high level of health for\nhumans, animals and plants along the food chain, a high level of protection and\ninformation of consumers and a high level of protection of the environment\nwhile favouring competitiveness and creation of jobs.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The pursuit of that\ngeneral objective requires appropriate financial resources. It is therefore necessary\nthat the Union contributes to the funding of measures undertaken in the\ndifferent areas pertaining to that general objective. In addition, in order to\nefficiently target the use of the expenditure, specific objectives should be\nlaid down and indicators should be set to assess the achievement of those\nobjectives.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union financing for\nexpenditure relating to food and feed has in the past taken the form of grants,\nprocurement and payments to international organisations active in the field. It\nis appropriate to continue financing in the same manner.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For reasons of budgetary\ndiscipline, it is necessary to lay down in this Regulation the list of eligible\nmeasures which may benefit from a Union contribution as well as the eligible\ncosts and applicable rates.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 29 June 2011, the\nEuropean Commission presented its proposal for a multiannual financial\nframework for 2014-2020[8]\nwhich was amended on 6 July 2012[9].\nTaking into account the conclusions of the European Council of 7/8 February\n2013, the Commission is proposing a maximum amount of EUR 1 891,936 million\nfor expenditure in relation to food and feed during the whole period 2014-2020.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, in its\nproposal for a multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020, the Commission suggests\nthe creation of an emergency mechanism to react to crisis situations.\nConsequently, in case of exceptional circumstances like emergency situations\nrelated to animal and plant health, when the appropriations under budget heading\n3 are insufficient but emergency measures are necessary, funds from the Reserve\nfor crises in the agricultural sector should be transferred in accordance with\nthe Interinstitutional Agreement of\u2026 between the European Parliament, the\nCouncil and the Commission on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound\nfinancial management[10].\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legislation currently\nin force provides that some of the eligible costs are reimbursed at fixed\nrates, while for other costs no limitation is foreseen. In order to rationalise\nand simplify the system, a fixed maximum rate for reimbursement should be set.\nIt is appropriate to set that rate at the usual level applied for grants. It is\nalso necessary to provide the possibility to raise that maximum rate in certain\ncircumstances.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the importance of achieving\nthe objectives of this Regulation, it is appropriate to finance 100% of the\neligible costs for certain actions provided that the implementation of those\nactions also implies incurring costs which are not eligible.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union has the\nresponsibility to ensure that funds are properly spent but also to take\nmeasures to respond to the need to simplify its spending programmes in order to\nreduce the administrative burden and the costs for beneficiaries of funds and\nfor all actors involved, in line with the Communication from the Commission to\nthe European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social\nCommittee and the Committee of the Regions \u2013 Smart Regulation in the European\nUnion[11].\nFor cost effectiveness reasons, both at level of the Commission and of the\nMember States, grants under a certain ceiling should not be granted anymore.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union legislation requires\nMember States to implement certain measures in the case of the occurrence and\ndevelopment of certain animal diseases or zoonoses. Therefore, the Union should make a financial contribution for such emergency measures.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also necessary to\nreduce, by appropriate eradication, control and monitoring measures, the number\nof outbreaks of animal diseases and zoonoses which pose a risk to human and\nanimal health, as well as to prevent the occurrence of such outbreaks. National\nprogrammes for the eradication, control and monitoring of those diseases and\nzoonoses should therefore benefit from Union funding.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For organisational and\nefficiency reasons in respect of the handling of funding in the animal and\nplant health areas, it is appropriate to lay down rules on content, submission,\nevaluation and approval of national programmes, including those implemented in\nthe outermost regions of the Union referred to in Article 349 of the Treaty on\nthe Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU'). For the same reasons, deadlines\nfor reporting and filing of payment requests should also be laid down.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive\n2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into\nthe Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against\ntheir spread within the Community[12]\nrequires Member States to take certain emergency measures for the eradication\nof organisms harmful to plants or plant products ('pests'). The Union should make a financial contribution towards the eradication of those pests. A Union\nfinancial contribution should also be available under certain conditions for emergency\nmeasures aimed at containing the pests which have the most severe impact on the\n Union and which cannot be eradicated in certain zones and for prevention\nmeasures concerning those pests.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Emergency measures taken\nagainst pests should be eligible for Union co-financing if those measures have\nadded value for the entire Union. For this reason, a Union financial\ncontribution should be made available for pests listed in Directive 2000/29/EC\nas not known to occur in the Union. Where pests are known to occur in the\nUnion, only measures relating to the pests which have the most severe impacts\non the Union should be eligible for a Union financial contribution. Measures\nrelating to pests subject to Union emergency measures for their eradication\nshould also be eligible for a Union financial contribution.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to timely\ndetect the presence of certain pests. Surveys carried out by the Member States\nfor such presence are essential to ensure the immediate eradication of\noutbreaks of those pests. The surveys carried out by individual Member States\nare essential to protect the territory of all other Member States. The Union should contribute to the financing of those surveys.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The outermost regions of\nMember States experience difficulties caused by their remoteness and dependence\non a limited number of products. It is appropriate for the Union to grant a financial\ncontribution to Member States for programmes that they carry out for the\ncontrol of pests in those outermost regions in line with the objectives of\nRegulation (EU) No 228/2013[13]\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 March 2013 laying down\nspecific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union and\nrepealing Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 .\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Official controls carried\nout by the Member States are an essential tool to verify and monitor that\nrelevant Union requirements are being implemented, complied with and enforced.\nThe effectiveness and efficiency of official control systems is vital for\nmaintaining a high level of safety for humans, animals and plants along the\nfood chain whilst ensuring a high level of protection of the environment. A Union\nfinancial support should be made available for such control measures. In\nparticular, a financial contribution should be available to Union reference\nlaboratories in order to help them bear the costs arising from the\nimplementation of work programmes approved by the Commission. Moreover, since\nthe effectiveness of official controls also depends on the availability to the\ncontrol authorities of well trained staff possessing an appropriate knowledge\nof Union legislation, the Union should be able to contribute to their training\nand relevant exchange programmes organised by competent authorities.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The efficient management of\nofficial controls depends on a rapid exchange of data and information related\nto such controls. In addition, the proper and harmonised implementation of the\nrelevant rules depends on the setting of efficient systems involving Member State competent authorities. Therefore the establishment and operation of databases\nand computerised information management systems for those purposes should also\nbe eligible for financial contribution.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union should make\nfunding available for technical, scientific, coordination and communication\nactivities necessary to ensure the correct implementation of Union legislation\nand to ensure the adaptation of the legislation to scientific, technological\nand societal developments. Funding should also be made available for projects\naimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of official controls.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 3 of\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general\nbudget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002[14], any proposal submitted to the\nlegislative authority containing derogations from provisions of that Regulation\nhas to clearly indicate such derogations and to state the specific reasons\njustifying them. Therefore, given the specificities of some objectives covered\nby this Regulation and considering that the respective competent authorities of\nthe Member States are best placed to implement the activities associated with\nthose objectives, those authorities should be considered as identified\nbeneficiaries for the purposes of Article 128(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\n966/2012. It should therefore be possible to award grants to such authorities\nwithout previous publication of calls for proposals.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of derogation from Article\n86 and as an exception as referred to in Article 130 of Regulation (EU,\nEuratom) No 966/2012, the costs for the emergency measures covered by Articles\n7 and 17 of this Regulation should be eligible as from the date of notification\nof the occurrence of a disease or the presence of a pest by the Member State to\nthe Commission due to the urgent and unforeseeable nature of those measures.\nThe corresponding budgetary commitments and the payment of eligible expenditure\nshould be made by the Commission, after assessment of the payment applications\nsubmitted by the Member States, using, if appropriate and needed, the reserve\nfor crises in the agricultural sector.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is of the utmost\nimportance that such emergency measures are implemented immediately. It would\ntherefore be counterproductive to exclude from funding those costs incurred\nprior to the submission of the grant application, as this would encourage\nMember States to focus their immediate efforts on the preparation of a grant\napplication, instead of on the implementation of emergency measures.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the extent of the\nUnion legislation in force concerning the implementation of eradication and\nsurveillance measures and the technical limitations as regards other expertise\navailable, the implementation of the measures covered by this Regulation needs\nto be carried out for a major part by the Member States' competent authorities.\nIt is therefore necessary to cofinance the salary costs of the personnel of\nnational administrations in certain cases.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Programming allows\ncoordination and prioritisation and thus contributes to effective use of Union\nfinancial resources. The Commission should therefore be empowered to adopt work\nprogrammes for the implementation of certain measures provided for in this\nRegulation.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure responsible and\neffective use of Union financial resources, the Commission should be allowed to\ncheck that Union funding is effectively used for the implementation of eligible\nmeasures either by on-the-spot checks or by documentary checks.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The financial interests of\nthe Union should be protected throughout the expenditure cycle, including the\nprevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of\nfunds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers\nshould be conferred on the Commission with regard to the establishment and\namendment of the lists of animal diseases and zoonoses which qualify for Union funding, as well as the establishment of work programmes. When amending the list of\nanimal diseases qualifying for emergency measures funding, the Commission\nshould take into account the animal diseases which must be notified in\naccordance with Council Directive 82/894/EEC of 21 December 1982 on the\nnotification of animal diseases within the Community[15]. Those powers should be\nexercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and\ngeneral principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of\nthe Commission's exercise of implementing powers[16].\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The advisory procedure\nshould be used for the adoption of the initial lists of animal diseases and\nzoonoses which qualify for funding in the field of animal health, given that\nthose initial lists should merely contain, without any modifications, the\nanimal diseases and zoonoses which already qualify for such funding under Council\nDecision 2009/470/EC of 25 May 2009 on expenditure in the veterinary field[17].\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union legislation should be\nmanaged and implemented in such a way as to ensure that it delivers the\nintended benefits, in the light of experience. It is therefore appropriate for\nthe Commission to evaluate the functioning and effectiveness of this Regulation\nand to communicate the results to the other institutions.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Different committees assist\nthe Commission in the implementation of Union rules covered by this Regulation,\nin particular the Committees established by Council Decision 66/399/EEC of 14\nJune 1966 setting up a Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for\nAgriculture, Horticulture and Forestry[18],\nCouncil Decision 76/894/EEC of 23 November 1976 establishing a Standing\nCommittee on Plant Health[19],\nCouncil Directive 98/56/EC of 20 July 1998 on the marketing of propagating\nmaterial of ornamental plants[20],\nCouncil Directive 2008/90/EC of 29 September 2008 on the marketing of fruit\nplant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production[21] and Regulation (EC) No\n178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002\nlaying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing\nthe European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of\nfood safety[22].\nIt is appropriate to streamline the Committee procedure in this area and to\ncharge the Committee established by Article 58 of Regulation (EC) 178/2002 with\nthe task of assisting the Commission in the exercise of its implementing powers\nin respect of the expenditure incurred in the relevant areas and to adapt the name\nof that Committee in order to reflect its extended tasks.

There are also indirect impacts on stakeholders such as primary\nproducers (farmers, etc.), other operators and veterinarians but these are\nsecondary. This will be continued with the draft Regulation covering the period\n2014-2020.\nThe overall expected result is that, through the co-financing by the\nEU:\n- animal diseases and plant pests will be faster eradicated in case\nof outbreaks\n- the appearance of animal diseases and plant pests will be avoided\n- EU legislation related to food and feed safety will be applied in\nmore harmonised way all over the EU.\nFurthermore, the above will also contribute to a smoother\nfunctioning of the internal market and more fluent access to the markets of\nthird countries which may have a positive impact on employment in the EU.\nIndicators of results and impact \nObjective 1: Contribute to a high level of safety of food and food\nproduction systems and of other products which may affect the safety of food\nwhile improving the sustainability of food production\nThis objective will be measured through the reduction in the number\nof cases of diseases in humans in the Union and which are linked to food safety\nor zoonoses.\nObjective 2: Contribute to a higher animal health status in the Union and to support the improvement of the welfare of animals\nThis objective will be measured through the increase of the number\nof Member States or regions thereof free from animal diseases for which a\nfinancial contribution is granted and by a reduction of disease parameters,\nsuch as incidence, prevalence and number of outbreaks.\nObjective 3: Contribute to timely detection of pests and their\neradication where these have entered into the Union\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThis objective will be measured through:\n- the coverage of the Union territory by surveys for pests, in\nparticular for pests not known to occur in the Union territory and pests\nconsidered to be most dangerous for the Union territory; and\n- the time and success rate for the eradication of those pests.\nObjective 4: Contribute to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and\nreliability of official controls and other activities carried out in view of\nthe effective implementation of and compliance with the Union rules referred to\nin Article 1 of the draft Regulation\nThis objective will be measured through a favourable trend of the\noutcome of controls in particular areas of concern carried out and reported by\nCommission experts in the Member States.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term \nThe private sector is to be protected from seriously harmful impacts\nof diseases and pests and hence will contribute fostering growth and job\ncreation in the EU. The provisions of this regulation should support the policy\ngoals for each area, which aim to uphold good animal health, plant health,\nplant reproductive material health and official controls.\nThe Regulation will continue to support the implementation of EU\naction in the field of food safety policy from 2014 onwards. It builds on the results\nachieved through the existing legislation and on the accelerated impact\nassessment accompanying this proposal. \n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nIn accordance with the \u201cfield-to-table\u201d approach to food and feed\nsafety, this action aims at bringing improvements all along the food chain.\nThis sector is harmonised at EU level and considerable trade takes place\nbetween Member States. The EU food and drink industry is the largest\nmanufacturing sector in Europe with an annual turnover in 2009 of 954 billion\nEuros; it exports some 54 billion Euros of food and drink products to third\ncountries, contributes to a positive trade balance of around 10 billion Euros\nand employs around 4.2 million people. (Source: Confederation of the food and\ndrink industries of the EU). \nOutbreaks of serious animal and plant diseases may cause major\ndirect losses to agriculture and potentially enormous indirect losses to the\nEuropean economy. Such problems can rapidly spread between Member States and\ninvolve the entire EU market. The recent occurrence of Bluetongue in much of Europe, which caused substantial losses, is an important reminder of the unpredictability\nand severity of animal disease outbreaks.\nThe objective of the EU intervention is to minimise the impact on\nhuman and animal health and markets and to reduce risks all along the food\nchain through preventive actions and the management of crises.\nAn EU contribution is made towards national programmes aimed at\nimproving animal health or eradicating those diseases that affect people or\nwhose presence can cause major social, economic and political impacts.\nEradication, surveillance and monitoring programmes are necessary to reduce\nthis risk for public and/or animal health to an acceptable level. EU wide\nsurveillance is also carried out for diseases such as avian influenza and\ntransmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). \nFinancial contribution for emergency measures (emergency fund) is\navailable to assist Member States in dealing with animal disease crises and\nvaccine banks have been established and are kept stocked to maintain a supply\nof vaccines for emergency use. \nFunds are also provided to support any Member State which is the\nvictim of an emergence of organisms harmful to plants, especially in the face\nof increased trade between Member States and with other countries. This affects\nnot just the food industry but also industry in general because of the possible\nimpact of some plant harmful organisms on wood and wood packaging material e.g.\npallets. \nIn addition a network of European Union Reference Laboratories is\nfunded to ensure better preparedness and to provide scientific support at EU\nlevel to the Commission and the Member States. This contributes to the\nharmonisation of the diagnostic practices at EU level. The action also\ncomprises a training programme (BTSF \u2013 Better Training for Safer Food\nprogramme) for staff of competent authorities, both within and outside the EU\nto ensure the proper implementation of EU standards. \n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe problems of the current legal framework primarily concern the\nneed to amend that framework to the changed sectorial needs identified in the\nrespective reviews. Those needs should be reflected in the future legislation,\nirrespective of whether the provisions concerning expenditures are positioned\nin the sectorial acts or brought together in a single horizontal act.\nDriver 1: The current legal framework is too complex \nThe current lack of clarity in funding rates presents Member States\nwith a great deal of uncertainty when planning. Therefore, this regulation\nforesees three maximum rates: 50, 75 and 100%. The 100% funding rate is applied\nfor the purchase of vaccines and the eligible costs of the EU reference\nlaboratories; the 75 % rate would apply to eligible expenses for Member States\nwhose most recent gross national income per inhabitant is less than 90% of the\nUnion average; the 50% rate applies to the other eligible expenses; it is\nconsidered as the basic rate from 2014 onwards. \nIn addition, the provisions regarding the various financial\nprovisions are currently found in a number of different legislative\ninstruments. This issue will be solved by grouping these provisions in one\nsingle legal base. The proposed minimum level of 50 000 euro per grant will\ndefinitely simplify the budgetary management for the administrations in the Member States and the European institutions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nDriver 2: The existing financial management tools are not complete \nThe existing financial provisions do not set clear and consistent\nobjectives and indicators. \nThe definition of eligible measures and associated costs is unclear.\nA 2012 internal audit report recommended that they be clarified and simplified.\n\nAll of these factors contribute to a situation where the system is\nover-complex and error rates are too high. A recent survey of MSs\nrepresentatives found that the multiannual and annual programme planning\nframework is regarded as burdensome. The annual cycle of plan preparation,\nappraisal, approval, adoption and reporting is resource-intensive and involves\na high degree of year-on-year repetition.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nIt is crucially important that the proposal currently under\nconsideration also remains consistent with other EU policies. At a high level,\nthis means supporting the objectives of EU 2020 and the multiannual financial\nframework. Perhaps most importantly, it is crucial that the financial framework\nsupports the economic recovery through promotion of trade and other important\neconomic activity. In other areas, it will be important to ensure that feed and\nfood safety policy supports and complements, and does not overlap or undermine,\nother EU policies. This is particularly true in the areas of agriculture and trade.\nThe new proposals for the common agricultural policy support the same sorts of\ngeneral objectives as the current draft regulation in question, but different\nspecific objectives and via different means. It is also crucial that the draft\ncontinues to support European trade and is consistent with existing and future\ntrade rules. There is some consideration needed of marine policy, when the\nfinancial framework supports the prevention or eradication of diseases\naffecting aquaculture animals, for example. And it is important to be mindful\nof the objectives of environmental policies lastly, there are strong links\nbetween other policies such as public health, animal welfare, and others, which\nmust be co-ordinated with.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact \n\u00fe Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration \n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from 01/01/2014 to 31/12/2020 \n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 Financial impact from 2014 to 2020 (commitment appropriations) \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \nFollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged[32]\n\n\u00fe Centralised direct management by the Commission \n\u00feCentralised indirect management with the\ndelegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[33]\n\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\n\"Comments\" section. \nComments \nExecutive\nagency EAHC: In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 of 19\nDecember 2002 laying down the statute for Executive Agencies to be entrusted\nwith certain tasks in the management of Community programmes[34], the Commission has entrusted[35] the Executive Agency for\nHealth and Consumers with implementation tasks for the management of the Better\nTraining for Safer Food (BTSF) policy for 2007-2013.

More attention will be paid to the analysis of the presented veterinary\nand phytosanitary programmes; the 2013 veterinary programmes were for the first\ntime submitted to an external evaluation; it will be further developed in\ncoming years. Performance indicators are currently under development; they will\nbe useful for the evaluation of the programme's achievements.\nBy the end of 2018, an evaluation report shall be established by the\nCommission on the achievement of the objectives of the measures (at the level\nof results and impacts), the efficiency of the use of resources and its\nEuropean added value, in view of a decision on the renewal, modification or\nsuspension of the measures. The evaluation shall additionally address the scope\nfor simplification, the continued relevance of all objectives, as well as the\ncontribution of the measures to the Union priorities of smart, sustainable and\ninclusive growth. It shall take into account evaluation results on the\nlong-term impact of the predecessor measures.\nFurthermore, no later than mid-2022, an ex-post evaluation will be\ncarried out.\nThe Commission shall communicate the results of those evaluations,\naccompanied by its comments, to the European Parliament, the Council, the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThe majority of the funds is directed to the Member States.\nThe main elements of the implementation of the budget are the\nfollowing:\nBy means of implementing acts, common or separate annual work\nprogrammes will be adopted for the implementation of the financial contribution\nto official controls and other activities. The above annual work programmes\nshall set out the objectives pursued, the expected results, the method of\nimplementation and their total amount. They shall also contain a description of\nthe measures to be financed, an indication of the amount allocated to each\nmeasure and an indicative implementation timetable. They shall include for\ngrants the priorities, the essential evaluation criteria and the funding rate.\nFor the implementation of the eradication, survey and monitoring\nprogrammes in the animal and plant health area the Commission will by\n30 January each year and, following evaluation of the programmes\nsubmitted, approve the programmes subject to any condition where appropriate\nand decide on the amount of the grant. In the case of approval of multiannual\nprogrammes, budgetary commitments may be divided into annual instalments. If\nso, each year the Commission shall commit the annual instalments taking into\naccount the progress of the programmes, the estimated needs and the budget\navailable.\nFor the implementation of emergency measures in the in the animal\nand plant health area or where it is necessary to respond to unforeseeable\ndevelopments, the Commission shall adopt ad hoc financing decisions.\nOn top of that a number of service contracts will be attributed.\nThe main risks are the following: \n- as regards official controls, risk of poor implementation reducing\nthe effectiveness of the measures co-financed;\n- inefficient or non-economic use of funds for the eradication\nprogrammes and the emergency measures due to complexity of reimbursing actual\neligible costs coupled with limited possibilities to check eligible costs from\nthe desk.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control methods envisaged \nIn general, all financial transactions (commitments, payments,\nrecovery orders, etc.) and contracts/grant agreements related to the food and\nfeed expenditure policy are checked, authorised and signed by the sub-delegated\nauthorising officers in charge of the activity. Each sub-delegated authorising\nofficer is assisted by a decentralised financial cell which verifies and\ncompletes the files of the financial transactions and contracts/grant\nagreements before they are signed. Operational initiation and verification is\ncarried out by members of staff of the responsible Unit.\nIn addition, the central financial cell performs a second level\nex-ante desk verification, based on a sample of transactions. Furthermore, the\nDG\u00b4s centralised on-the-spot control team verifies on the site the eligibility\nof the costs claimed at beneficiary's level. DG SANCO is also making use of a specialised\ncompany in the organisation of ex post controls.\nGrants: Having regard to the above mentioned framework on the one\nhand and to the fact that the bulk of the beneficiaries of the EU grants are\npublic identities, the risk of irregularities can be considered as very\nlimited. Finalised granted projects will be subject to ex post controls. The\nstrategy of ex-post audit will be: (a) to combine the risk assessment and ad\nrandom selection in order to avoid a too rigid selection process, and (b) to\npay attention to operational aspects whenever possible during the on-the-spot\naudit.\nService contracts: DG SANCO concludes service contracts directly\nwith service providers. The contractors are selected on the basis of call for\ntender procedures, in full respect of the Financial Regulation. Contracts above\na certain ceiling are subject to in depth control by a DG SANCO public\nprocurement committee. DG SANCO uses the standard contracts proposed by the\nCommission which provides for the possibility to run ex post controls. However,\nas the amounts of the contracts are fixed, the risks of financial errors are\nreduced and the number of ex post controls on service contracts very limited.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\nand irregularities \nThe Commission shall take appropriate measures ensuring that, when\nactions financed under this Regulation are implemented, the financial interests\nof the European Union are protected by the application of preventive measures\nagainst fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks\nand, if irregularities are detected, by the recovery of the amounts wrongly\npaid and, where appropriate, by effective, proportional and deterrent\npenalties, in accordance with Article 325 of the Treaty on the Functioning of\nthe European Union, Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18\nDecember 1995 on the protection of the European Communities\u2019 financial\ninterests and Article 58 of the Financial Regulation. \nThe Commission or its representatives and the Court of Auditors\nshall have the power of audit, on the basis of documents and on-the-spot, over\nall grant beneficiaries, contractors and subcontractors who have received Union\nfunds. OLAF shall be authorised to carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections\non economic operators concerned directly or indirectly by such funding in\naccordance with the procedures laid down in Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No\n2185/96 of 11 November 1996 with a view to establishing that there has been\nfraud, corruption or any other illegal activity in connection with a grant\nagreement or decision or a contract concerning Union funding.\nWithout prejudice to the previous sub-paragraphs, decisions,\nagreements and contracts resulting from the implementation of the Regulation shall\nexpressly entitle the Commission, including OLAF, and the Court of Auditors to\nconduct such audits, on-the-spot checks and inspections.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL\nIMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of

will be met by staff from the DG who are already assigned to\nmanagement of the action and/or have been redeployed within the DG, together if\nnecessary with any additional allocation which may be
