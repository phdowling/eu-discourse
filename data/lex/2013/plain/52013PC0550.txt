In addition, business rules\r\nand other conditions should be prohibited if they prevent consumers and\r\nretailers from having accurate information on fees paid in relation to payment\r\ntransactions and thereby hinder the creation of a fully effective internal\r\nmarket. \nGeneral context\nThe regulatory and legislative framework\r\nfor retail payments in the EU has been developed over the past 12 years, with the\r\nadvent of the Euro acting as an accelerating factor. Regulation 2560/2001 on\r\nthe equivalence of charges for national and cross-border payments in Euros\r\nprompted further initiatives on the completion of an Internal Market in\r\npayments. \nThe regulatory and legislative framework is complemented by a number of investigations and decisions under\r\nEU competition law by the Commission over the past years in the field of retail\r\npayments. \nSecure, efficient, competitive and\r\ninnovative electronic payments are crucial for the internal market in all\r\nproducts and services, and this has an increasing impact as the world moves\r\nbeyond bricks-and-mortar trade towards e-commerce. In this context the achievement of an effectively functioning\r\ninternal market in the area of payment cards has been hindered by the\r\nwidespread application of certain restrictive business rules and practices.\r\nSuch rules and practices also lead to a lack of information on costs and\r\npricing of transactions to consumers and retailers that results in sub-optimal\r\nmarket outcomes including inefficient prices. \nOne of the key practices hindering the\r\nachievement of an integrated market reasons is the widespread use in 'four party' schemes, the most common type of card schemes, of so-called Multilateral Interchange Fees\r\n(MIFs). These are collectively agreed inter-bank fees usually between the acquiring payment service providers and the\r\nissuing payment service providers belonging to a certain scheme. Such interchange fees paid by acquiring payment\r\nservice providers form part of the fees they charge to merchants (the Merchant Service Charges or MSCs), which merchants in\r\nturn pass on to consumers. Thus, high Interchange Fees paid by merchants result\r\nin higher final prices for goods and services, which are paid by all consumers.\r\nCompetition between card schemes appears in practice to be largely aimed at\r\nconvincing as many issuing payment service providers as possible to issue their\r\ncards, which usually leads to higher rather than lower fees, in\r\ncontrast with the usual price disciplining effect of competition in a market\r\neconomy . \nAt present, no legislation regulating\r\ninterchange fees is in place in the EU, except indirectly in the case of\r\nDenmark for MSCs for face-to-face transactions. However,\r\nmany national competition authorities have on-going competition law enforcement\r\nproceedings, including in the UK, Germany and Italy. Also, a number of Member\r\nStates are in the process of adopting legislation, including in Poland, Hungary,\r\nthe UK and Italy. \nEffects\r\non consumers\nThe price increases caused by interchange\r\nfees are harmful to consumers, who tend to be unaware of the fees paid by\r\nmerchants for the payment instrument they use. At the same time a series of\r\nincentivising practices applied by issuing payment service providers (such as\r\ntravel vouchers, bonuses, rebates, charge backs, free insurances, etc.) steers\r\nconsumers towards the use of payment instruments generating high fees for\r\nissuing payment service providers. Scheme rules applied by payment card schemes\r\nand practices applied by payment service providers tend to keep merchants and\r\nconsumers ignorant about fee differences and reduce market transparency, for\r\ninstance by \u2018blending\u2019 fees or prohibiting merchants from choosing a cheeper\r\ncard brand on co-branded cards or steering consumers to the use of such cheeper\r\ncards. Even if merchants are aware of the different costs, the scheme rules\r\noften hinder them from acting to reduce the fees. Of\r\nparticular importance are so-called \u2018Honour All Cards\r\nRules\u2019 (HACRs) which require merchants to accept all products issued under the\r\nsame brand, even if the merchant fees for these cards can vary by a factor of\r\n3-4 within the same card category (i.e. credit / debit) or by a factor\r\nof up to 25 between card categories, such as premium credit card and low-cost\r\ndebit cards. The result of the collectively agreed fees and transparency\r\nreducing measures is that banks are not made to compete on this element of\r\ntheir fees, which leads to higher retail prices to consumers, including those\r\nwho do not pay with a card or who pay with low fee cards. In fact, the latter\r\nconsumers are subsidising the use by other often wealthier consumers of more\r\nexpensive means of payment through higher retail prices. In addition to limited\r\nchoice as regards payment service providers, reduced innovation and higher\r\nprices for payment services, the interchange fees also call into question the\r\nCommission's policy to promote and facilitate the use of electronic payments\r\nfor the benefit of consumers[1].\r\nFinally, the lack of choice as regards payment service providers, including on\r\na pan-European level, effectively prevents consumers from reaping all the\r\nbenefits from the internal market, particularly as far as e-commerce is\r\nconcerned.\nEffects on the internal market\nThere currently is a wide variety of\r\ninterchange fees applied within national and international payment card\r\nschemes, which gives rise to market fragmentation and prevents retailers and\r\nconsumers from enjoying the benefits of an internal market for goods and\r\nservices. Even considering only the international payment card schemes,\r\ninterchange fees differ up to a factor of 10, which gives rise to substantial\r\ncost differences between retailers in the respective countries. As a\r\nconsequence of the wide differences in fees between Member States, retailers\r\nalso have difficulty formulating an EU wide price strategy for their products\r\nand services, both on-line and off line, to the detriment of consumers.\r\nRetailers cannot overcome the fee differences by making use of card acceptance\r\nservices offered by banks in other Member States; specific rules applied by the\r\npayment schemes prescribe the application of the interchange fee of the 'Point\r\nof Sale' (country of the retailer) for each payment transaction. This prevents acquiring\r\nbanks from successfully offering their services on a cross border basis and retailers\r\nfrom reducing their payment costs to the benefit of consumers. \nEffects on market entry\nInterchange fees also restrict market entry\r\nas their revenues for issuing payment service providers function as a minimum\r\nthreshold to convince issuing payment service providers to issue payment cards\r\nor other payment instruments, such as online and mobile\r\npayment solutions, offered by new entrants. Also,\r\nmarket entry for pan-European players remains difficult, as domestic interchange\r\nfees in EU Member States vary widely and new entrants would have to offer\r\ninterchange fees at least comparable to those prevailing in each market they\r\nwant to enter. This has an impact on the viability of their business model i.a.\r\naffecting potential economies of scale and scope. This also explains why in a\r\nnumber of Member States, national (normally cheaper) card schemes have tended\r\nto disappear. The entry barriers interchange fees thus created for online and mobile payment solutions also result in less innovation.\nAs said, no legislation regulating\r\ninterchange fees is currently in place in the EU, except indirectly in the case\r\nof Denmark. However, many national competition authorities have on-going competition\r\nlaw enforcement proceedings. Also, a number of Member States are in the process\r\nof adopting legislation. The different time paths of the national proceedings\r\nand the intended legislation risk leading to an even more fragmented market. \nThe present regulation therefore proposes\r\nto create common rules for interchange fees in the European Union by introducing\r\nmaximum fee levels for transactions with payment cards that are widely used by\r\nconsumers and thereby difficult to refuse or surcharge by retailers. This will\r\ncreate a level playing field which will take away the market fragmentation\r\ncurrently existing as a consequence of diverging fees. It will also allow for\r\nthe successful market entry of pan-European newcomers and for innovation based\r\non an infrastructure existing of a 'level playing field'. Consumers and\r\nretailers will thus benefit from a wider choice of payment service providers\r\n(new as well as incumbent), including on a pan-European level. The regulation\r\nwill in addition propose transparency measures to allow retailers and consumers\r\nto make better informed choices of payment instruments. \nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nThis initiative will complement the\r\nexisting legal framework for payment services within the EU, in particular with\r\nrespect to the completion of an Internal Market in payments, and migration to\r\npan-European payment instruments.\nDirective 2007/64/EC of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services\r\nin the internal market (the so called 'Payment Services Directive' or PSD)[2] aims to establish standardised conditions and rights for payment\r\nservices offered in the market for the benefit of consumers and companies\r\nacross the Union. This Directive, which is under revision at the same time the present\r\nproposal is prepared, creates the general framework for payments in the EU. It\r\nis complemented by several Regulations such as Regulation (EC) N\u00b0924/2009 on\r\ncross-border payments or Regulaton (EC) N\u00b0260/2012 which\r\nsets migration deadlines for the transition of all credit transfers and direct\r\ndebits in euros in the EU from national schemes to pan-European schemes. Regulation (EC) N\u00b0 260/2012 also clarifies that\r\nno Multilateral Interchange Fees can be charged for each direct debit\r\ntransactions.\nIn addition to the legislative framework, over\r\nthe last 20 years, the European Commission and national competition authorities\r\nhave conducted a number of antitrust proceedings addressing\r\nanti-competitive practices in the card payment market. The General Court judgment\r\nof May 2012[3]\r\nconfirmed the Commission's finding in its MasterCard Decision of December 2007[4]\r\nthat MIFs restrict competition as they inflate the cost of card acceptance by\r\nmerchants without leading to benefits for consumers. The Court rejected the argument\r\nthat MIFs were indispensable for the functioning of a payment card system. To address the competition concerns, the Commission has accepted\r\ncommitments by Visa and MasterCard to charge lower MIFs for cross-border (and\r\nsome domestic) transactions: the MasterCard undertakings of 2009 (caps for cross-border consumer MIFs to 0.2% for debit cards\r\nand 0.3% for credit cards and changes to the rules it imposes on retailers\r\nthrough the acquiring payment service providers), and the Visa Europe\r\ncommitments of 2010 (along the lines of those of MasterCard, with caps limited\r\nto debit but also covering domestic MIFs when these are fixed by Visa Europe\r\nitself and not the national banks). In 2013, Visa Europe also offered\r\ncommitments for credit card transactions cross-border regarding certain countries\r\nwhere these charges are set by Visa Europe, and on cross border acquiring\r\nrules. Competition proceedings are on-going in a number of other Member States,\r\nincluding in Poland, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, the UK, Germany and France. The\r\nFrench Competition Authority for instance made binding the commitments from the\r\nGroupement des Cartes Bancaires \u2013 the domestic card scheme \u2013 on 7 July\r\n2011 to reduce its interchange fees to levels equivalent to the ones agreed by\r\nMasterCard and Visa for their cross-border transactions.\nWhile no legislation is in place on\r\ninterchange fees in the EU, except indirectly in Denmark[5], a number of Member States are in the process of adopting legislation, including in Poland, Hungary, the UK and Italy. In Poland,\r\nthe Parliament is considering draft legislation regulating interchange fees, with MIFs caps progressively falling to 0,5% by the start of 2016,\r\nabolishing the Honour All Cards Rule and allowing surcharging (for credit cards\r\nonly). In Hungary, a legislative proposal is under\r\ndiscussion that would cap domestic credit and debit interchange fees at their\r\nrespective cross border level, with the Hungarian Central Bank in charge of\r\ncalculating these fees. In Italy, a draft Decree by the Ministry of Economy and\r\nFinance has been published for consultation in December 2012, focusing on\r\nlimits to blending, comparability of interchange fees and merchant service\r\ncharges, as merchant service charges should take into account the volume of\r\ntransactions and should be lower for low value payments. In the UK, the Government is proposing to bring payment systems under economic\r\nregulation, establishing a new competition-focused, utility-style regulator for\r\nretail payment systems[6].\nConsistency with the other policies and objectives\r\nof the Union\nThe objectives of the proposal are\r\nconsistent with the policies and objectives pursued by the Union. First, they\r\nwill improve the functioning of the internal market for payment services and\r\nmore broadly for all goods and services to the benefit of European consumers\r\nand companies. Second, they broadly support other Union policies, in particular\r\ncompetition policy (by establishing equal obligations, rights and opportunities\r\nfor all market players and facilitating cross-border provision of payment\r\nservices, thus increasing the level of competition). The impact assessment\r\naccompanying this proposal concluded that the proposed measures would promote market integration for consumers and merchants, favour\r\npan-European market entry and result in more legal certainty on business models\r\nfor existing card schemes and new entrants,. They would\r\nalso address the threat of 'exporting' models based on anti-competitive\r\npractices to new, innovative payment services. \nIn spite of the General Court judgement confirming\r\nthe Commission\u2019s assessment that MIFs as applied within the MasterCard system\r\nrestricted competition and did not lead to efficiencies outweighing their harm\r\nto merchants and consumers, international and national card schemes operating\r\nin the EU currently do not seem willing pro-actively to adjust their practices\r\nto comply with the European and national competition rules. Although National\r\nCompetition Authorities, in close cooperation with the Commission, are\r\naddressing this situation, competition enforcement according to different timelines\r\nand procedures may not lead to sufficiently comprehensive and timely results to\r\nunlock the market integration and innovation that are necessary to ensure the\r\ncompetitiveness of the European payments market at a global level. Taking into\r\naccount the EU competition rules and the Commission\u2019s experience in competition\r\ncases in payments, the present proposal therefore aims at providing legal\r\nclarity to ensure effective integration and competition,\r\nthereby improving economic welfare for all relevant stakeholders and in\r\nparticular consumers. By facilitating economic transactions within the Union,\r\nthis will also contribute to the attainment of the wider objectives of the EU\r\n2020 strategy.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nConsultation methods, main sectors\r\ntargeted and general profile of respondents\nOn 11 January 2012, The European Commission\r\npublished a Green Paper 'Towards an integrated European market for cards,\r\ninterent and mobile payments'[7] which was followed by a public consultation. The Commission received\r\nmore than 300 replies to its public consultation. The comprehensive feedback by\r\nstakeholders[8] provided relevant information on some recent new developments and\r\non possible requirements for changes to the existing payments framework. \nA public hearing took place on 4 May 2012\r\nand was attended by some 350 interested stakeholders. \nOn 20 November 2012 the European Parliament adopted a resolution\r\n'Towards an integrated European market for card, internet and mobile\r\npayments\u2019[9]\r\nwhich is a report on the Green Paper. \nSummary of responses and how they\r\nhave been taken into account\nThe consultation process has allowed the\r\nidentification of some key messages related to the scope of this Regulation. Stakeholders\r\nfrom all categories consistently agreed that there was a need to provide further\r\nlegal clarity on multilateral interchange fees (MIFs). This was seen by payment\r\nservice providers as particularly relevant in view of the on-going competition\r\ncases launched at European and national level. Secondly, merchants in\r\nparticular but also stakeholders from other categories pointed to obstacles for\r\ncross border acquiring, to be remedied for a genuine Single Market for payment\r\nservices to emerge. There was also a high level of interest in discussing\r\nbusiness rules, although views tended to be divided along the stakeholder\r\ncategories. \nPayment service providers and card schemes\r\nconsidered that the fact that MIFs differ substantially from one country to\r\nanother and for cross-border payments under the same card scheme were not\r\nproblematic and did not in their view hinder market integration. On the other\r\nside, merchants, consumer organisations and some non-bank payment service\r\nproviders considered that such differences are not justified and that the same\r\nMIFs should apply for national and cross-border transactions, and across Member\r\nStates. Public authorities considered that MIFs should be harmonised to achieve\r\nan integrated market. Payment service providers seemed opposed to a regulatory\r\ninitiative on interchange fees claiming that it would lead to higher cardholder\r\nfees, and that retailers would not pass on benefits to consumers. On the other\r\nside, retailers took the view that MIFs result in inverse competition favouring\r\nthe most expensive means of payment and raise barriers to market entry, whilst\r\ncreating a risk of spill-over effect from cards to mobile and internet\r\npayments. Most consumer organisations supported the merchants\u2019 analysis of the\r\nnegative impact of MIFs on competition and consumers welfare but expressed\r\nconcerns that reducing MIFs could lead to higher card fees and other consumer\r\ncharges. Competition authorities supported the need for action to lower MIFs,\r\nin particular for mature four-party schemes. Other public authorities were\r\ndivided.\nAs regards cross-border acquiring, most\r\nschemes and payment service providers saw the need for harmonisation of local\r\nstandards and rules, whilst merchants and consumers concurred on the existence\r\nof many local obstacles to cross-border acquiring. Contrary to payment service\r\nproviders and schemes, merchants favoured regulatory solutions to\r\nself-regulated standardisation. Schemes and payment service providers favoured\r\nthe MIF of the country where the sale is made to apply whilst most merchants\r\nand non-bank PSPs favoured a common MIF to apply across the internal market.\r\nThe need for mandatory prior authorisation for cross-border acquiring was\r\nfavoured by payment service providers and incumbent card schemes only. \nOn business rules, there was no consensus\r\non the benefits and the need to regulate steering and the Honour All Cards Rule\r\n(HACR) which obliges merchants to accept all cards within the same brand if\r\nthey accept one category of cards in this brand. Most schemes and payment\r\nservice providers were in favour of the status quo whilst merchants, consumers,\r\ncompetition authorities and most public authorities were in favour of allowing\r\nmerchants to steer consumers towards the use of cheaper means of payment\r\nthrough regulation \u2013 although consumers were against surcharging. An abolition\r\nof the HACR was rejected by payment service providers and schemes but supported\r\n\u2013 through regulation \u2013 by other stakeholders as enabling the merchant to accept\r\nonly cheaper means of payment and having a positive impact on competition, with\r\nconsumers striking a more cautious note. A ban on the blending of merchant\r\nservices charges towards retailers was supported by most stakeholders \u2013 with payment\r\nservice providers and schemes of the opinion that unblending was already\r\nimplemented after the MasterCard Undertakings and Visa Commitments.\nA detailed overview of stakeholder and\r\nMember States views on interchange fees can be found in the Feedback Report to\r\nthe public consultation on the Green Paper[10].\r\n\nThe European Parliament in its own-initiative\r\nreport on the Green Paper acknowledged the objectives and integration hurdles\r\nidentified in the Green Paper and called for legislative action in a number of\r\nareas concerning card payments, while suggesting a more cautious approach\r\nregarding internet and mobile payments due to the lesser maturity of those\r\nmarkets. Moreover, the Parliament took a firm position\r\nin favour of providing clarity on interchange fees to market participants and\r\nexpressed itself in favour of a gradual approach\r\nleading to a ban on interchange fees through regulation.\nImpact assessment\nThe Commission carried out an impact\r\nassessment listed in the Work Programme. This impact\r\nassessment has been prepared in consultation with the ECB. The impact assesment\r\nadressed at the same time options for revision of the Payment Service Directive\r\nand for regulating Multilateral\r\nInterchange Fees.\nThe impact assessment discusses the issue\r\nof ineffective competition in card payment and\r\ncard-based payment markets, resulting in sub-optimal market outcomes and\r\nrelatively high fees which are being passed on to merchants and in turn to\r\nconsumers. Limited market integration, reduced possibilities for new pan-European\r\nplayers to enter the market, disappearance of national (in general cheaper)\r\ncard schemes and limited innovation are also\r\nhighlighted in this context. Interchange Fees are identified as an important\r\nexplanatory factor behind these developments. The widely\r\ndiverging levels of Interchange Fees between Member States also constitute an\r\nobstacle for market integration. These effects are\r\nreinforced by a number of business rules, which impact transparency, the\r\nability of retailers to choose an acquirer in another Member State\r\n('cross-border acquiring'), and the ability of retailers to steer their\r\ncustomers towards more efficient means of payment or to refuse expensive cards\r\n(the HACR).\nThe impact assessment considers six\r\nscenarios for interchange fees: (i) No action from the Commission, (ii) Regulating\r\ncross-border acquiring and the level of interchange fees for cross-border\r\ntransactions, (iii) Mandating Member States to set domestic IFs on the basis of\r\na common methodology, (iv) Regulating a common, EU-wide maximum level for\r\ninterchange fees (a) whether the maximum IF cap \u2013 of a different level for\r\ndebit and for credit cards- covers both debit and credit cards or just debit\r\ncards and (b) whether the IFs for debit card transactions are to be forbidden\r\naltogether or just reduced to a low level, (v) Whether or not to exempt (normally\r\nmore expensive) commercial cards and cards issued by three party schemes from\r\nthe regulation of interchange fees and (vi) regulating\r\nMerchant Service Charges i.e. regulating the fees\r\npaid by the retailer to its acquiring bank \nThe 0.2% and 0.3% caps examined under the\r\nscenarios (ii) and (iv) for debit and credit card transactions respectively. These levels are based on the so-called 'Merchant Indifference Test'\r\ndeveloped in economic literature, which identifies the fee level a merchant\r\nwould be willing to pay if he were to compare the cost of the customer\u2019s use of\r\na payment card with those of non-card (cash) payments (taking into account the\r\nfee for service paid to acquiring banks, i.e. the merchant service charge). It\r\nthereby stimulates the use of efficient payment instruments through a promotion\r\nof those cards that provide higher transactional benefits, while at the same\r\ntime preventing disproportionate merchant fees, which would impose hidden costs\r\non other consumers. Excessive merchant fees might otherwise arise due to the collective\r\ninterchange fee arrangements, as merchants are reluctant to turn down costly\r\npayment instruments for fear of losing business. They\r\nalso take into account the levels proposed by schemes (Visa Europe, MasterCard,\r\nGroupement Cartes Bancaires) in competition proceedings and accepted by\r\nthe competition authorities as not requiring further\r\naction\nThe assessment concludes that the most\r\nbeneficial option appears to be a combination of: \n\u00b7              \r\na series of measures to enhance effective market\r\nfunctioning including the limitation of the HACR and\r\nallowing merchants to determine the choice of card brand at the point of sale\r\nfor all cards and card-based transactions based on four party\r\nscheme models; and\n\u00b7              \r\ncapping the level of interchange fees for\r\ncross-border transactions with consumer debit and\r\ncredit cards (in the first stage) and, in a second\r\nstage, capping the level of interchange fees also for\r\ndomestic transactions with consumer credit cards and consumer debit cards. \nThe impact assessment and its annex also\r\nprovide a detailed explanation of other measures proposed in the Regulation to\r\nensure market transparency and effective market functioning, including the\r\nabolition of no-steering measures, allowing card identification, co-badging,\r\nthe obligation to provide invoices to payees by their payment service providers,\r\nand imposing the unblending of fees. \nThese general transparency measures\r\nproposed in the Regulation should lead to a more effective market for all\r\npayment cards and card-based transactions based on four party (card) scheme models.\nHowever, since certain categories of cards\r\nhave become so widely used by consumers that merchants find themselves\r\ngenerally in a position that they cannot refuse such cards or discourage\r\nconsumers from using them without the fear of \u2018losing business\u2019, further\r\nmeasures are necessary to ensure an integrated market, effective market\r\nfunctioning and the removal of anti-competitive business practices in these\r\nareas. This applies with respect to consumer debit and credit cards.\nImportantly, in a first phase, allowing\r\nmerchants to choose an acquirer outside their own Member State ('cross-border\r\nacquiring') and regulating the level of cross border interchange fees would\r\nprovide legal clarity. Although its impact could be limited to large merchants,\r\nit would be conducive to market integration, and could, similarly to the\r\nequivalent provision in the SEPA End Date Regulation, have a disciplining and converging\r\nimpact on the level of interchange fees applying in a purely domestic context. \nHowever, in the longer term also smaller\r\nretailers should be able to benefit directly from measures leading to more\r\nefficient interchange fees and a level playing field for payment service providers. After a\r\ntransitional period, the regulation of interchange fees for consumer cards\r\nshould therefore be extended to cover also domestic interchange fees. Currently\r\nin eight EU Member States no or very low interchange fees apply to debit\r\ncard transactions with no appreciable negative effects on card issuing and card\r\nusage; on the contrary, these tend to be the Member States with the highest\r\ncard issuing and usage. In accordance with trends over the last ten years it is\r\nto be expected that debit card issuing and use will continue to increase in the\r\ncoming years so that after the transitional period provided for in the\r\nRegulation debit cards can be regarded as \u2018omnipresent\u2019 in the EU and there\r\nwill no longer be a justification to incentivise card issuing and card usage\r\nthrough fees passed from retailers to issuing payment service providers.\r\nAlready now it is very rare to open a payment account\r\nand not have a card, which in itself entails significant cost savings for payment\r\nservice providers. In addition, the proposal for a Directive[11] on inter alia access to\r\npayment account with basic features proposes that Member States shall ensure\r\nthat a payment account with basic features includes payment transactions\r\n(including online payments) through a payment card. For\r\nsmaller retailers to benefit directly from measures\r\nleading to more efficient interchange fees and a level playing field for payment service providers it would be\r\nnecessary also to regulate domestic consumer card fees.\r\nIn order to avoid discrimination between small and\r\nlarge retailers, who can benefit most easily from cross border acquiring, it is\r\nproposed to extend the cap proposed for cross-border transactions during\r\nthe first phase also to domestic credit card transactions in the second\r\nphase. The Commission considers however that the maturity of markets in the EEA,\r\nin particular as regards debit cards issuance and usage needs to be further\r\ninvestigated and the absence of a need for charging interchange fees to\r\nincentivise these must be ascertained. In the meantime, as explained above,\r\ncaps of 0.2% and 0.3% for debit and credit card transactions respectively would\r\napply.\nUnder the capping of interchange fees, all\r\nin all, retailers would benefit from lower fees, resulting in savings a portion\r\nof which would be passed on to consumers. Consumers already pay through the\r\nincorporation of Interchange Fees (via the MSC) in the retail prices, and banks\r\nare less likely to pass on the benefits of the Interchange Fees to their\r\naccount holders than merchants to their clients, given the lower level of\r\ncompetition in the banking sector and the current lack of consumer mobility in\r\nthe field of retail banking. Hence the pass-through by merchants should be\r\ngreater in any case than the pass-through by banks. In\r\nAustralia, after the intervention, 0.67 AUD reduction per purchase and 77.19\r\nAUD reduction per account per year have been estimated. The impact may however vary from one retail sector to another, the size of the merchant, its use of payment instruments, and the\r\n'basket of purchases'. It will always be difficult to associate the variation\r\nof a specific economic factor to the one of a specific price for a product or\r\nservice in a given retail shop.\nThis does not mean however that costs currently\r\nbearing on retailers would automatically be transferred to consumers by their\r\nbanks. Payment systems are inherently complex: the bank of the cardholder\r\ninteracts with the cardholder, the bank of the merchant interacts with the\r\nmerchant, and both in principle face competition with other banks and different\r\nmarket circumstances in their behaviour vis-\u00e0-vis their respective\r\nconsumers. Hence capping interchange fees would be\r\nexpected to have a positive effect on card acceptance, which can, on the basis\r\nof scale effects, also positively influence card issuing. A decrease of high interchange fees in most countries generally\r\nseems to be associated with a higher acceptance of cards, and it seems that in\r\ncountries with low interchange fees cards usage is higher. Denmark has one of\r\nthe highest card usage rates in the EU at 216 transactions per capita with a\r\nzero-Interchange Fee debit scheme. This is also true of international schemes:\r\nin Switzerland Maestro has no interchange fee and is the main debit card\r\nsystem. In the Netherlands, there is high and increasing card usage and\r\nacceptance, replacing cash. Both Denmark and the Netherlands are characterised\r\nby low bank account fees as compared to countries with higher Interchange Fees\r\n(e.g. France even after competition enforcement, Spain). In Spain, card use\r\nincreased after the intervention, with the average transaction value for card\r\npayments decreasing by 15% from 2005 to 2010. In parallel, card transactions\r\nvolume and value increased, according to official figures from the Bank of\r\nSpain[12].\nAs shown above, domestic schemes with no\r\ninterchange fees are also characterised with the highest levels of card usage\r\n(ECB data), with the UK and Sweden also having relatively low interchange fees.\r\n\nThe overall impact of interchange fee decreases\r\non issuing and acquiring payment service providers revenues is difficult to\r\nestimate, as increases in the volume of card transactions (through higher\r\nacceptance) and the savings to PSPs on cash handling could at least partly\r\ncompensate the losses due to the cap on interchange fees. Another costs saving\r\nmay result from fewer ATM cash withdrawals and more limited Interchange Fee\r\namounts they have normally to pay to ATM acquiring banks. Hence it is not\r\nobvious that issuing bank revenues decrease as a result. In terms of viability,\r\na debit card scheme without any IF seems to be perfectly viable from a\r\ncommercial perspective without raising the costs of current accounts for\r\nconsumers. Denmark for example has a zero-IF on its domestic debit scheme while\r\nan average account holder pays current account fees well below the EU average.\r\nSimilarly, in Switzerland the main debit card network is Maestro (part of\r\nMasterCard) which has no MIF. \nIn fact, there is no automatic linkage\r\nbetween decrease of Interchange Fees and increase of card annual fees. Card\r\nfees appear to be more related, for example, to the level of competition in\r\nretail banking. In the US banks tried to increase cardholder fees after IF\r\nregulation but had to back down due to consumers' revolt. In Switzerland there\r\nwas a decrease in cardholder fees in parallel with the decrease in Interchange Fees\r\n.In Australia, cardholder fees were increasing fast before caps on interchange\r\nfees were introduced and after the reforms, the growth of cardholder fees slowed\r\ndown (between 1997 and 2002: credit cards +218% and between 2003 and 2008:\r\n+122%). In Spain, since the intervention, average annual fees increased each\r\nyear by 6.18\u20ac for debit cards, and 11.45\u20ac for credit cards. However, the banks'\r\ncard portfolio increased with credit card growth significantly higher than\r\ndebit, in spite of the economic crisis. Other trends may perhaps suggest that competition\r\nin the Spanish banking sector is relatively limited: for instance fees for\r\nmaintaining current accounts doubled from 2007 to 2012, fees for overdrafts\r\nincreased. Increases in retail banking fees seem widespread in in Spain without\r\na relation with interchange fees. \nThere is anecdotal evidence of price\r\ndecreases happening in the USA, one year after the MIF regulation was\r\nintroduced. In addition, from evidence in Australia, it seems that retailers\r\nwould benefit integrally (100%) from lower IFs \u2013 as acquiring markets tend to\r\nbe more competitive than issuing markets, whilst the potential increase in\r\ncardholder fees is limited to 30-40% of the amount of the IF decrease. In addition after interchange fees are capped and transparency\r\nmeasures introduced, consumers using low cost means of payment will no longer\r\n'subsidise' the (often wealthier) ones using more expensive means of payment as\r\nmerchants cannot steer consumers, especially for the 'must use' cards. \nAs competition would play its role again, consumers\r\nand retailers would benefit from new entry in the payments market. Even if cardholder fees increase \u2013 which is not a given as the\r\nimpact of capping interchange fees on banking revenues is likely to be mixed -\r\nconsumers are still likely to benefit from lower interchange fees through lower\r\nretail prices, even if retailers do not pass through 100% of the savings, and\r\nfrom new entry in the payment market. It has also to be considered that\r\nconsumers are very likely to benefit from the services offered by new market\r\nentrants. A real-life example of this, for interchange fees below 0.2%, is the\r\nNetherlands, where the cheap online payment solution (Ideal) was developed\r\nlargely because the low interchange fees prevailing there encouraged bank to\r\ninnovate. In consequence, Dutch consumers do not have to pay high credit card\r\nsubscription fees in order to shop online.\nCommercial cards and cards issued by three\r\nparty schemes, even though they tend to be more expensive, would not be covered\r\n\u2013 as proposed under option v - under the various caps proposed for consumer\r\ncards as they have limited market shares in the EU and different fee structures\r\nand this is not expected to change in the future. However, the measures\r\nproposed for consumer card transactions would be applied to such schemes to the\r\nextent that they issue such cards and make use of licenced payment service providers in a way that\r\ncauses their scheme to effectively function in a similar way as a four party\r\nscheme. In addition, the transparency enhancing measures would apply to such\r\nschemes under all conditions.\nRegulating merchant service charges as\r\nunder option vi would imply covering not only interchange fees but also the other\r\nfees imposed on merchants. This would amount to de facto controlling\r\nprices for merchants, and to retail price regulation. By contrast, capping inter change fees would mean regulating wholesale prices to align\r\nthem with the analysis in competition cases to achieve an internal market, as interchange\r\nfess are not final prices to retailers and even less to consumers.\nTransparency and steering measures would\r\nremain key to prevent heavy promotion of cards with unregulated Interchange Fees.\r\nAnti-circumvention measures would also need to be\r\nincluded. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal is divided into two main parts.\r\n\nThe first part introduces rules on\r\ninterchange fees. With regard to such fees the proposal\r\ncreates a 'regulated' and a 'non-regulated' area. The regulated area consists\r\nof all card transactions that are widely used by consumers and therefore\r\ndifficult to refuse by retailers, i.e. consumer debit and credit card, and card\r\nbased payment transactions. The non-regulated area consists of all payment card\r\ntransactions and card based payment transactions based on those that\r\nfall outside the regulated area including so called commercial cards or cards\r\nissued by three party schemes.\nIn the 'regulated area', during a\r\ntransition period of two years following the publication of the Regulation, maximum levels of interchange fees are imposed for cross-border\r\ntransactions (where the card holder uses their card in another Member State) or\r\ncross-border acquired transactions (where the merchant uses an acquiring PSP in\r\nanother Member State) only. \nAlthough the Impact Assessment identified a\r\nban on interchange fees for debit cards as part of the most beneficial option,\r\nthe Commission considers that the maturity of markets in the EEA, in particular\r\nas regards debit cards issuance and usage needs to be further investigated and\r\nthe absence of a need for charging interchange fees to incentivise these must\r\nbe ascertained before interchange fees for debit cards are entirely abolished.\r\nIt is therefore proposed that after the transitional phase of only liberalising\r\nand regulating cross border acquiring, the same maximum fees that apply to\r\ncross border acquired transactions will also apply to domestic transactions.\r\nAfter two years following the complete entry into force of the legislation, the\r\nCommission will present to the European Parliament and to the Council a report\r\non its application, assessing in particular the appropriateness of the level of\r\ninterchange fee, taking into account the use and cost of the various means of\r\npayments and the level of entry of new players and new technology on the\r\nmarket. \nAfter the transitional period all (cross\r\nborder and domestic) 'consumer' debit card\r\ntransaction and card-based payment transaction based on such a\r\ntransaction will have a maximum interchange fee of 0,20% and all (cross\r\nborder and domestic) consumer credit card transactions and card\r\nbased payment transactions based on those will have a maximum interchange\r\nfee of 0.30%. These caps, since they have been accepted by competition authorities as not requiring further action, appear as\r\nreasonable benchmarks that have already been\r\nimplemented without calling into question the operation of international card schemes and payment service, providers,\r\nand retailers and consumers' welfare while they also\r\nprovide legal certainty.\nThe second part of the regulation reflects\r\nrules regarding business rules that will be applicable to all categories\r\nof card transactions and card-based payment\r\ntransactions based on those. As\r\nof the entry into force of the regulation, for instance:\n\u00b7              \r\nThe application of the 'Honour All Cards Rule'\r\nwill be limited. No discrimination will be nonetheless allowed on the basis of\r\nthe issuing bank or the provenance of the card holder and between the cards\r\ncarrying the same interchange fee level.\n\u00b7              \r\nthe application of any rule preventing or\r\nlimiting merchants from steering customers to more efficient payments instruments\r\n('no steering rules') will be prohibited.\n\u00b7              \r\nacquiring Payment Service Providers will provide\r\nat least monthly statements of fees to merchants, in which the fees paid by the\r\nmerchant over the relevant month concerning each category of cards and each\r\nindividual brand for when the acquirer provides acquiring services is\r\nspecified; \n\u00b7              \r\nthe application of any rule withholding\r\nmerchants from disclosing to their customers fees they pay to payment services\r\nacquirers will be prohibited.\nThe Impact Assessment has been modified\r\nfollowing the Impact Assessment Board meeting of 20 March 2013. Notable changes\r\ninclude the provision of supplementary information on the card market, its\r\nfunctioning and on the EU case law related to interchange fees, together with a\r\nsummary of the economic litteraure related to interchange fees. The possible impact of imposing maximum interchange fees on cardholder\r\nfees, overall consumers' welfare and bank revenues was presented more\r\nprominently, to streamline the presentation of impacts of\r\nthe most important options in the main text. The interdependencies between\r\ndifferent options and packages was better explained, together with the rationale for an all-inclusive package including interchange fees, substantiating the reasons for regulating interchange fees through\r\nlegislation. \nLegal basis\nArticle 114(1) of the Treaty on the\r\nfunctioning of the EU.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe subsidiarity principle applies insofar\r\nas the proposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the Union.\nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\r\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States for the following reason(s):\nBy its nature an integrated payments\r\nmarket, based on networks that reach beyond national borders, requires a\r\nUnion-wide approach as the applicable principles, rules, processes and standards\r\nhave to be consistent across all Member States in order to achieve legal\r\ncertainty and a level playing field for all market participants. The\r\nalternative to a Union-wide approach would be a system of national regulatory\r\nand competition enforcement actions, which would be less effective than EU\r\naction and with greater complexity and higher costs than legislation at\r\nEuropean level. A possible intervention at EU level therefore complies with the\r\nsubsidiarity principle. Such an approach supports the Single Euro Payments Area\r\n(SEPA) and is consistent with the Digital Agenda, in particular the creation of\r\na Digital Single Market. It promotes technological innovation and contributes\r\nto growth and jobs, in particular in the areas of e- and m-commerce.\nMoreover, in view of the cross-border\r\nnature of payments markets, any measure taken by public authorities seeking to\r\nreduce or modify the level of wholesale fees (interchange fees) in one Member\r\nState alone would disrupt the smooth functioning of the Community wide payment\r\nmarket and would not be conducive to market integration as it would not result\r\nin a level playing field across the EU. This would be the case for instance of\r\ndifferent national measures aimed at regulating interchange fees or capping\r\nthem, as currently foreseen in several Member States.\nThe proposal therefore complies with the\r\nsubsidiarity principle.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe proposal does not go beyond what is strictly\r\nnecessary to achieve its objectives, namely to help develop an EU-wide market\r\nfor payments, which will enable consumers, retailers and other undertakings to\r\nenjoy the full benefits of the EU internal market including e-commerce. These enhanced possibilities of entry by pan-European players, more innovation,\r\nand increased ability for national (in general cheaper) card schemes together\r\nwith more limited cash use provide opportunities for retailers and payment\r\nservice providers, regardless of whether these are banks or new market entrants.\r\nEffective competition in card payment and card-based payment markets will result\r\nin efficient market outcomes, wider choice of payment service providers,\r\nincluding pan-European ones and innovative players, and in lower costs to\r\nretailers and consumers. These cost savings should in turn be passed on by\r\nmerchants to consumers through lower retail prices.\nThe interchange fees as such, and their\r\nwidely diverging levels constitute an obstacle to market integration and to effective\r\ncompetition, whose effects are reinforced by a number of business rules reducing\r\ntransparency to retailers and consumers, restricting the ability for retailers\r\nto choose an acquirer in another Member State, and retailers from steering\r\nconsumers towards more efficient means of payment. \nOn the basis of consultations of\r\nstakeholders, as summarised in the impact assessment, the Commission proposes a\r\ncombination of measures to enhance effective market functioning, capping the level of interchange fees for cross-border transactions\r\nwith consumer debit and credit cards (in the first\r\nstage) and, in a second stage, capping\r\nthe level of interchange fees also for domestic transactions with consumer\r\ncredit cards and consumer debit cards. \nNot regulating would leave intact the\r\nproblems of increased reliance on the two international market players with the\r\ngradual disappearance of (in general cheaper) domestic card schemes. Economies\r\nof scale and scope for potential new pan-European entrants and innovative\r\nplayers would remain limited, whilst merchants and consumers will continue to pay\r\nfor the fragmented and expensive EU payments market (more than 1% of EU GDP or\r\n\u20ac130 billion a year, according to the ECB). Leaving these issues to competition\r\nenforcement actions, in particular on the basis of the MasterCard judgement is\r\nlikely to take many years and will always be on a case-by-case basis and thus cannot\r\nprovide a level playing field. \nIt is necessary and proportionate to cover\r\ndomestic transactions and not only cross-border transactions which would mainly\r\nbenefit big retailers. Cross-border transactions can be addressed rapidly,\r\ncreating opportunities for retailers to seek cheaper acquiring services\r\ncross-border, and incentivising domestic banking communities or schemes to\r\nlower their acquiring fees. A similar process has recently taken place as\r\nregards direct debit. The SEPA End Date Regulation limits interchange fees for\r\ndirect debit, abolishing cross-border interchange fees for direct debit while\r\nallowing domestic interchange fees to stay in place until 2017. As a result and\r\nfaced with a number of merchants moving their acquirer to neighbouring\r\ncountries, banks have committed to abolish their interchange fees for direct\r\ndebit already by 1 September 2013[13][14]. \nAs a consequence of unilateral undertakings\r\nand commitments accepted in the framework of\r\ncompetition proceedings, a large number of cross-border card payment\r\ntransactions in the Union are already carried out respecting the maximum\r\ninterchange fees applicable to the first phase of this Regulation. These\r\nelements can therefore be introduced rapidly. However, domestic interchange\r\nfees would need to be modified. It is therefore necessary to grant a transition\r\nperiod for domestic payment transactions. Moreover, the proposal does not\r\nprevent Member States from maintaining or introducing lower caps or measures of\r\nequivalent object or effect through national legislation\nFurthermore, capping\r\nof interchange fees would benefit retailers, which are more likely to pass on\r\nthese benefits to their customers than banks are, given the current lower levels\r\nof competition and switching in the banking sector. \nAt the same time, consumers already pay the\r\ninterchange fees indirectly in retail prices, and consumers using cash or debit\r\ncards currently subsidise the use of more expensive cards by other consumers. It\r\ncould be argued that decreasing interchange fees would encourage banks to\r\nincrease card holder fees. However, there is no evidence of such a linkage. Card fees appear to be primarily determined by the\r\nlevel of competition in retail banking. \nAlthough this proposal favours market\r\nintegration, market entry and consumers and retailers welfare, a negative\r\nimpact on incumbent payment service providers and banks is far from certain.\r\nCapping interchange fees at these levels is expected to\r\nhave a positive effect on card acceptance by merchants so would encourage\r\nconsumers to an increased use of cards. Increases in\r\nthe volume of card transactions (through higher acceptance) and the savings on cash\r\nhandling could at least partly compensate banks for the potential losses due to\r\nthe cap on interchange fees. Other cost savings could result from fewer ATM\r\ncash withdrawals.\nThe 0.2% and 0.3% caps envisaged are based on the so-called 'Merchant Indifference Test', which\r\nidentifies the fee level a merchant would be willing to pay if he were to\r\ncompare the cost of the customer\u2019s use of a payment card with those of non-card\r\n(cash) payments. The figures were calculated on the basis of this test, using\r\ndata gathered by four national central banks. These figures have been accepted\r\nby Visa, MasterCard and the French domestic card scheme Groupement Cartes Bancaires.The proposal\r\nis therefore proportionate to the objectives mentioned above. All of the proposed rules have been subject to a proportionality\r\ntest and to ensure appropriate and proportionate regulation.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: Regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reasons:\nInterchange fees levels and restrictive\r\nbusiness rules requires standardisation at technical level and the fullest\r\npossible harmonisation. This argues in favour of a Regulation rather than a\r\nDirective. Furthermore, due to the network character of the payment industry,\r\nmost of the benefits of will only materialise once the domestic transition to\r\nUnion-wide payment instruments is completed in all EU Member States.\r\nA Directive with potentially differing national implementations runs the\r\nrisk of perpetuating the current payment market fragmentation. Finally, it\r\nwould delay migration due to the time necessary for national transposition. It\r\nis therefore recommended to use the legal instrument of a Regulation for regulating\r\ninterchnage fees and restrictive business rules in the card payments market and\r\nmobile and internet based card markets.\nThe Regulation complies with the\r\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the\r\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the freedom to\r\nconduct a business, the right to an effective remedy or to a fair trial and has\r\nto be applied in accordance with those rights and principles.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary implications\nThe proposal does not have any impact on\r\nthe EU Budget. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nReview/revision/sunset clause\nThe proposal includes a review clause.\nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposed act concerns an EEA matter and\r\nshould therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\nDetailed explanation of the proposal\nThe following short summary aims to\r\nfacilitate the decision making process by sketching the main substance of the\r\nRegulation.\nArticle 1 \u2013 subject matter and scope \u2013\r\nstates that the Regulation concerns rules for the interchange fees regarding\r\npayment card transactions and card based payment transactions within the EU when\r\nthe payee and its payment service provider in the payment transaction are\r\nlocated in the EU and business rules related to those payments.\nArticle 2 \u2013 definitions \u2013 aligned, as much\r\nas possible, with those used in Directive 2007/64/EC. However, given the\r\nRegulation\u2019s limited scope in comparison with the Payment Services Directive,\r\nsome of the definitions have been tailored to the needs of this proposal.\nArticle 3 \u2013 (Maximum interchange fee for\r\ncross-border consumer debit and credit card transactions) sets caps for\r\ninterchange fees to payment service providers of 0.2% and 0.3% for for\r\ncross-border consumer debit and credit transactions, for entry into force 2\r\nmonths after publication. \nArticle 4 \u2013 (Maximum interchange fees for all\r\nconsumer debit and credit card transactions) sets caps for interchange fees to\r\npayment service providers of 0.2% and 0.3% fo the value of the transaction for\r\nall consumer debit and credit transactions, for entry into force 2 years after\r\npublication \nArticle 5 \u2013(Prohibition of circumvention\r\nFees) establishes that for the purpose of implementing the caps under articles\r\n3 and 4, the net compensation of fees received and paid between the issuer and\r\nthe scheme are integrated in the calculation of the interchange fees paid and\r\nreceived for the purpose of assessing possible circumvention. \nArticle 6 \u2013 (Licensing) sets that the\r\nlicenses delivered by schemes for issuing or acquiring purposes should not be\r\nrestricted to a specific territory but cover the entire Union territory \nArticle 7 \u2013 (Separation between scheme and\r\nprocessing) establishes that an organisational separation should be in place\r\nbetween the schemes and the entities which are processing the transactions, and\r\nprohibits territorial discrimination in processing rules whilst mandating\r\ntechnical interoperability of processing entities' systems\nArticle 8 \u2013 (Co- badging and choice of\r\napplication) This article states that the issuer of the payment instrument\r\ndecides whether the payment application can reside on the same card or wallet.\r\nThe choice of payment application used remains with the consumer and cannot not\r\nbe prescribed in advance by the issuer through automatic mechanisms on the\r\ninstrument or the equipment at the point of sale. \nArticle 9 \u2013 (Unblending) This article clarifies\r\nthat acquiring banks shall offer and charge payees individually for different\r\ncategories and different brands of payment cards and not impose a single price,\r\nand provide the relevant information on the amounts applicable for the\r\ndifferent categories and brands \nArticle 10 \u2013 (Honour all cards rule) This\r\narticle clarifies that payment schemes and payment service providers cannot\r\nimpose that a retailer accepts a category or brand if he accepts another\r\ncategory or brand, except if the brand or category is subject to the same\r\nregulated interchange fee as the former. For example, merchants accepting\r\nconsumer debit cards may not be forced to accept consumer credit cards but can\r\nbe imposed to accept other consumer debit cards\nArticle 11 \u2013 (Steering rules) This article\r\nclarifies that payment schemes and payment service providers schemes cannot\r\nprevent retailers from steering consumers towards the use of specific payment\r\ninstruments preferred by the retailer. This is without prejudice to the rules\r\non rebates and surcharges established under the Payment Services Directive and\r\narticle 19 of the Consumer Rights Directive. Payment schemes and payment\r\nservice providers schemes cannot prevent retailers from informing consumers\r\nabout interchange fees and merchant service charges\nArticle 12 \u2013 (Information for the payee on\r\nindividual payment transactions) states the informations the payment service\r\nprovider shall provide to the merchant after the execution of an individual\r\npayment transaction, and provides for the possibiliy for this information to be\r\nprovided periodically\nArticle 13 \u2013 Competent authorities regulates\r\nthe procedures for designating the national authorities responsible for the\r\napplication of provisions in the Regulation\nArticle 14 \u2013 Penalties requires Member\r\nStates to establish rules on sanctions for breaches of the provisions in the\r\nRegulation, and to notify the Commission of these\nArticle 15 \u2013 Out-of-court complaint and\r\nredress procedures requires Member States to establish specific requirements\r\nfor the settlement of disputes between payees and payment service providers. \nArticle 16 \u2013 (Review clause) four years\r\nafter the entry into force, dealing in particular with the interchange level. This\r\narticle sets out the mechanisms for assessing the effective application of the\r\nprovisions in the Directive and, if needed, propose changes to it\nArticle 17 \u2013 (entry into force) states the\r\ndate upon which the Regulation enters into force\n2013/0265 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non interchange fees for card-based payment\r\ntransactions\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[15],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Central Bank[16],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fragmentation of the\r\ninternal market is detrimental to competitiveness, growth and job creation\r\nwithin the Union. Eliminating direct and indirect obstacles to the proper\r\nfunctioning and completion of an integrated market for\r\nelectronic payments, with no distinction between national and cross-border\r\npayments, is necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive\r\n2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[17] has provided a legal\r\nfoundation for the creation of a Union-wide internal market for payments as it substantially facilitated the activity of payment service\r\nproviders, creating uniform rules with respect to the provision of payment\r\nservices.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\r\n(EC) No 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council[18] established\r\nthe principle that charges paid by the users for a cross-border payment in euro\r\nare the same as for the corresponding payment within a Member State including\r\ncard payments covered by this Regulation. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\r\n(EC) No 260/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[19] provided the rules for the\r\nfunctioning of credit transfers and direct debits in euro in the internal\r\nmarket but excluded card based payments from its scope.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive\r\n2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council [20] harmonizes certain rules on contracts concluded between\r\nconsumers and traders, including rules on fees for the use\r\nof means of payment, on the basis of which Member States are to prohibit\r\ntraders from charging consumers, in respect of the use of a given means of\r\npayment, fees that exceed the cost borne by the trader for the use of such\r\nmeans.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secure,\r\nefficient, competitive and innovative electronic payments are crucial if\r\nconsumers, retailers and companies are to enjoy the full benefits of the\r\ninternal market, and increasingly so as the world moves towards e-commerce.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preparation of legislation\r\nis under way in several Member States[21] to\r\nregulate interchange fees, covering a number of issues, including caps on\r\ninterchange fees at various levels, merchant fees, the Honour All Cards rules\r\nor steering measures. The existing administrative decisions in some Member\r\nStates vary significantly. In view of the harmfulness of interchange fees to\r\nretailers and consumers, a further introduction of regulatory measures at\r\nnational level aimed at addressing the level or divergencies of these fees is anticipated.\r\nSuch national measures would be likely to lead to significant barriers to the\r\ncompletion of the internal market in the area of cards, internet and mobile\r\npayments based on cards and would therefore hinder the freedom to provide\r\nservices.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Payment cards are the most\r\nfrequently used electronic payment instrument for retail purchases. However,\r\nintegration of the Union payment card market is far from complete as many\r\npayment solutions cannot develop beyond their national borders or new pan-Union\r\nproviders are prevented from entering the market. The lack of market integration\r\ncurrently results in higher prices and less choice in payment services for\r\nconsumers and retailers, and more limited opportunities to take advantage of\r\nthe internal market. There is therefore a need to remove obstacles to the\r\nefficient functioning of the card market, including mobile and internet\r\npayments that are based on card transactions which still pose barriers to the\r\ndeployment of a fully integrated market. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To enable the internal\r\nmarket to function effectively, the use of electronic payments should be\r\npromoted and facilitated to the benefit of retailers and consumers. Cards and\r\nother electronic payments can be used in a more versatile manner, including\r\npossibilities to pay online in order to take advantage of the internal market\r\nand e-commerce, whilst electronic payments also provide retailers with\r\npotentially secure payments. Card and card based payments instead of cash use\r\ncould therefore be beneficial for retailers and consumers, provided the fees\r\nfor the use of the payment systems are set at an economically efficient level,\r\nwhilst contributing to innovation and market entry of new operators. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the key practices\r\nhindering the functioning of the internal market in card and card-based\r\npayments is the widespread existence of interchange fees,\r\nwhich are in most Member States not subject to any legislation. Interchange fees are inter-bank fees usually applied between the card-acquiring\r\npayment service providers and the card-issuing payment service providers\r\nbelonging to a certain card scheme. Interchange fees\r\nare a main part of the fees charged to merchants by acquiring payment service providers for\r\nevery card transaction. Merchants in turn incorporate\r\nthese card costs in the general prices of goods and services. Competition between\r\ncard schemes appears in practice to be largely aimed at convincing as many\r\nissuing payment service providers (e.g. banks) as possible to issue their\r\ncards, which usually leads to higher rather than lower\r\ninterchange fees on the market, in contrast with the usual price disciplining\r\neffect of competition in a market economy. Regulating interchange fees would\r\nimprove the functioning of the internal market. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ncurrently existing wide variety of interchange fees and their level prevent the\r\nemergence of 'new' pan Union players on the basis of business models with lower\r\ninterchange fees, to the detriment of potential economies of scale and scope\r\nand their resulting efficiencies. This has a negative impact on retailers and\r\nconsumers and prevents innovation. As Pan-Union players would have to offer\r\nissuing banks as a minimum the highest level of interchange fee prevailing in\r\nthe market they want to enter it also results in persisting market\r\nfragmentation. Existing domestic schemes with lower or no interchange fees may\r\nalso be forced to exit the market because of the pressure from banks to obtain\r\nhigher interchange fees revenues. As a result, consumers and merchants face\r\nrestricted choice, higher prices and lower quality of payment services while\r\ntheir ability to use pan-Union payment solutions is restricted. In addition,\r\nretailers cannot overcome the fee differences by making use of card acceptance\r\nservices offered by banks in other Member States. Specific rules applied by the\r\npayment schemes require the application of the interchange fee of the 'Point of\r\nSale' (country of the retailer) for each payment transaction. This prevents\r\nacquiring banks from successfully offering their services on a cross border\r\nbasis. It also prevents retailers from reducing their payment costs to the\r\nbenefit of consumers.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The application of existing\r\nlegislation by the Commission and national competition authorities has not been\r\nable to redress this situation.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, to avoid the\r\nfragmentation of the internal market and significant distortions of competition\r\nthrough diverging laws and administrative decisions, there is a need, in line\r\nwith article 114 TFEU, to take measures to address the problem of high and\r\ndivergent interchange fees, to allow payment service providers to provide their\r\nservices on a cross-border basis and consumer and retailer to use cross-border\r\nservices. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The application of this\r\nRegulation is without prejudice to the application of Union and national\r\ncompetition rules. It should not prevent Member States from maintaining or\r\nintroducing lower caps or measures of equivalent object or effect through\r\nnational legislation.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation follows a\r\ngradual approach. As a first step, it is necessary to\r\ntake measures to facilitate cross-border issuing and acquiring of payment card\r\ntransactions. Allowing merchants to choose an acquirer\r\noutside their own Member State ('cross border acquiring') and imposing a\r\nmaximum level of cross border interchange fees for cross border acquired\r\ntransactions should provide the necessary legal clarity. In addition, licences for issuing or acquiring of payment\r\ninstruments should be valid without geographic restrictions within the Union. These\r\nmeasures would facilitate the smooth functioning of an internal market for\r\ncard, internet and mobile payments, to the benefit of consumers and retailers.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\na consequence of unilateral undertakings and commitments accepted in the\r\nframework of competition proceedings, many cross-border card payment\r\ntransactions in the Union are already carried out respecting the maximum\r\ninterchanges fees applicable to the first phase of this Regulation. Therefore,\r\nthe provisions relating to those transactions should enter into force quickly,\r\ncreating opportunities for retailers to seek cheaper acquiring services\r\ncross-border, and incentivising domestic banking communities or schemes to\r\nlower their acquiring fees. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For domestic transactions,\r\na transition period is necessary to provide payment services providers and\r\nschemes with time to adapt to the new requirements. Therefore, after a two year\r\nperiod following the entry into force of this Regulation and in order to\r\nprovide for a completion of an internal market for card-based payments, the caps\r\non interchange fees for consumer card transactions should be extended to cover all,\r\ncross-border and domestic payments. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to facilitate cross border acquiring all (cross-border\r\nand domestic) 'consumer' debit card transactions\r\nand card based payment transaction should have a maximum interchange\r\nfee of 0,20% and all (cross-border and domestic) consumer credit card\r\ntransactions and card based payment transactions based on those should\r\nhave a maximum interchange fee of 0.30%. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those\r\ncaps are based on the so-called 'Merchant Indifference Test' developed in\r\neconomic literature, which identifies the fee level a merchant would be willing\r\nto pay if he were to compare the cost of the customer\u2019s use of a payment card\r\nwith those of non-card (cash) payments (taking into account the fee for service\r\npaid to acquiring banks, i.e. the merchant service charge coming on top\r\nof the interchange fee). It thereby stimulates the use of efficient payment\r\ninstruments through a promotion of those cards that provide higher\r\ntransactional benefits, while at the same time preventing disproportionate\r\nmerchant fees, which would impose hidden costs on other consumers. Excessive\r\nmerchant fees might otherwise arise due to the collective interchange fee\r\narrangements, as merchants are reluctant to turn down costly payment instruments\r\nfor fear of losing business. Experience has shown that those levels are\r\nproportionate, as they do not call into question the\r\noperation of international card schemes and payment\r\nservice providers. They also provide benefits for retailers\r\nand consumers and provide legal certainty.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should\r\ncover all transactions where the payer's payment service provider and the\r\npayee's payment service provider are established in the Union. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nprinciple of technological neutrality set out in the Digital Agenda for Europe,\r\nthis Regulation should apply to card based payment transactions regardless of\r\nthe environment in which this transaction takes place, including through retail\r\npayment instruments and services which can be off-line, on-line or mobile .\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Payment card transactions\r\nare generally carried out on the basis of two main business models, so-called three\r\nparty payment card schemes (cardholder \u2013 acquiring and issuing scheme -\r\nmerchant) and four party payment card schemes (card holder- issuing bank-\r\nacquiring bank- merchant). Many four payment card party schemes are using an\r\nexplicit interchange fee, mostly multilateral. Interchange fees (fees paid by\r\nacquiring banks to incentivise card issuing and card use) are implicit in three\r\nparty payment card schemes. To acknowledge the existence of implicit\r\ninterchange fees and contribute to the creation of a level playing field, three\r\nparty payment card schemes using payment service providers as issuers or\r\nacquirers should be considered as four party payment card schemes and should\r\nfollow the same rules, whilst transparency and other measures related to\r\nbusiness rules should apply to all providers.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important to ensure\r\nthat the provisions concerning the interchange fees to be paid or received by\r\npayment service providers are not circumvented by alternative flows of fees to\r\nissuing payment services providers. To avoid this, the \"net\r\ncompensation\" of fees paid and received by the issuing payment service\r\nprovider from a payment card scheme should be considered as the interchange fee. When calculating the interchange fee, for\r\nthe purpose of checking whether circumvention is taking place the total amount\r\nof payments or incentives received by an issuing payment services provider from\r\na payment card scheme with respect to the regulated transactions less the fees\r\npaid by the issuing payment services provider to the scheme should be taken\r\ninto account. Payments, incentives and fees considered could be direct (i.e.\r\nvolume-based or transaction-specific) or indirect (including marketing\r\nincentives, bonuses, rebates for meeting certain transaction volumes). \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumers tend to be\r\nunaware of the fees paid by merchants for the payment instrument they use. At\r\nthe same time, a series of incentivising practices applied by issuing payment\r\nservice providers (such as travel vouchers, bonuses, rebates, charge backs,\r\nfree insurances, etc.) may steer consumers towards the use of payment\r\ninstruments generating high fees for issuing payment service providers.To counter this, the measures imposing restrictions on interchange\r\nfees should only apply to payment cards that have become mass products and\r\nmerchants generally have difficulty refusing due to their widespread issuance\r\nand use (i.e. consumer debit and credit cards). In order to enhance effective\r\nmarket functioning in the non-regulated parts of the sector and to limit the\r\ntransfer of business from the regulated to the non-regulated parts of the\r\nsector, it is necessary to adopt a series of measures , including separation of\r\nscheme and infrastructure, steering of the payer by the payee and enable selective\r\nacceptance of payment instruments by the payee.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A separation of scheme and\r\ninfrastructure should allow all processors to compete for customers of the\r\nschemes. As the cost of processing is a significant part of the total cost of\r\ncard acceptance, it is important for this part of the value chain to be opened\r\nto effective competition. On the basis of the separation of scheme and infrastructure, card schemes and processing\r\nentities should be independent in terms of legal form, organisation and\r\ndecision making process. They should not discriminate, for instance by providing each other with preferential\r\ntreatment or privileged information which is not available to their competitors\r\non their respective market segment, imposing excessive information requirements\r\non their competitor in their respective market segment, cross-subsidizing their\r\nrespective activities or having shared governance\r\narrangements. Such discriminatory practises contribute\r\nto market fragmentation, negatively impact market entry by new players and\r\nprevent pan\u2011Union players from emerging, hence hindering the completion\r\nof the internal market in cards, internet and mobile payments, to the detriment\r\nof retailers, companies and consumers.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scheme rules applied by\r\npayment card schemes and practices applied by payment service providers tend to\r\nkeep merchants and consumers ignorant about fee differences and reduce market\r\ntransparency, for instance by \u2018blending\u2019 fees or prohibiting merchants from\r\nchosing a cheeper card brand on co-branded cards or steering consumers to the\r\nuse of such cheeper cards. Even if merchants are aware of the different costs,\r\nthe scheme rules often prevent them from acting to reduce the fees.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Payment instruments entail\r\ndifferent costs to the payee, with certain instruments being more expensive\r\nthan others. Except where a payment instrument is imposed by law for certain\r\ncategories of payments or cannot be refused due to its legal tender status, the\r\npayee should be free to steer payers towards the use of a specific payment\r\ninstrument. Card schemes and payment services providers impose several\r\nrestrictions on payees in this respect, examples of which include restrictions\r\non the refusal by the payee of specific payment instruments for low amounts, on\r\nthe provision of information to the payer on the fees incurred by the payee for\r\nspecific payment instruments or limitation imposed on the payee of the number\r\nof tills in his shop accepting specific payment instruments. Those restrictions\r\nshould be abolished.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n55of the proposal COM (2013)547 the payee can steer the payer towards the use\r\nof a specific payment instrument. However, no charges should be requested by\r\nthe payee for the use of payment instruments of which interchange fees are\r\nregulated within the scope of this Regulation, as in such situations the\r\nadvantages of surcharging become limited while creating complexity in the\r\nmarket. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Honour all Cards Rule\r\nis a twofold obligation imposed by issuing payment services providers and\r\npayment card schemes on payees to, on the one hand, accept all the cards of the\r\nsame brand ('Honour all Products' - element), irrespective of the\r\ndifferent costs of these cards, and on the other hand irrespective of the\r\nindividual issuing bank which has issued the card ('Honour all Issuers'\r\n\u2013element). It is in the interest of the consumer that for the same category of\r\ncards the payee cannot discriminate between issuers or cardholders, and payments\r\nschemes and payment service providers can impose such obligation on them. Therefore,\r\nalthough the 'Honour all Issuers' element of the Honour all Cards Rule\r\nis a justifiable rule within a payment card system, since it prevents that\r\npayees from discriminating between the individual banks which have issued a\r\ncard, the 'Honour all Products' element is essentially a tying practice\r\nthat has the effect of tying acceptance of low fee cards to acceptance of high\r\nfee cards. A removal of the 'Honour all Products' element of the Honour\r\nAll Cards Rule would allow merchants to limit the choice of payment cards they\r\noffer to low(er) cost payment cards only, which would also benefit consumers\r\nthrough reduced merchants' costs. Merchants accepting debit cards would then\r\nnot be forced also to accept credit cards, and those accepting credit cards\r\nwould not be forced to accept commercial cards. However, to protect the\r\nconsumer and his ability to use the payment cards as often as possible, merchants\r\nshould be obliged to accept all cards that are subject to the same regulated interchange\r\nfee. Such a limitation would also result in a more competitive environment for\r\ncards with interchange fees not regulated under this Regulation, as merchants would\r\ngain more negotiating power as regards the conditions under which they accept\r\nsuch cards. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the effective\r\nfunctioning of the limitations to the Honour All Cards Rule certain information\r\nis indispensable. First, payees should have the means to identify the different\r\ncategories of cards. Therefore, the various categories should be identifiable\r\nvisibly and electronically on the device. Secondly, also the payer should be\r\ninformed about the acceptance of his payment instrument(s) at a given point of\r\nsale. It is necessary that any limitation on the use of a given brand to be\r\nannounced by the payee to the payer at the same time and under the same\r\nconditions as the information that a given brand is accepted. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\r\nredress is possible where this Regulation has been incorrectly applied, or\r\nwhere disputes occur between payment services users and payment services\r\nproviders, Member States should establish adequate and effective out-of-court\r\ncomplaint and redress procedures. Member States should lay\r\ndown rules on the penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and\r\nshould ensure that those penalties are effective, proportionate and dissuasive\r\nand that they are applied. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of\r\nthis Regulation, namely to lay down uniform requirements for payment card\r\ntransactions and internet and mobile transactions based on the card payments,\r\ncannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by\r\nreason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union\r\nmay adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out\r\nin Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle\r\nof proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond\r\nwhat is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation complies\r\nwith the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in\r\nparticular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably\r\nthe right to an effective remedy or to a fair trial, the freedom to conduct a\r\nbusiness, consumer protection and has to be applied in accordance with those\r\nrights and principles.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\r\nScope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation lays down\r\nuniform technical and business requirements for payment card transactions carried\r\nout within the Union, where both the payer's payment service provider and the\r\npayee's payment service provider are established therein. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation does not\r\napply to payment instruments that can be used only within a limited network designed\r\nto address precise needs through payment instruments only to be used in a\r\nlimited way, because they allow the specific instrument holder to acquire goods\r\nor services only in the premises of the issuer, within a limited network of\r\nservice providers under a direct commercial agreement with a professional\r\nissuer, or because they can be used only to acquire a limited range of goods or\r\nservices.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter II does not apply\r\nto the following:\n(a)         \r\ntransactions with commercial cards,\n(b)         \r\ncash withdrawals at automatic teller machines\r\nand\n(c)         \r\ntransactions with cards issued by three party\r\npayment card schemes.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 7 does not apply\r\nto three party payment card schemes. \nArticle 2\r\nDefinitions \nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the\r\nfollowing definitions shall apply:\n(1)                   \r\n'acquirer' means a payment service provider\r\ncontracting directly or indirectly with a payee to process the payee\u2019s payment\r\ntransactions;
