Its development has\ninvolved two comprehensive legislative packages \u2013 SES I and SES II composed of\nfour regulations[1]\n\u2013 and over 20 Commission implementing rules and decisions[2]. The framework of the four SES\nregulations is intertwined with the development of the European Aviation Safety\nlegislation[3],\nthe latter comprising a number of tasks entrusted to the European Aviation\nSafety Agency (EASA)[4]\nand the launch of a comprehensive project to modernise equipment and systems\nfor air navigation services under the SESAR title[5]. Existing rules touch upon five\ninterrelated pillars addressing performance, safety, technology, the human\nfactor and airports.\nThe experience gained with SES I since 2004\nand SES II since 2009 has shown that the principles and direction of the SES\nare valid and warrant a continuation of their implementation. However the\ninitiative is experiencing significant delays in its implementation, notably in\nthe achievement of the performance goals and the deployment of its basic elements\n(such as functional airspace blocks (FABs) or National Supervisory Authorities\n(NSAs)).\nIn 2009, when adopting the SES II package,\nthe legislator decided that SES II would be done in two stages and invited the\nCommission to come back to do an alignment of SES and EASA regulations after\nthe initial set of EASA implementing measures and audit experiences concerning\nANS was in place[6].\nA recast of the legislative package was therefore already foreseen, primarily\naiming at simplifying and clarifying the border line between EASA and SES legal\nframeworks.\nThe process of recast also gives the\nopportunity to assess the effectiveness of the existing legal provisions in the\nlight of the lack of timely implementation of the SES initiative. This process\nof revision of the SES legal framework, known under the abbreviation of SES 2+,\nis intended to accelerate the implementation of the reform of air navigation\nservices without departing from its original objectives and principles. It is\nalso part of the Single Market Act II[7]\ninitiative and aims hence to improve the general competitiveness and growth of\nthe EU economy and not just that of the air traffic management system. \nThe purpose of the SES 2+ package is to\nintroduce improvements in oversight of rules, the performance scheme, the\ncustomer focus of the service providers and in overall performance. \nIn addition, the SES 2+ package will\nsimplify the legislation by eliminating certain overlaps in the existing\nframework. Concerns have been raised about several overlapping areas existing\nin the SES framework and there is also a need to clarify the roles of the\nvarious actors at EU-level. This alignment between the four SES Regulations and\nthe EASA Basic Regulation[8],\nis a purely technical adaptation measure already required by the legislation.\nDue to the extent of overlap between the Regulations, a recast of the remaining\nparts of the four SES Regulations into one is a logical consequence of that\nadaptation. \nProblems addressed\nThe first problem area addressed in SES2+\nis the insufficient efficiency of Air Navigation ANS provision remains\nrelatively inefficient in terms of cost- and flight efficiency as well as the\ncapacity offered. This is highlighted by a comparison with the United States,\nwhich covers similar sized airspace. In the US, the en-route airspace is\ncontrolled by a single service provider as opposed to 38 en-route service\nproviders in Europe. The US service provider controls almost 70% more flights\nwith 38% less staff. The main root causes for this difference in productivity\nin Europe are the shortcomings in setting up and enforcing the performance\nscheme, ineffective supervisory authorities and the disproportionally high\namount of support staff in the service providers.\nThe second key problem addressed is a fragmented\nATM system. The European ATM system consists of 27 national authorities\noverseeing in total over a hundred Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs),\nwith the associated variance in systems, rules and procedures. There is a large\namount of additional costs caused by the fact that Europe has a large number of\nservice providers, each procuring their own systems, mostly training their own\nstaff, creating their own operating procedures and being limited territorially\nto providing services in a small airspace. To overcome fragmentation, the SES\nhas introduced the ideas of cross-border Functional Air Blocks (FABs) and the\ncentralised Network Manager to run certain network level services. However,\nFABs are not yet performance oriented and the Network Manager remains too weak.\nGeneral\nobjective:\nTo improve\nthe competitiveness of the European air transport system vis-\u00e0-vis other\ncomparable regions and in particular to develop further the Single European Sky\ninitiative.\nSpecific\nobjectives:\n\u00b7       \nTo improve the performance of air traffic\nservices in terms of efficiency.\n\u00b7        \nTo improve the utilisation of air traffic\nmanagement capacity.\nOperational\nobjectives:\n\u00b7       \nTo ensure that the provision of Air Navigation\nServices is transparent, based on market principles and customer value.\n\u00b7       \nTo strengthen the role of the National\nSupervisory Authorities.\n\u00b7       \nTo strengthen the process of setting up targets\nand enforcing the performance scheme (including the reinforcement of the\nPerformance Review Body/Performance Review Unit (PRB/PRU).\n\u00b7       \nTo undertake a strategic redirection of\nFunctional Airspace Blocks.\n\u00b7       \nTo strengthen the governance and operational\nscope of the Network Manager.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nA three-month public consultation was\nperformed between September and December 2012 on the DG MOVE website. In\naddition two high-level events \u2013 a conference in Limassol and a hearing in\nBrussels \u2013 have been organised and numerous bilateral meetings with all\naffected stakeholders have taken place to support the preparation of this\ninitiative.\nAn impact assessment (IA) has been prepared\nby DG MOVE to support legislative proposals on improving efficiency, safety and\ncompetitiveness of the Single European Sky. The package proposes revising the\nfour SES Regulations ((EC) Nos 549-552/2004, as amended by Regulation (EC) No\n1070/2009) and the EASA Basic Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, as\namended by Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009)[9].\nThis initiative concerns agenda planning number (EU) No 2014/MOVE/001. The impact\nassessment roadmap has also been published on the website of the Commission[10].\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recast (throughout the\nRegulation)\nThe four SES Regulations have been merged\ninto a single regulation, which has necessitated a number of changes throughout\nthem. The new rule is structured in five chapters based on the actors\nconcerned:\n- Chapter I: General provisions\n- Chapter II: National authorities\n- Chapter III: Service provision\n- Chapter IV: Airspace\n- Chapter V: Final provisions\nIn addition, some of the contents which\noverlapped with the existing Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 have been removed from\nthe SES Regulations and certain small details from these removed sections have\nbeen reproduced in Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, in order to underline the\ncontinuity of approach. Most provisions have been removed from Regulation (EC)\nNo 552/2004, which is now deleted in its entirety, except for certain details\nrelated to Annex I on notified bodies, which have been merged with the annex on\nqualified entities, as well as some general descriptive paragraphs in Annex II,\nwhich are reproduced in Annex Vb of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 to stress the\nneed for continuing existing policies.\nIn line with the view that the Commission\nshould focus on economic regulation and in particular on the performance scheme\nand SESAR, whereas EASA(now EAA, under the agreement on standardisation of\nAgencies) supports the process through co-ordinating all technical rule\ndrafting, a new Article 28 has been added to describe the manner in which the\nconsistency between SESAR policies and new technical rules can be ensured.\nFinally, the new rules on implementing and\ndelegated acts stemming from the Lisbon Treaty have been included throughout\nthe Regulation.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 National authorities\n(Articles 3, 4 and 5 and Article 2, definition 36)\nOne of the major needs for action\nidentified in the impact assessment has been the need to strengthen the\nnational authorities, both as regards their independence and their expertise\nand resources. For that purpose Article 3 describes the level of independence\nrequired from the authorities vis-\u00e0-vis the service providers they are intended\nto oversee. Due to the need in some Member States to carry out some\nadministrative reorganisation, a transitional period is also foreseen until\n2020. Furthermore more explicit requirements are set on the competences and\nindependence of the staff hired, as well as strengthening the independent\nfunding of the authorities through the route charges scheme Article 14.\nTo improve expertise amongst the\nauthorities, a network of national authorities is foreseen in Article 5,\nincluding also the possibility of pooling experts so that States may benefit of\nexperts coming from other Member States.\nFinally, a definition of the term 'National\nSupervisory Authority' has been added, whereby it is clarified that for the\npurposes of this Regulation the competent authorities under Regulation (EC) No\n216/2008 are considered to be National Supervisory Authorities, so that no\nsecond layer of administration is required.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Performance and charging\nschemes (Articles 11, 12, 13 and 14)\nThe Article 11 on performance scheme has\nbeen amended to rationalise the process of target setting and to allow focusing\nof target setting more at the local level. This allows for more educated\ntailored setting of targets. \nSmall adjustments to support this have also\nbeen made to Articles 12 and 13 on charging and the text has also been updated\nso that the provision concerning funding of authority tasks covers also the\nextension of EASA under Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009 to perform some of those\ntasks.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Functional Airspace Blocks\n(Article 16)\nThe article was amended already under\nRegulation (EC) No 1070/2009 to give the functional airspace blocks (FABs) more\nof a performance focus and this process is continued in this revision. The FABs\nshould not be seen as static blocks of airspace, but as industry-led\ninitiatives to seek improvements in overall service provision. For that to be\npossible, the industry needs to be given more flexibility to develop the FABs,\neven to devise different types of FABs, depending on where they expect to find\nthe most synergies. Therefore the focus of the article is now more on flexible\n\"industrial partnerships\" and the measure of success will be the\nlevel of performance improvements achieved.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Support services (Articles\n10 and Article 2, definition 37)\nSince analysis has shown that most\nimprovement potential exists in the services that are provided to support the\ncore air traffic services and since these services by their nature could also\nbe provided under market conditions, the former Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No\n550/2004 has been deleted and replaced with an article concerning the provision\nof support services under normal public procurement rules. The core air traffic\nservices, which are considered to be natural monopolies, remain under the\nrequirement to designate them, but support services should be allowed to\ndevelop freely, using the full potential of expertise also from other sectors.\nA safeguard clause has been included, based on the model of Article 4 of\nRegulation (EC) No 1008/2008 to ensure vital security and economic interests\nare not endangered. A transitional period is foreseen until 2020.\nFinally, a definition of support services\nis included in Article 2 (37) to explain which services are targeted with this\nprovision.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Network Management\n(Articles 17 and Article 2, definitions 7, 9 and 10)\nThe Article 17 on network management has\nbeen updated in two ways. First, the previously inconsistent article has been\nreorganised to bring the listing of all of the services that the Network\nManager provides into paragraph 2 and elements that were related to technical\nimplementing rules on air traffic flow management \u2013 and hence not to the\nNetwork Manager itself \u2013 have been relocated in Annex Vb of Regulation (EC) No\n216/2008, which already included the relevant provisions concerning flow\nmanagement rules. In connection with this, a reference to the aeronautical\ninformation portal has been added to paragraph 2 as this service is already to\nsome extent integrated in the Network Manager, but not expressly mentioned in\nthe Regulation.\nSecondly, the article has been revised to\nalign it with the language used in Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009, naming the\n\"functions\" as \"services\" and treating the Network Manager\nconsistently in the same manner as other service providers insofar as\ncertification, oversight and safety requirements are concerned. The language of\nthe relevant definitions has also been updated accordingly.\nFinally, a provision has been included in\nArticle 17 to cover the further development of the Network Manager in the\ndirection of an industrial partnership by 2020.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Involvement of airspace\nusers (Article 19)\nThe need to introduce more customer focus\non the air navigation service providers was identified as one area of\nimprovement in the impact assessment. A new Article 19 has been created to\nensure the airspace users are consulted and also involved in the approval of\ninvestment plans.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nA shorter separate explanatory memorandum\nhas been created to accompany the proposed amendments to the EASA Basic\nRegulation, i.e. Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\nThe proposal has no impact on EU Budget, as\nall the functions addressed in it already exist today.\n\u00ea 549/2004\n(adapted)\n2013/0186 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nlaying down the\nframework for the creation of \u00d6 on the\nimplementation of \u00d5 the sSingle\nEuropean sSky\n(recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\u00ea 549/2004\n(adapted)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) \u00d6 100(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission[11],\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[12],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[13],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00f2 new\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\n(EC) No 549/2004 of 10 March 2004 laying down the framework for the\ncreation of the single European sky (the framework Regulation)[14], Regulation (EC)\nNo 550/2004 of 10 March 2004 on the provision of air navigation\nservices in the single European sky (the service provision Regulation)[15], Regulation (EC)\nNo 551/2004 of 10 March 2004 on the organisation and use of the\nairspace in the single European sky (the airspace Regulation)[16] and Regulation (EC)\nNo 552/2004 of 10 March 2004 on the interoperability of the European\nair traffic management network (the interoperability Regulation)[17] have been substantially\namended. Since further amendments are to be made, they should be recast in the\ninterests of clarity.\n\u00ea 549/2004\nrecital 1\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Implementation of the\ncommon transport policy requires an efficient air transport system allowing\nsafe and regular operation of air transport services, thus facilitating the\nfree movement of goods, persons and services.\n\u00ea 549/2004\nrecital 2 (adapted)\nAt its\nExtraordinary Meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000, the European\nCouncil called on the Commission to put forward proposals on airspace\nmanagement, air traffic control and air traffic flow management, based on the\nwork of the High Level Group on the single European sky set up by the\nCommission. This Group, made up largely of the civil and military air\nnavigation authorities in the Member States, submitted its report in\nNovember 2000.\n\u00ea 1070/2009\nrecital 2 (adapted)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The adoption by the\nEuropean Parliament and the Council of the first package of the single European\nsky legislation, namely, Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 of 10 March 2004 laying down\nthe framework for the creation of the single European sky (the framework\nRegulation), Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 of 10 March 2004 on the\nprovision of air navigation services in the single European sky (the service\nprovision Regulation), Regulation (EC)\nNo 551/2004 of\n10 March 2004 on the organisation and use of the airspace in the single\nEuropean sky (the airspace Regulation), and\nRegulation (EC) No 552/2004 of 10 March 2004 on the interoperability of the European air traffic\nmanagement network (the interoperability Regulation),\nlaid down a firm legal basis for a seamless, interoperable and safe air traffic\nmanagement (ATM) system. \n\u00f2 new\nThe\nadoption of the second package, namely, Regulation (EC) No 1070/2009, further\nstrengthened the Single European Sky initiative by introducing the performance\nscheme and the Network Manager concepts to further improve the performance of\nthe European Air Traffic Management system\n\u00ea 550/2004\nrecital 3 (adapted)\nRegulation\n(EC) No 549/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March\n2004 (the framework Regulation)[18] lays down the framework for the creation of\nthe single European sky.\n\u00ea 551/2004\nrecital 4 (adapted)\nRegulation\n(EC) No 549/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March\n2004 (the framework Regulation)[19] lays down the framework for the creation of\nthe single European sky. \n\u00ea 551/2004\n(adapted)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 1 of the\n1944 Chicago Convention on Civil Aviation, the Contracting States recognise\nthat \u2018every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace\nabove its territory\u2019. It is within the framework of such sovereignty that the\nMember States of the Community \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , subject to\napplicable international conventions, exercise the powers of a public authority\nwhen controlling air traffic. \n\u00ea 552/2004\nrecital 3 (adapted)\nRegulation\n(EC) No 549/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March\n2004 (the framework Regulation)[20] lays down the framework for the creation of\nthe Single European Sky.\n\u00ea 1070/2009\nrecital 1\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Implementation of the\ncommon transport policy requires an efficient air transport system allowing the\nsafe, regular and sustainable operation of air transport services, optimising\ncapacity and facilitating the free movement of goods, persons and services.\n\u00ea 1070/2009\nrecital 37\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The simultaneous pursuit\nof the goals of augmentation of air traffic safety standards and improvement of\nthe overall performance of ATM and ANS for general air traffic in Europe\nrequire that the human factor be taken into account.

According to this statement,\nMember States should, in particular, enhance civil-military cooperation and, if\nand to the extent deemed necessary by all Member States concerned, facilitate\ncooperation between their armed forces in all matters of air traffic\nmanagement. \n\u00ea 549/2004\nrecital 3\nSmooth operation of the air transport system requires\na consistent, high level of safety in air navigation services allowing optimum\nuse of Europe's airspace and a consistent, high level of safety in air travel,\nin keeping with the duty of general interest of air navigation services,\nincluding public service obligations. It should therefore be carried out to the\nhighest standards of responsibility and competence.\n\u00ea 549/2004\nrecital 4 \nThe single European sky initiative should be\ndeveloped in line with the obligations stemming from the membership of the\nCommunity Union and its Member States of Eurocontrol, and in line with the\nprinciples laid down by the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil\nAviation.\n\u00ea 549/2004\nrecital 5 (adapted)\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decisions relating to the\ncontent, scope or carrying out of military operations and training do not fall\nwithin the sphere of competence of the Community \u00d6 Union under Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5.\n\u00ea 549/2004\nrecital 23 (adapted)\nArrangements\nfor greater cooperation over the use of Gibraltar airport were agreed in London\non 2 December 1987 by the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom in a\njoint declaration by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries.\nSuch arrangements have yet to enter into operation.\n\u00ea 550/2004\nrecital 1 (adapted)\n\u00f0 new\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States have\nrestructured, to varying degrees, their national air navigation service\nproviders by increasing their level of autonomy and freedom to provide\nservices.
