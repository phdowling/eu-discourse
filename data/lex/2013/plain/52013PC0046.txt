Powdered corn cob was identified as an existing active\nsubstance and evaluated in the context of that work programme.\nIn accordance\nwith the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC, it may\nbe decided through the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in\nArticle 28(4) of the Directive that an existing active substance shall be\nincluded in Annex I to the Directive. In the view of the Commission, the\nconclusions of the evaluation of powdered corn cob are that the conditions for\nthe inclusion of the substance into both Annex I and Annex IA for use in\nproduct-type 14, rodenticides, as defined in Annex V to the Directive, are\nmet under certain conditions. Accordingly, the Commission submitted a draft Directive\nfor vote in the Committee established under Article 28(1) of Directive 98/8/EC.\nThe Committee did not deliver a favourable opinion on the draft Directive in\nits meeting on 21 September 2012. In particular, some Member States\nhad reservations regarding the level of efficacy of this active substance. The Commission\nconsiders that sufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate a\ncertain efficacy to justify an inclusion into the annex I and IA of the\ndirective, in particular in light of the fact that additional efficacy data\nwill have to be submitted in the applications for product authorisation. \nThus, in accordance with the procedure set\nout in Article 5(a) of Decision 1999/468/EC, a Proposal for a Council Directive\nis submitted to the Council and forwarded to the European Parliament.\n2013/0026 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\namending Directive 98/8/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council to include powdered corn cob as an active\nsubstance in Annexes I and IA thereto\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning\nthe placing of biocidal products on the market[2],\nand in particular the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Regulation (EC)\nNo 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work\nprogramme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the\nmarket[3]\nestablishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their\npossible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list\nincludes powdered corn cob.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Regulation\n(EC) No 1451/2007, powdered corn cob has been evaluated in accordance with\nArticle 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 14, rodenticides,\nas defined in Annex V to that Directive.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Greece was designated as\nRapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together\nwith a recommendation, to the Commission on 22 October 2009 in\naccordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The competent authority\nreport was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission with the\ninvolvement of the applicant. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation\n(EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within\nthe Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 21 September 2012, in an\nassessment report.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The assessment report\nconcludes that biocidal products used as rodenticides and containing powdered\ncorn cob may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of\nDirective 98/8/EC, and therefore recommends the inclusion of powdered corn\ncob for use in product type 14 in Annex I to that Directive. It is\nappropriate to follow that recommendation. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The assessment report also\nconcludes that biocidal products used as rodenticides and containing powdered\ncorn cob may be expected to present only low risk to humans, non-target animals\nand the environment, in particular with regard to the use which was examined\nand detailed in the assessment report, that is, when used in the form of\npellets in dry locations. The report therefore recommends the inclusion of\npowdered corn cob for that use in Annex IA to Directive 98/8/EC. It is\nappropriate to follow that recommendation.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with current\npractice, and in compliance with Article 10(1) of Directive 98/8/EC,\nit is appropriate to limit the duration of the inclusion to ten years.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not all potential uses and\nexposure scenarios have been evaluated at Union level. It is therefore\nappropriate to require that Member States assess those uses or exposure\nscenarios and those risks to human populations and to environmental\ncompartments that have not been representatively addressed in the Union level\nrisk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that\nappropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to\nreduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions adopted\npursuant to this Directive should be applied simultaneously in all Member\nStates in order to ensure equal treatment on the Union market of biocidal\nproducts of product-type 14 containing the active substance powdered corn cob\nand also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in\ngeneral.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A reasonable period should\nbe allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I and\nAnnex IA to Directive 98/8/EC in order to permit Member States and\ninterested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed\nand to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from\nthe 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article\n12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After inclusion, Member\nStates should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of\nDirective 98/8/EC.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 98/8/EC should\ntherefore be amended accordingly.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nJoint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September\n2011on explanatory documents[4],\nMember States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the\nnotification of their transposition measures with one or more documents\nexplaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the\ncorresponding parts of national transposition instruments.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Committee established by Article 28(1) of Directive 98/8/EC has not delivered an opinion on the measures provided for in this\nDirective, and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal\nrelating to the measures and forwarded it to the European Parliament,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nAnnex I and IA to Directive 98/8/EC are\namended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.\nArticle 2\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States shall adopt\nand publish, by 31 January 2014 at the latest, the laws, regulations\nand administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
