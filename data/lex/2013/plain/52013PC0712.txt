With a view to ensuring that the amounts for the financing of\r\nthe Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) comply with the annual sub-ceilings for\r\nmarket related expenditure and direct payments under heading 2 laid down in the\r\nRegulation to be adopted by the Council pursuant to Article 312(2) of the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, a financial discipline\r\nmechanism has been provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009\r\nestablishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common\r\nagricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers[1]. According to this mechanism,\r\nan adjustment of direct payments should be determined when the forecasts for\r\ndirect payments and market related expenditure, taking into account any\r\nfinancial transfers between the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and\r\nthe European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), indicate that the\r\nannual sub-ceiling under heading 2 set out in the Financial Framework will be\r\nexceeded.\nIn drawing up the 2014 Draft Budget, the\r\nbudgetary estimates for direct payments and market related expenditure showed\r\nthat the sub-ceiling under heading 2 for financial year 2014, after financial\r\ntransfers between EAGF and EAFRD, was likely to be exceeded. As a consequence,\r\ndirect payments should be reduced in order to comply with the ceiling. \nOn this basis, the Commission presented a\r\nproposal for setting the adjustment rate for direct payments in respect of\r\ncalendar year 2013[2],\r\nwhich had to be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council by 30 June\r\n2013 in accordance with Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as amended\r\nby Regulation (EU) No 671/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[3]. However, the European\r\nParliament and the Council had not determined that rate by 30 June 2013.\r\nTherefore, the Commission has set the rate in the Commission Implementing\r\nRegulation (EU) No 964/2013 ([4]),\r\npursuant to Article 18(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the\r\nfinancing of the common agricultural policy[5].\r\n\nArticle 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No\r\n1290/2005 gives the possibility to the Commission to propose an adaptation of\r\nthis rate on the basis of new information in its possession. The Council may\r\nadapt the adjustment rate by 1 December 2013. The updated forecasts for market\r\nrelated expenditure and direct payments of the Amending Letter to the 2014\r\nDraft Budget show the need for a different amount of financial discipline.\r\nTherefore the adjustment rate should be proposed to be adapted.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThis proposal implements the rules provided\r\nfor in Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and Article 18 of\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. Prior consultation with the interested\r\nparties and the preparation of impact assessment were not needed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThis proposal amends the financial\r\ndiscipline adjustment rate set in Article 1 of Commission Implementing\r\nRegulation (EU) No 964/2013 in respect of calendar year 2013. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe calculation of the financial discipline\r\nadapted adjustment rate is part of the preparation of Amending Letter to the\r\n2014 Draft Budget in order to comply with the EAGF net ceiling, i.e. the sub-ceiling\r\nfor market related expenditure and direct payment under Heading 2 for financial\r\nyear 2014 after financial transfers between EAGF and EAFRD. The EAGF net\r\nceiling for financial year 2014 is calculated based on the same principles as\r\nfor the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 964/2013. The Amending Letter\r\nNo 2 to the Draft Budget 2014 includes an amount for the reserve for crises in\r\nthe agricultural sector (EUR 424.5 million). \nThe Amending Letter estimates of budget\r\nappropriations for direct aids and market related expenditure show the need to\r\nreduce the direct payments that can be granted to farmers in respect of\r\ncalendar year 2013 by EUR 902.9 million, compared to EUR 1 471.4 million\r\nestablished in the Draft Budget. The adapted adjustment rate necessary to\r\nrespect the ceiling is 2.453658%. It has been calculated according to the same\r\nmethod as in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 964/2013.\nThe application of this adjustment rate\r\nwill result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines\r\ncovering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in\r\nrespect of calendar year 2013 (financial year 2014). \n2013/0339 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nfixing an adjustment rate to direct\r\npayments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in respect of calendar year\r\n2013 and repealing Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 964/2013\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural\r\npolicy[6],\r\nand in particular Article 18(4) and(5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 25 March 2013 the\r\nCommission adopted a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council on fixing an adjustment rate to direct payments provided for in\r\nRegulation (EC) No 73/2009 in respect of calendar year 2013[7]. The European Parliament and\r\nthe Council had not determined this adjustment by 30 June, as provided for in\r\nArticle 11(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009[8]. Therefore, in accordance with\r\nArticle 18(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, the Commission has set the\r\nadjustment in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 964/2013 ([9]). \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The forecasts for the direct payments and market related expenditure of the\r\nCommission Amending Letter No 2 to the 2014 Draft Budget show the need to adapt\r\nthe amount of financial discipline which was taken into account in the Draft\r\nBudget 2014. The Amending Letter No 2 to the 2014 Draft Budget has been\r\nestablished taking into account an amount of financial discipline of EUR\r\n902.9 million, including an amount for the reserve for crises in the\r\nagricultural sector. The adjustment rate to the direct payments set in\r\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 964/2013 should therefore be adapted, in\r\naccordance with Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a general rule, farmers\r\nsubmitting an aid application for direct payments for one calendar year (N) are\r\npaid within a fixed payment period falling under the financial year (N+1).\r\nHowever, Member States have the possibility to make late payments, within\r\ncertain limits, to farmers beyond this payment period without any time limits.\r\nSuch late payments may fall in a later financial year. When financial\r\ndiscipline is applied for a given calendar year, the adjustment rate should not\r\nbe applied to payments for which aid applications have been submitted in the\r\ncalendar years other than that for which the financial discipline applies.\r\nTherefore, in order to ensure equal treatment of farmers, it is appropriate to\r\nprovide that the adjustment rate should only apply to payments for which aid\r\napplications have been submitted in the calendar year for which the financial\r\ndiscipline is applied, irrespectively of when the payment to farmers is made.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the political agreement\r\non the reform of Common Agricultural policy of 26 June 2013, it has been\r\ndecided that financial discipline will apply to the direct payments in excess\r\nof EUR 2 000. Moreover it has also been agreed that the reimbursement of unused\r\nappropriations (if any) at the end of financial year would be paid to farmers\r\nthe following year subject to the financial discipline. In order to ensure consistency,\r\nit is appropriate to set the same threshold over the years. The financial\r\ndiscipline should be applied in a similar way for calendar year 2013 to be\r\nconsistent with what has been agreed to apply in the future; therefore, it is\r\nappropriate to provide for the application of the adjustment rate only for\r\namounts in excess of EUR 2 000.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 11(3) of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 73/2009 lays down that in the framework of the application\r\nof the schedule of increments provided for in Article 121 of that Regulation to\r\nall direct payments granted in the new Member States within the meaning of\r\nArticle 2(g) of that Regulation, the financial discipline should not apply to\r\nthe new Member States until the beginning of the calendar year in respect of\r\nwhich the level of direct payments applicable in the new Member States is at\r\nleast equal to the then applicable level of such payments in the other Member\r\nStates. Since the direct payments are still subject to the application of the\r\nschedule of increments in calendar year 2013 in Bulgaria, Romania, the adjustment rate to be determined by the present Regulation should not apply to\r\npayments to farmers in these Member States. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 73/2009\r\nhas been adapted by the Act of Accession of Croatia. Since Croatia is subject to the application of the schedule of increments provided for in Article 121 of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 73/2009 in calendar year 2013 the adjustment rate to be\r\ndetermined by the present Regulation should not apply to payments to farmers in\r\n  Croatia.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure that the adapted\r\nrate is applicable as of the date provided for by Regulation (EC) No 73/2009\r\nwhen the payments to the farmer should start, this Regulation should apply from\r\n1 December 2013. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The new adjustment rate\r\nshould be taken into account for the calculation of the entire payment to be\r\ngranted to a farmer for an aid application submitted in respect of calendar\r\nyear 2013. For sake of clarity, Implementing Regulation (EU) No 964/2013 should\r\ntherefore be repealed. \nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amounts of direct\r\npayments within the meaning of Article 2(d) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 to be\r\ngranted to a farmer in excess of EUR 2 000 for an aid application submitted in\r\nrespect of calendar year 2013 shall be reduced by 2.453658%.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reduction provided for\r\nin paragraph 1 shall not apply in Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia.\nArticle 2\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 964/2013[10] is repealed.\nArticle 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe [seventh] day following that of its publication in the Official Journal\r\nof the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 December 2013. \nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n FINANCIAL STATEMENT || FS/13/ \n 6.15.2013.1 \n   || DATE: 26.09.2013   \n 1. || BUDGET HEADING: See budgetary forecast after adjustment (former modulation) and financial discipline per item below: 05 03 01 01 (SPS) 05 03 01 02 (SAPS) 05 03 01 03 (Separate sugar payment) 05 03 01 04 (Separate F & V payment) 05 03 01 05 (Specific support Art 68 \u2013 decoupled payment) 05 03 01 06 (Separate soft fruit payment) 05 03 02 06 (Suckler cow premium) 05 03 02 07 (Additional national suckler cow premium) 05 03 02 13 (Sheep and goat premium) 05 03 02 14 (Sheep and goat supplementary premium) 05 03 02 28 (Aid for silkworms) 05 03 02 39 (Additional amount for sugarbeet and cane pr.) 05 03 02 40 (Area aid for cotton) 05 03 02 44 (Specific support, Art 68 \u2013 coupled payment) 05 03 02 50 (POSEI \u2013 Community support programmes) 05 03 02 52 (POSEI \u2013 Aegean Islands) 05 03 10 Reserve for agricultural crises   || APPROPRIATIONS: in EUR million   30 083 7 382 277 12 487 11 902 49 23 7 0.5 21 239 1089 407 18 424.5   \n 2. || TITLE: Draft REGULATION OF THE COUNCIL amending Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 964/2013 on fixing an adjustment rate to direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in respect of calendar year 2013   \n 3. || LEGAL BASIS: Article 18(4) and (5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy   \n 4. || AIMS: This draft regulation adapts the financial discipline adjustment rate to be applied to direct payments to be granted to farmers for aid applications lodged in respect of calendar year 2013 on the basis of the new information available. \n 5. || FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS || 12 MONTH PERIOD (EUR million) || CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR 2013 (EUR million) || FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR 2014 (EUR million) \n 5.0 || EXPENDITURE -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHARGED TO THE EU BUDGET (REFUNDS/INTERVENTIONS) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL AUTHORITIES -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OTHER || -902.9 + 424.5 || n.a. || -902.9 + 424.5 \n 5.1 || REVENUE -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OWN RESOURCES OF THE EU (LEVIES/CUSTOMS DUTIES) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 \n 5.0.1 || ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE ||   ||   ||   ||   \n 5.1.1 || ESTIMATED REVENUE ||   ||   ||   ||   \n 5.2 || METHOD OF CALCULATION: See Comments \n 6.0 || CAN THE PROJECT BE FINANCED FROM APPROPRIATIONS ENTERED IN THE RELEVANT CHAPTER OF THE CURRENT BUDGET?

The EAGF net ceiling for financial year 2014 is calculated based on the same principles as for the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 964/2013. The Amending Letter estimates of budget appropriations for direct aids and market related expenditure show the need to reduce the direct payments that can be granted to farmers in respect of calendar year 2013 by EUR 902.9 million, compared to EUR 1 471.4 million established in the Draft Budget. It includes an amount for the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector (EUR 424.5 million). The adapted adjustment rate necessary to respect the ceiling is 2.453658%. It has been calculated according to the same method as for the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 964/2013, i.e. taking into account that it is applied only to amounts in excess of EUR 2 000 and not in Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia because they are in the process of phasing-in in calendar year 2013.   The estimated amounts of financial discipline per budget item are the following (in EUR million):   05 03 01 01 (SPS) || 717.1 \n 05 03 01 02 (SAPS) || 103.2 \n 05 03 01 03 (Separate sugar payment) || 5.8 \n 05 03 01 04 (Separate F & V payment) || 0.2 \n 05 03 01 05 (Specific support Art 68 \u2013 decoupled payment) || 11.5 \n 05 03 01 06 (Separate soft fruit payment) || 0.2 \n 05 03 02 06 (Suckler cow premium) || 22.2 \n 05 03 02 07 (Additional national suckler cow premium) || 1.3 \n 05 03 02 13 (Sheep and goat premium) || 0.3 \n 05 03 02 14 (Sheep and goat supplementary premium) || 0.1 \n 05 03 02 28 (Aid for silkworms) || 0.0 \n 05 03 02 39 (Additional amount for sugarbeet and cane pr.) || 0.6 \n 05 03 02 40 (Area aid for cotton) || 6.2 \n 05 03 02 44 (Specific support, Art 68 \u2013 coupled payment) || 25.2 \n 05 03 02 50 (POSEI \u2013 Community support programmes) || 8.7 \n 05 03 02 52 (POSEI \u2013 Aegean Islands) || 0.3 \n   ||   \nThe regulation has budgetary implications in the sense that the\r\n  estimates of budget appropriations for direct payments (before considering\r\n  financial discipline) have been reduced by the amounts shown above following\r\n  the application of the adapted adjustment rate of the present proposal.
