It is therefore proposed that the Council adopt the\nattached proposal for a Regulation which should be published no later than 22\nFebruary 2013.\nLegal basis\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of\n30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not\nmembers of the European Community.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and\nadministrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional\nand local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and\nproportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason:\nOther means would not be adequate because\nthe basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n\n4.                      \nBUDGETARY IMPLICATION \n\nThe proposal has no implication for the\nUnion budget.\n2013/0009 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on\nimports of bioethanol originating in the United States of America\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning\nof the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[1]\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Article 9(4) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\nCommission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) after consulting the Advisory Committee, \nWhereas:\n1.                      \nPROCEDURE\n1.1.                \nInitiation\n(1)              \nOn 25 November 2011, the European Commission\n('the Commission') announced, by a notice ('NOI') published in the Official\nJournal of the European Union[2], the\ninitiation of an anti-dumping proceeding ('AD proceeding' or 'the proceeding')\nwith regard to imports into the Union of bioethanol\noriginating in the United States of America ('USA' or\n'the country concerned').\n(2)              \nOn the same day, the Commission announced, by a\nnotice published in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union[3], the initiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding with regard to\nimports into the Union of bioethanol originating in the USA and commenced a\nseparate investigation ('AS proceeding'). This proceeding will be terminated on\n21 December 2012 without imposition of countervailing measures.\n(3)              \nThe AD proceeding was initiated following a\ncomplaint lodged on 12 October 2011 by the European Producers Union of\nRenewable Ethanol Association (ePURE) ('the complainant') on behalf of\nproducers representing more than 25%, of the total Union production of\nbioethanol. The complaint contained prima facie evidence of dumping of\nthe said product and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was\nconsidered sufficient to justify the initiation of an investigation.\n1.2.                \nParties concerned by the proceeding\n(4)              \nThe Commission\nofficially advised the complainant, other known Union producers, the\nexporters/producers in the USA, importers, and other parties known to be\nconcerned, and the authorities of the USA of the initiation of the proceeding.\nInterested parties were given an opportunity to make their views known in\nwriting and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of\ninitiation. \n(5)              \nAll interested parties, who so requested and\nshowed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard, were granted a hearing.\n1.2.1.          \nSampling of exporters/producers in the USA\n(6)              \nIn view of the\npotentially large number of exporters/producers in the USA, sampling was\nenvisaged in the notice of initiation in accordance with Article 17 of the\nbasic Regulation.\n(7)              \nIn order to enable the Commission to decide\nwhether sampling would be necessary and if so, to select a sample,\nexporters/producers in the USA were asked to make themselves known within 15\ndays from the date of the initiation of the investigation and to reply to a\nsampling form providing, as specified in the notice of initiation, basic\ninformation on their activities related to production and sales of bioethanol\nduring the period from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2011 ('the investigation\nperiod' or 'the IP'). \n(8)              \nThe relevant US authorities were also consulted\nfor the selection of a representative sample.\n(9)              \nMore than 60 exporters/producers made themselves\nknown and provided the requested information within the 15 days deadline. \n(10)          \nIn accordance with Article 17 of the basic\nRegulation, the Commission selected a sample based on the largest\nrepresentative quantity of exports of bioethanol to the Union which could\nreasonably be investigated within the time available. The sample selected\nconsisted of six US bioethanol producers (US sample).\n(11)          \nDuring the investigation it was found that the\nproduction of one producer included in the US sample was not exported to the\nUnion in the IP. This company was therefore removed from the sample.\n(12)          \nDespite the fact that the other sampled\nproducers mentioned exports of bioethanol to the Union in their sampling form,\nthe investigation showed that none of them exported bioethanol to the Union\nmarket. In fact they were selling domestically to unrelated traders/blenders\nwhich then blended it with gasoline and resold it domestically and for export\nin particular to the Union. During the investigation on-spot, it became clear\nthat in fact, contrary to the impression that had resulted from the information\nprovided by the sampled US producers in their sampling forms, those producers\nwere not systematically aware whether or not their production was intended for\nthe Union market or any other destination including the US market and had no\nknowledge of the traders/blenders sales prices. In effect, this means that the\nUS producers of bioethanol are not the exporters of the product concerned to\nthe Union. The exporters are in fact the traders/blenders. Hence, the data\ncollected and verified at the level of the US sample at provisional stage did\nnot allow establishing whether or not US bioethanol was exported at dumped\nprices to the Union during the IP.\n(13)          \nNo anti-dumping measures could thus be imposed\nat that time. \n(14)          \nIn order to identify the exports of bioethanol\nto the Union, the US sample relied mainly on data provided to them by the\nunrelated blenders/traders which were not investigated at provisional stage.\nAlthough at provisional stage one such trader cooperated in the investigation\nand provided additional data, that data was not sufficient to establish\nprecisely and reliably the necessary data for the purpose of calculating dumping\nmargins.\n(15)          \nIn order to complete the dumping investigation,\nit was thus considered necessary to rather base it on the data of traders and\nblenders which were actually exporting the product concerned to the Union. \n(16)          \nDumping questionnaires were thus sent to the\neight largest US traders/blenders that were identified during the investigation\nof the US sample. These traders/blenders represent over 90% of total exports of\nbioethanol to the Union. Two agreed to cooperate in the investigation and their\nexports represent about 51% of total exports of bioethanol to the Union during\nthe IP.\n1.2.2.          \nSampling of Union producers\n(17)          \nIn view of the potentially large number of Union\nproducers, sampling was envisaged in the notice of initiation in accordance\nwith Article 17 of the basic Regulation. \n(18)          \nIn the notice of initiation the Commission\nannounced that it had provisionally selected a sample of Union producers (EU\nsample). This sample consisted of five companies and groups, out of the 19\nUnion producers that were known prior to the initiation of the investigation.\nThe sample was selected on the basis of the production volume of bioethanol\nduring the investigation period and the location of the known producers. This\nsample represented 48% of the total estimated Union production during the IP. \n(19)          \nBut the investigation revealed that the groups\nincluded in the EU sample consisted of a large number of companies or single\nentities producing and selling the like product. In this case it would have\nmeant to investigate 13 companies and it was not possible to investigate all of\nthem given the time available for the investigation. It was thus decided to\nre-examine the data available for the selection of a representative sample. It\nwas considered that the sample should be based on the largest individual\nproducing entities in the Union and in the groups taking also into account a\ncertain geographical spread amongst Union producers. \n(20)          \nHence, a definitive EU sample of six individual\nproducers was ultimately selected based on representativity in terms of the\nproduction and sales volume of bioethanol during the IP and the geographical\nlocation of the producer. These producers located in Belgium, the Netherlands,\nFrance, UK, Sweden and Germany represent 36% of the total estimated Union\nproduction and 44% of the total production reported by the companies that\nsubmitted data for the selection of a sample. This sample was deemed to be\nrepresentative for the examination of possible injury to the Union industry. \n(21)          \nInterested parties were given the opportunity to\ncomment on the appropriateness of the choice of the sample. \n(22)          \nSome parties claimed that the EU sample was less\nrepresentative than the one originally selected which included complete groups\nof companies. In their view, an objective analysis of the situation of the\nUnion industry could only be made by including all companies which are part of\ngroups in the sample. They alleged in particular that costs and revenues could\nbe allocated to certain companies of a group which are not visited and may thus\nnot be reflected in the injury analysis. \n(23)          \nIn this respect it should be noted that the\nCommission duly considered and examined the data provided by all sampled and\nnon-sampled companies and in particular the companies belonging to groups, in\norder to ensure that all costs and revenues involved in the production and sale\nby the companies selected in the sample had been fully and correctly reflected\nin the injury analysis. \n(24)          \nSome parties contested the inclusion in the EU\nsample of Union producers which were in a start-up phase. They also claimed\nthat one company with important idle capacity in 2011, located in a Member\nState that did not implement the Renewable Energies Directive ('RED'), should\nnot have been included in the sample. It was also claimed that in case these\ncompanies would be finally included in the sample, the Commission should adjust\ntheir data in order to account for these extraordinary circumstances.\n(25)          \nIt is considered that the fact that companies\nrecently started or resumed operations does not preclude them from being part\nof the sample. The inclusion of these companies is not in contravention with\nthe criteria for the selection of a sample as laid down in Article 17 of the\nbasic Regulation. With regard to the adjustment of their data, parties did not\nprovide any specific issue or substantiated evidence to support their claim,\nnor a basis on how to make the claimed adjustment. \n(26)          \nFurthermore, the investigation did not reveal\nany cost, such as for example accelerated depreciations, which should be\nadjusted to correct any distortion due to the start-up of activity. Hence, this\nclaim is rejected. \n(27)          \nSome parties also disputed the fact that one\ncompany that was provisionally selected in the EU sample and located in a\nMember State with high consumption and production of bioethanol was no longer\npart of the EU sample. They claimed that this economic situation of this\ncompany was good and suggested that this was the reason for its exclusion from\nthe sample. They further argued that the selection of the sample had been skewed\ntowards finding injury. According to these parties the Commission should have\nsent so called mini-questionnaires to all producers to collect the relevant\ndata in order to select a sample. \n(28)          \nWith regard to the sending of\nmini-questionnaires, it should be noted that, prior to the selection of the\nsample, the Commission requested information from all Union producers known to\nbe concerned in order to collect the relevant data for the purpose of the\nselection of a sample. As mentioned in point 5.2.1 of the NOI, this information\nwas available as from the date of the initiation of the investigation in the\nfile for inspection by interested parties and was not such as to show the state\nof the economic situation of the respondents. Hence, the Commission had\nsufficient relevant information at its disposal to select a representative\nsample respecting the criteria of Article 17 of the basic Regulation but could\nnot make any result-oriented selection of companies. The above claims were\ntherefore rejected.\n(29)          \nFinally, it was claimed that the sample should\nhave included companies producing bioethanol from sugar beet since production\nfrom this raw material can be much more profitable than production from, for\nexample, wheat. Even though this claim was not substantiated, the information\navailable has shown that bioethanol produced from sugar beet represents only a\nminor part of total Union production, around 12% in 2011 and that two of the\ncompanies included in the sample partially use sugar beet as feedstock to\nproduce bioethanol. Therefore, the claim is rejected. \n(30)          \nBased on the above, it is considered that the\nsample selected as explained above for the purpose of the injury analysis is\nrepresentative for the Union industry.\n\u00a0\n1.2.3.          \nSampling of unrelated importers\n(31)          \nIn view of the potentially large number of\nimporters involved in the proceeding, sampling was envisaged\nfor importers in the notice of initiation in accordance with Article 17 of the\nbasic Regulation.\n(32)          \nOnly three importers provided the requested\ninformation and agreed to be included in the sample within the deadline set in\nthe notice of initiation. In view of the limited number of cooperating importers, sampling was not deemed to be necessary.\n1.2.4.          \nQuestionnaire replies and verifications\n(33)          \nThe Commission sent questionnaires to all\nparties known to be concerned. Questionnaires were thus sent to the sampled USA\nexporters/producers, the sampled Union producers, the three cooperating\nunrelated importers in the Union and to all users known to be concerned by the\ninvestigation.\n(34)          \nReplies were received from the sampled USA\nexporters/producers, the sampled Union producers, two unrelated importers and\nfour users. \n(35)          \nThe Commission sought and verified all the\ninformation provided by interested parties and deemed necessary for the\npurposes of a definitive determination of dumping, resulting injury and Union\ninterest. \n(36)          \nVerification visits were carried out at the\npremises of the following companies:\nExporters/producers in the USA\n\u00b7      - Marquis Energy LLC, Hennepin, Illinois\n\u00b7      - Patriot Renewable Fuels LLC, Annawan, Illinois\n\u00b7      - Platinum Ethanol LLC, Arthur, Iowa\n\u00b7      - Plymouth Energy Company LLC, Merrill, Iowa\n\u00b7      - POET LLC, Wichita, Kansas and Sioux Falls, South Dakota\nUnrelated trader in the USA\n\u00b7      - Bio Urja Trading LLC, Houston, Texas\nRelated trader in Switzerland\n\u00b7      - Cargill International SA, Geneva\nProducers in the Union\n\u00b7      - Abengoa Energy Netherlands B.V., Rotterdam, the Netherlands\n\u00b7      - BioWanze, S.A.

Rotterdam, the\nNetherlands\n1.3.                \nInvestigation period and period\nconsidered\n(37)          \nThe investigation of dumping and injury covered\nthe period from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2011. The examination of trends\nrelevant for the assessment of injury covered the period from January 2008 to\nthe end of the IP (\u2018the period considered\u2019).\n2.                      \nPRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT\n2.1.                \nProduct concerned\n(38)          \nThe product concerned is bioethanol, sometimes\nreferred to as \u2018fuel ethanol\u2019, i.e. ethyl alcohol produced from agricultural\nproducts (as listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion), denatured or undenatured, excluding products with a water content of\nmore than 0,3 % (m/m) measured according to the standard EN 15376, but\nincluding ethyl alcohol produced from agricultural products (as listed in Annex\nI to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) contained in blends\nwith gasoline with an ethyl alcohol content of more than 10 % (v/v) originating\nin the USA, currently falling within CN codes ex\n2207 10 00, ex 2207 20 00, ex 2208 90 99, ex 2710 12 21, ex 2710 12 25, ex 2710\n12 31, ex 2710 12 41, ex 2710 12 45, ex 2710 12 49, ex 2710 12 51, ex 2710 12\n59, ex 2710 12 70, ex 2710 12 90, ex 3814 00 10, ex 3814 00 90, ex 3820 00 00\nand ex 3824 90 97. \n(39)          \nBioethanol can be produced from various\nagricultural feedstocks, such as sugar cane, sugar beet, potatoes, manioc and\ncorn. In the USA a distinction on the basis of the various feedstocks is made,\nas described below: \n(a) The Conventional Biofuel (mainly\nproduced from corn feedstock and commonly called corn ethanol) which is defined\nas a renewable fuel derived from corn starch produced from facilities that\ncommenced construction after the date of enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act in\nDecember 2007[4] and which must achieve in the future a 20% reduction in greenhouse\ngas ('GHG') emissions compared to baseline lifecycle GHG emissions of gasoline\nand diesel. \n(b) The Advanced Biofuel which is defined\nas a renewable fuel other than ethanol derived from corn starch, which is\nderived from renewable biomass and has lifecycle GHG emissions, as determined\nby the Energy Policy Act ('EPA') Administrator, that are at least 50% less than\nbaseline GHG emissions. This term includes \"cellulosic biofuels\" such\nas bioethanol and \"biomass-based diesel.\" The schedule for Advanced\nBiofuels includes the schedule for Cellulosic Biofuels, Biomass-Based Diesel,\nand Undifferentiated Advanced Biofuels.\n(40)          \nMore specifically, Cellulosic Biofuel[5] is defined as a renewable fuel derived from any cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin that is derived from renewable biomass\nand that has lifecycle GHG emissions, as determined by the EPA Administrator,\nthat are at least 60% less than the baseline lifecycle GHG emissions.\nCellulosic biofuels include cellulosic bioethanol. There are researches and\npilot projects largely supported by the US Federal Government for producing\nAdvanced Biofuels and in particular cellulosic bioethanol, produced in\nparticular out of agricultural and forestry wastes. According to US officials\nand publicly available data[6], the production of this type of bioethanol will reach around 4\nbillion litres in 2014 and more than 50 billion litres by 2021. Production of\ncellulosic bioethanol was negligible in the IP. \n(41)          \nDuring the investigation period up to now corn\nhas been the main feedstock used in the USA, while the main feedstock used in\nthe Union is wheat.\n(42)          \nThe investigation showed that bioethanol is\ngenerally sold in its pure form to blenders/traders which blend[7] it with gasoline in particular to produce high level blends which\nare exported or sold on the domestic market for further blending and used for\nfuel consumption. Blending is not a very complex operation and may be\naccomplished by mixing the products in special tanks adding the desired\npercentages of bioethanol and gasoline. \n(43)          \nTo identify the various types of bioethanol,\nbioethanol blends or mixtures in use around the world, ethanol fuel mixtures\nhave \"E\" numbers which describe the percentage of ethanol fuel in the mixture by volume. For example, E85 is 85% anhydrous ethanol and 15% gasoline. Low ethanol blends, from E5 to E25, are also\nknown as gasohol, though internationally the most common use of the term\ngasohol refers to the E10 blend. Blends of E10 or less have been used in more\nthan twenty countries around the world by 2011, led by the USA, where almost\nall retail gasoline sold in 2010 was blended with 10% of bioethanol. \n(44)          \nThe investigation showed that all types of\nbioethanol are considered to be biofuels under the current National Renewable Fuel Standard program (RFS1) established\nunder the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which amended the Clean Air Act by establishing the first national renewable\nfuel standard. The U.S. Congress gave the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the\nresponsibility to coordinate with the US Department of Energy, the US Department of Agriculture, and stakeholders\nto design and implement this program. \n(45)          \nAs a result of their energy policy the USA\nbecame the largest worldwide producer of bioethanol as from 2005 accounting for\n57,5% of global production. In 2009, the requirements under the EPA ensured\nthat at least 11 billion US gallons of renewable fuels were produced, in\nparticular to keep up with the targets established by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.\nThe large scale production also allowed US producers to become exporter of\nbioethanol to other markets, including the Union.\n(46)          \nBased on official sources, market and publicly\navailable information[8], all types of bioethanol and bioethanol in blends, namely mixtures\nof bioethanol with mineral gasoline as explained in recital (43) above, which\nare produced in the USA and sold either in the USA or exported are considered\nto be bioethanol fuels and are part of a legislative package concerning energy\nefficiency and renewable energy and alternative fuels in the USA. \n(47)          \nIt has been found that all types of bioethanol\nand bioethanol in blends covered by this investigation, despite possible\ndifferences in terms of feedstock used for the production, or variances in the\nproduction process, have the same or very similar basic physical, chemical and\ntechnical characteristics and are used for the same purposes. The possible\nminor variations in the product concerned do not alter its basic definition,\nits characteristics or the perception that various parties have of it.\n(48)          \nSome parties claimed that the definition of the\nproduct concerned was not clear, in particular because it did not allow for\ndistinguishing the bioethanol for fuel applications from that destined for\nother applications. Hence, they claimed that the investigation should\ncover ethanol for all uses and ethanol from all sources, including synthetic\nethanol that competes with bioethanol for industrial use. \n(49)          \nAnother party claimed the opposite, namely that\nthe investigation should only cover bioethanol for fuel applications and that\nbioethanol for industrial use should thus be excluded.\n(50)          \nIn this context, it is noted that the product\nconcerned should primarily be defined on the basis of its basic physical,\ntechnical and chemical characteristics and not its uses or applications. A\nproduct which has various applications may indeed have the same or similar\nbasic characteristics notwithstanding its further use and in certain\ncircumstances it may be necessary to deepen the analysis of the product\ndefinition and the product scope in the light of the specificity of the\nindustry and the market. \n(51)          \nIn the present case, it was clear that the\nnotice of initiation did not intend to cover synthetic ethanol in the product\ndefinition. Synthetic ethanol has different characteristics than bioethanol and\ndoes not correspond to the above criteria linked to the definition of the\nproduct concerned. There is no producer that focusses on the production of that\nproduct which took part in this investigation. Therefore, synthetic ethanol\ncannot be included in the definition of the product concerned and is outside\nthe scope of the investigation. Contrary to the suggestion made by some\nparties, this clarification does not lead to a change in the scope of the\ninvestigation or the definition of the product concerned and did not have any\nimpact on the quality of the data used.\n(52)          \nBioethanol for fuel application and bioethanol\ndestined to other applications may have similar characteristics. However,\nduring the investigation dumping was examined at the level of USA operators\nwhich produced or blended bioethanol for fuel application, namely bioethanol to\nbe included in a fuel mixture. Similarly, the investigation of Union producers\nfocussed on bioethanol destined to fuel applications and not for other uses.\nHence, bioethanol destined to applications other than fuel should not be\ncovered by the scope of this investigation.\n(53)          \nThe importers which will not use the imported\nUSA bioethanol for fuel application have the possibility to make a declaration\nsubject to the end use provisions as established by the\nImplementing provisions embedded in Articles 291 to 300 of the Union Customs\nCode[9].\n2.2.                \nLike product\n(54)          \nIt was found that bioethanol manufactured by the\nUnion industry and sold on the Union market have similar\nbasic physical, chemical and technical characteristics when compared to\nbioethanol exported to the Union from the USA.\n(55)          \nAs described in recital (39) above, bioethanol\ncan be produced from various feedstocks. However, the investigation did not\npoint to the fact that the feedstock used would lead into any differences in\nthe characteristics of the end-product. It was found that the product concerned\nproduced in the USA in particular from corn and exported to the Union is\ninterchangeable with that produced in particular from wheat and sold in the\nUnion by Union producers. In addition, there are no significant differences, if\nany, in the uses and the perception by operators and users in the market\nconcerning bioethanol. \n(56)          \nIt is therefore confirmed that bioethanol\nproduced and sold in the Union and the product concerned exported from the USA\nshould be considered to be alike within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the\nbasic Regulation. \n(57)          \nSome of the sampled US producers claimed that\nthe bioethanol produced and sold on the USA market is not like the product\nconcerned, since it does not strictly correspond to the wording of the product\ndescription as laid out in the notice of initiation. Effectively, the types\nbioethanol sold on the USA market have a water content above the threshold of\n0,3% and corresponds to the USA standard (ASTM) rather than EN 15376.\n(58)          \nHowever, the investigation showed that\nbioethanol produced for sales on the US market largely shares the same basic\nphysical, chemical and technical characteristics as the product concerned.\nArticle 1(4) of the basic Regulation stipulates that a like product should not\nnecessarily be alike in all respects to the product concerned, but it could be\na product that although not alike in all respects, has characteristics closely\nresembling those of the product concerned. This is the\ncase for the bioethanol sold in the US market and the bioethanol exported to\nthe Union. There are precedents where products were considered to be like the\nproduct concerned in spite of certain differences[10]. \n(59)          \nIt was therefore decided to reverse the\nprovisional finding and consider that the ASTM bioethanol sold in the US market\nis a like product to the product concerned within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation. \n3.                      \nDUMPING\n3.1.                \nIntroduction\n(60)          \nAs explained in recitals (6) to (16) above, in\norder to investigate the possible existence of dumping,\nthe investigation covered producers of bioethanol, on the one hand, and\ntraders/blenders which were exporting the product concerned to the Union\nmarket, on the other hand.\n(61)          \nPursuant to Article 9(5) of the basic\nRegulation, the regulation imposing the duty shall specify the duty for each\nsupplier or if that is impracticable, the duty for the supplying country\nconcerned. \n(62)          \nCertain producers claimed that it was possible\nto identify and trace their products when sold to US operators for export, in\nparticular to the Union. They referred to the certification process foreseen by\nthe RED but they could not in particular make the link between their sales in\nthe US market and the exports made by other operators to the EU. As mentioned\nin recital (12) above and (63) below, these producers were also not aware of\nthe level of the export price to the Union. \n(63)          \nIn the present case it was found that the\nstructure of the bioethanol industry and the way the product concerned was\nproduced and sold in the US market and exported to the Union, made it\nimpracticable to establish individual dumping margins for US producers. More\nspecifically, the producers in the US sample did not export the product\nconcerned to the Union and the investigated traders/blenders sourced bioethanol\nfrom various producers, blended it and sold it in particular for export to the\nUnion, hence, contrary to allegations made by the above parties, it was not\npossible to trace all purchases individually and compare the normal values with\nthe relevant export prices and it is not possible to identify the producer at\nthe moment of the export to the Union. In other\nwords, each shipment made to the EU contains bioethanol produced by various US\nproducers in the US and not only by the US sample. Moreover, the investigation\nalso showed that the price level at which the US sample charged their US\ncustomers in the USA was not in line with the actual price paid or payable for\nthe product concerned when exported to the Union. \n(64)          \nTherefore, it is considered that a countrywide\ndumping margin should be established. \n3.2.                \nNormal value\n(65)          \nFor the determination of normal value in\naccordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, the Commission first\nestablished whether the domestic sales of the product concerned by the two\nco-operating traders/blenders to independent customers were made in\nrepresentative volumes, i.e. whether the total volume of such sales represented\nat least 5% of the total export sales volume to the Union during the IP.\n(66)          \nGiven that the sales of the like product in the\ndomestic market were made in sufficient quantity, normal value was determined\non the basis of the price paid or payable to the two aforementioned\ntraders/blenders, in the ordinary course of trade, by independent customers in\nthe USA.\n3.3.                \nExport price\n(67)          \nThe cooperating traders/blenders provided data\nwhich allowed establishing an export price on the basis\nof their prices that are actually paid or payable in accordance with Article\n2(8) of the basic Regulation. For those transactions for which the imports into\nthe Union were made through a related trading company, the export price was\nconstructed on the basis of the first resale price of the related trader to\nindependent customers in the Union, pursuant to Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation.\n(68)          \nAs regard the sales made via the related trader\nlocated in Switzerland, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A)\nand profit were not deducted from the export price as they were considered not\nto be costs between importation and resale in the Union. The investigation\nshowed that the principal activity of the related trader consisted of cash\nmanagement for the \"sugar\" business unit to which biofuels belong and\nthe hedging of the risks inherent in the agricultural business by concluding\nderivative contracts on both over the counter and organised financial markets.\n(69)          \nSome US producers claimed that it is the\ninstitutions constant practice to take the exporter's sales price to the first\nindependent customer as the export price to use for dumping calculations. In\nthis case, this price would be the US producers' sales price to US unrelated\ntraders/blenders. However, as mentioned in recitals (62) and (63) above, none\nof the US producers of bioethanol exported the product concerned to the Union\nand they were not aware of the level of the export price to the EU. Hence,\ntheir domestic price cannot be used as it is not an export price paid or\npayable for the product concerned in the Union. Their claim cannot therefore be\naccepted.\n3.4.                \nComparison \n(70)          \nThe comparison between the weighted average\nnormal value and the weighted average export price per product type established\nfor the cooperating traders/blenders was made on an ex-works basis, taking into\naccount, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, differences\nin factors which were demonstrated to affect prices and price comparability. One\ntrader/blender claims that the data on domestic sales was not representative.\nAs the trader/blenders failed to provide data on all domestic sales, the\ncalculation is based on the ones provided in the questionnaire and during the\non-spot visit.\n(71)          \nOne trader/blender argues that the calculation\nof the domestic sales price should be based on spot market data from the NYMEX.\nThe Commission considers that verified data from the two trader/blenders is\nmore reliable.\n(72)          \nFor this purpose, due allowance in the form of\nadjustments was made for differences in transport, insurance, handling, loading\nand ancillary costs where applicable and justified. \n(73)          \nThe product concerned and the like product\npresent the particularity that traders/blenders have received a subsidy mainly\nin the form of excise tax credits during the IP on their sales of bioethanol\nblends. The method used to establish normal value and export price is a method\nwhere the actual sales prices, domestic and export of the said traders/blenders\nare fully taken into account. Hence, a comparison of sales made by\ntraders/blenders in the US market and export prices of traders/blenders to the\nEU, in order to calculate the level of dumping on the product concerned,\neliminates any possible impact the subsidy may have had on prices, since the\nsubsidy equally affected both domestic and export sales during the IP. One trader/blender\nclaimed that it had not received a subsidy for its domestic sales. However, it\nfails to provide proof for this claim; the claim is also difficult to reconcile\nwith information provided by the US authorities on the use of the subsidy. \n3.5.                \nDumping\n(74)          \nAs provided for in Article 2(11) of the basic\nRegulation, the weighted average normal value by product type was compared to\nthe weighted average export price of the corresponding product type of the\nproduct concerned. Based on that comparison, the cooperating unrelated\ntraders/blenders were found to have engaged in dumping practices.\n(75)          \nThe weighted average dumping margin of 9,5% was\nestablished based on the aggregated data of the cooperating traders/blenders,\nand represents the countrywide dumping margin for the USA.\n(76)          \nSome of the US producers included in the sample\nclaimed that in the case of imposition of definitive anti-dumping measures,\nthey expected to obtain their individual duty margin. In the light of the contents\nof recitals (6) to (16) and the reasoning in recitals (60) to (64) above, this\nclaim cannot be accepted as the investigation confirmed that for these\noperators, in particular because they did not have any exports to the Union\nduring the IP, it was not possible to trace their products when exported to the\nUnion and they had generally no idea of the timing of the export and of the\nprice paid or payable by Union importers, hence an export price and a dumping\nmargin could not be reliably established for these producers. \n(77)          \nCertain producers requested more information on\nthe dumping calculations established for the two cooperating traders/blenders. However,\nit should be considered on the one hand that the information requested contains\nbusiness secret information and cannot therefore be disclosed to other parties\nthan the party concerned. On the other, it is constant practice of the\ninstitutions to disclose the general method used to establish dumping to all\nparties for which no individual data was used in the calculations. This method\nwas described in the general disclosure document sent to all parties. \n4.                      \nINJURY\n4.1.                \nUnion production and Union industry\n(78)          \nThe Union production was established on the\nbasis of a market report provided by the complainant during the investigation.\nThe total Union production of the like product stated in this report was\ncompared with the information provided by the 17 cooperating Union producers. A\nsmall difference of around 5% was found between the two sets of data. This is\nexplained by the fact that some relatively small non-cooperating Union\nproducers did not submit production information. On this basis, the total Union\nproduction was estimated at 3,42 million tonnes during the IP. The Union\nproducers accounting for the total Union production constitute the Union\nindustry within the meaning of Articles 4(1) and 5(4) of the basic Regulation\nand will therefore be referred to as the \"Union Industry\".\n4.2.                \nUnion consumption\n(79)          \nUnion consumption was established on the basis\nof the total Union production of the Union industry, adding the volume of\nimports from third countries established on the basis of the best available\nstatistics, whereas the stock variation and exports of the Union industry as\nreported by the Union industry were deducted. Some parties claimed that the\nstatistics used to establish consumption were not complete because significant\nimports of bioethanol from other third countries, especially in the IP, were\nnot taken into consideration. They also considered that the volume of imports\nfrom the US was overestimated by the Commission and that figures for\nconsumption and market share were therefore unreliable. \n(80)          \nThese claims were analysed and cross-checked\nwith the information available. Regarding the imports from other countries, the\nparties did not provide any evidence regarding the volumes of imports of the\nproduct concerned. Nevertheless, imports from other countries were taken into\nconsideration in the estimation of the imports. For the volume of US imports, a\nclerical error was found in the estimation of US imports during the IP. Hence,\nthe volume of imports has been re-assessed and adjusted where necessary.\nHowever, this has no impact on the conclusions reached in the injury and\ncausality assessments.\n(81)          \nRegarding the imports of the product concerned,\nit should be underlined that there is no specific customs Combined nomenclature\ncodes for the product concerned. Moreover, the Combined Nomenclature codes\nwhere the product concerned can be declared to the customs authorities include\nother products in addition to the product concerned. \n(82)          \nFor the imports of bioethanol blends, the\nverified questionnaire responses of the unrelated importers have shown that most\nof the imports were declared at customs under the TARIC code 3824 90 97 99.\nHowever, the volume of imports cannot be obtained directly from Eurostat\nbecause this TARIC code includes various chemical products in addition to the\nproduct concerned. . \n(83)          \nRegarding the imports declared under the\nCombined Nomenclature codes 2207 10 00 and 2207 20 00, it was not possible to\ndifferentiate between the product concerned and other products not concerned by\nthe investigation due to the absence of sufficient information regarding the\nproduct imported.\n(84)          \nTherefore, in the absence of complete imports\ndetails retrievable from Eurostat, it was decided to use also other sources of\ninformation for the purpose of establishing the imports of the product\nconcerned in the Union market.\n(85)          \nIn order to get the best estimate of the imports\nof the product concerned originating in the USA, it was considered that the\nmost reliable basis were the statistics provided by the US International Trade\nCommission (ITC). The volumes of exports reported correspond to the US tariff\ncodes 2207 10 60 and 2207 20 00. \n(86)          \nA reasonable approach was adopted to estimate\nthese imports and all the quantities reported by the US International Trade\nCommission were taken into consideration for establishing the US imports into\nthe Union market.\n(87)          \nThe estimate concerning the imports in the Union\noriginating from Brazil was based on the following sources of information:\nreports issued by the United Kingdom Renewable Fuels Agency for the imports in\nthe United Kingdom; extractions of customs import detailed database provided by\nthe Netherlands, Sweden and Finland and by Eurostat. For the Netherlands,\nSweden and Finland, the volume of imports was estimated on the basis of the\nimporter and exporter names and the product description when available. To\nestimate these imports, a conservative approach was adopted. All the quantities\nreported were taken into consideration for the calculation of the imports.\n(88)          \nFinally, Eurostat was also used to estimate the\nresidual imports into the Union for the Member States other than those\nmentioned in recital (87) above. An adjustment to the import volumes was\napplied on the basis of the percentage of bioethanol used as fuel in the Union.\nThe source of this adjustment can be found in the complaint. This percentage\nwas obtained from the annual ethyl alcohol balance published by the European\nCommission[11]. The percentage of bioethanol used for fuel in the Union was 54% in\n2008, 66% in 2009, and 68% in 2010. For the IP, the percentage of 2010 was used\nfor the purpose of estimating the relevant imports made during the IP.\n(89)          \nFor the estimation of the imports from other\norigins, the sources of information used were Eurostat and the extractions of\ncustoms import detailed database provided by the Netherlands, Sweden and\nFinland. The same methodology as that used to establish Brazilian imports was\nused. \n(90)          \nRegarding the calculation of the CIF average\nunit price for imports from the USA and from Brazil, the source of information\nis the extraction of customs import detailed database provided by the\nNetherlands, Sweden and Finland. And for the USA, also data from the verified\nunrelated importer questionnaire was used. For the USA, the CIF average prices\nfor 2008 and 2009 were estimated on the basis of the average price reported by\nthe US ITC for these years, expressed in relation with the CIF average price\nunit obtained for 2010.\n(91)          \nThe stock variation was established on the basis\nof the Union industry information provided by the complainant.\n(92)          \nOn this basis Union consumption was found to\nhave developed as follows:\n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Total Union production (tonnes) (A) || 2.153.118 || 2.797.948 || 3.274.665 || 3.389.503 \n Total imports from third countries including the country concerned (tonnes) (B) || 1.252.705 || 1.130.703 || 859.605 || 1.031.226 \n Total exports from Union industry to non-EU countries (tonnes) (C) || 26.263 || 41.023 || 53.085 || 59.633 \n Stock variation[12] (tonnes) (C) || 0 || 4.730 || -8.415 || -5.458 \n Union Consumption (tonnes) || 3.379.559 || 3.882.897 || 4.089.600 || 4.366.554 \n Index: 2008=100 || 100 || 115 || 121 || 129 \nSource: (A)\nmarket report, (B) Eurostat, the US International Trade Commission, the UK\nRenewable Fuels Agency and customs import database provided by the Netherlands,\nSweden and Finland; (C) complaint, questionnaire replies from the sampled Union\nproducers, Union industry information provided in the complaint\n(93)          \nDuring the period considered, the Union\nconsumption increased significantly, by 29%.

Similarly, the market share held by the US exporters in the Union\nsignificantly increased from 1,9% to 15,7% over this period. \n(96)          \nAlthough the average US import prices increased\nby 6% over the period considered, prices charged by US exporters were\nconsistently lower than the average Union producers' prices as explained in\nrecital (117) below. This systematic price undercutting practiced by the US\nexporters explains the significant increase in market share they achieved over\nthe period considered. \n4.3.2.          \nPrice undercutting of imports from the\ncountry concerned\n(97)          \nFor the purpose of assessing any price\nundercutting during the IP, the weighted average sales prices per product type\nof the sampled Union producers charged to unrelated customers on the Union\nmarket, adjusted to an ex-works level, were compared to the corresponding\nweighted average prices per product type of the US exporters charged to the\nfirst independent customer on the Union market, established on a CIF basis. In\norder to allow a fair price comparison, the appropriate adjustments for the\nexisting customs duties and post-importation costs were applied to the US\nprice.\n(98)          \nThe results of this comparison, when expressed\nas a percentage of the sampled Union producers' sales prices during the\ninvestigation period, showed consistent price undercutting of 5,6% on average.\nThis price undercutting indicates the price pressure which was exerted by the\nimports from the country concerned on the Union market, in particular during\nthe IP.\n4.4.                \nEconomic situation of the Union industry\n4.4.1.          \nPreliminary remarks\n(99)          \nIn accordance with Article 3(5) of the basic\nRegulation, the examination of the impact of the dumped imports on the Union\nindustry included an evaluation of all economic indicators for an assessment of\nthe state of the Union industry over the period considered.\n(100)      \nThe injury analysis with regard to macroeconomic\ndata such as production, production capacity, capacity utilisation, sales\nvolume, market share, growth, inventories, employment, productivity and\nmagnitude of the dumping margin is based on the data of the Union industry as a\nwhole from ePURE.\n(101)      \nThe injury analysis with regards to\nmicroeconomic data such as prices, profitability, cash flow, investment, return\non investment, ability to raise capital, wages and inventories have been\nestablished on the basis of data provided by the sampled Union producers\nthrough verified questionnaire replies.\n(102)       The bioethanol industry is still in a start-up phase in the Union.\nCompanies have recently invested in new production facilities or have expanded\nexisting capacities to meet the growing demand in the Union. The fact that new\nproducers started production during the period considered led to positive\ndevelopments for indicators such as production, production capacity, sales\nvolume and employment. \n(103)       The investigation also showed that this type of industry needs a\ncertain time, between two to three years from the moment of start-up, to reach\nnormal levels of production.\n\u00a0\n4.4.2.          \nProduction, production capacity and\ncapacity utilisation\n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Production volume (tonnes) || 2.153.118 || 2.797.948 || 3.274.665 || 3.389.503 \n Index: 2008=100 || 100 || 130 || 152 || 157 \n Production capacity (tonnes) || 3.443.766 || 3.992.640 || 4.670.076 || 4.734.915 \n Index: 2008=100 || 100 || 116 || 136 || 137 \n Capacity utilisation || 63% || 70% || 70% || 72% \n Index: 2008=100 || 100 || 112 || 112 || 114 \nSource: based\non data from the Union industry provided by the complainant\n(104)      \nAs a result of the RED, Union production grew\nsignificantly in the period considered, by around 57%. From 2008 to 2010 the\nUnion production increased by 36% but subsequently, the growth rate slowed down\nsignificantly and was only 3,5% in the IP compared to 2010. \n(105)      \nProduction capacity increased by 37% during the\nperiod considered and followed a similar pattern as production. \n(106)      \nCapacity utilisation increased by 14% during the\nperiod considered and this increase was achieved in the beginning of the period\nconsidered. Given the start-up phase of certain Union producers in 2009, it was\nexpected that capacity utilisation would have increased further as producers\nnormally need between two to three years from the start-up to reach normal\nlevels of production, as explained in recital (103) above. This has however not\nbeen the case. \n(107)       The investigation thus confirmed that several companies in the EU\nstarted operation in the beginning or during the period considered due to the\nexpected publication of the RED. This led to positive developments in\nparticular for the above injury factors especially in the period up to 2010.\nBut the situation in the Union market changed in coincidence with the surge of\nUS dumped imports in 2010 and the growth in activity expected during the IP did\nnot materialise. \n4.4.3.          \nSales volume and market share\n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Sales volume (tonnes) || 2.035.367 || 2.650.526 || 3.117.410 || 3.229.326 \n Index: 2008=100 || 100 || 130 || 152 || 159 \n Market share || 60,2% || 68,3% || 76,2% || 74,0% \n Index: 2008=100 || 100 || 113 || 126 || 122 \nSource: based\non data from the Union industry provided by the complainant\n(108)      \nSales volume of the Union industry increased by\n59% and 13,8 percentage points of market share were gained during the period\nconsidered. Sales volume grew steadily between 2008 and 2010 but between 2010\nand the IP the sales volume grew less than consumption which increased by 6,8%\nin that period.\n(109)      \nSimilarly, the Union industry market share\nincreased until 2010 but then decreased during the IP. In the period between\n2010 and the IP, whilst the US imports almost doubled their market share,\ngaining 7,2 percentage points, the Union industry lost 2,2 percentage points. \n4.4.4.          \nGrowth \n(110)      \nUnion consumption increased significantly during\nthe period considered, by 29,2%. Although sales volume and market share also\nincreased during this period, the Union industry did not fully benefit from\nthis growth in consumption, in particular as from 2010. From 2010 up to the IP,\ngrowth in sales volume of the Union industry slowed down and market share\ndecreased compared to the previous years.\n(111)      \nSome parties claimed that the growth pattern\nshown by certain indicators during the period considered do not reflect the\nsituation of an injured industry. However, as explained above, the\ninvestigation showed that the slowdown of growth of the Union industry in 2010\nand in the IP coincided with the surge of low-priced dumped imports from the\nUSA. \n4.4.5.          \nEmployment and productivity \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Number of employees || 2.331 || 2.419 || 2.523 || 2.552 \n Index: 2008=100 || 100 || 104 || 108 || 109 \n Productivity (unit/employee) || 924 || 1157 || 1298 || 1.328 \n Index: 2008=100 || 100 || 125 || 141 || 144 \nSource:based on\ndata from the Union industry provided by the complainant\n(112)      \nEmployment increased by 9% in the period\nconsidered. More specifically, it grew by 8% from 2008 to 2010 but increased\nonly marginally by 1% during the IP. This trend reflects the trend for capacity\nand production in the Union.\n(113)      \nThe productivity of the Union industry workforce\nwas measured as the output per person employed in one year. It increased\nsignificantly over the period considered by 44%, reflecting the learning effect\nand increase in efficiency during and after the start-up phase. \n4.4.6.          \nMagnitude of the actual dumping margin\n(114)      \nGiven the volume, market share and prices of the\ndumped imports from the country concerned, the impact on the Union industry of\nthe dumping margins established during the IP cannot be considered to be\nnegligible.\n4.4.7.          \nRecovering from the effects of past\ndumping\n(115)      \nThis issue is not relevant in this case due to\nthe absence of past dumping effects.\n\u00a0\n4.4.8.          \nAverage unit prices of the Union industry\n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Unit prices (EUR) || 702,59 || 634,88 || 657,41 || 768,59 \n Index: 2008=100 || 100 || 90 || 94 || 109 \nSource:\nquestionnaire replies of sampled Union producers.\n(116)       Prices of the Union industry increased overall by 9% during the\nperiod considered.

However, the investigation showed that the\nprice increases were not sufficient to allow the Union Industry to cover its\ncosts. The gap between the sale prices and the costs further increased in\nparticular during the IP. This situation coincides with the increased presence\nof low-priced US dumped imports in the Union market.\n(117)       The investigation showed that Union industry's prices remained\nhigher (up to 23%) than those of the dumped imports from the USA over the\nperiod considered.\n4.4.9.          \nProfitability, cash flow, investments,\nreturn on investment and ability to raise capital\n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Net profit before tax (EUR) || -33.305.225 || 1.343.823 || -33.932.738 || -82.070.168 \n Index: 2008= -100 || -100 || 4 || -102 || -246 \n Profitability of Union sales (% of net sales) || -11,65% || 0,33% || -5,72% || -9,74% \n Index: 2008= -100 || -100 || 3 || -49 || -84 \n Cash flow (EUR) || -2.528.061 || 34.783.260 || 48.733.697 || 36.832.646 \n Index: 2008=-100 || -100 || 1376 || 1928 || 1457 \n Cash flow in % of Union Sales to unrelated parties || -0,9% || 8,7% || 8,2% || 4,4% \n Index: 2008=-100 || -100 || 980 || 930 || 494 \n Investments (EUR) || 330.441.830 || 86.279.988 || 38.710.739 || 23.018.175 \n Index: 2008=100 || 100 || 26 || 12 || 7 \n Return on investment || -10% || 2% || -88% || -357% \n Index: 2008=100 || -100 || 15 || -870 || -3538 \nSource:\nQuestionnaire replies of sampled Union producers \n(118)      \nProfitability of the Union industry was established\nboth in absolute amounts (net profit before tax) and by expressing the pre-tax\nnet profit or loss as a percentage of the turnover of the sales of the like\nproduct.

In that period, certain injury indicators pertaining\nto the economic situation of the Union industry improved, but the growth was\nnot in line with the increase in consumption during the period considered and\nthe improvements were thus not sufficient to allow the Union industry to\ndevelop its activities.\n(125)      \nAs is normal in a new and growing activity,\ncertain indicators, such as sales volume, production, and capacity utilisation\nshowed a positive trend during the period considered. This is explained by the\nfact that new Union producers entered the market in that period. Nevertheless,\nthe investigation showed that the situation in the Union market, as from 2010\nwhen the surge of low-priced imports occurred, did not allow Union producers to\nreach a sufficient activity and price level in order to develop and to sustain\nthe important investments made in the period considered.\n(126)      \nIt was found that the low-priced imports\nconstantly undercut the prices of the Union industry. The level of prices did\nnot allow that industry to cover its costs and realise the cash flow and\nprofits, which are necessary to develop the activities.\n(127)      \nIndeed, the injury indicators related to the\nfinancial performance of the Union industry, such as profitability, cash flow\nand return on investment deteriorated or remained far below the normal level.\nThis seriously affected the Union industry's ability to raise capital and to\nfurther invest in its activities.\n(128)      \nIn the light of the foregoing, it was considered\nthat the Union industry suffered material injury during the IP within the\nmeaning of Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation. \n5.                      \nCAUSATION\n5.1.                \nIntroduction\n(129)      \nIn accordance with Articles 3(5) and 3(6) of the\nbasic anti-dumping Regulation, it was examined whether the dumped imports of\nthe product concerned originating in the country concerned caused injury to the\nUnion industry; Known factors other than the dumped imports, which could at the\nsame time be injuring the Union industry, were also examined to ensure that\npossible injury caused by these other factors was not attributed to the dumped\nimports.\n5.2.                \nEffect of the dumped imports\n(130)      \nAs mentioned above, Union consumption grew\nsubstantially during the period considered, by 29,%. However, the dumped\nimports from the country concerned significantly increased in volume, i.e. from\n1,9% share of the Union market at the beginning of the period considered to\n15,7% during the IP. This clearly exerted pressure on the Union industry,\nparticularly from 2010 until the end of the IP, when these imports more than\ndoubled. From 2010, and in particular during the IP, large volumes of\nlow-priced imports from the USA were present on the Union market and were\nundercutting the prices of the Union industry. This situation did not allow the\nindustry to develop as expected during the IP.\n(131)      \nSome parties have argued that the situation of\nthe Union industry improved precisely from 2010 to the IP, coinciding with the\ndoubling of imports from the USA. As explained above in recitals (102) and (107),\nthe fact that many Union producers started to enter the market during the\nperiod considered led to positive trends in certain injury factors, such as\nproduction and sales volume. However, the Union industry lost market share in\nthe IP compared to 2010 while at the same time the Union market experienced the\nhighest increase of US dumped imports. The existence of price undercutting and\nprice pressure led to the deterioration of the general financial situation, in\nparticular the profitability, of the Union industry. \n(132)      \nThe low-priced imports thus have played a\nsignificant role in the material injury suffered by the Union industry during\nthe IP.\n5.3.                \nEffect of other factors\n(133)      \nThe following known factors, other than the\ndumped imports, which might have injured the Union industry, were examined to\nensure that any injury caused by those factors was not attributed to the dumped\nimports: the imports from other countries, the export performance of the Union\nindustry, the impact of the economic crisis and other factors such as the raw\nmaterial prices fluctuations, development of demand and alleged internal\nproblems of companies in the Union industry.\n5.3.1.          \nImports from other countries (Brazil)\n(134)      \nAccording to the information available, apart\nfrom Brazil, there was no other country exporting the product concerned to the\nUnion in significant quantities in the period considered. In terms of prices,\nBrazilian import prices have remained well below those of the Union producers'.\nHowever, imports from Brazil, clearly showed a decreasing trend in volume\n(-81%), and market share (-25,8%) during the period considered. In consequence,\nsince the import volumes were reduced to such a low level during the IP, they\ncannot be considered to have broken the causal link between the low-priced\nimports from the USA and the injury of the Union industry during the IP. \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Volume of imports originating from Brazil (tonnes) || 1.022.980 || 884.020 || 396.249 || 195.342 \n Index: 2008=100 || 100 || 86 || 39 || 19 \n Market share of imports from Brazil (%) || 30,3% || 22,8% || 9,7% || 4,5% \n CIF average unit price (EUR / tonne of imports) || 560,8 || 496,2 || 580,8 || 622,4 \n Index: 2008=100 || 100 || 88 || 104 || 111 \nSource: Eurostat,\nthe UK Renewable Fuels Agency, customs import database provided by the Netherlands,\nSweden and Finland and the complaint.\n(135)      \nParties claimed that imports from Brazil\nremained above the de minimis level throughout the period considered,\nand that they were made at dumped prices on the Union market. They further\nargued that imports from the USA, only replaced the market share left by the Brazilian\nimports. The imports from the USA can therefore allegedly not be considered to\nbe the cause of the material injury of the Union industry. \n(136)      \nAs explained above, Brazilian imports decreased\nsignificantly in the period considered. Their market share decreased from 30,3%\nto 4,5% at a time when consumption significantly increased. Given the price\nlevel practiced by Brazilian exporters in the Union market, it cannot be\nexcluded that the presence of Brazilian bioethanol contributed to some extent\nto the injury of the Union industry. However, it is considered that these\nimports were reduced to such a level during the IP that they cannot be regarded\nas a major cause of that injury. Indeed, in period between 2010 and the IP,\nwhilst imports from Brazil decrease by about 200 000 tons, the dumped imports\nfrom the USA increased by over 330 000 tons. It is thus considered that the\npresence of the Brazilian bioethanol in the Union market, in particular during\nthe IP, cannot be such as to break the causal link established between the\ndumped imports from the USA and the injurious situation of the Union industry\nin that period. \n5.3.2.          \nExport performance of the Union industry \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Sales volume for export (tonnes) || 26.263 || 41.023 || 53.085 || 59.633 \nSource:\nComplaint and questionnaire replies of sampled Union producers\n(137)      \nThe investigation showed that small volumes of\nbioethanol were exported by the Union industry during the IP at prices largely\nabove those practiced on the Union market. This has led to the conclusion that\nthe export performance is not a factor that broke the causal link between the\ninjury suffered by the Union industry and the dumped imports from the country\nconcerned.\n5.3.3.          \nThe impact of the economic crisis\n(138)      \nThe economic crisis was not found to have had a\nnegative impact on the Union industry. Consumption of bioethanol in the Union\nexperienced its biggest increase in 2009, the year generally considered to be\nthe worst year of the economic crisis. In the same period, production and sales\nby Union producers also increased. \n(139)      \nBased on the above, it is considered that the\neconomic crisis did not break the causal link between the low-priced imports\nfrom the country concerned and the material injury suffered by the Union\nindustry.\n5.3.4.          \nOther factors\n(140)      \nParties have also mentioned other factors that\ncould have broken the causal link such as the fluctuation of the raw material\nprices, the development of demand which was lower than expected, a regulatory\nframework in the Union that allegedly plays against Union producers and certain\nalleged internal problems of Union producers. \n(141)      \nRegarding the fluctuations in the raw material\nprices, both prices of corn and wheat were found to be volatile during the\nperiod considered. The investigation showed that most producers however hedge\nthis risk through a specific price setting mechanism with their suppliers or\nthrough the financial markets. Hence even if prices of feedstock did differ in\nparticular from 2008 until 2010, when the price for corn was lower than the\nprice of wheat, feedstock prices in the second half of the IP were more or less\nthe same. This indicates that any price difference is reduced to a minimum and\nis not of a lasting nature. \n(142)      \nSome parties have claimed that the\nimplementation of the RED in Member States has been too slow and that\nconsumption lagged behind the targets established by the mentioned Directive.\nBut, even if initial targets were not fully met within the period considered\nthe fact that consumption has grown significantly, namely by 29,2%, in that\nperiod is a positive factor that cannot be ignored in the analysis. In any\nevent, the alleged slow implementation of the RED cannot justify the presence\nof high volumes of low-priced dumped imports in the Union market undercutting\nthe prices of the Union industry and causing injury to that industry. Hence,\nthe claim is rejected.\n(143)      \nParties have also argued that the Union industry\nalone could not meet Union demand as a result of regulatory uncertainty and\nthat the system of certification is very slow and thus undermine the benefits\nfor the certified Union producers. Some parties have finally argued that the\nfact that many Union producers suffered internal problems during the period\nconsidered explains any injury they suffered. These claims were however not\nsubstantiated and the investigation did not confirm that these claims were\nfounded. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the investigation showed\nthat any alleged low level of the Union production was mainly justified by a\nlow level of sales prices in the Union market which was largely affected by the\nsurge of low-priced US dumped imports undercutting the Union producers prices,\nin particular during the IP. It appeared that EU producers had no other choice\nthan stopping production as prices did not even allow them to cover the cost of\nthe raw material in particular during the IP. Hence, the above unsubstantiated\nclaims are not such as to break the causal link between the dumped imports and\nthe injurious situation of the Union industry during the IP. \n(144)      \nIt is thus concluded that all the above factors\ncould not break the causal link between the injury suffered by the Union\nindustry and the dumped imports from the USA.\n(145)      \nParties finally mention the fact that during the\nIP, a considerable number of imports were declared under CN heading 3824,\nattracting a low customs duty. After the end of the IP, the level of the\nrespective customs duty was raised. They consider that the injury was caused by\nthe low customs duty, and not by dumping. In this regard, it suffices to say\nthat customs duties may change at any time, and that this argument therefore\ncannot put into question the presence of injury during the investigation\nperiod.\n5.4.                \nConclusion on causation\n(146)      \nThe above analysis demonstrated that there was a\nsubstantial increase in the volume and market share of the low-priced imports\noriginating in the country concerned over the period considered. In addition,\nit was found that the prices of these imports were below the prices charged by\nthe Union industry on the Union market. \n(147)      \nThis increase in volume and market share of the\nlow-priced imports from the country concerned coincided with an overall and\ncontinuous increase of consumption in the Union and also with negative results\nof the Union industry during the period considered. The exporters from the\ncountry concerned managed to increase their market share by systematically\nundercutting Union industry's prices. At the same time, the Union industry was\nnot able to reach sustained positive levels of profitability despite its\nincrease in activity.\n(148)      \nThe examination of the other known factors which\ncould have caused injury to the Union industry revealed that these factors do\nnot appear to be such as to break the causal link established between the\ndumped imports from the country concerned and the injury suffered by the Union\nindustry.\n(149)      \nBased on the above analysis, which has properly\ndistinguished and separated the effects of all known factors on the situation\nof the Union industry from the injurious effects of the dumped imports, it was\nconcluded that the dumped imports from the USA have caused material injury to\nthe Union industry within the meaning of Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation.\n6.                      \nUNION INTEREST\n6.1.                \nPreliminary remark\n(150)      \nIn accordance with Article 21 of the basic\nRegulation, it was examined whether, despite the conclusion on injury caused by\nthe dumped imports from the country concerned, compelling reasons existed for\nconcluding that it was not in the Union interest to adopt anti-dumping measures\nin this particular case. The analysis of the Union interest was based on an\nappreciation of all the various interests involved, including those of the\nUnion industry, importers and users of the product concerned.\n6.2.                \nInterest of the Union industry\n(151)      \nThe investigation has shown that the Union\nindustry suffered material injury caused by the dumped imports from the USA. In\nthe absence of measures to correct the trade distorting effects of these\nimports, a further deterioration in the Union industry's economic situation\nappears to be very likely.\n(152)      \nIt is expected that the imposition of\nanti-dumping duties will restore effective trade conditions on the Union\nmarket, allowing the Union industry's prices to reflect its cost of production.\nIt can be expected that the imposition of measures would also enable the Union\nindustry to increase sales volume and thus gain the market share lost due to\nthe presence of dumped imports. This in turn will have a further positive\nimpact on its financial situation and profitability. \n(153)      \nIt was therefore concluded that the imposition\nof anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in the\nUSA would not be against the interest of the Union industry.\n6.3.                \nInterest of importers\n(154)      \nTwo companies sent responses to the\nquestionnaire intended for unrelated importers in the Union. Verification visits\ntook place at the premises of these cooperating importers. For both companies\nvisited, the bioethanol business constitutes only a small part of their total\nturnover (less than 5%). In addition, they both indicated that they would be\nable to pass on any price increase to their customers, the users. \n(155)      \nBased on the information available, it was\nconcluded that the imposition of measures would not have a significant negative\nimpact on the importers.\n6.4.                \nInterest of users\n(156)      \nFour companies sent responses to the questionnaire\nintended for users in the Union. Verification visits took place at the premises\nof one of them.\n(157)      \nFor the company visited, the bioethanol business\nrepresents a small part of its turnover, less than 5%. The company has made an\nimpact assessment considering a blend of E5 and calculated that a duty of 100\nEuro/m3 would result in a price increase of EUR 0,5 cents/litre at the pump. \n(158)      \nAs concerns the other three users, on the basis\nof data contained in their questionnaire replies, it is clear that the impact\nwould be limited as well. For one company, the volumes purchased from the\ncountry concerned are quite limited and the imposition of an antidumping duty\nwould only lead to a minimal impact on its profitability. \n(159)      \nThe other two cooperating users are related and\nhave declared that any imposition of antidumping duties can be passed on to\ntheir customers. They also made clear that they have sufficient choice in the\nsources of supply and that they do not depend on US imports.\n(160)      \nParties have claimed that there is not\nsufficient capacity in the Union to meet total demand and that the Union will\nneed imports to secure its bioethanol needs. The verified capacity figures show\nthat there was idle capacity in the Union given in particular the low level of\nsale prices. In consequence, the Union producers would be able to increase\ntheir production to fulfil the growing demand particularly when trade\ndistortions are removed from the market. Furthermore, it is expected that new\nplants will be constructed and will come into operation in the near future,\nreducing any alleged risk of shortage in the Union. \n(161)      \nIn view of the above, it was concluded that the\neffect of anti-dumping measures against imports of the bioethanol from the USA\nwould not have a significant negative impact on the users in the Union.\n6.5.                \nConclusion on Union interest\n(162)      \nIn view of the above, it\nwas concluded that overall, based on the information available concerning the\nUnion interest, there are no compelling reasons against the imposition of\nanti-dumping measures on imports of bioethanol originating in the USA.\n7.                      \nDEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES\n7.1.                \nInjury elimination level\n(163)      \nIn view of the conclusions reached with regard\nto dumping, injury, causation and Union interest, definitive anti-dumping\nmeasures should be imposed in order to prevent further injury being caused to\nthe Union industry by the dumped imports.\n(164)      \nFor the purpose of determining the level of\nthese measures, account was taken of the dumping margins and the amount of duty\nnecessary to eliminate the injury sustained by the Union industry, without\nexceeding the dumping margins found.\n(165)      \nWhen calculating the amount of duty necessary to\nremove the effects of the injurious dumping, it was considered that any\nmeasures should allow the Union industry to cover its costs of production and\nto obtain a profit before tax that could be reasonably achieved by an industry\nof this type in the sector under normal conditions of competition, i.e. in the\nabsence of dumped imports, on sales of the like product in the Union. \n(166)      \nIn this case, given the observations made in particular\nin recitals (102) and (103) above, it is considered that the target profit for\nthe Union industry, should be based on the profit achieved when the imports\nfrom the USA were negligible, i.e. the average pre-tax profit margin of one of\nthe sampled Union producers in 2008 and 2009, a producer which was not in a\nstart-up phase at that time. It is thus considered that a margin of 6,8% of\nturnover is reasonable and could be regarded as an appropriate minimum which\nthe Union industry could have expected to obtain under normal trade conditions in\nthe absence of injurious dumping during the IP. \n(167)      \nOn this basis, a non-injurious price was\ncalculated for the Union industry for the like product. The non-injurious price\nwas obtained by adjusting the sales prices of the sampled Union producers by\nthe actual profit/loss made during the IP and by adding the above mentioned\nprofit margin.\n(168)      \nThe necessary price increase was then determined\non the basis of a comparison of the weighted average import price of the\ncooperating exporting producers in the USA, as established for the price\nundercutting calculations, with the non-injurious price of the products sold by\nthe Union industry on the Union market during the IP. Any difference resulting\nfrom this comparison was then expressed as a percentage of the average total\nCIF import value.\n7.2.                \nForm and level of the duties\n(169)      \nIn the light of the foregoing, it is considered\nthat, in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, definitive\nanti-dumping measures should be imposed on imports of the product concerned at\nthe level of the lower of the dumping and the injury margins, in accordance\nwith the lesser duty rule. Accordingly, all duty rates should be set at the\nlevel of the dumping margins found.\n(170)      \nThe proposed definitive anti-dumping duties are\nthe following:\n   || Dumping margin || Injury margin || Definitive duty % \n country-wide dumping margin || 9,5% || 31,1% || 9,5% \n(171)      \nIn view of the fact that the anti-dumping duty\nwill also apply to blends containing by volume more than 10% (v/v) of\nbioethanol, in proportion to their bioethanol content, it is considered\nappropriate for the effective implementation of the measure by the customs\nauthorities of the Member States to determine the duty as a fixed amount on the\nbasis of the pure bioethanol content.\n(172)      \nThe anti-dumping duty rate specified in this\nRegulation was established on the basis of the findings of the present\ninvestigation. Therefore, they reflect the situation found during that\ninvestigation. This country-wide duty applicable to all companies is applicable\nto imports of the product concerned originating in the USA. \n(173)      \nWhile it was initially\nenvisaged limiting the duration of measures to 3 years due to the perceived dynamic\nmarket developments regarding the product concerned this issue was reassessed\nfollowing the comments received from interested parties. The complainants\nin particular claimed that it would be too early to assume at this stage a\nmajor change in the market patterns as the shift to new generation bioethanol\nmay very likely take a considerable amount of time and should not be taken into\naccount in the current proposal. Likewise, it would also be premature to assume\nwhat the outcome and the impact of some of the regulatory proposals currently\ndiscussed would be for all the operators in the market. After examining these\narguments it was considered that it was not appropriate to depart from the\nnormal period of validity of measures as provided in Article 11(2) of the Basic\nRegulation. This is without prejudice to the possibility for any interested\nparty to ask for a review should the circumstances so warrant pursuant to\nArticle 11(3).\n8.                      \nREGISTRATION\n(174)      \nThe Commission has received requests from the\ncomplainant for registration of imports of bioethanol originating in the USA.\nAccording to Article 14(6) of the basic Regulation, the Commission may, after\nconsultation of the Advisory Committee, direct the customs authorities to take\nthe appropriate steps to register imports, so that measures may subsequently be\napplied against those imports from the date of such registration. Imports may\nbe made subject to registration following a request from the Union industry\nwhich contains sufficient evidence to justify such action. The complainant\nargued that, since registration was imposed in the parallel anti-subsidy\nproceeding on imports of bioethanol originating in the USA[13], such conditions were automatically met.\n(175)      \nHowever, it should be underlined that the\nregistration in the parallel anti-subsidy proceeding has been made in a\ncompletely different set of circumstances. As indicated in recital 10 to the\nRegulation 771/2012, despite positive findings of countervailing subsidisation\nand material injury caused thereby to the Union industry during the\ninvestigation period, the Commission decided not to adopt provisional\ncountervailing duties because it was provisionally found that the main subsidy\nscheme in force during the investigation period had ceased, in the sense that\nit no longer conferred a benefit at the time provisional measures would have\nbeen imposed. However, there was evidence that the USA might reinstate the main\nsubsidy scheme found to be countervailable in the coming months with\nretroactive effects. In that event, the Commission considered that it would\nhave been entitled to adopt (and eventually collect) provisional countervailing\nduties in the present investigation. Thus, in order to preserve the European\nUnion's rights under these special circumstances, the Commission decided to\ndirect the Custom authorities to register imports. This specific set of\ncircumstances does not apply in the current AD proceeding.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.                      \nA definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed\non imports of bioethanol, referred to as \u201cfuel ethanol\u201d, i.e. ethyl alcohol\nproduced from agricultural products (as listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union), denatured or undenatured, excluding\nproducts with a water content of more than 0,3 % (m/m) measured according to\nthe standard EN 15376, but including ethyl alcohol produced from agricultural\nproducts (as listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion) contained in blends with gasoline with an ethyl alcohol content of more\nthan 10 % (v/v) intended for fuel uses currently falling within CN codes ex\n2207 10 00, ex 2207 20 00, ex 2208 90 99, ex 2710 12 21, ex 2710 12 25, ex 2710\n12 31, ex 2710 12 41, ex 2710 12 45, ex 2710 12 49, ex 2710 12 51, ex 2710 12\n59, ex 2710 12 70, ex 2710 12 90, ex 3814 00 10, ex 3814 00 90, ex 3820 00 00\nand ex 3824 90 97 (TARIC codes 2207 10 00 12, 2207 20 00 12, 2208 90 99 12,\n2710 12 21 11, 2710 12 25 92, 2710 12 31 11, 2710 12 41 11, 2710 12 45 11, 2710\n12 49 11, 2710 12 51 11, 2710 12 59 11, 2710 12 70 11, 2710 12 90 11, 3814 00\n10 11, 3814 00 90 71, 3820 00 00 11 and 3824 90 97 67) and originating in the\nUnited States of America.\n2.                      \nThe rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty\napplicable to the product described in paragraph 1 shall be 62.3 Euro per tonne\nnet.
