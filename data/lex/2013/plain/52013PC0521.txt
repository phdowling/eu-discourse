In this context, is of particular\r\nimportance to ensure a maximum implementation of rural development programmes. \nProgramme implementation is often challenging,\r\nnot least as a result of the liquidity problems resulting from fiscal\r\nconsolidation. This is particularly the case for those Member States which have\r\nbeen most affected by the financial crisis and have received financial\r\nassistance under an adjustment programme. To date, seven countries have\r\nreceived financial assistance and have agreed a macro-economic adjustment\r\nprogramme with the Commission. These countries are Cyprus, Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, hereafter called \"programme\r\ncountries\". Hungary, Romania and Latvia are no longer under an adjustment\r\nprogramme.\nTo ensure that these Member States (and any\r\nother Member State which may benefit from such assistance programmes in the\r\nfuture) continue to implement rural development programmes on the ground and\r\ncontinue to disburse funds to projects, the current proposal contains\r\nprovisions that would allow these Member States to use increased co-financing\r\nrates, without modifying their overall allocation under rural development\r\npolicy for the period 2007-2013. This will provide additional financial\r\nresources to the Member States at a critical juncture and will facilitate the\r\ncontinued implementation of programmes on the ground.\n\u00b7     \r\nGeneral context and provisions in force in\r\nthe policy sphere of the proposal\nArticle 70(4c) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 provides\r\nfor a derogation to increase the European Agricultural Fund for Rural\r\nDevelopment (EAFRD) contribution ceilings set out in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the\r\nsame Article, up to a maximum of 95 % of eligible public expenditure in the\r\nregions eligible under the Convergence Objective and the outermost regions and\r\nthe smaller Aegean Islands, and up to 85 % of eligible public expenditure in\r\nother regions. That derogation currently applies only to the expenditure\r\nincurred by the paying agencies until 31 December 2013. \n\u00b7     \r\nConsistency with other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThe proposal is consistent with other proposals\r\nand initiatives adopted by the Commission as a response to the financial\r\ncrisis.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u00b7     \r\nConsultation of interested parties\nThere was no consultation of external\r\nstakeholders\n\u00b7      Procurement and use of expertise\nUse of external expertise has not been\r\nnecessary.\n\u00b7     \r\nImpact analysis\nThe Member States under financial assistance\r\nhave a possibility to submit a request to the Commission to modify its 2007-2013\r\nrural development programme and make use of the derogation to apply higher than\r\nnormal co-financing rates. Currently Greece, Ireland and Portugal make use of that derogation, but not in all cases up to the maximum. Because the\r\ntotal financial allocation for the period from the EAFRD to the Member State  s and the programmes in question will not change, the higher EU co-financing\r\nrates essentially reduce the total amount of public contribution available to\r\nthe rural development programmes during the programming period. The possibility\r\nfor the Member States under financial assistance to increase the EAFRD\r\ncontribution rates under the current 2007-2013 rural development programmes currently\r\nexist only for the expenditure incurred until 31 December 2013 (for the period\r\nthe Member State is under financial assistance) and therefore does not extend\r\nuntil the final eligibility date of the expenditure on 31 December 2015.\nFor the expenditure incurred under the new programming\r\nperiod 2014-2020, according to Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 [Common\r\nProvisions Regulation] the EAFRD contribution rate may be increased by 10\r\npercentage points above the co-financing rate applicable to each measure for\r\nthe EAFRD. This new system, which will be a uniform top-up for all measures,\r\nmay in some cases mean either lower or higher changes to the EAFRD contribution\r\nrates than the current system under Article 70(4c) of Regulation (EC) No\r\n1698/2005.\nIf the possibility provided for in Article\r\n70(4c) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 to use higher than normal EAFRD\r\ncontribution rates under the current rural development programmes is limited\r\nuntil the end of 2013 and only to the period in which the Member State is under\r\nfinancial assistance, there is a risk that the maximum and optimal use of the\r\nfunding from the EAFRD will be seriously affected for the rural development\r\nprogrammes concerned before the possibility exist for the top-ups under the new\r\nprogrammes.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7     \r\nSummary of the proposed measures\nIt is proposed to amend Article 70(4c) of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1698/2005 to allow the Member\r\nStates receiving financial assistance to benefit from the increase of 10\r\npercentage points, only for the open budget commitments for the\r\n2007-2013 programming period, until the end of the\r\neligibility period and to claim it in their requests for final balance even if\r\nthe financial assistance is not anymore provided. \n\u00b7     \r\nLegal basis\nArticles 42 and 43 of the TFEU.\n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal complies within the subsidiarity\r\nprinciple to the extent that it seeks to provide increased support through EAFRD\r\nfor certain Member States which are experiencing serious difficulties, notably\r\nwith respect to economic growth and financial stability and with deterioration\r\nin their deficit and debt position, also as a result of the international\r\neconomic and financial environment. In this context, it is necessary to\r\nestablish at the Union level a temporary mechanism which allows derogating from\r\nthe normal co-financing rates for the EAFRD. \n\u00b7     \r\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal conforms to the proportionality\r\nprinciple:\nThe extension of the application of the\r\nincreased co-financing rates is proportional in relation to the sustained\r\neconomic crisis and to the other efforts undertaken to help these Member\r\nStates.\n\u00b7     \r\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: amendment of the current\r\nregulation.\nThe Commission has explored the scope for\r\nmanoeuvre provided by the legal framework and considers it necessary, in the\r\nlight of experience up to now, to propose a modification to Regulation (EC) No\r\n1698/2005. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThere is no impact on commitment appropriations\r\nsince no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of EAFRD financing\r\nprovided for in the Operational Programmes for the programming period\r\n2007-2013.\nHowever, the need of payment appropriations in budget\r\n2014 may be increased by EUR 90 million in case Member States continue applying\r\nthe increased co-financing rates.\nIn the light of Member State's requests to\r\nbenefit from this action and taking into account the evolution of the\r\nsubmission of interim payments, the Commission will review the situation and if\r\nnecessary consider relevant actions.\n2013/0247 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund\r\nfor Rural Development (EAFRD)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 42 and 43 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[2],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The unprecedented global\r\nfinancial crisis and economic downturn have seriously damaged economic growth\r\nand financial stability and provoked a strong deterioration in financial and\r\neconomic conditions in several Member States. In particular, certain Member\r\nStates are experiencing serious difficulties or are threatened with such\r\ndifficulties, notably with problems in their economic growth and financial\r\nstability and with deterioration in their deficit and debt position, also as a\r\nresult of the international economic and financial environment.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whilst important actions\r\nto counterbalance the negative effects of the crisis have already been taken, including\r\namendments of the legislative framework, the impact of the financial crisis on\r\nthe real economy, is still being widely felt and pressure on national financial\r\nresources is increasing.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the serious\r\ndifficulties that a number of Member States still face with respect to their\r\nfinancial stability, and in order to limit the resulting negative effects\r\nduring the transition from the current to the forthcoming programming period,\r\nby allowing for maximum utilisation of the EAFRD funds available, the duration\r\nof the derogation increasing the maximum EAFRD contribution rates provided for\r\nin Article 70(4c) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005[3] should be extended until the\r\nfinal date of eligibility of expenditure for the 2007-2013 programming period, on\r\n31 December 2015.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The possibility for\r\ninterim payments and payments of final balance to be increased\u00a0 above the normal\r\nco-financing rate should not be limited to the time period during which the\r\nMember State receives financial assistance in accordance with Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 407/2010, Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 or the Treaty establishing the\r\nEuropean Stability Mechanism because the Member State continues to face serious\r\ndifficulties in ensuring co-financing from the national budget even after the\r\nfinancial assistance has been completed. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with the European\r\nCouncil conclusions of 7-8 February 2013 and as foreseen in Article 22 of\r\n[CPR], the co-financing rate increased by 10 percentage points will apply with\r\nregard to the 2014-2020 programming period until 30 June 2016 when the\r\npossibility of the increase will be reviewed. As the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020\r\nprogramming periods overlap, it is necessary to ensure coherent and uniform\r\ntreatment of Member States receiving financial assistance under the two\r\nperiods. Therefore, the Member States receiving financial assistance should be\r\nable to benefit from the increase of the co-financing rate until the end of the\r\neligibility period and to claim it in their requests for final balance even if\r\nthe financial assistance is not anymore provided. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the fact that\r\nthe deadline established in Article 70(4c) coincides with the end of the\r\nprogramming period and the relevant programming and procedural requirements, it\r\nis appropriate that this Regulation enters into force on the day of its\r\npublication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n1698/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nArticle 70(4c) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005\r\nis amended as follows:\n(a)                   \r\nIn the first subparagraph the introductory part is\r\nreplaced by the following:\n\u201cBy way of\r\nderogation from the ceilings set out in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, the EAFRD\r\ncontribution may be increased up to a maximum of 95 % of eligible public\r\nexpenditure in the regions eligible under the Convergence Objective and the\r\noutermost regions and the smaller Aegean Islands, and 85 % of eligible public\r\nexpenditure in other regions. These rates shall apply to the eligible\r\nexpenditure newly declared in each certified declaration of expenditure, where after\r\n[OPOCE please insert date of entry into\r\nforce of this Regulation] a Member State complies with one of\r\nthe following conditions: \u201c\n(b)                   \r\nThe second subparagraph is replaced by the\r\nfollowing:\n\"A Member State wishing to make use of the derogation provided for in\r\nthe first subparagraph shall submit a request to the Commission to modify its\r\nrural development programme accordingly. The derogation shall apply from the\r\napproval, by the Commission, of the modification of the programme.\"\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, \nFor the European Parliament\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\nThe President\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n FINANCIAL STATEMENT || AGRI/I1/2013/1278200   \n 6.20.2013.6 \n   || DATE: 17.05.2013   \n 1. || BUDGET HEADING:   05 04 Rural Development   ||   \n 2. || TITLE:   Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD)   \n 3. || LEGAL BASIS:   Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union   \n 4. || AIMS:   This regulation extends until the end of 2015 the derogation which allows Member States under financial assistance to increase the EAFRD contribution rates up to 95% in regions under the Convergence Objective and the outermost regions and smaller Aegean Islands, and up to 85% in other regions.     \n 5. || FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS || 12 MONTH PERIOD (EUR million) || CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR 2013 (EUR million) || FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR 2014 (EUR million) \n 5.0 || EXPENDITURE -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHARGED TO THE EU BUDGET (REFUNDS/INTERVENTIONS) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL AUTHORITIES -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OTHER ||   || \u00a0 || CA: - PA: + 90 \n 5.1 || REVENUE -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OWN RESOURCES OF THE EU (LEVIES/CUSTOMS DUTIES) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 \n 5.0.1 || ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE ||   ||   || PA: - 90 ||   \n 5.1.1 || ESTIMATED REVENUE ||   ||   ||   ||   \n 5.2 || METHOD OF CALCULATION: - \n 6.0 || CAN THE PROJECT BE FINANCED FROM APPROPRIATIONS ENTERED IN THE RELEVANT CHAPTER OF THE CURRENT BUDGET? || n.a. \n 6.1 || CAN THE PROJECT BE FINANCED BY TRANSFER BETWEEN CHAPTERS OF THE CURRENT BUDGET? || n.a. \n 6.2 || WILL A SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET BE NECESSARY? || NO \n 6.3 || WILL APPROPRIATIONS NEED TO BE ENTERED IN FUTURE BUDGETS? || NO \n OBSERVATIONS: For commitment appropriations, the modification of Regulation 1698/2005 will not have any financial impact as the global envelope for rural development remains unchanged as well as its annual breakdown.   For payments, the extension of the derogation that permits the application of increased co-financing rates could result in higher reimbursements to the MS concerned. The proposal will not have any impact in year 2013. Based on the latest available payment forecast from Member States, the additional payments needs can be estimated at EUR 90 million in 2014 (compared to a situation where the application of increased rates ends in 2013). This amount will be compensated at the closure of programmes, most likely in 2017.   In the light of Member State's requests to benefit from this action and taking into account the evolution of the submission of interim payments, the Commission will review the situation and if necessary consider relevant actions.       \n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 277, 21.10.2005, p.1.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
