Therefore, from that date Mayotte will cease to be\nan overseas territory to become an outermost region within the meaning of\nArticles 349 and 355(1) TFEU. Union law will apply to Mayotte from 1 January\n2014. \nThe present proposal follows the\nexamination of requests made by the French authorities to have the Union acquis\namended through derogations and/or transitional periods applicable to Mayotte in different areas, such as environment, agriculture, social policy and public\nhealth.\nThe examination has revealed that France needs additional time to comply with the Union acquis with regard to Mayotte in the\nfields of environment, agriculture, social policy and public health. It is\ntherefore appropriate to provide for corresponding measures, limited to\nreflecting the particular situation of Mayotte, without affecting Union law otherwise.\n\nIn the interest of simplicity and\nspeediness, it has been considered expedient not to resort to individual\nproposals for each of the acts concerned but, where legally possible, to bundle\nthe amendments to several acts in a single proposal. The amendments proposed in\nthe present document relate all to Directives and fall under the ordinary\nlegislative procedure (Articles 289(1) and 294 TFEU). \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Commission has not used an impact assessment. However, when\nexamining the various issues and in particular the requests made by France, it had contacts with representatives of national and regional authorities in order\nto better evaluate the grounds of the specific measures.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nIn accordance\nwith Article 153(2) TFUE, the European Parliament and the Council are empowered\nto adopt, by means of directives, minimum requirements\nfor gradual implementation of working conditions having regard to the conditions\nand technical rules in each of the Member States. Under this legal basis, it is\nproposed to amend Directive 2006/25/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 with a view to granting a\nderogation to France, until 31 December 2017, from certain provisions in the\nfield of artificial optical radiation. The proposed derogation only applies\ninsofar as the structures necessary to comply with these provisions are not\navailable in Mayotte, and without prejudice to the general principles of\nprotection and prevention in the area of health and safety of workers. It is\nalso proposed that France must ensure proper consultation of the social\npartners and limit risks for workers to a minimum.\nPursuant to Article 192(1) TFUE, the European Parliament and the Council\nshall decide what action is to be taken by the Union in order to achieve the objectives on the environment referred to in Article 191. The current situation prevailing in Mayotte calls for considerable\nimprovement in order to comply with environmental objectives set forth by Union\nlaw. It is therefore proposed to amend, on the basis of Article 192(1) TFEU,\nthree Directives in the area of environment: \n\u2013                        \nCouncil Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 in\norder to grant France the sufficient periods of time for meeting the\nrequirements of the Directives concerning urban waste water treatment; \n\u2013                        \nDirective 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 23 October 2000 in order to grant France the sufficient periods of time for the adoption and proper implementation of river\nbasin management plans;\n\u2013                        \nDirective 2006/7/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 15 February 2006 in order to define specific time limits\nto allow France to reach the Union standards as regards bathing water quality.\nIn accordance\nwith Article 43(2) TFUE, the European Parliament and the Council are empowered\nto adopt, inter alia, provisions necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of\nthe common agricultural policy. On the basis of this provision, it is proposed\nto amend Council Directive 1999/74/EC of 19 July 1999 laying down minimum\nstandards for the protection of laying hens. Since laying hens are reared in\nMayotte in unenriched cages and since it would be difficult to change this\nposition in the short term, France should be granted sufficient time to adapt.\nEven though almost 100% of the egg production is sold in Mayotte, measures\nshould be taken in order to prevent any distortion of competition.\nFinally, pursuant to Article 114 TFEU, the European Parliament and\nthe Council shall adopt the measures for the approximation of the provisions\nlaid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which\nhave as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market.\nOn the other hand, in accordance with Article 168 TFEU the European Parliament\nand the Council may also adopt incentive measures designed to protect and\nimprove human health. Under these legal bases, it is proposed to amend Directive 2011/24/EU\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the\napplication of patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare, given the current\nsituation in Mayotte and the number of adaptations required to be carried out to\ntranspose the Directive in order to ensure continuity of care and information\nto patients.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no impact on the budget of\nthe European Union. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nIt\nhas been considered that no explanatory documents need to be requested for the\nfollowing reasons:\n(1)\nThis proposal for a Directive essentially contains: \n(a) Amendments to introduce derogations and/or\ntransitional periods related to the application in Mayotte of the Directives\nconcerned, and \n(b) A very limited number of obligations for France in this respect. \n(2)\nThe derogations and/or transitional periods granted are based on requests\nsubmitted by France, in which it has motivated the need of such derogations\nand/or transitional periods and has indicated an implementation plan. \nTherefore,\nthe Commission does not need explanatory documents to carry out its task of\noverseeing the transposition of Directives. The individual transposition\nmeasures to be notified by France can be expected to be self-explanatory.\n2013/0192 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending certain Directives in the fields\nof environment, agriculture, social policy and public health by reason of the\nchange of status of Mayotte with regard to the Union\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2), Article\n114, Article 153(2), Article168 and Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[2],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Decision 2012/419/EU[3], the European Council decided\nto amend the status of Mayotte with regard to the European Union with effect\nfrom 1 January 2014. Therefore, from that date Mayotte will cease to be an\noverseas territory and become an outermost region within the meaning of\nArticles 349 and 355(1) of the Treaty. Union law will apply to Mayotte as from that date. It is appropriate to provide for certain specific measures\njustified by the particular situation of Mayotte in a number of areas.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to take\naccount of the particular situation in Mayotte as regards the state of the\nenvironment, which calls for considerable improvement in order to comply with\nenvironmental objectives set forth by Union law, for which additional time is\nneeded. Specific measures in order to gradually improve the environment should\nbe adopted within specific time limits. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to comply with\nthe requirements of Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21\nMay 1991 concerning urban waste water treatment[4],\nmeasures need to be taken in Mayotte to ensure that agglomerations\nare provided with collecting systems for urban waste water. Such measures call for infrastructure works that should follow appropriate\nadministrative and planning procedures and furthermore require the\nestablishment of systems for measuring and monitoring urban waste water\ndischarges. Therefore, a sufficient period of time needs to be granted to France for meeting those requirements.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the field of agriculture,\nas regards Council Directive 1999/74/EC of 19 July 1999 laying down minimum\nstandards for the protection of laying hens[5]\nit is noted that, in Mayotte, laying hens are reared in unenriched cages. In\nview of the considerable investment and preparatory work required for replacing\nunenriched cages by enriched cages or alternative systems, it is necessary, in\nrespect of laying hens in lay on 1 January 2014, to postpone the prohibition of\nusing unenriched cages for a period of up to 12 months from that date. Replacement\nof the cages during the laying cycle of the hens should thereby be avoided. In\norder to prevent distortions of competition, eggs derived from establishments\nusing unenriched cages should be marketed only on the local market of Mayotte. In order to facilitate the necessary controls, eggs produced in unenriched cages\nshould bear a special mark.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field\nof water policy[6],\nthe proper implementation of the Directive as regards river basin management\nplans requires that France adopt and implement management plans containing\ntechnical and administrative measures to achieve good water status for, and to prevent\nthe deterioration of all bodies of surface waters. A sufficient period of time\nneeds to be granted for the adoption and implementation of such measures.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of Directive 2006/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n15 February 2006 concerning the management of bathing water quality and\nrepealing Directive 76/160/EEC[7],\nthe current state of surface waters in Mayotte calls for considerable\nimprovement in order to comply with the requirements of that Directive. The\nquality of bathing waters depends directly upon urban waste water treatment,\nand the provisions of Directive 2006/7/EC may only be complied with\nprogressively once agglomerations that affect the quality of urban waste waters\ncomply with the requirements of Directive 91/271/EEC. Therefore, specific time\nlimits need to be adopted in order allow France to reach the Union standards as\nregards bathing water quality in Mayotte.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the area of social\npolicy, account should be taken of the difficulties to comply with Directive\n2006/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on the\nminimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to\nrisks arising from physical agents (artificial optical radiation)[8] in Mayotte as from 1 January 2014.\nThere are no technical facilities available in Mayotte for the implementation\nof measures necessary to comply with that Directive in the field of artificial\noptical radiation. Therefore, it is possible to grant a derogation to France from certain provisions of that Directive until 31 December 2017, provided that those\nstructures are not available in Mayotte and without prejudice to the general\nprinciples of protection and prevention in the area of health and safety of\nworkers.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to guarantee a\nhigh level of protection of the health and safety of workers at work, the\nconsultation with the social partners should be ensured, the risks resulting\nfrom the derogation should be reduced to a minimum and the workers concerned\nshould benefit from to reinforced health surveillance. It is important to\nreduce the duration of the derogation as much as possible. Therefore, the\nnational derogating measures should be reviewed every year and withdrawn as\nsoon as the circumstances justifying them no longer subsist.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrespect of Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 9 March 2011 on the application of patients\u2019 rights in cross-border\nhealthcare[9], its transposition requires a number of adaptations to ensure\ncontinuity of care and information to patients. It is therefore appropriate to\ngrant France an additional period of 30 months from 1 January 2014 to bring\ninto force the provisions necessary to comply with that directive in respect of\n Mayotte. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directives 91/271/EEC, 1999/74/EC,\n2000/60/EC, 2006/7/EC, 2006/25/EC and 2011/24/EU should therefore be amended\naccordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nAmendments to Directive 91/271/EC\nDirective 91/271/EC is amended as follows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 3, the following\nparagraph 1a is inserted: \n'(1a)\u00a0 By way of derogation from the first and\nsecond sentences of paragraph 1, in respect of Mayotte France shall ensure that all agglomerations are provided with collecting systems for urban\nwaste water: \n- by 31 December 2020\nat the latest for agglomerations of more than 10 000 p.e., which will cover at\nleast 70% of the load generated in Mayotte; \n- by 31 December 2027\nat the latest for all agglomerations.'\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 4, the following\nparagraph 1a is inserted:\n'(1a)\u00a0 By way of derogation from paragraph 1,\nin respect of Mayotte France shall ensure that urban waste water entering\ncollecting systems are, before discharge, subject to secondary treatment or an\nequivalent treatment:\n- by 31 December 2020\nat the latest for agglomerations of more than 15 000 p.e. which, along with\nthose agglomerations referred to in Article 5 (2a), will cover at least 70% of\nthe load generated in Mayotte;\n- by 31 December 2027\nat the latest for all agglomerations.

Those eggs and their packs\nshall be clearly identified with a special mark, allowing for the necessary\ncontrols. A clear description of this special mark shall be communicated to the\nCommission by 1 January 2014.\u2019\nArticle 3\nAmendments to Directive 2000/60/EC\nDirective 2000/60/EC is amended as follows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 4 is amended as follows:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in paragraph 1, the following\nsubparagraph is added:\n'As regards Mayotte, the time limit\nreferred to in points (a)(ii), (a)(iii), (b)(ii) and (c) shall be 22 December\n2021.'\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in paragraph 4, the introductory\nsentence is replaced by the following:\n'The time limits\nestablished under paragraph 1 may be extended for the purposes of phased\nachievement of the objectives for bodies of water, provided that no further\ndeterioration occurs in the status of the affected body of water when all the\nfollowing conditions are met: '\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 11 is amended as follows:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in paragraph 7, the following subparagraph is added:\n'As regards Mayotte, the time limits\nreferred to in the first subparagraph shall be 22 December 2015 and 22 December\n2018 respectively.'\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in paragraph 8, the following subparagraph is added:\n'As regards Mayotte, the time limit\nreferred to in the first subparagraph shall be 22 December 2021.'\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 13 is amended as follows: \n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in paragraph 6, the following subparagraph is added:\n'As regards Mayotte, the time limit\nreferred to in the first subparagraph shall be 22 December 2015.'\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in paragraph 7, the following\nsubparagraph is added:\n'As regards Mayotte, the time limit\nreferred to in the first subparagraph shall be 22 December 2021.'\nArticle 4\nAmendments to Directive 2006/7/EC\nDirective 2006/7/EC is amended as follows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 5 is amended as follows:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in paragraph 2, the following subparagraph is added:\n'As regards Mayotte, the time limit referred to in the first subparagraph shall be 31 December 2019.'\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in paragraph 3, the following\nsubparagraph is added:\n'As regards Mayotte, the time limit referred to in the first subparagraph shall be 31 December 2031.'\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 6(1), the following\nsubparagraph is added:\n'As regards Mayotte, the time limit referred to\nin the first subparagraph shall be 30 June 2015.'\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 13(2), the following\nsubparagraph is added:\n'As regards Mayotte, the time limit referred to\nin the first subparagraph shall be 30 June 2014.'\nArticle 5\nAmendment to Directive 2006/25/EC\nIn Directive 2006/25/EC, the following\nArticle 14a is inserted:\n\u2018Article 14a\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without prejudice to with\nthe general principles of protection and prevention in the area of health and\nsafety of workers, France may until 31 December 2017 derogate from the\napplication of the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive in\nMayotte provided that such application requires specific technical facilities\nand that such facilities are not available in Mayotte.\nThe first subparagraph does not apply to the\nobligations in Article 5(1) of this Directive as well as to those provisions of\nthis Directive which reflect the general principles set out in Directive\n89/391/EEC.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All derogations from this\nDirective resulting from the application of measures existing on 1 January 2014\nor from the adoption of new measures shall be preceded by a consultation with\nthe social partners in accordance with national laws and practice.
