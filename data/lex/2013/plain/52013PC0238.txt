The Commission, by Decision 2000/745/EC[5], as amended by Decision 2002/232/EC[6] accepted five price undertakings from Indonesian and Indian companies. \n 141 || \u00b7          Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. \n 2) Consultation of interested parties and impact assessment \n   || \u00b7          Consultation of interested parties \n 219 || Interested parties concerned by the proceeding have had the opportunity to comment, in line with Article 8 (9) of the basic Regulation. \n   || \u00b7           Collection and use of expertise \n 229 || There was no need for external expertise. \n 230 || \u00b7          Impact assessment This proposal is the result of the implementation of the basic Regulation. The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed.   \n 3) Legal elements of the proposal \n 305 || \u00b7          Summary of the proposed action The Commission is currently proceeding with the withdrawal of two price undertakings due to their repetitive breach by Commission decision. Hence, the underlying Council Regulation imposing the definitive anti-dumping duty should also be amended accordingly, i.e. by deleting the companies concerned from the list of companies with undertakings mentioned in Article 2 (3). Therefore, it is proposed that the Council adopts the attached proposal for Regulation which should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. \n 310 || \u00b7           Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. \n 329 || \u00b7          Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n   || \u00b7           Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n 331 || The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n 332 || Indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n   || \u00b7          Choice of instruments \n 341 || Proposed instruments: regulation. \n 342 || Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The above-mentioned basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n 4) Budgetary implication \n 409 || The proposal has no implication for the Union budget. \n2013/0126 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\namending Regulation (EC) No 192/2007\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET) originating in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand and Taiwan\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[7]\n('the basic Regulation'), and in particular Articles\n8 and 9 thereof,\nHaving regard to the\nproposal submitted by the European Commission after having consulted the\nAdvisory Committee,\nWhereas:\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PREVIOUS PROCEDURE\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 192/2007[8], imposed a definitive\nanti-dumping duty on imports of certain polyethylene terephtalate (\u2018PET\u2019)\noriginating in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand and Taiwan following an expiry review and a partial interim review.
