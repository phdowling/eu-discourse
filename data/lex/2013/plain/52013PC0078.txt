It is an important pillar of the\nsingle market and gives consumers confidence when purchasing products.\nThis proposal for a Regulation on consumer\nproduct safety, which will replace Directive 2001/95/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council on general product safety[1] (the \"General Product\nSafety Directive\" or simply GPSD), concerns manufactured non-food consumer\nproducts. Like the GPSD also the proposed Regulation requires that consumer\nproducts must be \"safe\", sets certain obligations on economic\noperators and contains provisions for the development of standards in support\nof the general safety requirement.\nHowever, the operation of the proposed\nRegulation and its interface with other Union legislation will be significantly\nstreamlined and simplified whilst maintaining a high level of protection of the\nhealth and safety of consumers. \nOverlaps of market surveillance rules and\nobligations of economic operators laid down in various pieces of Union\nlegislation (the GPSD, the Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 setting out the\nrequirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the\nmarketing of products[2]\nand sector-specific Union harmonisation legislation that also covers consumer\nproducts) has led to confusion on the part of both economic operators and\nnational authorities and has seriously hampered the effectiveness of market\nsurveillance activity in the Union.\nThis proposal aims at clarifying the regulatory\nframework for consumer products taking into account legislative developments in\nrecent years such as the New Legislative Framework on the Marketing of Products\nadopted in 2008[3],\nthe alignment of sector-specific Union harmonisation legislation to that new\nframework[4]\nand the entry into application on 1 January 2013 of a new Regulation on\nEuropean standardisation[5].\n\nThe proposal is part of the \"Product\nSafety and Market Surveillance Package\" which also includes a proposal for\na single market surveillance regulation and a multi-annual action plan for\nmarket surveillance covering the period 2013-2015. The Single Market Act (2011)[6] identified the revision of the\nGPSD and the drawing up of a market surveillance plan as initiatives that will\ncontribute to boosting growth and creating jobs. The Single Market Act II[7], adopted in 2012, confirms the\n\"Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package\" as a key action\n\"to improve the safety of products circulating in the EU through better\ncoherence and enforcement of product safety and market surveillance\nrules\".\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nFrom 2009 to 2011, the Commission held\nextensive public consultations on the revision of the GPSD concerning the scope\nof the impact assessment. Following the definition of the scope of the impact\nassessment, the Commission proceeded to the second round of public consultation\nwhich concentrated on four main substantive areas for improvement in the EU\nproduct safety regime: (i) procedures for mandating standards under the GPSD\nfor non-harmonised products, (ii) harmonisation of safety evaluations, (iii)\nmarket surveillance cooperation and coordination, including the functioning of\nthe EU Rapid Information System (RAPEX) and on-line distribution channels, and\n(iv) alignment with the Free Movement of Goods Package.\nThe second round of public consultation on\nproblems identified and the solutions proposed by the Commission took place\nbetween May and December 2010. Between 18 May and 20 August 2010, the\nCommission held an internet public consultation focussing on those four areas.\nThe Commission sought feedback through four consultation papers and nine online questionnaires targeting various groups of\nstakeholders. 55 national authorities responded, from all EU Member States\nexcept one and from Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.\nVarious other stakeholders, including more than thirty business associations,\nseventeen consumer organisations, and over fifty individual economic operators\n(including several SMEs) contributed to the consultation. In total, 305 replies\nwere received to the nine online questionnaires. In addition, thirteen business\nand consumer organisations provided separate position papers. A number of\npresentations and direct exchanges with stakeholders (with both business and\nconsumer organisations) were also held during the consultation period.\nThe second round of public consultation ended\nwith an international stakeholder conference on the \"Revision of the\nGeneral Product Safety Directive\" on 1 December 2010 during which the\nCommission received feedback from the stakeholders on key conclusions of the\npublic internet consultation.\nThe third round of public consultation took\nplace between January and March 2011. It took the form of targeted stakeholder\nmeetings with the participation of experts in the relevant areas. These\nmeetings covered structural topics, including the organisation of market\nsurveillance coordination, the impact of the new definitions of obligations of\neconomic operators (in particular traceability obligations), procedures for\nestablishing mandates leading to the establishment of European standards under\nthe GPSD and ways to establish a clear and understandable structure for\nnon-food product safety rules.\nOne of the outcomes of the public consultation\nprocess and the dialogue with interested parties was to transfer the market\nsurveillance rules from the current GPSD into a new stand-alone Market\nSurveillance Regulation to be developed and adopted hand in hand with the\npresent proposal for the revision of the GPSD.\nThe impact assessment prepared by the\nCommission thus covers aspects related to both this proposal and the proposal\nfor a new Market Surveillance Regulation. The Commission's Impact Assessment\nBoard delivered a favourable opinion in September 2012.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \nScope and definitions\nThe proposed Regulation clearly delimits its\nscope of application compared to sectoral Union harmonisation legislation.\nWhilst the general principle that all non-food consumer products must be safe\napplies across the board, the more detailed obligations on economic operators\nonly apply to those operators that are not subject to corresponding obligations\nlaid down in harmonising legislation covering a specific product sector. The\nCommission envisages drawing up guidance which will help businesses, in\nparticular small and medium-size enterprises, to identify which legislation\napplies to the consumer products they manufacture or distribute.\nThe definitions section has been updated and,\nwhere applicable aligned with the New Legislative Framework for the Marketing\nof Products[8].\n\u00b7                        \nGeneral safety requirement and obligations of\neconomic operators\nThe requirement that all consumer products must\nbe safe when placed or made available on the Union market is a fundamental\npillar of EU legislation in the field of product safety. This general product\nsafety requirement, laid down already in the GPSD, has been kept. However, its\noperation in practice will be significantly simplified due to the introduction\nof a clear link with sector-specific legislation and a simplification of the\nrules on standards. \nConsumer products that comply with\nsector-specific Union harmonisation legislation that aims at ensuring the\nhealth and safety of persons shall be presumed to be safe also under this\nproposed Regulation. If they do not comply with the applicable harmonisation\nlegislation, they would not benefit from the safety presumption but correction\nof such situation would be governed by the sector-specific legislation in\nconjunction with the future single market surveillance regulation. \nMoreover, the proposal lays down the elementary\nobligations of economic operators (manufacturers, importers, distributors)\ninvolved in the supply chain of consumer products insofar as they are not\nsubject to corresponding requirements under sector-specific Union harmonisation\nlegislation. The obligations are based on the reference provisions set out in\nDecision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the\nmarketing of products[9]\nand address, among others, issues related to labelling, product identification,\ncorrective actions to be taken in case of unsafe products and information of\nthe competent authorities. Proportionate to the potential risks of their\nproducts, manufacturers will be obliged to establish a technical documentation\nregarding their products which shall contain the necessary information to prove\nthat their product is safe.\nEqually based on Decision No 768/2008/EC, the\nproposal requires economic operators to be able to identify the operators who\nsupplied them with the product and to whom they supplied it. Where justified\ndue to the risks inherent to specific types of products, the Commission should\nbe empowered to adopt measures requiring economic operators to establish or\nadhere to an electronic traceability system.\n\u00b7                        \nUse of European standards\nLike the GPSD, also the proposal for the new\nRegulation favours the use of standards in support of the implementation of the\ngeneral safety requirement. However, the process to identify existing European\nstandards or to ask for the development of European standards that would give\nrise to presume that a product is safe has been significantly simplified and\naligned to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 that sets a new overarching framework\nfor European standardisation[10].\nThis underlines the importance the Commission gives to an approach of\nco-regulation and will enhance the use of European standards in support of the\nproposed Regulation. \n\u00b7                        \nTransfer of rules on market surveillance and\nRAPEX to a new Market Surveillance Regulation\nIn line with the objective to strengthen and\nstreamline market surveillance for all products, whether harmonised or not and\nwhether intended for consumers or for professionals, the provisions regarding\nmarket surveillance and RAPEX that are currently contained in the GPSD have\nbeen transferred to the proposal for a new single\nMarket Surveillance Regulation. That new Regulation\nwould produce a one-tier system in which all market surveillance rules are\nbrought together in a single instrument and in which RAPEX will be the single\nalert system regarding products presenting a risk. Further information is given\nin the proposal for a Regulation on market surveillance of products.\n\u00b7                        \nUnion competence, subsidiarity,\nproportionality and legal form\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) which provides for the same\nlegal base for the establishment and functioning of the internal market on\nwhich the current GPSD was adopted. In regulating product safety, the Union is\nexercising its shared powers under Article 4(2) of the TFEU.\nWithin the internal market where products can\ncirculate freely, the rules on product safety can effectively be adopted only at\nUnion level. This is necessary in order to guarantee a high level of consumer\nprotection (in line with Article 169 TFEU) and also to prevent Member States\nfrom adopting diverging product regulations which would result in fragmentation\nof the single market. In accordance with the principles\nof proportionality and subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union, this proposal does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\nachieve those objectives.\nThe proposal takes the form of a Regulation.\nThis is the appropriate legal instrument as it imposes clear and detailed rules\nwhich will become applicable in a uniform manner and at the same time throughout\nthe Union. It will avoid diverging transposition by Member States which is\nliable to lead to different levels of health and safety protection and to create\nobstacles to the internal market. Replacing the\nnational transposition measures also has a strong simplification effect since\nit allows economic operators to conduct their business on the basis of a single\nregulatory framework, rather than a 'patchwork' of Member States' national\nlaws.\n\u00b7                        \nFundamental rights \nIn line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights\nof the EU, this proposal seeks to ensure a high level of human health\nprotection (Article 35 of the Charter) and consumer protection (Article 38) by\nassuring a high level of safety of consumer products made available on the\nUnion market. The proposal affects the freedom of economic operators to conduct\nbusiness (Article 16) but the obligations imposed on manufacturers, importers\nand distributors of consumer products are necessary to guarantee a high level\nof safety of those products.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal does not have other budgetary\nimplications than those related to the proper management of the Regulation\nwhich, in form of the GPSD, is already part of the Union law acquis. The budgetary implications are already foreseen in the existing or\nproposed programmes and respect the Commission proposal for the new multiannual\nfinancial framework. The details are set out in the financial statement\nattached to this proposal.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SIMPLIFICATION AND SMART\nREGULATION\nThis proposal contributes to the simplification\nof EU legislation and adheres to the principles of smart regulation. When\npreparing this proposal the Commission has taken stock of the important\nadvancement of sector-specific legislation that aims at ensuring the safety of\nproducts and which usually does not make a distinction whether the products\ncovered are intended for consumers or professional users. Contrary to the\nsituation 10 or 15 years ago, it is not necessary any more to apply a second\nlayer of obligations to economic operators who are already appropriately\nregulated by sector-specific legislation. At the same time, the obligations for\nthose who produce, import or distribute consumer products that are not covered\nby specific legislation are to a large extent aligned with those applicable to\nharmonised products. \nThis approach will reduce administrative\nburdens and compliance costs for businesses, in particular for small and\nmedium-sized enterprises. In the future, they can easily identify the set of\nrules applicable to their commercial activity so that they will save on costs\ncaused by legal uncertainty.\nDue to the subject-matter and objective of the\nproposed Regulation, micro-enterprises as defined in\nCommission Recommendation 2003/361/EC[11] cannot be exempted from its requirements because rules aiming at\nprotecting the health and safety of persons must apply regardless of the size\nof the economic operator. But micro-enterprises are likely to benefit most from\nthe simplification that the new piece of legislation will bring about which is\nfit for purpose and replaces two directives that have become out of date. The\nCommission is committed to providing further guidance to businesses, in particular to small and medium-sized\nenterprises, and consumers to help them to easily\nidentify their respective rights and obligations. \n2013/0049 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non consumer product safety and repealing\nCouncil Directive 87/357/EEC and Directive 2001/95/EC \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[12],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2001/95/EC of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general\nproduct safety[13]\nlays down the requirement that consumer products must be safe and that Member\nStates' market surveillance authorities must take action against dangerous\nproducts as well as exchange information to that effect through the Community rapid\ninformation exchange system RAPEX. Directive 2001/95/EC needs to be\nfundamentally revised to improve its functioning and to ensure consistency with\ndevelopments in Union legislation as regards market surveillance, obligations of\neconomic operators and standardisation. In the interest of clarity, Directive\n2001/95/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\nRegulation is the appropriate legal instrument as it\nimposes clear and detailed rules which do not give room for divergent\ntransposition by Member States. A Regulation ensures that legal requirements\nare applicable at the same time throughout the Union.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation must contribute to the attainment of the objectives\nreferred to in Article 169 of the TFEU. In particular\nit should aim at ensuring the\nfunctioning of the internal market as regards products intended for consumers\nby laying down uniform rules regarding a general safety requirement, assessment\ncriteria and obligations of economic operators. Given that rules on market surveillance, including rules on RAPEX, are\nlaid down in Regulation (EU) No [\u2026/\u2026] [on market\nsurveillance of products][14]\nwhich applies also to products covered by this Regulation, no further\nprovisions on market surveillance or RAPEX are needed in this Regulation.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union legislation on food,\nfeed and related areas sets up a specific regime ensuring the safety of the\nproducts covered by it. This Regulation should therefore not apply to those\nproducts with the exception of materials and articles intended to come into\ncontact with food insofar as risks are concerned that are not covered by\nRegulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n27 October 2004 on materials and articles to come into contact with food[15] or by other food specific\nlegislation which only covers chemical and biological food related risks.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Medicinal products are\nsubject to a pre-market assessment that includes a specific risk-benefit\nanalysis. They should therefore be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nRegulation should not cover services. However, in order to secure the\nattainment of the protection of health and safety of consumers, it should apply\nto products that are supplied or made available to consumers in the context of the\nprovision of services, including products to which\nconsumers are directly exposed during a service provision. Equipment on which consumers ride or travel which is operated by a\nservice provider should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation since it\nhas to be dealt with in conjunction with the safety of the service provided. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite\nthe development of sector-specific Union harmonisation legislation that\naddresses safety aspects of specific products or categories of products, it is\npractically impossible to adopt Union legislation for all consumer products\nthat exist or may be developed. There is therefore still a need for a\nlegislative framework of a horizontal nature to fill gaps and ensure consumer protection\nnot otherwise ensured, in particular with a view to achieving a high level of\nprotection of safety and health of consumers, as required by Article 114 and\nArticle 169 of the TFEU.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrespect of the consumer products subject to this Regulation the scope of\napplication of the different parts of it should be clearly delimited from\nsector-specific Union harmonisation legislation. Whilst the general product safety requirement and related provisions should be\napplicable to all consumer products, the obligations of economic operators\nshould not apply where Union harmonisation legislation includes equivalent\nobligations, such as Union legislation on cosmetics, toys, electrical\nappliances or construction products.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to ensure consistency between this Regulation and sector-specific Union\nharmonisation legislation with regard to specific obligations of economic\noperators, the provisions concerning manufacturers, authorised representatives,\nimporters and distributors should be based on the reference provisions included\nin Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products[16].\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nscope of this Regulation should not be limited to any selling technique of\nconsumer products, and thus also cover distance selling. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nRegulation should apply to second hand products that re-enter the supply chain\nin the course of a commercial activity, except for those second-hand products\nfor which the consumer cannot reasonably expect that they fulfil state-of-the\nart safety standards, such as antiques.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should also\napply to consumer products which, although not foodstuff, resemble\nfoodstuff and are likely to be confused with foodstuff in a way that consumers,\nespecially children, may place them in their mouths, suck or ingest them,\nwhich might cause, for example, suffocation, poisoning, the perforation or\nobstruction of the digestive tract. Those food-imitating products have so far\nbeen regulated by Council Directive 87/357/EEC of 25\nJune 1987 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning\nproducts which, appearing to be other than they are, endanger the health or\nsafety of consumers[17]\nwhich should be repealed.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsafety of products should be assessed taking into account all the relevant\naspects, in particular their characteristics and presentation as well as the\ncategories of consumers who are likely to use the products taking into account\ntheir vulnerability, in particular children, the elderly and the disabled.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To\navoid overlapping safety requirements and conflicts with other Union legislation,\na product which conforms to sector-specific Union harmonisation legislation that aims at the protection of\nhealth and safety of persons should be presumed to be safe under this\nRegulation.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic operators should\nbe responsible for the compliance of products, in relation to their respective\nroles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of protection of the\nhealth and safety of consumers.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All\neconomic operators intervening in the supply and distribution chain should take\nappropriate measures to ensure that they only make available on the market products\nwhich are safe and in conformity with this Regulation. It is necessary to provide\nfor a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which correspond to the\nrole of each operator in the supply and distribution process.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Importers bear the\nresponsibility that products from third countries that they place on the Union\nmarket comply with the requirements of this Regulation. The specific\nobligations of importers should therefore be included in this Regulation.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Distributors make products\navailable on the market after they have been placed on the market by the\nmanufacturer or the importer and should act with due care to ensure that their\nhandling of the product does not adversely affect the compliance of the product\nwith this Regulation.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any\neconomic operator that either places a product on the market under his own name\nor trademark or modifies a product in such a way that compliance with the requirements\nof this Regulation may be affected should be considered to be the manufacturer\nand should assume the obligations of the manufacturer.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ensuring\nproduct identification and the traceability of products throughout the entire\nsupply chain helps to identify economic operators and to take effective\ncorrective measures against unsafe products, such as targeted recalls. Product\nidentification and traceability thus ensure that consumers and economic\noperators obtain accurate information regarding unsafe products which enhances\nconfidence in the market and avoids unnecessary disruption of trade. Products\nshould therefore bear information allowing their identification and the\nidentification of the manufacturer and, if applicable, of the importer.\nManufacturers should also establish technical documentations regarding their\nproducts for which they may choose the most appropriate\nand cost-efficient way such as by electronic means.\nMoreover, economic operators should be required to identify the operators who\nsupplied them and to whom they supplied a product. Directive\n95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on\nthe protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data\nand on the free movement of such data[18] is applicable to\nthe processing of personal data for the purposes of this Regulation.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nindication of origin supplements the basic traceability requirements concerning\nthe name and address of the manufacturer. In particular, the indication of the\ncountry of origin helps to identify the actual place of manufacture in all\nthose cases where the manufacturer cannot be contacted or its given address is\ndifferent from the actual place of manufacture. Such information can facilitate\nthe task of market surveillance authorities in tracing the product back to the\nactual place of manufacture and enable contacts with the authorities of the\ncountries of origin in the framework of bilateral or multilateral cooperation\non consumer product safety for appropriate follow up actions.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\neffective and consistent application of the general safety requirement set out\nin this Regulation, it is important to make use of European standards covering\ncertain products and risks in such a way that a product which conforms to such\na European standard, the reference of which is published in the Official\nJournal of the European Union, is to be presumed to be in compliance with\nthat requirement. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the Commission\nidentifies a need for a European standard ensuring compliance of certain products\nwith the general safety requirement under this Regulation, it should apply the\nrelevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European standardisation[19] to request one or several\nEuropean standardisation organisations to either draft or identify a standard\nwhich is suitable to ensure that products which conform to it are presumed to\nbe safe. The references of such European standards should be published in the Official\nJournal of the European Union.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The procedures to request European\nstandards in support of this Regulation, and on formal objections against them,\nshould be laid down in this Regulation and be aligned with Regulation (EU) No\n1025/2012. To ensure overall consistency in European standardisation issues, requests for European standards, or objections to a European\nstandard, should therefore be brought before the committee set up by that Regulation,\nafter appropriate consultation of experts of the Member States in the field of\nconsumer product safety. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European standards, the\nreferences of which have been published in accordance with Directive\n2001/95/EC, should continue providing presumption of conformity with the\ngeneral safety requirement. Standardisation mandates issued by the Commission\nin accordance with Directive 2001/95/EC should be deemed standardisation\nrequests issued in accordance with this Regulation. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where no relevant European\nstandards or other recognised means to assess the safety of products exist, the\nassessment of product safety should take into account Commission\nrecommendations adopted for this purpose pursuant to Article 292 TFEU.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation,\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards the exemption\nto the obligation to inform market surveillance authorities about products\npresenting a risk, as regards the type of data carrier\nand its placement on the product for the purposes of the traceability system,\nas regards standardisation requests to European standardisation organisations\nand as regards decisions on formal objections to European standards. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation\n(EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February\n2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for\ncontrol by the Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing\npowers[20].\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The advisory procedure\nshould be used for the adoption of implementing acts with respect to the\nobjections to European standards and where the references to the European\nstandard concerned have not yet been published in the Official Journal of\nthe European Union, given that the relevant standard has not yet led to the\npresumption of conformity with the general safety requirement laid down in this\nRegulation.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to maintain a high\nlevel of health and safety of consumers, the power to adopt acts in accordance\nwith Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of products\nfor which the name and address of the manufacturer and of the importer does not\nneed to be indicated on the product itself due to the low level of risk related\nto such products, and in respect of the identification\nand traceability of products bearing a potential serious risk to health and safety. It is of particular\nimportance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its\npreparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and\ndrawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the\nCouncil.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member\nStates should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this\nRegulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties must be\neffective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To\nallow economic operators, Member States and the Commission to adapt to the\nchanges introduced by this Regulation, it is appropriate to provide for a\nsufficient transitional period until the requirements of this Regulation are\napplicable.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\nRegulation, namely to ensure the functioning of the internal market as regards\nproducts intended for consumers while guaranteeing a high level of health and\nsafety protection of consumers, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member\nStates and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the measure, be better\nachieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the\nprinciple of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\nUnion.

This shall overcome the fragmentation of market\nsurveillance rules and obligations of economic operators among various pieces\nof Union legislation (Directive 2001/95/EC, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 and\nsector-specific Union harmonisation legislation) which has led to confusion on\nthe part of both economic operators and national authorities and has seriously\nhampered the effectiveness of market surveillance activity in the Union.\nAlong with a series of other actions, the Single Market Act I and II\nidentified the revision of the General Product Safety Directive as part of the\nProduct Safety Market Surveillance Package as important initiatives to contribute\nto boosting growth and creating jobs.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU involvement\nThe proposed revision of Directive 2001/95/EC, which will integrate\nthe modifications of the Lisbon Treaty, can only be achieved at Union level.\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion (TFEU), to which also Article 169 TFEU refers, in order to ensure a high\nlevel of protection of health and safety of all European consumers and\nestablish an internal market for consumer goods. \nIn accordance with the principles of proportionality and\nsubsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, this\nproposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe use of European standards in support of Directive 2001/95/EC is\ncumbersome and resource-intensive. The proposal aims at simplifying the\nprocedures.\nThe application of Directive 2001/95/EC in terms of market\nsurveillance measures to consumer products covered also by sector-specific\nlegislation was not always clear which will be clarified.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nThis proposal is part of the Product Safety and Market Surveillance\nPackage and thus fully coherent with the proposal for a Regulation of the\nEuropean parliament and of the Council on market surveillance of products.\nThis proposal aligns definitions and economic operators' obligations\nwith the New Legislative Framework adopted in 2008. It is therefore coherent\nwith the \"Alignment Package\" of sectoral Union harmonisation\nlegislation currently negotiated in the European Parliament and in the Council.\nThe provisions on European standards are coherent with the recently\nadopted Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 on European standardisation.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \nX Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) envisaged[24] \nX Centralised direct management\nby the Commission \nX Centralised indirect management\nwith the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \nx\u00a0\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[25]\n\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\n\"Comments\" section.\nComments: \nImplementation of the proposed Regulation should be ensured through\ncentralised direct management by the Commission. \nThe management of the proposed Regulation may be complemented by\nactions with the involvement of the Executive Agency on Health and Consumers\n(EAHC) that, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 of 19\nDecember 2002[26],\ncan be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Community programmes.\nThe Commission has entrusted[27] the Executive Agency for Health and Consumers with implementation\ntasks for the management of the Programme of Community Action in the field of\nConsumer policy for 2007-2013.
