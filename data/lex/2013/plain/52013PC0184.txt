Since the proposed redrafting for that Annex would imply certain substantive amendments, and would\r\ntherefore go beyond straightforward codification, it was considered necessary\r\nthat point 8[6] of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 \u2013 Accelerated working\r\nmethod for official codification of legislative texts[7] \u2013 be applied, in the light of the Joint\r\ndeclaration on that point[8].\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendment to be made to the\r\ntable contained in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 975/98 consists of a replacement of all existing values relating to\r\nthe thickness of coins with new values. In that table, the thickness of the\r\ncoins is indicated in the third column, with a footnote mentioning that the\r\nvalues relating to thickness are of an indicative nature. As was pointed out in\r\nthe abovementioned opinion of the ECB, while those indicative values may have\r\nbeen the only values that could be laid down in 1998 when the technical\r\nspecifications of euro coins intended for circulation were adopted for the\r\nfirst time, it is now considered appropriate that such indicative values be\r\nreplaced by the real thickness values of euro coins, which are well known and\r\nused as reference value by the mints to produce the coins. As a consequence of\r\nthat change, recital 13 of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 975/98, which contains a statement\r\nregarding the indicative nature of the existing thickness values, should be\r\ndeleted.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore appropriate to\r\ntransform the codification of Regulation (EC) No 975/98 into\r\na recast in order to incorporate the necessary amendments.\n\u00ea 975/98\r\n(adapted)\n2013/0096 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non denominations and technical\r\nspecifications of euro coins intended for circulation\n(recast)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article \u00d6 128(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[9],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Central Bank[10],\nWhereas:\n\u00f2 new\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 975/98 of 3 May 1998 on denominations and technical\r\nspecifications of euro coins intended for circulation[11] has\r\nbeen substantially amended several times[12]. Since further amendments are to\r\nbe made, it should be recast in\r\nthe interests of clarity.\n\u00ea 975/98 recital\r\n2 (adapted)\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article \u00d6 128(2) \u00d5 of the Treaty,\r\nMember States may issue euro coins subject to approval by the European Central\r\nBank (ECB) of the volume of the issue. The Council \u00d6 , on a\r\nproposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament\r\nand the ECB, \u00d5 may adopt\r\nmeasures to harmonise the denominations and technical specifications of all\r\ncoins intended for circulation to the extent necessary to permit their smooth\r\ncirculation within the \u00d6 Union \u00d5.\n\u00ea 975/98\r\nrecital 3 (adapted)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Euro banknotes range from\r\n5 to 500 \u00d6 euro \u00d5. The\r\ndenominations of banknotes and coins need to allow for cash payments of amounts\r\nexpressed in euro and cent to be made easily.\n\u00ea 975/98\r\nrecital 5 (adapted)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The single coinage system \u00d6 of the Union \u00d5 should induce\r\npublic confidence and entail technological innovations \u00d6 which\r\nensure that \u00d5 it \u00d6 is \u00d5 a secure,\r\nreliable and efficient system.\n\u00ea 975/98\r\nrecital 6 (adapted)\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The acceptance of the\r\nsystem by the public is one of the main objectives of the coinage system \u00d6 of the\r\nUnion \u00d5. Public\r\nconfidence in the system \u00d6 depends \u00d5 on the\r\nphysical characteristics of the euro coins, which should be as user-friendly as\r\npossible.\n\u00ea 975/98\r\nrecital 7 (adapted)\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultations with\r\nconsumer associations, the European Blind Union and representatives of the\r\nvending machines industry \u00d6 were \u00d5 carried out to\r\ntake into account the specific requirements of important categories of coin\r\nusers. In order to ensure a smooth changeover to the euro and to facilitate\r\nacceptance of the coinage system by users, easy distinction between coins\r\nthrough visual and tactile characteristics \u00d6 needed \u00d5 to be\r\nguaranteed.\n\u00ea 975/98\r\nrecital 8 (adapted)\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The euro coins \u00d6 are \u00d5 more readily\r\ndistinguishable and easier to become accustomed to \u00d6 because\r\nof the \u00d5 link between\r\ntheir diameter and face value.\n\u00ea 975/98\r\nrecital 9 (adapted)\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain special security\r\nfeatures are needed in order to reduce the scope for fraud for the 1 and 2 euro\r\n\u00d6 coins \u00d5 given their\r\nhigh value. The use of a technique whereby coins are made in three layers and\r\nthe combination of two different colours in the coin are considered to be the\r\nmost efficient security features available.\n\u00ea 975/98\r\nrecital 11 (adapted)\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European Parliament and\r\nCouncil Directive 94/27/EC of 30 June 1994 amending for the 12th time Directive\r\n76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative\r\nprovisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing\r\nand use of certain dangerous substances and preparations[13] \u00d6 limits \u00d5 the use of\r\nnickel in certain products in recognition that nickel could cause allergies\r\nunder certain conditions. Coins are not covered by that Directive. It seems\r\ndesirable to reduce the nickel content of coins \u00d6 for\r\nreasons of public health \u00d5.\n\u00ea 975/98 recital\r\n13\nOf all prescribed technical specifications for euro\r\ncoins, only the value for thickness is of an indicative nature since the actual\r\nthickness of a coin depends on prescribed diameter and weight,\n\u00ea 975/98\r\nrecital 10 (adapted) and 566/2012 recital 3 (adapted) \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Giving the coins one \u00d6 common \u00d5 European and \u00d6 a\r\ndistinctive \u00d5 national side\r\nis an appropriate expression of the idea of European monetary union between\r\nMember States. The common European sides of euro coins bear both the name of\r\nthe single currency and the denomination of the coin. The national side should\r\nneither repeat the name of the single currency nor the denomination of the\r\ncoin.\n\u00ea 566/2012\r\nrecital 4\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A clear indication of the\r\nname of the issuing Member State should be put on the national side of the coin\r\nin order to allow interested coin users to easily identify the issuing Member State.\n\u00ea 566/2012\r\nrecital 5\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The edge lettering of euro\r\ncoins should be considered part of the national side and should therefore not\r\nrepeat any indication of the denomination, except for the 2-euro coin, and\r\nprovided that only the figure \u20182\u2019 or the term \u2018euro\u2019 in the relevant alphabet,\r\nor both, are used.\n\u00ea 566/2012\r\nrecital 6\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The designs on the national\r\nside of euro coins are decided upon by each Member State whose currency is the\r\neuro and should take into account the fact that euro coins circulate in the\r\nwhole euro area and not only in the issuing Member State. In order to ensure\r\nthat coins are immediately recognisable as euro coins also from their national\r\nside, the design should be fully surrounded by the 12 stars of the Union flag.\n\u00ea 566/2012\r\nrecital 7\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\r\nrecognition of circulation coins and to ensure appropriate continuity in the\r\nminting, Member States should only be allowed to modify the designs used for\r\nthe national sides of regular circulation coins once every 15 years,\r\nexcept if the Head of State referred to on a coin changes. This should,\r\nhowever, be without prejudice to changes necessary to prevent counterfeiting of\r\nthe currency. Changes to the design of the common European side of circulation\r\ncoins should be decided by the Council and voting rights should be restricted\r\nto Member States whose currency is the euro.\n\u00ea 566/2012\r\nrecital 8\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individual Member States\r\nshould be allowed to issue commemorative coins to celebrate subjects of major\r\nnational or European relevance, whereas commemorative coins issued collectively\r\nby all Member States whose currency is the euro should be reserved for subjects\r\nof the highest European relevance. The 2-euro coin constitutes the most\r\nsuitable denomination for this purpose, principally on account of the large\r\ndiameter of the coin and its technical characteristics, which offer adequate\r\nprotection against counterfeiting.\n\u00ea 566/2012\r\nrecital 9\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account that\r\neuro coins circulate in the whole euro area, to avoid the use of inappropriate\r\ndesigns, issuing Member States should inform each other and the Commission\r\nabout draft designs for the national side of euro coins in advance of the\r\nplanned issue date. The Commission should verify the compliance of the designs with\r\nthe technical requirements of this Regulation. Submission of draft designs to\r\nthe Commission should be made sufficiently in advance of the planned issue date\r\nfor issuing Member States to modify the design if necessary.\n\u00ea 566/2012\r\nrecital 10\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, uniform\r\nconditions for the approval of the designs of the national sides of euro coins\r\nshould be laid down to avoid the choice of designs which could be considered as\r\ninappropriate in some Member States. In view of the fact that the competence\r\nfor an issue as sensitive as the design of the national sides of the euro coins\r\nbelongs to the issuing Member States, implementing powers should be conferred\r\non the Council. Any implementing decisions taken on this basis by the Council\r\nwould be closely connected to the acts adopted by the Council on the basis of\r\nArticle 128(2) of the Treaty. Therefore, the suspension of the voting\r\nrights of the members of the Council representing Member States whose currency\r\nis not the euro for the adoption by the Council of those decisions should apply\r\nas set out in Article 139(4) of the Treaty. The procedure should allow the\r\nissuing Member States to modify the design in due time if so required,\n\u00ea 975/98\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\u00ea 975/98\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 1\nThe series of euro coins \u00d6 shall \u00d5 include eight\r\ndenominations in the range from 1 cent to 2 euro \u00d6 which\r\nshall meet the technical specifications set out in Annex I. \u00d5\n\u00ea 566/2012\r\nArt. 1\nArticle 2\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the\r\nfollowing definitions shall apply:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201ccirculation coins\u201d means euro\r\ncoins intended for circulation, the denominations and technical specifications\r\nof which are referred to in Article 1;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cregular coins\u201d means circulation\r\ncoins excluding commemorative coins;\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201ccommemorative coins\u201d means\r\ncirculation coins which are intended to commemorate a specific subject as\r\nspecified in Article 9.\nArticle 3\nCirculation coins shall have a common\r\nEuropean side and a distinctive national side.\nArticle 4\n1. The national side of circulation coins\r\nshall not repeat any indication of the denomination, or any parts thereof, of\r\nthe coin. It shall not repeat the name of the single currency or of its\r\nsubdivision, unless such indication stems from the use of a different alphabet.\n2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1,\r\nthe edge lettering of the 2-euro coin may include an indication of the\r\ndenomination, provided that only the figure \u201c2\u201d or the term \u201ceuro\u201d in the\r\nrelevant alphabet, or both, are used.\nArticle 5\nThe national side of all denominations of\r\ncirculation coins shall bear an indication of the issuing Member State by means of the Member State\u2019s name or an abbreviation of it.\nArticle 6\n1. The national side of circulation coins\r\nshall bear a circle of 12 stars that shall fully surround the national design,\r\nincluding the year mark and the indication of the issuing Member State\u2019s name. This shall not prevent some design elements from extending into the circle of\r\nstars, provided that the stars are all clearly and fully visible. The 12 stars\r\nshall be depicted as on the Union flag.\n2. The designs for the national side of\r\ncirculation coins shall be chosen taking into account that euro coins circulate\r\nin all Member States whose currency is the euro.\nArticle 7\n1. Changes to the designs used for the\r\nnational sides of regular coins may only be made once every 15 years,\r\nwithout prejudice to changes necessary to prevent counterfeiting of the\r\ncurrency.\n2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1,\r\nchanges to the designs used for the national sides of regular coins may be made\r\nwhere the Head of State referred to on a coin changes. However, a temporary\r\nvacancy or the provisional occupation of the function of Head of State shall\r\nnot give any additional right to such change.\nArticle 8\nIssuing Member States shall update their\r\nnational sides of regular coins in order to fully comply with this Regulation\r\nby 20 June 2062.\nArticle 9\n1. Commemorative coins shall bear a\r\ndifferent national design from that of the regular coins and shall only\r\ncommemorate subjects of major national or European relevance. Commemorative\r\ncoins issued collectively by all Member States whose currency is the euro shall\r\nonly commemorate subjects of the highest European relevance and their design\r\nshall be without prejudice to the possible constitutional requirements of those\r\nMember States.\n2. The edge lettering on commemorative\r\ncoins shall be the same as on regular coins.\n3. Commemorative coins may only have a face\r\nvalue of 2 euro.\nArticle 10\n1. Member States shall inform each other of\r\nthe draft designs of new national sides of circulation coins, including the\r\nedge lettering, and, for commemorative coins, of the estimated volume of\r\nissuance, before the formal approval of those designs.\n2. The power to approve designs for new or\r\nmodified national sides of circulation coins shall be conferred on the Council\r\nacting by qualified majority in accordance with the procedure set out in\r\nparagraphs 3 to 7.\nWhen taking the decisions referred to in\r\nthis Article, the voting rights of the Member States whose currency is not the\r\neuro shall be suspended.\n3. For the purpose of paragraph 1, draft\r\ndesigns of circulation coins shall be submitted by the issuing Member State to the Council, to the Commission and to the other Member States whose\r\ncurrency is the euro, in principle at least three months before the planned\r\nissue date.\n4. Within seven days following the\r\nsubmission referred to in paragraph 3, any Member State whose currency is the\r\neuro may, in a reasoned opinion addressed to the Council and to the Commission,\r\nraise an objection to the draft design proposed by the issuing Member State if that draft design is likely to create adverse reactions among its citizens.\n5. Where the Commission considers that the\r\ndraft design does not respect the technical requirements set out by this\r\nRegulation, it shall, within seven days following the submission referred to in\r\nparagraph 3, submit a negative assessment to the Council.\n6.
