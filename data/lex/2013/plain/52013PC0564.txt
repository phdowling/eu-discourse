The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n Summary of the proposed action The attached proposal for a Council Implementing Regulation is based on the findings of the investigation, which has confirmed that circumvention of the measures is taking place and that all other criteria for the establishment of circumvention as set out in Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation are met. It is therefore proposed that the Council adopt the attached proposal to extend the anti-dumping measures on molybdenum wire, containing by weight at least 99,95% of molybdenum originating from the People\u2019s Republic of China to imports of certain slightly modified molybdenum wires, containing by weight 97% or more but less than 99,95% of molybdenum, originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The relevant Council Regulation should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union no later than 19 September 2013. \n Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community and in particular Article 13 thereof. \n Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n Indication of how the financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n Choice of instruments \n Proposed instruments: Regulation. \n Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The above-mentioned basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nUnion budget.\n2013/0272 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nextending the definitive anti-dumping duty\r\nimposed by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 511/2010 on imports of molybdenum\r\nwire, containing by weight at least 99,95 % of molybdenum, of which the maximum\r\ncross- sectional dimension exceeds 1,35 mm but does not exceed 4,0 mm,\r\noriginating in the People\u2019s Republic of China to imports of molybdenum wire,\r\ncontaining by weight at least 97 % of molybdenum, of which the maximum cross-\r\nsectional dimension exceeds 1,35 mm but does not exceed 4,0 mm, originating in\r\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\r\ncountries not members of the European Community[1]\r\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Article 13 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission after having consulted Advisory Committee,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Procedure \n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing measures \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In December 2009, the\r\nEuropean Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) by Regulation (EU) No1247/2009[2] (\u2018the provisional anti-dumping\r\nregulation\u2019), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of molybdenum\r\nwire, containing by weight at least 99,95% of molybdenum, of which the maximum\r\ncross-sectional dimension exceeds 1,35 mm but does not exceed 4,0 mm\r\noriginating in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u2018PRC\u2019). \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In June 2010, the Council,\r\nby Implementing Regulation (EU) No 511/2010[3],\r\nimposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 64,3% on the same imports. These\r\nmeasures will hereinafter be referred to as \u2018the measures in force\u2019 and the\r\ninvestigation that led to the measures in force will be hereinafter referred to\r\nas \u2018the original investigation\u2019.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In January 2012, following\r\nan anti-circumvention investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic\r\nRegulation, by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 14/2012[4] the Council extended the measures\r\nin force to imports of the product concerned consigned from Malaysia, whether\r\ndeclared as originating in Malaysia or not. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Request\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nNovember 2012, the Commission received a request pursuant to Articles 13(3) and\r\n14(5) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the\r\nanti-dumping measures imposed on certain molybdenum wires originating in the PRC\r\nby imports of certain slightly modified molybdenum wires, containing by weight\r\n97% or more but less than 99,95% of molybdenum, originating in the PRC, and to\r\nmake such imports subject to registration.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request was lodged by\r\nPlansee SE (\u2018Plansee\u2019), a Union producer of certain molybdenum wires that\r\nparticipated in the original investigation.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request contained\r\nsufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on\r\nimports of certain molybdenum wires originating in the PRC are being\r\ncircumvented by means of imports of a certain slightly modified molybdenum\r\nwires, containing by weight 97% or more but less than 99,95% of molybdenum,\r\noriginating in the PRC. \n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having\r\ndetermined, after the consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient prima\r\nfacie evidence existed for the initiation of an investigation pursuant to\r\nArticles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission initiated an\r\ninvestigation by Regulation (EU) No 1236/2012[5] (\u2018the\r\ninitiating Regulation\u2019) of the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures\r\nimposed on imports of certain molybdenum wires originating in the PRC and also\r\ndirected the customs authorities to register imports into the Union of\r\nmolybdenum wire, containing by weight 97 % or more but less than 99,95 % of\r\nmolybdenum, of which the maximum cross-sectional dimension exceeds 1,35 mm but\r\ndoes not exceed 4,0 mm and currently falling within CN code ex 8102 96 00\r\n(TARIC code 8102 96 00 30), originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China, as\r\nfrom 21 December 2012.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product concerned and\r\nproduct under investigation\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned is\r\nthe same as defined in the original investigation, namely molybdenum wire,\r\ncontaining by weight at least 99,95% of molybdenum, of which the maximum\r\ncross-sectional dimension exceeds 1,35 mm but does not exceed 4,0 mm (\u2018pure\r\nmolybdenum\u2019) originating in the PRC currently falling within CN code ex 8102 96\r\n00. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nproduct under investigation, namely the product allegedly circumventing, is the\r\nsame as that defined in recital (7) containing by weight 97% or more but less\r\nthan 99,95% of molybdenum, of which the maximum cross-sectional dimension\r\nexceeds 1,35 mm but does not exceed 4,0 mm originating in the PRC. \n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation and parties\r\nconcerned by the investigation\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission officially advised the authorities of the PRC of the initiation of\r\nthe investigation and sent questionnaires to the exporting producers in the PRC\r\nand importers in the Union known\r\nto be concerned. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make\r\nthemselves and their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the\r\ntime limit set in the initiating Regulation. All parties were informed that\r\nnon-cooperation might lead to the application of Article 18 of the basic\r\nRegulation and to findings being based on facts available.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two\r\nexporting producers submitted a questionnaire reply to the Commission. One of\r\nthese companies, who also cooperated during the original investigation, is a\r\ngenuine exporting producer of the product under investigation. As regards the\r\nsecond one, this company did not report any sales of the product under\r\ninvestigation. Therefore, its submission was disregarded. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Four importers submitted a\r\nquestionnaire reply to the Commission. One of them did not report any imports\r\nof the product under investigation and turned out to be a user of molybdenum\r\nwire.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission carried out on-spot\r\ninvestigations at the two premises of the cooperating Chinese exporting\r\nproducer:\n---\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jinduicheng Molybdenum Co.,\r\nLtd., No88, Jinye 1st Road, Hi-Tech Industry Developing Zone, Xi\u2019an,\r\nShaanxi Province, P.R.

The reporting period (\u2018RP\u2019) covered\r\nthe period from 1 October 2011 to 30 September 2012 in order to investigate if\r\nthe imports are made at prices below the\r\nnon-injurious price established in the investigation that led to the existing\r\nmeasures and the existence of dumping. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Results of the\r\ninvestigation\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General considerations\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n13(1) of the basic Regulation, the assessment of the existence of possible\r\ncircumvention practices was made by analysing successively: (1) whether there\r\nwas a change in pattern of trade between the PRC and the Union; (2) if this\r\nchange stemmed from a practise, process or work for which there was\r\ninsufficient due cause or economic justification other than the imposition of\r\nthe duty; (3) if there was evidence of injury or that remedial effects of the\r\nduty were being undermined in terms of the prices and/or quantities of the\r\nproduct under investigation; and (4) whether there was evidence of dumping in\r\nrelation to the normal values previously established for the like product, if\r\nnecessary in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of the basic Regulation.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Slight modification and\r\nessential characteristics \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ninvestigation has shown that the product under investigation is a wire made of\r\nmolybdenum (between 99,6% and 99,7%) and usually lanthanum (\u2018La\u2019) (between\r\n0,25% and 0,35%). This alloy contains also other chemicals elements and is\r\nknown as a \u2018doped molybdenum\u2019 or \u2018MoLa\u2019 or \u2018ML\u2019. The product concerned and the\r\nproduct under investigation both currently fall under CN code 8102 96 00. As\r\nexplained below, the investigation did not find any difference in the\r\nproduction process of the product under investigation and the product\r\nconcerned, other than the addition of a low percentage of lanthanum to pure\r\nmolybdenum at the blending step. In addition, the cooperating exporting\r\nproducer confirmed that the cost of production of the product under\r\ninvestigation is similar to the cost of the product concerned. This implies\r\nthat there is no economic benefit for the exporting producer to produce the\r\nproduct under investigation other than avoidance of the measures in force.\r\nFurthermore, it was found that the users of the product concerned switched to\r\nthe product under investigation after the imposition of the provisional\r\nmeasures, which implies that there is not\r\ndifference between the product concerned and the product under consideration\r\nfor the users.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nmentioned in recital (15) of the provisional anti-dumping regulation, the\r\nproduct concerned is mainly used as coating in the manufacturing of automotive\r\nparts (i.e. gear boxes), aircraft parts or as electrical contacts. The most\r\ntraded diameters of the product concerned are 2,31 mm and 3,17 mm, used for\r\nflame or arc spraying.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three\r\nparties argued that the product under investigation and the product concerned\r\nhave different essential characteristics. At the request of two of them, a\r\nconfrontational hearing with GTV, JDC and Plansee, chaired by the Hearing\r\nOfficer took place in April 2013. As explained in detail below, during the\r\nhearing the main focus was on the alleged technical differences between the product\r\nconcerned and the product under investigation, and the economic justification\r\nfor importation of the latter into the Union market.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 GTV\r\nand JDC argued during the hearing and in writing that the product under\r\ninvestigation has different essential physical characteristics which differ\r\nsignificantly from the product concerned. More specifically, they claimed that\r\nthe ductility, namely the ability of the material to be drawn out\r\nlongitudinally to a reduced section without fracture under the action of a\r\ntensile force, the elongation parameters and the coating properties of the\r\nproduct under investigation are especially improved compared to the product\r\nconcerned.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In support of this claim, the\r\ntwo parties submitted a number of articles and studies which aimed to show that\r\nalloying molybdenum and lanthanum leads to a product with better resistance to\r\nbrittle failure and better elongation than the product concerned. These parties\r\nalso claimed that information published on the Plansee\u2019s web site provides\r\nevidence that the product under investigation has improved properties compared\r\nto the product concerned.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding the product\u2019s\r\ncharacteristics, in order to evaluate whether the product under investigation\r\nand the product concerned have different essential characteristics, Plansee\r\nproposed to mandate an independent institute to compare the product concerned\r\nand the product under investigation. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After\r\nthe hearing, the above request was assessed on the basis of the evidence\r\ncollected during the investigation, in particular the purchase orders sent by\r\nimporters to the exporting producer, the explanations provided by the exporting\r\nproducer about its production process, the chemical content and elongation and\r\ntensility characteristics mentioned on certificates of qualities, the commercial\r\ninvoices issued by the exporting producer and the absence of any commercial\r\ninformation related to the improved characteristic of the product under\r\ninvestigation compared to the product concerned sent to any customer. All the\r\ninformation confirmed that better properties were not requested by the\r\ncustomers nor provided by the producer of the product under investigation. Therefore,\r\nit was concluded that an expert\u2019s opinion is not necessary. In consequence,\r\nthis request was rejected.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this aspect, the investigation has confirmed that the\r\nimproved qualities mentioned above in recital (20) depend on the content of\r\nlanthanum and on whether an optimized production processes is being used.\r\nHowever, the cooperating exporting producer did not demonstrate that it put in\r\nplace the optimized production processes for the product under investigation\r\nexported to the EU during the IP. The claim was therefore rejected as\r\nunfounded.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One party claimed that the\r\nproduct under investigation has improved coating properties. However, the party\r\ndid not submit sufficient evidence to support this statement. The claim was\r\ntherefore rejected as unfounded. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two parties claimed that\r\nfracture toughness is improved for the product under investigation. This means\r\nthat the wire never breaks when unrolled inside a spraying machine. However,\r\nthese parties were asked to provide supporting documentation but failed in\r\ndoing this. In the absence of any supporting evidence, this claim was disregarded.\r\n\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the above,\r\nit has been concluded that the product under investigation has no different\r\nproperties compared to the product concerned.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\r\nthe evidence collected during the verification visits shows that users/importers\r\ndid not specifically request the product with the claimed better physical\r\ncharacteristics as described above in recital (20) when placing their orders.\r\nNone of them requested a specific content of lanthanum but did request at least\r\n99% of pure molybdenum. Only one customer requested specific physical\r\ncharacteristics for the parameters of elongation and tensility. In this case,\r\nthe exporting producer tested these parameters and provided this customer with\r\ncertificates of quality. As these certificates were also delivered for the\r\nproduct concerned, it was possible to compare the two products for these\r\nparameters. The comparison showed that the requirements for elongation and\r\ntensility were identical for both products. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naddition, the investigation showed that the exporting producer did not inform\r\nthe market or their customers on the alleged advantages of the product under\r\ninvestigation over the product concerned and did not market the slightly\r\nmodified MoLa wires as a new or different product.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on a patent\r\nregistered by Plansee in January 1996, one party claimed that the product\r\nconcerned and the product under investigation are different products. Analysis\r\nof this claim showed that the patent does not concern the product under\r\ninvestigation but the use of a molybdenum alloy as a lead-in conductor for\r\nlamps, electron tubes and similar components. Furthermore, the diameters of\r\nthis product type are lower than the diameters defined for the product under\r\ninvestigation. In addition, as mentioned above in recital (24), the alleged improved\r\nqualities of MoLa over the product concerned depend on the use of an optimized\r\nproduction process. The claim is therefore rejected. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, it has to be\r\nconcluded that from a customer\u2019s point of view, the product concerned and the\r\nproduct under investigation are very similar.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\r\nparty claimed that the commercial offers published on Plansee\u2019s web site show\r\nthat they offered the product under investigation not only in the field of\r\nthermal spraying but also in various other domains (i.e. lamp components, wire\r\ncutting industries). However, Plansee\u2019s commented that the commercial\r\ninformation published on its web site indicates the diameters for which they\r\nare able to supply. In addition, the investigation showed that Plansee\u2019s sales\r\nfor other domains are very limited (i.e. less than 2% in quantity compared with\r\nthe sales of the product concerned) and that an optimized production processes was\r\nused. Therefore, this claim was rejected.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One party claimed that\r\nPlansee was already producing the product under investigation when it lodged the\r\ncomplaint which led to the initiation of the original investigation and since\r\nPlansee considers that the product under investigation and the product\r\nconcerned share the same essential characteristics, they should have included\r\nit in the scope of the original investigation. However, as explained above\r\nrecital (32), the investigation confirmed that this particular MoLa wire is\r\ndifferent from the product under investigation. The product diameters are\r\ngenerally below 1mm and it is mainly used in the lighting industry. Moreover, as\r\nmentioned below in Table 1, the imports of the product under investigation\r\nstarted only after provisional measures were imposed on the product concerned. Therefore,\r\nin the absence of any imports of the product under investigation during the IP\r\nof the original investigation, there were no reasons to include this product in\r\nthe product scope. The claim is therefore rejected as unfounded. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\r\nparty claimed that the expansion of the range from 99,95% down to 97% will\r\ncover all kinds of molybdenum alloys and in consequence, these products would\r\nnot be available on the EU market (i.e. for example for the re-drawing market).\r\nFirstly, this party did not present any evidence supporting this statement. Secondly,\r\nthe investigation has shown that only one exporting producer was exporting MoLa\r\nto the Union during the IP\r\nand no other alloys which would be covered by the definition of the product\r\nunder investigation. Thirdly, the investigation showed that the market in the\r\nEU for redrawing and sales of molybdenum alloys is very limited. Finally, the\r\nextension of the measures will not make it impossible to import the product\r\nunder investigation. The claim was therefore rejected. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As far as the questions of\r\nwhether or not the modification mentioned in recital (19) altered the essential\r\ncharacteristics of the product concerned, the information provided by the\r\ncooperating parties analysed in recital (24) to recital (32), revealed that the\r\nproduct under investigation has the same basic physical characteristics and\r\nuses as the product concerned. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In consequence, it was\r\nfound that there are no relevant physical characteristics differences between\r\nthe product under investigation and the product concerned. Therefore, it was\r\nconcluded that the product under investigation is considered as a like product\r\nwithin the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore,\r\nit has to be concluded that the product under investigation is only slightly\r\nmodified compared to the product concerned, imported for no other economic\r\njustification but to circumvent the anti-dumping duties in place. \n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change in the pattern of\r\ntrade\n2.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports of molybdenum wires\r\ninto the Union\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information\r\nabout the Union imports could not be directly obtained from Eurostat data, as\r\nthe CN code under which the product under investigation is declared includes\r\nalso other products than the product under investigation. Therefore, in the\r\nabsence of specific import statistics for the product under investigation,\r\nEurostat data was adjusted in accordance with the method suggested in the request.\r\nAccordingly, the volume of imports of the product under investigation into the Union was established on the basis of an\r\nestimation of the EU consumption of molybdenum wires adjusted by the total EU\r\nproduction of the product concerned. This method was found to be reliable to\r\nobtain data relating to the product under investigation.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nmentioned in recital (11), only one exporting producer in the PRC cooperated\r\nwith the investigation. However, on the basis the comparison of the of the\r\ninformation given by this exporting producer with the adjusted Eurostat data\r\nmentioned in the previous recital, it was established that this company\r\nrepresented most of the total EU imports of the product under investigation\r\nduring the IP and was thus considered to be representative for the total EU\r\nimports of molybdenum wires.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As shown in the table\r\nbelow, the imports into the Union of the product concerned stopped entirely after\r\nthe imposition of the definitive measures in June 2010 and were immediately\r\nreplaced by imports of the product under investigation. \nTable\r\n1: Evolution of the imports of the product concerned and product under\r\ninvestigation originating the PRC\n Imports to the EU || 2008 || 2009 || 01/01/2010* - 16/06/2010 || 17/06/2010** - 31/12/2010 || 2010 || 2011 || RP*** \n (1) Total Imports \u2013 (tonnes indexed) || 100 || 31 || 10 || 17 || 27 || 128 || 99 \n Total Imports || 100% || 100% || 100% || 100% || 100% || 100% || 100% \n Product Concerned || 100% || 100% || 20% || 0% || 7% || 0% || 0% \n \u00a0Product Under Investigation || 0% || 0% || 80% || 100% || 93% || 100% || 100% \n (1) Indexed on the basis of volume in kg reported by the cooperating exporting producer.

These parties purchased 99,8% of the total\r\nquantity of the product under investigation during the RP.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two interested parties\r\nclaimed that as early as in 2007, they started a project to develop the product\r\nunder investigation in the PRC and thus the exports of the product under\r\ninvestigation was not linked to the imposition of the measures on the product\r\nconcerned. However, the investigation did not confirm the materiality of such a\r\nproject. Altogether, one email, the minutes of one phone conference and the export\r\nof a sample of the product under investigation for further analysis were\r\nprovided. Furthermore, this project did not result in any sales of the product\r\nunder investigation to the EU before the imposition of the provisional measures\r\non the product concerned, namely in October 2010. Nevertheless, the fact that a\r\nproject was allegedly initiated in 2007 does not change the finding that the\r\nproduct concerned and the product under investigation are similar. The\r\nconclusion reached in the investigation that there was no economic\r\njustification for the export of the product under investigation than the\r\nimposition of the measures on the product concerned also remain valid.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation also\r\nshowed that no sales of the product under investigation\r\nwere made to other countries than the EU and that only limited quantities were\r\nsold in the Chinese market during the IP as shown in table 2 below.\nTable\r\n2: Product under investigation market\n   || 2008 || 2009 || 01/01/2010-16/06/2010 || 17/06/2010-31/12/2010 || 2010 || 2011 || 1/10/2011-30/09/2012 \n (1) Total Turnover (indexed) || 100 || 96 || 863 || 1529 || 2393 || 11168 || 8123 \n \u00a0Total Turnover || 100% || 100% || 100% || 100% || 100% || 100% || 100% \n Domestic sales (PRC) || 100% || 100% || 5% || 4% || 4% || 0.4% || 2% \n EU sales ||  0% || 0%  || 95% || 96% || 95% || 99,6% || 98% \n \u00a0Other countries sales ||  0% ||  0% ||  0% || 0%  ||  0% ||  0% ||  0% \n (1) methodology as described for Table 1.

These improvements have an impact on the\r\nproductivity of coating gear components, by minimizing production interruption\r\ndue to brittle wire failure. However, the investigation has confirmed that this\r\nparty did not market the product under investigation nor informed its customers\r\nabout the alleged different technical characteristics or about the improvements\r\nbrought by the product under investigation. In addition, the customers did not\r\nspecifically ask for the improvements. The claim\r\nwas therefore rejected as unfounded.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\r\nparty claimed that one user switched to the product under investigation because\r\nof the technical failures of the product concerned. However, this party was\r\nasked to provide supporting documentation but failed in doing this. In the\r\nabsence of any supporting evidence, this claim was disregarded.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 GTV\r\nclaimed that MoLa used for spray coating provides better results when\r\nconsidering the coating micro hardness. This allows avoiding wear by material\r\ntransfer from the surface of a component rubbing on a counterpart. This party submitted\r\ntest results from an independent laboratory showing that micro hardness can be\r\nimproved with the use of MoLa. However, the methodology used by the independent\r\nlaboratory did not guarantee the outcome as the test was realized on only one\r\nbatch of wire while this party claimed that a further test analysis should cover\r\na multitude of batches. In addition, the chemical composition of the sample tested\r\nwas not analysed which means that there is no guarantee that the batch analysed\r\nwas actually the product under investigation. The claim was therefore rejected\r\nas unfounded.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation did not\r\nbring to light any other due cause or economic justification for the imports of\r\nthe product under investigation other than the avoidance of the payment of the\r\nduty in force.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore concluded\r\nthat, in the absence of any other sufficient due cause or economic\r\njustification within the meaning of the second sentence of Article 13(1) of the\r\nbasic Regulation, the change in the pattern of trade between the PRC and the\r\nUnion was due to the imposition of the measures in force.\n2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Undermining of the remedial\r\neffects of the duty in terms of the prices and/or the quantities of the like\r\nproduct\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To assess whether the imports\r\nof the product under investigation, in terms of quantities and prices,\r\nundermined the remedial effects to the measures in force, data provided by one\r\ncooperating exporting producer as described in recital (39) were used.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The increase in imports of\r\nthe product under investigation from the PRC as from the imposition of the\r\nprovisional measures was significant in terms of quantities. The level of\r\nimports into the EU from the PRC in the RP corresponds to the level of imports\r\nof the product concerned originating in the PRC to the Union in 2008, before\r\nthe imposition of measures.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the\r\ninjury elimination level as established in the original Regulation and the\r\nweighted average of exports price showed significant underselling. It was\r\ntherefore concluded that the remedial effects of the measures in force are\r\nbeing undermined both in terms of quantities and prices.\n2.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evidence of dumping in\r\nrelation to the normal value previously established for the like product\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export prices of the\r\nproduct under investigation have been established on the basis of the verified\r\ninformation provided by the cooperating exporting producer.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These\r\nexport prices were found to be slightly lower compared to the export prices of\r\nthe product concerned previously established in the original investigation. Two\r\ninterested parties confirmed that there is almost no price difference between\r\nthe product concerned and the product under investigation.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, in accordance\r\nwith article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, it was considered appropriate to\r\ncompare the normal value previously established in the original investigation with\r\nthe export price of the product under investigation. \n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nmentioned in recital (24) and (25) of the provisional regulation, the USA was considered to be an appropriate market\r\neconomy analogue country. It is recalled that since the analogue country\r\nproducer made only marginal sales on the domestic US market, it was found\r\nunreasonable to use US domestic sales data for the purposes of determining or\r\nconstructing normal value. Consequently, the normal value for the PRC was\r\nestablished on the basis of export prices from the USA to other third\r\ncountries, including the Union.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One party claimed that the\r\nnormal value established in the original should be adjusted because the price\r\nof molybdenum oxide, which is a decisive factor for the price setting of both the\r\nproduct concerned and the product under investigation, fell sharply in the\r\nreporting period of this investigation. As mentioned above in recital (61), normal\r\nvalue in the original investigation was established on the basis of the prices charged\r\nfor export by a producer located in the USA and not on the basis of its costs.\r\nTherefore, any adjustment based on costs does not seem to be appropriate in\r\nthis case. Because the price of the main raw material decreased significantly\r\nit appears even more clearly that prices elements should be used to establish\r\nthe relevant normal value in this case.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The adjustment to the normal\r\nvalue was thus established on the basis of the evolution of prices of the\r\nproduct concerned. Given that the US producer stopped its activity and that no\r\ninformation was available from the analogue country, the adjustment was\r\ncalculated on the basis of the prices reported by Plansee in the original\r\ninvestigation and during the RP. This led to a downwards adjustment of about\r\n20% to the normal value established in the original investigation. \n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation, dumping was calculated by comparing\r\nthe adjusted weighted average normal value as established in the original investigation\r\nand the weighted average export prices of the product under investigation established\r\nduring this investigation\u2019s RP, expressed as a percentage of the net,\r\nfree-at-Union- frontier price, before customs duty. \n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the adjusted\r\nweighted average normal value and the weighted average export prices showed the\r\nexistence of dumping.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer in\r\nthe PRC, requested an exemption from the possible extended measures in\r\naccordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation and submitted a\r\nquestionnaire reply. \n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has\r\nhowever confirmed that this producer circumvented the measures in place. It was\r\ntherefore concluded to reject the request.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MEASURES \n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the findings\r\nabove, it was concluded that the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on\r\nimports of molybdenum wires originating in the PRC was circumvented by imports\r\nof a certain slightly modified molybdenum wires originating in the PRC.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nfirst sentence of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, the existing\r\nanti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in the\r\nPRC, should be extended to imports of the product under investigation.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Articles 13(3)\r\nand 14(5) of the basic Regulation, which provide that any extended measures\r\nshall be applied against registered imports from the date of registration, the\r\nanti-dumping duty should be collected on all imports of into the Union of\r\nmolybdenum wire, containing by weight 97 % or more but less than 99,95 % of\r\nmolybdenum, of which the maximum cross-sectional dimension exceeds 1,35 mm but\r\ndoes not exceed 4,0 mm and currently falling within CN code ex 8102 96 00\r\n(TARIC code 8102 96 00 30) which entered the Union under registration imposed\r\nby the initiating Regulation.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DISCLOSURE\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All interested parties were\r\ninformed of the essential facts and considerations leading to the above\r\nconclusions and were invited to comment.
