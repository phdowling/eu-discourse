The Commission notified Luxembourg by letter dated 12 November\r\n2012 that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.\nGeneral context\nChapter 1 of Title XII of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC allows Member States to apply special schemes for small\r\nenterprises, including the possibility of exempting taxable persons below a certain\r\nannual turnover. This exemption implies that a taxable person does not have to\r\ncharge VAT on his supplies and, consequently, he cannot deduct the VAT on his\r\npurchases.\nUnder the first paragraph of\r\nArticle 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Member States, which did not\r\nexercise the option under Article 14 of Directive 67/228/EEC to introduce\r\nexemptions or graduated tax relief, may exempt taxable persons whose annual\r\nturnover is no higher than EUR 5 000 or the equivalent in national\r\ncurrency. Pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 285 of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC, those Member States may also grant graduated tax relief to taxable\r\npersons whose annual turnover exceeds the ceiling fixed by them for its\r\napplication.\nAccording to the information submitted to\r\nthe Commission, Luxembourg currently exempts from VAT taxable persons whose\r\nannual turnover is no higher than EUR 10 000. Furthermore, Luxembourg\r\ninformed the Commission that it makes use of the option pursuant to the second\r\nparagraph of Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC by granting graduated\r\ntax relief to taxable persons whose annual turnover is between\r\nEUR 10 000 and EUR 25 000.\nLuxembourg has the\r\nobjective to apply a turnover threshold of EUR 25 000 as regards the\r\nexemption scheme for small businesses whilst at the same time abolish the\r\napplication of the graduated tax relief. It considers that, as part of an\r\neconomic recovery programme and also to take account of the monetary\r\ndepreciation since the introduction of the exemption scheme in Luxembourg, increasing\r\nthe current exemption scheme ceiling for small enterprises to EUR 25 000\r\nshould enable the VAT administrative burden to be significantly lightened for\r\nenterprises with a low turnover and should foster the creation of new\r\nopportunities for this type of businesses.\nThe application of the increased exemption\r\nthreshold is in its view appropriate to simplify the VAT system for small\r\nenterprises by significantly reducing the burdens on those businesses eligible\r\nfor the scheme by releasing them from many of the VAT obligations under the\r\nnormal VAT arrangements. Moreover, the measure pursued would have the\r\nadditional effect to reduce the administrative burden for businesses currently\r\nsubject to the graduated tax relief scheme, which will be removed at the same\r\ntime. The system would be optional for taxable persons. According to the Luxembourg authorities, the special measure pursued would only have a negligible effect on\r\nthe overall amount of VAT revenue collected (not more than 0.10%).\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nIn 2004, the Commission made a proposal to -\r\ninter alia - increase the annual turnover threshold available to Member States\r\n(COM(2004) 728 final[2])\r\nfor the exemption from VAT of taxable persons to EUR 100 000. That\r\nproposal is still on the table of the Council.\nIn the medium term, the Commission\r\nconsiders that the adoption of that proposal would be a more appropriate way\r\nforward than having a piecemeal approach based on individual derogations. The\r\nCommission therefore calls on the Council to resume the negotiations on that\r\nproposal.\nConsistency with other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nNot applicable.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nNot relevant.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThe proposal for a Council Decision aims at\r\napplying a simplification measure which removes many of the VAT obligations for\r\nbusinesses operating with an annual turnover no higher than\r\nEUR 25 000 and therefore has a potential positive impact.\nBecause of the narrow scope of the\r\nderogation, and its limited application in time, the impact will in any case be\r\nlimited.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal aims to authorise Luxembourg\r\nto apply a simplification measure derogating from Article 285 of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC so as to allow for the exemption from VAT of taxable persons with\r\nan annual turnover no higher than EUR 25 000. Taxable persons may\r\nstill opt for the normal VAT arrangements.\nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of Council Directive\r\n2006/112/EC.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\r\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle as this Decision concerns an authorisation granted to\r\na Member State on its own request and does not constitute any obligation.\nGiven the narrow scope of the derogation,\r\nthe special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: Council Decision.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reasons:\nUnder Article 395 of Council Directive\r\n2006/112/EC, a derogation from the common VAT rules is only possible upon\r\nauthorization of the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the\r\nCommission. A Council Decision is the most suitable instrument since it can be\r\naddressed to an individual Member State.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal will not adversely affect the\r\nUnion's own resources from VAT because Luxembourg will carry out a compensation\r\ncalculation in accordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC,\r\nEURATOM) No 1553/89.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nThe proposal includes a sunset clause.\n2013/0296 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nauthorising Luxembourg to introduce a\r\nspecial measure derogating from Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the\r\ncommon system of value added tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Directive\r\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax[3], and in particular Article\r\n395(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter registered with\r\nthe Commission on 24 October 2012, Luxembourg requested authorisation to apply\r\na measure derogating from Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC, allowing Luxembourg\r\nto exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 25 000.\r\nThrough that measure, those taxable persons would be exempted from all or some\r\nof the obligations in relation to VAT referred to in Chapters 2 to 6 of Title\r\nXI of Directive 2006/112/EC.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission informed the other Member\r\nStates of the request made by Luxembourg by letter dated 9 November 2012.\r\nBy letter dated 12 November 2012, the Commission notified Luxembourg that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under Article 285 of\r\nDirective 2006/112/EC, Member States, which have not exercised the option under\r\nArticle 14 of Second Council Directive 67/228/EEC of 11 April 1967 on\r\nthe harmonization of legislation of Member States concerning turnover taxes,\r\nstructure and procedures for application of the common system of value added\r\ntax[4], may exempt from VAT taxable\r\npersons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 5 000 or the\r\nequivalent in national currency and may also grant graduated tax relief to\r\ntaxable persons whose annual turnover exceeds the ceiling fixed by them for its\r\napplication.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luxembourg has informed\r\nthe Commission that it currently exempts from VAT taxable persons whose annual\r\nturnover is no higher than EUR 10 000 and that it makes use of the\r\noption of granting graduated tax relief with respect to taxable persons whose\r\nannual turnover is between EUR 10 000 and EUR 25 000. Luxembourg has requested the authorisation, as a derogating measure, to exempt from VAT\r\ntaxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 25 000.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A higher threshold for the\r\nspecial scheme is a simplification measure, insofar as it may significantly\r\nreduce the VAT obligations of small businesses and would enable Luxembourg to cease applying the graduated tax relief scheme that is burdensome for\r\nbusinesses. Taxable persons may still opt for the normal VAT arrangements.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its proposal for a\r\nDirective amending Directive 77/388/EEC with a view to simplifying valued added\r\ntax obligations dated 29 October 2004[5],\r\nthe Commission included provisions aimed at allowing Member States to set the\r\nannual turnover ceiling for the VAT exemption scheme at up to EUR 100 000\r\nor the equivalent in national currency, with the possibility of updating that amount\r\neach year. This Decision is in line with that proposal.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogating measure\r\nwill only have a negligible effect on the overall amount of tax collected at\r\nthe stage of final consumption and will not adversely affect the Union's own\r\nresources accruing from value added tax,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nBy way of derogation from Article 285\r\nof Directive 2006/112/EC, Luxembourg is authorised to exempt from VAT taxable\r\npersons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 25 000.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall take effect on the day\r\nof its notification.\nThis Decision shall apply until the date of\r\nentry into force of Union rules amending the amounts of the annual turnover\r\nceilings below which taxable persons may qualify for VAT exemption or until\r\n31 December 2016, whichever date is earlier.\nArticle 3 \nThis\r\nDecision is addressed to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ 347, 11.12.2006, p.1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2004:0728:FIN:EN:PDF\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ 347, 11.12.2006, p.1.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ 71, 14.4.1967, p. 1303/67\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2004) 728 final.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
