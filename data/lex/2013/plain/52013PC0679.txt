The proposed amendment is of a purely technical nature and concerns\r\nthe extension of the availability period of the financial assistance from three\r\nyears to three years and two months. The key parameters of the macroeconomic\r\nadjustment programme, notably the duration of the programme and the overall\r\nfinancial envelope remain unchanged.\nIn accordance with Article 4 of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 473/2013 on the common budgetary timeline, which entered into force on\r\n30 May 2013, the Irish authorities will publish their draft budgetary plan on\r\n15 October 2013 at the latest. Moreover, the results of the balance sheet\r\nassessment as per programme conditionality are expected by end November 2013.\r\nFor a comprehensive and thorough assessment of compliance with the programme\r\nconditionality it is clearly essential to take the information contained in the\r\ndraft budgetary plan and the bank diagnostics into account. Therefore, the 12th\r\nand final review mission under the Irish programme cannot start before 15\r\nOctober 2013. Council Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU currently states that\r\nthe financial assistance shall be made available during three years starting\r\nfrom the first day after its entry into force, which means the availability\r\nperiod of the assistance ends 8 December 2013. All the processes to complete\r\nthe review and prepare the necessary documents would have to be squeezed in the\r\nfew remaining weeks before this date, running the risk of lacking time for the\r\nappropriate scrutiny in assessing the compliance as well as failing the\r\ndeadline due to an unforeseen event, in which case Ireland would miss out the\r\nfinal disbursement. To mitigate these risks, the availability period of the\r\nprogramme could be extended by two months.\nIt should be\r\nnoted that such decision will enhance the predictability of the disbursement\r\nunder the programme. At the same time, it enhances the quality of the review\r\nassessment. These effects are beneficial for both creditor and debtor countries\r\nand therefore contribute to the stability of the euro area.\nTaking into account the above explanations,\r\nthe Commission considers that the changes consisting in the extension of availability\r\nperiod of the financial assistance are beneficial to securing the programme's\r\nobjectives. \n2013/0326 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\namending Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU\r\non granting Union financial assistance to Ireland\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EU) No\r\n407/2010 of 11 May 2010 establishing a European financial stabilisation\r\nmechanism[1],\r\nand in particular Article 3(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon\r\na request by Ireland, the Council granted financial assistance to Ireland (Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU[2])\r\nin support of a strong economic and reform programme\r\naiming at restoring confidence, enabling the return of\r\nthe economy to sustainable growth, and safeguarding financial stability in\r\nIreland, the euro area and the Union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission completed\r\nthe tenth review of the Irish economic reform programme on 10 July 2013.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A short extension of the\r\navailability period of the financial assistance is necessary as it would allow\r\nfor a comprehensive and thorough assessment of programme compliance under the\r\nfinal review in due diligence and make sure that the decision on the release of\r\nthe last instalment can proceed in time.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of these\r\ndevelopments, Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU should be amended,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nIn Article 1(2) of Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU, the words \u201cduring 3 years\u201d are replaced by \u201cduring 3\r\nyears and 2 months\u201d.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision\r\nis addressed to Ireland. \nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union. \nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 118, 12.5.2010, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 30, 4.2.2011, p. 34.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
