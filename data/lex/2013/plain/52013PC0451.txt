It makes a clear\r\ndistinction between the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt\r\nnon-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain\r\nnon-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts) on the one hand\r\nand the powers conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing acts on the\r\nother hand. They are subject to entirely different legal frameworks.\nIn terms of the wording, the definition of\r\ndelegated acts in Article 290(1) is very similar to that of acts which, under\r\nDecision 1999/468/EC[1] (\"the Comitology Decision\"), are subject to the\r\nregulatory procedure with scrutiny (RPS) established in Article 5a of this\r\nDecision. In both cases, the acts in question are of general application and\r\nseek to amend or supplement certain non-essential elements of the legislative\r\ninstrument.\nFor this reason, the revision of the\r\nComitology Decision by the Regulation 182/2011[2]\r\n(\"the Comitology Regulation\") left out of its scope Article 5a of the\r\nComitology Decision. Article 5a establishing the RPS had therefore to be provisionally\r\nmaintained for the purposes of existing basic acts referring to this Article.\r\nIn this context, the Commission made a commitment to formally adapt those\r\nexisting provisions providing for RPS to the delegated acts regime.\nThe Commission issued the following\r\nstatement at the moment of the adoption of the Comitology Regulation[3]:\n\"As regards legislative acts in force which currently\r\ncontain references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the Commission\r\nwill review the provisions attached to this procedure in each instrument it\r\nintends to modify, in order to adapt them in due course according to the\r\ncriteria laid down in the Treaty. In addition, the European Parliament and the\r\nCouncil will be entitled to signal basic acts they consider important to adapt\r\nas a matter of priority.\nThe Commission will assess the results of this process by the end of\r\n2012 in order to estimate how many legislative acts containing references to\r\nthe regulatory procedure with scrutiny remain in force. The Commission will then\r\nprepare the appropriate legislative initiatives to complete the adaptation. The\r\noverall objective of the Commission is that, by the end of the 7th term of the\r\nParliament, all provisions referring to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny\r\nwould have been removed from all legislative instruments.\"\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OVERVIEW OF THE BASIC\r\nINSTRUMENTS CONCERNED BY THE ALIGNMENT\nAt the end of 2012, 288 legislative acts\r\nstill containing references to the RPS were identified. Around 60 of them are\r\ncurrently in the legislative process and therefore are not concerned by the\r\npresent proposal (those acts are listed for information in point 4 below). \nThe Commission has carried out a careful\r\nexamination of all legislative instruments still referring to the RPS in order\r\nto analyse whether the RPS measures covered by the\r\nComitology Decision meet the criteria of Article 290\r\nTFEU.\nThis is the first of the\r\nthree proposals adapting a number of legislative instruments referring to the\r\nRPS to the criteria laid down in the Treaty. It provides for a transformation\r\nof the RPS into delegated acts for the basic legislative acts which are listed\r\nin the annex. It is based on the legal bases of all the\r\nbasic acts concerned.\nAnother separate regulation is proposed for the legislative\r\nacts in the area of Justice which refer to the RPS (COM(2013)452), as those acts were adopted under a legal basis pursuant to Title V\r\npart III of the TFEU and therefore do not bind all Member States, and are thus\r\nirreconcilable with the legal bases of the other basic acts. \nFinally, a third proposal will cover the\r\nremaining basic acts referring to the RPS which are subject to an on-going\r\nanalysis.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 METHOD OF THE ADAPTATION\r\nOF LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS STILL REFERRING TO THE RPS\nThe approach followed by this proposal is\r\nto apply the method used in the Comitology Regulation and to align the basic\r\nacts still containing the RPS by way of a framework regulation.\nThe Comitology Regulation provides for an\r\nautomatic alignment of the existing acquis to the new procedures. Article 13 of\r\nthat Regulation stipulates that, where basic acts make reference to the\r\nprocedures provided for in the Comitology Decision, the corresponding procedure\r\nof the Comitology Regulation applies.\nAccordingly, the present framework\r\nregulation provides that where instruments listed in the annex make reference\r\nto the procedure referred to in Article 5a of the Comitology Decision, the\r\nCommission is empowered to adopt delegated acts.\nIn cases where there are curtailed\r\ntime-limits for opposition, in accordance with Article 5a(5)(b) of the\r\nComitology Decision, the proposal provides for a time-limit for objection of 1\r\nmonth (Article 2(6) of the proposal).\nThe proposal adapts the urgency procedure\r\naccording to Article 5a(6) of the Comitology Decision to the urgency procedure\r\nfor delegated acts (Article 3 of the proposal).\nAdaptation to the delegated act regime will\r\nnot affect pending procedures in which an opinion has already been delivered by\r\na committee in accordance with the Comitology Decision.\nBasic acts which are adapted to the\r\ndelegated acts regime are listed in the annex of the proposal. The list is\r\norganised according to policy areas and chronological order of the adoption of\r\nthe instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LIST OF BASIC

The\r\nTreaty of Lisbon introduced the possibility for the legislator to delegate\r\npower to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to\r\nsupplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nmeasures which can be covered by delegations of powers, as referred to in Article\r\n290(1) of the Treaty

28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers\r\nconferred on the Commission [6]. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis necessary to adapt to Article 290

that it carry out appropriate\r\nconsultations, including at expert level. The\r\nCommission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a\r\nsimultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the\r\nEuropean Parliament and to the Council,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1. Where the\r\nlegal acts listed in the Annex to this Regulation provide for the use of the\r\nregulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 5a(1) to (5) of\r\nDecision 1999/468/EC, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts\r\nin accordance with Article 2 of this Regulation.\n2. Where the\r\nlegal acts listed in the Annex provide for the use of the urgency procedure\r\nreferred to in Article 5a(6) of the Decision 1999/468/EC, the Commission shall\r\nbe empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with the urgency procedure\r\nprovided in Article 3 of this Regulation.\nArticle 2\n1. The power to\r\nadopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions\r\nlaid down in this Article. \n2.

The\r\ndelegation of power may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by\r\nthe Council. A decision to revoke shall put an end to the delegation of the\r\npower specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the\r\npublication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Union\r\nor at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of any\r\ndelegated acts already in force. \n4. As soon as\r\nit adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the\r\nEuropean Parliament and to the Council. \n5. An adopted\r\ndelegated act shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed\r\neither by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of two months\r\nof notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if,\r\nbefore the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have\r\nboth informed the Commission that they will not object.
