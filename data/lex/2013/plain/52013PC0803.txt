To that end, the European Council agreed to set EU\r\nheadline targets, which constitute shared objectives guiding action of the\r\nMember States and of the Union. \nThe Treaty on the functioning of the EU\r\nprovides that Member States are to regard their economic policies and promoting\r\nemployment as matters of common concern and coordinate them within the Council.\r\nIn two distinct articles, it provides that the Council is to adopt broad\r\neconomic policy guidelines (Article 121) and employment guidelines (Article\r\n148), specifying that the latter must be consistent with the former. Given this\r\nlegal basis, the guidelines for employment and economic policies are presented\r\nas two distinct \u2014 but intrinsically interconnected \u2014 legal instruments: \n\u2013     \r\nA Council Recommendation on broad guidelines for\r\nthe economic policies of the Member States and of the Union -Part I of the\r\nEurope 2020 Integrated Guidelines;\n\u2013     \r\nA Council Decision on guidelines for the\r\nemployment policies of the Member States -Part II of the Europe 2020 Integrated\r\nGuidelines. \nThese guidelines implemented by the above\r\nmentioned legal instruments form together the integrated guidelines for\r\nimplementing the Europe 2020 strategy. The employment guidelines were adopted\r\non 21 October 2010, and as provided by the adoption decision should remain\r\nstable until 2014 to ensure a focus on implementation.\nThe overall objectives and priorities\r\nexpressed in the guidelines for the employment policies remain valid. By virtue\r\nof Article 148(2), their validity for 2014 needs to be confirmed by a Council\r\ndecision, following consultation of the European Parliament, the European\r\nEconomic and Social Committee, the Committee of Regions and the Employment\r\nCommittee.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nn.a.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nOJ L 308, 24.11.2010, p. 46.\n2013/0392 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non guidelines for the employment policies\r\nof the Member States\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 148(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[2],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEmployment Committee,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[3],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[4],\r\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) stipulates in Article 145 that Member\r\nStates and the Union shall work towards developing a coordinated strategy for\r\nemployment and particularly for promoting a skilled, trained and adaptable\r\nworkforce as well as labour markets that are responsive to economic change and\r\nwith a view to achieving the objectives defined in Article 3 of the Treaty on\r\nEuropean Union (TEU).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The \"Europe 2020\r\nStrategy\" proposed by the Commission enables the Union to turn its economy\r\ntowards smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, accompanied by high level\r\nemployment, productivity and social cohesion. Five headline targets, listed\r\nunder the relevant guidelines, constitute shared objectives which guide the action\r\nof the Member States, and take into account their relative starting positions\r\nand national circumstances as well as the positions and circumstances of the Union. The European Employment Strategy has the leading role in the implementation of the\r\nemployment and labour market objectives of the new strategy. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The integrated guidelines\r\nare in line with the conclusions of the European Council of 17 June 2010. They\r\ngive precise guidance to the Member States on defining their national reform\r\nprogrammes and on implementing reforms. The employment guidelines should form\r\nthe basis for any country-specific recommendations that the Council may address\r\nto the Member States under Article 148(4) of the TFEU, in parallel with the\r\ncountry-specific recommendations addressed to the Member States under Article\r\n121(2) of the TFEU. The employment guidelines should also form the basis for\r\nthe establishment of the Joint Employment Report sent annually by the Council\r\nand the Commission to the European Council. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The examination of the\r\nMember States\u2019 draft national reform programmes, contained in the Joint\r\nEmployment Report adopted by the Council on 28 February 2013, shows that Member\r\nStates should continue to make every effort to address the following\r\npriorities: increasing labour market participation and reducing structural\r\nunemployment, developing a skilled workforce responding to labour market needs\r\nand promoting job quality and lifelong learning, improving the performance of\r\neducation and training systems at all levels and increasing participation in\r\ntertiary education, promoting social inclusion and combating poverty. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The employment guidelines\r\nadopted in 2010 should remain stable until 2014 to ensure a focus on their\r\nimplementation. Until the end of 2014, any updating of the employment\r\nguidelines should remain strictly limited. In 2011 and 2012 and 2013 the\r\nemployment guidelines were maintained. They should be maintained for 2014.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe guidelines for Member States'\r\nemployment policies as set out in the Annex to Council Decision of 21 October\r\n2010 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States[5] are maintained for 2014 and\r\nshall be taken into account by the Member States in their employment policies.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision\r\nis addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2010) 2020, 3.3.2010.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2010/707/UE of 21\r\nOctober 2010 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States (OJ L 308, 24.11.2010, p. 46).\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
