In\nresponse to requests from several Member States, the Commission, together with\nthe government experts concerned, considered whether to open autonomous tariff\nquotas for certain agricultural and industrial products.\nOn 22 December 2009 the Council\nadopted Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 opening and providing for the management\nof autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural and\nindustrial products so that Union demand for the products in question could be\nmet under the most favourable conditions.\nTariff quotas of the Union should be opened\nat zero or reduced rates of the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duty for\nappropriate volumes, without disturbing the markets for such products.\nDiscussions at meetings of the Economic Tariff Questions Group showed that the\nMember States were ready to open quotas for the products listed in Annex I to\nthis proposal for a Regulation, without disturbing the markets for such\nproducts. \nFurthermore, it became necessary to adapt\nthe quotas listed in Annex II to this proposal: for order no 09.2620 and\n09.2633 the description had to be changed and for order no 09.2629 another\nTARIC code had to be added. Moreover, in the interrests of transperency the end-date\nof the quotas with order no 09.2632 and 09.2917 have been integrated in Annex\nII of this proposal for a regulation in order to anounce the date on which\nthese quotas will be discontinued.\nThe proposal is in line with agricultural,\ntrade, entreprise, development and external relations policies. Especially this\nproposal is not at the expense of countries enjoying a preferential trading\nagreement with the EU (e.g. GSP, ACP regime, candidate countries and potential\ncandidates).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nOF THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Economic Tariff Questions Group\nrepresenting the industries of each Member State was consulted. All listed\nquotas reflect the agreement reached by the Group.\nThere was no mention of potentially serious\nrisks with irreversible consequences.\nThis proposal will follow an inter service\nconsultation procedure and will be published after its adoption by the Council.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nAmendment of a Council Regulation opening\nand providing for the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for\ncertain agricultural and industrial products on the legal basis of Article 31\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of\nthe European Union. By virtue of that Article autonomous\ntariff quotas are fixed by the Council acting on a qualified majority on the\nbasis of a Commission proposal.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiary principle therefore does not apply.\nThis set of measures is in line with the\nprinciples for simplifying the procedures for the operators engaged in foreign\ntrade and with the Commission communication of 2011 concerning autonomous\ntariff suspensions and quotas (C 363, 13.12.2011, p.6).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nUncollected customs duties of a total\namount of approximately 8,8 Mio \u20ac/year. The effect on the traditional own\nresources of the budget is -6,6 Mio \u20ac/year (75% x 8,8 Mio \u20ac/year).\n2013/0118 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 opening\nand providing for the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for\ncertain agricultural and industrial products\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\nsufficient and uninterrupted supplies of certain goods insufficiently produced\nin the Union and to avoid any disturbances on the market for certain\nagricultural and industrial products, autonomous tariff quotas have been opened\nby Council Regulation (EU) No 7/2010[1].\nProducts within those tariff quotas can be imported at reduced or zero duty\nrates. For the same reasons it is necessary to open, with effect from 1 July\n2013, new tariff quotas at reduced or zero duty rates for an appropriate volume\nfor the nine products with order numbers 09.2644 and 09.2663 until 09.2671.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, for the\nautonomous tariff quotas of the Union with order numbers 09.2620 and 09.2633\nthe product description should be adapted and for order number 09.2629 another TARIC\ncode should be added.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the autonomous tariff\nquotas of the Union with the order numbers 09.2917 and 09.2632 an end date of\n31.12.2013 should be inserted, as it is not in the interest of the Union to\ncontinue granting such quotas beyond this date.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 7/2010\nshould therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the tariff quotas\nhave to take effect from 1 July 2013, this Regulation should apply from the\nsame date and enter into force immediately,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThe Annex to Regulation\n(EU) No 7/2010 is amended as follows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the rows\nwith order numbers 09.2644 and 09.2663 until 09.2671 set out in Annex I to this Regulation are\ninserted;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the rows for the tariff quotas\nwith order numbers 09.2620, 09.2629, 09.2632, 09.2633 and 09.2917 are replaced\nby the rows set out in Annex II to this Regulation.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\nthe day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\nANNEX I\nTariff\nquotas referred to in Article 1(1)\n Order number || CN code || TARIC || Description || Quota period || Quota volume || Quota duty (%) \n 09.2663 || ex 1104 29 17 || 10 || Milled sorghum grains that have been at least hulled and de-germed for use in the manufacture of loose fill packaging products (1) || 1.7-31.12 || 750 tonnes || 0 % \n 09.2664 || ex 2008 60 19 ex 2008 60 39 || 30 30 || Sweet cherries containing added spirit, whether or not with a sugar content of 9 % by weight, of a diameter of not more than 19,9 mm, with stone, for use in chocolate products (1) || 1.7-31.12 || 500 tonnes || 10 % (2) \n 09.2665 || ex 2916 19 95 || 30 || Potassium (E,E)-hexa-2,4-dienoate (CAS RN 24634-61-5) || 1.7-31.12 || 4 000 tonnes || 0 % \n 09.2666 || ex 3204 17 00 || 55 || Dye C.I.
