The approximate number of medium combustion plants in\nthe EU is 142,986.\nThe combustion of fuel in new small\ncombustion plants and appliances can be covered by provisions implementing\nDirective 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21\nOctober 2009 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements\nfor energy-related products[3].\nCombustion of fuel in large combustion plants is controlled by Directive\n2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on\nindustrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control)[4] from 7 January 2013,\nwith Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23\nOctober 2001 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air\nfrom large combustion plants[5]\ncontinuing to apply to existing large combustion plants until 31 December 2015.\nEmissions of air pollutants from medium\ncombustion plants are generally not regulated at EU level, and it is therefore\nappropriate to complement the existing legislation relating to combustion\nplants with provisions for this category. \nConsistency with\nother policies and objectives of the Union\nThe present proposal is\npart of the new framework of action in the field of air\nquality in the EU, as set out in the revised EU Thematic Strategy on Air\nPollution, and is consistent with and reinforces the\nEurope 2020 objectives on smart, inclusive and sustainable growth[6]. Care\nis taken to safeguard the interests of SMEs along the \"think small\nfirst\" principle.[7]\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of\ninterested parties\nStakeholders\nand the public were consulted through a series of formal and informal events,\nincluding two online questionnaires, a Eurobarometer survey, and a continued\ndialogue through multi- and bilateral meetings. Consultation with Member States\nalso took place via the meetings of the Air Quality Expert Group. A significant\npart of stakeholders highlighted the importance of EU source controls for\nsharing the pollution reduction burden, and expressed favourable opinion in\ncontrolling emissions from medium combustion plants, noting however the need to\nlimit administrative burden, which could become disproportionate, both for\noperators and for competent authorities, in case of a \"full\"\npermitting regime. Input from stakeholders has been taken into account when\ndesigning the different possible options for controlling emissions from medium\ncombustion plants.\nA first scoping on-line public consultation\nwas carried out at the end of 2011 with a view to broaden the information base\nfor the initial development of the policy options. An internet consultation ran\nfor 12 weeks from 10 December 2012 on the European Commission\u2019s \u2018Your voice in Europe\u2019 web page. The consultation used two questionnaires, one short questionnaire aimed\nfor the general public, the second one longer and more articulated, including questions\non sources controls, targeting experts and stakeholders. A total of 1934\nindividuals answered from general public, while 371 responses were received\nfrom experts and stakeholders. Out of those latter, about 40% agreed on the\nnecessity of regulating combustion plants below the 50MW threshold set in the\nIndustrial Emissions Directive (IED) at EU level, with 20% from business\nrepresentatives, 43% from individual experts, 48% from government\nrepresentatives and 55% from NGOs. Business and government representatives chose\na light permitting regime or registration regime, while about half of\nindividual experts and NGOs opted for a \"full\" permitting regime with\nEU-wide emission limit values.\nAll background information is available on\na website[8]\ndedicated to this initiative.\nResult of the impact\nassessment\nAs stated in the Impact Assessment (IA) of\nthe Review of the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution while\nthe overall structure of air quality policy is logical and coherent, a better\nmatch must be ensured in practical implementation between source controls,\nemission ceilings and ambient air quality standards, notably to ensure that\nlocal achievement of ambient air quality standards is not compromised by (a)\nfailure to limit pollution from significant point sources or from products\n(e.g. real world emissions), or (b) high background concentrations resulting\nfrom the overall emission burden. \nTo make progress towards the EU's long-term\nobjective (after 2020) of further reducing health and environmental impacts of\nair pollution, a number of policy options were assessed with the aim of\nidentifying a cost-effective package of measures. This included the\nconsideration of selected additional EU source control measures, one of them\naddressing emissions from medium combustion plants. The result of the assessment\nis that an EU-wide instrument to control emissions from medium combustion\nplants would extend to all Member States the technical measures identified as\ncost-effective in the multi-sectorial analysis, and has led to the conclusion to\npropose a legislative instrument for controlling emission from such plants at\nEU-level. \nOut of the five policy options considered and\nin depth analysed to control emissions from medium combustion plants, the\npreferred option would set emission limit values in line with those set in Directive\n2010/75/EU for plants between 50-100 MW and in a number of Member States, and\ncomplemented with a number of emission limit values set out for new plants in\nthe amended Gothenburg Protocol[9].\nTo limit the costs associated to nitrogen oxides reductions, the emission limit\nvalues should be mainly based on the application of primary emission abatement\nmeasures. In situations where air quality is not meeting the EU standards,\nMember States should however apply stricter limits.\nTo avoid significant impact on SMEs, in\nwhich most of the medium combustion plants are operated, a number of mitigation\nmeasures have been taken on board: operators will not require a permit, but\nneed to notify the operation of the plant to the competent authorities, which\nwill ensure registration; phased implementation providing existing plants a\nlonger transitional period to comply with the limits has been also recommended\nwith longer periods for the smallest plant category; limited or simplified\nmonitoring and reporting obligations are foreseen. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the\nproposed action\nThe proposal, when\nestablishing provisions for medium combustion plants, aims at filling in an existing gap in legislation. It\nintroduces minimum requirements, keeping the administrative burden at the\nlowest possible level and taking special account of the situation of SMEs.\nSpecific information on the Articles and\nAnnexes of the proposal is provided below.\nArticle 1\nmakes it clear that the directive aims at reducing emissions to air of sulphur\ndioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from medium combustion plants\nand thereby reducing the potential risks to human health and the environment\nfrom such emissions.\nArticle 2 defines\nthe scope of the Directive in a way to avoid overlap with Directive 2009/125/EC\nor with Chapter III or IV of Directive 2010/75/EU, and exempts also some\ncombustion plants on the basis of their technical characteristics or their use\nin particular activities.\nArticle 3\nlists the definitions applicable for the purposes of this Directive.\nArticle 4\nsets out the obligation of the competent authority to register medium combustion\nplants, based on notification by the operator. The elements of such\nnotification are listed in Annex I.\nProvisions on emission limit values are\nlaid down in Article 5, with the corresponding values applicable for\nexisting and new plants in Annex II. It is proposed that the emission limit\nvalues apply to existing combustion plants after a fixed period from the date\nof application of this Directive, in order to provide them with sufficient time\nto adapt technically to the requirements of this Directive. Article 5(4)\nrequires Member States to apply more stringent emission limit values to\nindividual plants in zones not complying with air quality limit values. Annex III\nlays down the benchmark values for that purpose that reflect the performance of\nthe most advanced techniques available.\nMonitoring requirements are set out in Article\n6 and Annex IV. This Annex is proposed to be adapted to technical and\nscientific progress by means of delegated acts (as per Articles 14 and 15).\nArticles 7 and 8 of the proposal lay down provisions to ensure an effective\nimplementation and enforcement of this Directive. In particular, a provision is\nintroduced to require operators to immediately report on non-compliance to the\ncompetent authority. Member States should also ensure that the operator and the\ncompetent authority take necessary measures in case of non-compliance with this\nDirective. Furthermore, the proposal introduces requirements for Member States\nto provide for a system of environmental inspections of medium combustion\nplants covered by this Directive, or implement other measures to check\ncompliance thereof.\nArticle 9\nprovides for the obligations of the operator and the competent authority in\ncase of changes to a medium combustion plant.\nArticle 10 is\nconcerned with the right of access to information and refers, for that purpose,\nto Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28\nJanuary 2003 on public access to environmental information and repealing\nCouncil Directive 90/313/EEC [10].\nArticle 11\nrequires Member States to designate the competent\nauthorities responsible for carrying out the obligations arising from this\nDirective.\nArticle 12\nestablishes a reporting mechanism. While Member States' first report to the Commission, due by 30 June 2019, shall contain a summary of\ndata of key importance in implementing this Directive, the following reports shall\ncontain qualitative and quantitative information on the implementation of this\nDirective, any action taken to verify compliance of the operation of medium combustion\nplants with this Directive and any enforcement action taken for the purposes\nthereof. Article 13 also lays down the Commission's reporting duties. \nArticle 14\nlays down the applicable delegation procedure with a view to adapting Annex IV\nto scientific and technical progress through delegated acts, in accordance with\nArticle 13.\nArticles 15, 16 and 17 lay down, respectively, the provisions on penalties applicable to\nbreaches of the national provisions enacted pursuant to the proposal, on the\ntransposition by xx/xx/xx at the latest of the proposal into the law of the\nMember States and on its entry into force.\nAnnex I lists\nthe information to be notified by the operator to the\ncompetent authority.\nAnnex II sets\nout the emission limit values applicable for existing and new combustion plants,\nin accordance with Article 5(2) and 5(3), respectively.\nAnnex III provides\nfor benchmark values for the application of more stringent emission limit\nvalues, in accordance with Article 5(4).\nAnnex IV details\nthe requirements applicable to the monitoring of emissions.\nExplanatory\ndocuments\nThe Commission\nconsiders that explanatory documents are necessary in order to improve the\nquality of information on the transposition of the directive for the following\nreasons.\nThe complete and\ncorrect transposition of the Directive is essential to guarantee that its\nobjectives (i.e. protecting human health and the environment) are achieved. Given that certain Member States already regulate emissions\nof air pollutants from medium combustion plants, the\ntransposition of this directive would probably not consist of one piece of\nlegislation, but would rather consist of various amendments or new proposals in\nrelevant fields. In addition, the implementation of the Directive is\noften highly decentralised, as the regional and local authorities are\nresponsible for its application and, in some Member States, even for its\ntransposition. \nThe above factors\nare likely to increase the risks of incorrect transposition and implementation\nof the Directive, and complicate the Commission\u2019s task of monitoring the\napplication of EU law. Clear information with respect to the transposition of\nthe Directive is instrumental in ensuring the conformity of national\nlegislation with its provisions.\nThe requirement to provide explanatory documents may create an\nadditional administrative burden on those Member States which do not work on\nthis basis in any case. However, explanatory documents are necessary to allow\neffective verification of complete and correct transposition, which is\nessential for the reasons mentioned above, and there are no less burdensome\nmeasures to allow efficient verification. Moreover, the explanatory documents\ncan contribute significantly to reducing the administrative burden of compliance\nmonitoring by the Commission; without them, considerable resources and numerous\ncontacts with national authorities would be required to track the methods of\ntransposition in all Member States. Hence, the possible additional\nadministrative burden of providing explanatory documents is proportionate to\nthe aim pursued, namely to ensure effective transposition and fully achieve the\nobjectives of the Directive.\nIn view of the above it is appropriate to ask Member States to\naccompany the notification of their transposition measures with one or more\ndocuments explaining the relationship between the provisions of the Directive\nand the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.\nLegal basis\nAs the primary objective\nof the Directive is the protection of the environment, in accordance with\nArticle 191 TFEU, the proposal is based on Article 192(1) TFEU.320\nSubsidiarity and proportionality principles and choice of instrument\nThe subsidiarity\nprinciple applies insofar as the proposal does not fall under the exclusive\ncompetence of the European Union.\n\nThe objectives of the\nproposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and Union action\nwill better achieve those objectives for the following reasons.3\nWhile emissions to air often cause\ntransboundary pollution, emissions of air pollutants from medium combustion\nplants are generally not regulated at EU level at the current stage. The major thrust of this proposal is to lay down\nemission limit values to control emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides\nand particulate matter into the air from medium combustion plants as minimum standards of protection for the environment and\nfor all citizens of the EU.\nAll Member States must therefore take\nmeasures to comply with the minimum requirements; varying national regulation\nmight hamper transboundary economic activities. Action\nat EU level is necessary and brings added value compared to individual national\nactions.\nThe proposal therefore\ncomplies with the subsidiarity principle.\nThe chosen legal instrument is a directive\nas the proposal lays down objectives and obligations, while leaving sufficient\nflexibility to the Member States as regards the choice of measures for\ncompliance and their detailed implementation. The proposal therefore complies with\nthe proportionality principle.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implications for the EU\nbudget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nThe proposal concerns a\nmatter relevant to the European Economic Area and should therefore be\napplicable to it.\n2013/0442 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the limitation of emissions of certain\npollutants into the air from medium combustion plants\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[11],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[12],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure[13],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision XXX/XXXX of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[14]\n(the Action Programme) recognises that emissions of pollutants to air have been\nreduced significantly over the past decades, but at the same time air pollution\nlevels are still problematic in many parts of Europe, and citizens of the Union\ncontinue to be exposed to air polluting substances, potentially compromising\ntheir health and wellbeing. According to the Action Programme,\necosystems continue to suffer from excess nitrogen and sulphur deposition\nassociated with emissions from transport, unsustainable agricultural practices\nand power generation.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a\nhealthy environment for all, the Action Programme calls for local measures to\nbe complemented with adequate policy at both national and Union level. It\nrequires in particular strengthening efforts to reach full compliance with air\nquality legislation of the Union and defining strategic targets and actions\nbeyond 2020.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scientific assessments\nshow that the average lifetime loss for citizens of the Union due to air\npollution is of eight months.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Emissions of pollutants\nfrom the combustion of fuel in medium combustion plants are generally not\nregulated at Union level although they contribute increasingly to air pollution,\ndue in particular to an increase in the use of biomass as a fuel, driven by\nclimate and energy policy.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The combustion of fuel in\nsmall combustion plants and appliances can be covered by acts implementing\nDirective 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21\nOctober 2009 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements\nfor energy-related products[15].\nCombustion of fuel in large combustion plants is covered by Directive\n2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council[16] from 7 January 2013,\nwhile Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[17] continues to apply to\nlarge combustion plants covered by Article 30(2) of Directive 2010/75/EU until\n31 December 2015.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The report of the\nCommission of 17 May 2013[18]\non the reviews undertaken under Article 30(9) and Article 73 of Directive\n2010/75/EU concluded that for the combustion of fuels in medium combustion\nplants, a clear potential for cost-effective abatement of air emissions was\ndemonstrated.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's international\nobligations on air pollution to abate acidification, eutrophication,\nground-level ozone and emissions of particulate matter are agreed under the\nGothenburg Protocol of the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air\nPollution, which was amended in 2012 to strengthen the\nexisting reduction commitments for sulphur dioxide,\nnitrogen oxides, ammonia and volatile organic compounds\nand introduce new reduction commitments for fine particulate matter (PM 2.5),\nto be attained from 2020 onwards. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Communication from the\nCommission to the Council and the European Parliament \"A Clean Air\nProgramme for Europe\"[19] calls for action to\ncontrol emissions of air polluting substances from medium combustion plants,\nthereby completing the regulatory framework for the combustion sector. The\nStrategy completes the pollution reduction agenda for 2020 laid down in\nCommission Communication of 21 September 2005 on the Thematic Strategy on Air\nPollution[20],\nand develops impact reduction objectives for the period up to 2030. To achieve\nthe strategic objectives, a regulatory agenda should be established, including\nmeasures to control emissions from medium combustion plants.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should not\napply to energy related products covered by implementing measures adopted in\naccordance with Directive 2009/125/EC or by Chapter III or IV of Directive\n2010/75/EU. Certain other combustion plants should also be exempted from the\nscope of this Directive, on the basis of their technical characteristics or\ntheir use in particular activities.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\ncontrol of emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter\ninto the air, each medium combustion plant should operate only if it is at\nleast registered by the competent authority, based on notification by the\noperator.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of\ncontrolling emissions into air from medium combustion plants, emission limit\nvalues and requirements for monitoring should be set out in this Directive. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to provide\nexisting medium combustion plants with sufficient time to adapt technically to\nthe requirements of this Directive, the emission limit values should apply to\nthose combustion plants after a fixed period from the date of application of\nthis Directive.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n193 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), this\nDirective does not prevent Member States from maintaining or introducing more\nstringent protective measures, for example for the purposes to comply with\nenvironmental quality standards. In particular, in zones not complying with air\nquality limit values, more stringent emission limit values, which would also\npromote eco-innovation in the Union, facilitating in particular market access\nof small and medium enterprises, should be applied by Member States, such as\nthe benchmark values set out in Annex III to this Directive.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should ensure\nthat the operator of a medium combustion plant and the competent authority each\ntake the necessary measures in the event of non-compliance with this Directive.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to limit the\nburden for small and medium enterprises operating medium combustion plants, the\nadministrative obligations on operators for notifying, monitoring and reporting\nshould be proportionate, while still allowing effective compliance verification\nby the competent authorities. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure the consistency\nand coherence of the Member State information on the implementation of this\nDirective and promote exchange of information between Member States and the Commission, the Commission, assisted by the European Environment Agency, should\ndevelop an electronic reporting tool also available for internal use by Member\nStates for national reporting and data management purposes.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to adapt to\nscientific and technical progress, the power to adopt acts to adjust the\nprovisions on emission monitoring set out in Annex IV in accordance with\nArticle 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular\nimportance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its\npreparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and\ndrawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and the Council.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of\nthis Directive, namely the improvement of environmental quality and human\nhealth, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States, and can therefore be\nbetter achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with\nthe principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that\nArticle, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\nachieve those objectives.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects the\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, this\nDirective seeks to ensure the application of Article 37 on the environmental protection\nof the Charter.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nJoint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September\n2011 on explanatory documents[21],\nMember States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the\nnotification of their transposition measures with one or more documents\nexplaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the\ncorresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this\nDirective, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be\njustified,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive lays down rules to control emissions\nof sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter into the air from\nmedium combustion plants, and thereby reduce emissions to air and the potential\nrisks to human health and the environment from such emissions.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive shall apply\nto combustion plants with a rated thermal input equal to or greater than 1 MW\nand less than 50 MW (hereinafter referred to as \u2018medium combustion plants\u2019),\nirrespective of the type of fuel used.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive shall not\napply to the following:\n(a)         \ncombustion plants which are covered by Chapter\nIII or Chapter IV of Directive 2010/75/EU;\n(b)         \nenergy related products which are covered by\nimplementing measures adopted in accordance with Directive 2009/125/EC where those implementing acts are setting\nemission limit values for the pollutants listed in Annex II of this Directive;\n(c)         \ncombustion plants in which the gaseus products\nof combustion are used for the direct heating, drying or any other treatment of\nobjects or materials;\n(d)        \npost-combustion plants designed to purify the\nwaste gases from industrial processes by combustion and which are not operated\nas independent combustion plants;\n(e)         \nany technical apparatus used in the propulsion\nof a vehicle, ship or aircraft;\n(f)          \ncombustion plants which are covered by\nimplementing measures adopted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[22]\nwhere those implementing acts are setting emission limit values for the\npollutants listed in Annex II of this Directive.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this\nDirective the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)                   \n\u2018emission\u2019 means the discharge of substances from\nthe combustion plant into the air;\n(2)                   \n\u2018emission limit value\u2019 means the permissible\nquantity of a substance contained in the waste gases from the combustion plant\nwhich may be discharged into the air during a given period;\n(3)                   \n\u2018nitrogen oxides\u2019 (NOx) means nitric\noxide and nitrogen dioxide, expressed as nitrogen dioxide (NO2);\n(4)                   \n\u2018particulate matter\u2019 means particles, of any\nshape, structure or density, dispersed in the gas phase at the sampling point\nconditions which may be collected by filtration under specified conditions\nafter representative sampling of the gas to be analysed, and which remain\nupstream of the filter and on the filter after drying under specified\nconditions;
