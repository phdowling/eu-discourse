It is therefore proposed that the Council adopt the attached proposal for a\r\nCouncil Regulation which should be published no later than 8 November 2013.\n\u00b7      Legal basis\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30\r\nNovember 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members\r\nof the European Community (\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019).\n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\r\napply.\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality\r\nprinciple for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the\r\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and administrative\r\nburden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local\r\nauthorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to\r\nthe objective of the proposal is not applicable.\n\u00b7      Choice of instruments\nProposed instruments: regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reason:\nOther means would not be adequate because the\r\nbasic Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union\r\nbudget.\n2013/0328 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty\r\nand collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain\r\nstainless steel wires originating in India\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\r\ncountries not members of the European Community (\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019)[1], and in particular Article 9\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\r\nthe European Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) after having consulted the Advisory\r\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provisional measures \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission imposed a\r\nprovisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain stainless steel wires\r\noriginating in India by Regulation (EU) No 418/2013[2] ('the provisional Regulation').\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation was\r\ninitiated following a complaint lodged on 28 June 2012\r\nby the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries (Eurofer) ('the complainant')\r\non behalf of Union producers representing more than 50% of total Union\r\nproduction of certain stainless steel wires. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe parallel anti-subsidy investigation, the Commission\r\nimposed a provisional countervailing duty on imports of certain stainless steel\r\nwires originating in India by Regulation (EU) No 419/2013[3] and a definitive countervailing\r\nduty by Regulation (EU) No 861/2013[4].\r\n\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the\r\ninvestigation \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the provisional stage\r\nof the investigation sampling was applied for the Indian exporting producers\r\nand the Union producers. At the provisional stage, sampling was envisaged also\r\nregarding unrelated importers. However, as two out of three importers chosen\r\nfor the sample did not submit questionnaire replies, sampling for importers\r\ncould not be applied. Therefore, all available information pertaining to all cooperating\r\nimporters was used to reach definitive findings; in particular as far the Union\r\ninterest is concerned. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer\r\nalleged that since no sales from non-complainants were used for the\r\ndetermination of the injury suffered by the Union industry, the selected sample\r\nof Union producers could not be considered representative. This claim was\r\nrejected because the sample was selected on the basis of the replies received\r\nfrom all cooperating Union producers regardless their support or not for the\r\ncomplaint at the stage of determination of standing, and was made on the basis\r\nof production volumes.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer,\r\nrelated to a Union producer, opposed the complaint, and requested individual\r\nexamination, because it was not included in the sample of exporting producers,\r\nbased on its low export volumes. The Union producer itself was also not\r\nincluded in the Union industry sample because of its low production volumes.\r\nThe individual examination was granted by the Commission, but the exporting\r\nproducer withdrew its request. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seven Indian exporting\r\nproducers outside the sample requested individual examination. Two of them\r\nreplied to the questionnaires and five did not. Out of the two which replied to\r\nthe questionnaire, one withdrew its individual examination request. As a\r\nresult, the Commission has examined the request of one Indian exporting\r\nproducer outside the sample:\n\u2013 KEI Industries Limited, New Delhi (KEI).\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At provisional stage none\r\nof the initially sampled exporting producers was found to have submitted\r\nsufficiently reliable information therefore Article 18 of the basic Regulation\r\nwas applied. The Commission decided to extend the sample with three companies,\r\nbased on their export volumes and their willingness to co-operate as expressed\r\nfollowing the initiation of the proceeding. As a result, the Commission has\r\nexamined the questionnaire replies and carried out verification visits at the\r\npremises of the following Indian exporting producers:\n- Garg Inox, Bahadurgarh, Haryana\n- Macro Bars and Wires, Mumbai, Maharashtra\n- Nevatia Steel & Alloys, Mumbai, Maharashtra\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apart from the above,\r\nrecitals (4) to (7) and (14) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation period and\r\nthe period considered \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As set out in recital (20)\r\nto the provisional Regulation, the investigation of dumping and injury covered\r\nthe period from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012 ('investigation period\u2019 or 'IP').\r\nThe examination of the trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the\r\nperiod from 1 January 2009 to 31 March 2012 ('period considered').\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent procedure\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure of\r\nthe essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was decided to\r\nimpose provisional anti-dumping measures ('provisional disclosure'), several\r\ninterested parties, namely the 3 sampled exporting producers, the one exporting\r\nproducer which withdrew its individual examination request, the complainant,\r\nand 11 users submitted comments. The parties who so requested were granted a\r\nhearing. The Commission continued to seek information it deemed necessary for\r\nthe definitive findings. All comments received were considered and taken into account,\r\nwhere appropriate. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission informed the\r\ninterested parties of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of\r\nwhich it intended to recommend the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duty\r\non imports of certain stainless steel wires originating in India and the\r\ndefinitive collection of the amounts secured by way of the provisional duty\r\n(\u2018final disclosure\u2019). The parties were also granted a period within which they\r\ncould comment on the final disclosure. All comments received were considered\r\nand taken into account, where appropriate.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the comments\r\nreceived to the final disclosure, the Commission informed the interested\r\nparties of changes in the findings concerning the level of dumping of certain\r\nexporting producers. The parties were again granted a period within which they\r\ncould comment on the additional disclosure. All comments received were\r\nconsidered and taken into account, where appropriate. One interested party, the\r\ncomplainant, criticised the fact that the findings concerning the level of\r\ndumping of certain exporting producers were altered on the basis of new data\r\nand comments received after the provisional disclosure and at the definitive\r\nstage of the investigation. It also alleged that its procedural rights were infringed.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission however\r\nconsidered that it must take into account the submissions received from the\r\ninterested parties and if necessary alter the findings when the comments are\r\njustified. In none of these instances, new unverified data was used for the\r\ndumping determination. Moreover, the procedural rights of all interested\r\nparties were respected as they were duly and timely informed and given the same\r\ndeadlines to submit comments. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product concerned and like\r\nproduct\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nstated in recital (21) to the provisional Regulation, the product concerned is\r\ndefined as stainless steel wires containing by weight:\n\u2013              \r\n2,5% or more of nickel, other than wire\r\ncontaining by weight 28% or more but not more than 31% of nickel and 20% or\r\nmore but not more than 22% of chromium, \n\u2013              \r\nless than 2,5% of nickel, other than wire\r\ncontaining by weight 13% or more but not more than 25% of chromium and 3,5% or\r\nmore but not more than 6% of aluminium, \ncurrently falling within CN codes 7223 00 19\r\nand 7223 00 99, originating in India.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some users expressed\r\nconcerns about the apparent lack of distinction between the various types of\r\nthe product concerned and the like product because a wide product mix exists\r\namong all the product types. There was a particular concern as to how a fair\r\ncomparison among all types could be ensured in the investigation. As is the\r\ncase in most investigations, the definition of the product concerned covers a\r\nwide variety of product types which share the same or similar basic physical\r\ntechnical and chemical characteristics. The fact that\r\nthese characteristics can vary from product type to product type may indeed\r\nlead to cover a wide range of types. This is the case in the current\r\ninvestigation. The Commission took account of the differences among the product\r\ntypes and ensured a fair comparison. A unique product control number (PCN) was\r\nallocated to each product type, produced and sold by the Indian exporting\r\nproducers and to each one produced and sold by the Union industry. The number\r\ndepended on the main characteristics of the product, in this case, the steel\r\ngrade, the tensile strength, the coating, the surface, diameter, and the shape.\r\nTherefore, the types of wires exported to the Union were compared on a PCN\r\nbasis with the products produced and sold by the Union industry that have the\r\nsame or similar characteristics. All these types fell within the definition of\r\nthe product concerned and the like product in the notice of initiation[5] and in the provisional Regulation.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\r\nparty reiterated its claim that the so called \u201chighly technical\u201d product types\r\nare different and not interchangeable with other types of the product\r\nconcerned. Hence, they should be excluded from the product definition.\r\nAccording to the case-law, when determining whether products are alike so that\r\nthey form part of the same product, it needs to be assessed whether they share\r\nthe same technical and physical characteristics, and have the same basic end-uses and the same price-quality ratio. In that regard, the\r\ninterchangeability of, and competition between, those products should also be\r\nassessed.[6] The investigation found that the \u201chighly technical\u201d product types\r\nreferred to by the party have the basic physical, chemical, and technical\r\ncharacteristics as the other products subject to the investigation. They are\r\nmade from stainless steel and they are wires, and the production process is\r\nsimilar, using similar machines, such that producers can switch between\r\ndifferent variants of the product, according to demand. Therefore, although different\r\ntypes of wires are not directly interchangeable and do not directly compete,\r\nproducers are competing for contracts covering a broad range of stainless steel\r\nwires. Moreover, these product types are produced and sold by both the Union\r\nindustry and the Indian exporting producers using a similar production method.\r\nTherefore, the claim cannot be accepted.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to final\r\ndisclosure one party claimed that the analysis carried out by the Commission in\r\nterms of establishing whether the so-called highly technical product types\r\nshould be included in the investigation was insufficient. This argument is\r\nrejected. The investigation established that the highly technical product types\r\nfall within the product definition as stated in recital (17) above. The party\r\nwrongly assumes that all the criteria referred to in the case-law have to be\r\nmet at the same time; this is incorrect. According to the case-law[7], the Commission enjoys a wide\r\ndiscretion when defining the product scope, and has to base this assessment on\r\nthe set of criteria developed by the Court. Often, as in the present case, some\r\ncriteria may point in one and some in the other direction; in such a situation,\r\nthe Commission needs to carry out a global assessment, as it has done in the\r\npresent case. It is therefore wrongly assumed by this interested party that\r\nproduct types need to share all characteristics in order to fall in the same\r\nproduct definition. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some\r\nusers claimed that the so-called stainless steel wires \u201cseries 200\u201d should be\r\nexcluded from the product scope. In particular, they alleged this type was\r\nhardly produced by the Union industry. However, this claim is unfounded. First,\r\nthe fact that a certain product type is not produced in by the Union industry\r\nis not a sufficient reason to exclude it from the scope of the investigation,\r\nwhere the production process is such that the Union producers could start\r\nproducing the product type in question. Second, as for highly technical wires,\r\nit was found that these types of the product concerned have basic physical,\r\nchemical, and technical characteristics identical or similar to other types of\r\nthe like product produced and sold by the Union industry. Therefore, the claim\r\ncannot be accepted.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alternatively,\r\nthey claimed that wire rod should be included in the definition of the product\r\nconcerned. However, wire rod is the raw material used for the production of the\r\nproduct concerned but can also be used for the production of different products\r\nsuch as fasteners and nails. Therefore, contrary to the product concerned, it\r\ndoes not constitute a finished steel product. Through cold forming production\r\nprocess the wire rod amongst other product can be transformed into the product\r\nconcerned or the like product. On that basis, wire rod cannot be included in the\r\nproduct scope within the meaning of the basic Regulation.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above, the definition of the product concerned and the\r\nlike product in recitals (21) to (24) to the provisional Regulation are hereby\r\nconfirmed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DUMPING\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the verification\r\nvisits at the premises of the three originally sampled Indian exporting\r\nproducers and the subsequent analysis of the collected information, it was\r\nfound that these companies had submitted some information which could not be\r\nconsidered reliable. The Commission continued its investigation, analysing all\r\ninformation submitted in reaction to the provisional disclosure and in\r\nsubsequent hearings.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated in recital\r\n(26) of the provisional Regulation, in the case of one exporting producer, the\r\nCommission had found that the costs reported in the questionnaire reply could\r\nnot be reconciled to the company\u2019s internal cost reporting system. The company\r\nhad argued that the lack of reconciliation was caused by registration errors\r\nand a valuation method of stocks that differed between the internal cost\r\nreporting system and the data published in the annual accounts.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As explained in recital\r\n(28) of the provisional Regulation, although the data contained in the internal\r\ncost reporting system were consistent with the audited financial statements at\r\ncompany-wide level, it was not possible to reconcile the data generated by the\r\ninternal cost reporting system for the wire division to the cost tables\r\nspecifically prepared by the company in reply to the investigation\u2019s\r\nquestionnaire. Hence, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, it\r\nwas considered that the information found in the internal cost reporting system\r\nshould be used for the purpose of the anti-dumping investigation. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For that reason, the\r\nCommission provisionally adjusted the cost data provided by the exporting\r\nproducer in its questionnaire reply by using the facts available in the\r\ninternal cost reporting system.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As noted in recital (27) of\r\nthe provisional Regulation, the exporting producer argued that the data in the\r\ninternal cost reporting system were not reliable and should not be used for the\r\npurpose of the investigation. The company pointed to several errors and\r\nconceptual problems regarding the internally reported figures on which the\r\nCommission had based its adjustment of the costs. The company claimed that the\r\nCommission should have based its analysis on the costs reported in the\r\nquestionnaire reply. Additionally, at a later stage following the provisional\r\nmeasures, the company provided a reconciliation between the internally reported\r\ndivisional cost figures and the questionnaire reply. On that basis, and having\r\nregard to the evidence collected during the on-spot visit, certain manufacturing\r\ncosts originally reported by that company in its questionnaire reply could then\r\nbe accepted. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, on the basis of\r\nthe evidence at hand, the allocation of certain costs such as overheads and\r\nfinance costs reported by the company in its questionnaire reply could not be considered\r\nas reliable for the purpose of the investigation. The Commission considered\r\nthat these costs should be allocated based on the total company turnover and\r\ncost of goods sold in accordance with Article 2(5) of the basic Regulation. Based\r\non the above, most of the costs reported in the questionnaire reply could be\r\naccepted and the turnover allocation was agreed by the company at the\r\ndefinitive stage of the investigation. The level of the dumping margin\r\ndecreased following a revision of packing costs and certain overheads. It is\r\nthus considered that Article 18 of the basic Regulation should no longer apply to\r\nestablish the dumping margin of this exporting producer. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As set out in recital (30)\r\nof the provisional Regulation, in the case of a second exporting producer, the\r\nCommission found that the purchases and the consumption of raw materials\r\nreported in the company\u2019s questionnaire reply were not supported by the data\r\nfound in the producer\u2019s inventory management system. In particular it appeared\r\nthat the distribution of steel grades was different in each of the sources. The\r\nCommission established that the steel grade is a key factor in the\r\ndetermination of the cost of the final product and that unreliable information\r\nconcerning the steel grade could seriously distort the determination of costs\r\nand sales prices of individual product types and could therefore be misleading,\r\nand made the exporting producer aware of this essential consideration at\r\nvarious occasions.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As set out in recital (31)\r\nof the provisional Regulation, the exporting producer claimed however that the\r\ncomputer files containing the purchases of raw material collected by the\r\nCommission during the verification visit were incomplete, because additional\r\npurchases of raw material had been made by other units in the company, but had\r\nnot been reported and were not included in the computer files collected during\r\nthe verification visit and examined by the Commission. Furthermore, the\r\nexporting producer claimed that the observed discrepancies in the quantities of\r\nsteel grades were due to the fact that some steel grades were partly\r\noverlapping with each other and that some parts of the production process were\r\nnot traceable at the level of individual steel grades.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In recital (32) of the\r\nprovisional Regulation the Commission however noted that the above claims made\r\nby the company relating to the additional purchases of raw material had not\r\nbeen substantiated and in any event were not sufficient to explain the observed\r\ndiscrepancies at the level of individual steel grades. The Commission also\r\nnoted that the company had alleged that it is not possible to make an exact\r\ntracing by individual steel grades in all the stages of the production process.\r\nThis acknowledgment further undermined the reliability of the reporting system\r\nof steel grades as a whole. The information provided concerning steel grades\r\nwas therefore provisionally considered misleading.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In recital (33) of the\r\nprovisional Regulation the Commission considered that the reported distribution\r\nof raw material by steel grade is not reliable and should be provisionally\r\ndisregarded and that the determinations should be made on the basis of facts\r\navailable pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation. Due to the unreliability\r\nof the reporting system as a whole, it was not possible to make the\r\ndeterminations on the basis of any of the reported steel grades. Therefore the\r\ntotal consumption of all raw materials taken as a whole, without considering\r\nthe distribution by steel grade, was used in calculating an overall dumping\r\nmargin for all products. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the publication\r\nof the provisional findings, the company has contested this provisional\r\napproach in general terms but continued being unable to offer a one-to-one\r\nmatching at PCN level. However, the company offered later in the investigation a\r\nsufficient degree of reconciliation when the raw material is grouped in the\r\nmain series of stainless steel grades according to their chemical composition\r\n(the 200-, 300- and 400-series in the AISI classification). The company also\r\noffered an alternative way of grouping in which the final end-use was included\r\nas an additional grouping factor. However, as the final end-use cannot be\r\nverified, the Commission recalculated the dumping margin on the basis of the steel\r\ngrades grouped based on the chemical composition as expressed in the series of\r\nsteel grades (the 200-, 300- and 400-series in the AISI classification). The\r\nseries of steel grades are a generally used, objective and verifiable criterion\r\nwhereas for this company the use of the PCN does\r\nnot allow for full reconciliation and therefore would not ensure a fair\r\ncomparison on the basis of reliable data within the meaning of the basic\r\nRegulation. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the additional\r\ninformation submitted by the company did however not allow reconciling the data\r\nat the sufficiently detailed level required for the investigation, the\r\nprovisional conclusion that the company\u2019s tracing systems are not sufficiently\r\nreliable is maintained and Article 18 of the basic Regulation is applied for\r\nthe definitive determination of cost of production and the dumping margin\r\ncalculation, which is therefore based on the approach referred to in the\r\nprevious recital.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated in recital\r\n(34) of the provisional Regulation, in the case of the third exporting\r\nproducer, the Commission found during the verification visit that the flows of\r\nraw materials reported in the questionnaire reply were not consistent with the\r\ndata contained in the producer\u2019s accounting system. It appeared that the\r\ndistribution per steel grades was different in each of the two sources. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated in recital\r\n(35) of the provisional Regulation, the exporting producer, while admitting\r\nsome errors in its questionnaire reply, alleged that the differences in the\r\noverall quantities of raw material could be reconciled by taking into account\r\nthe changes in inventories. However, the company also alleged that partly\r\noverlapping steel grades made it impossible to make an exact reconciliation as\r\nper each individual steel grade. In its comments following the provisional\r\nfindings, it also stated that occasionally the steel grade indicated on the\r\nsales invoice does not correspond with the actual steel grade being exported.\r\nFurthermore, the company argued that steel grades are not used in a precise\r\nmanner in the stainless steel industry, but instead there are variations\r\nbetween the published chemical compositions of steel grades and the actual\r\nproducts. The company argued that when taking into account these explanations,\r\nthe discrepancies identified by the Commission would concern only an\r\ninsignificant proportion of its exports.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission considered that\r\nthe volume of the detected discrepancies could not be explained by occasional\r\nimprecisions. On the contrary, the arguments being put forward contributed to\r\nundermining the reliability of the company\u2019s reporting system of steel grades\r\nas a whole, especially in light of the decisive nature of steel grades in the\r\ndetermination of the cost of the final product.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, later in the\r\ninvestigation the company claimed that if the Commission does not accept the\r\ncompany\u2019s initial reporting of steel grades, a more accurate result could be\r\nobtained, if instead of merging together all PCNs as had been done at the\r\nprovisional stage, the Commission would group together only those specific\r\nsteel grades between which discrepancies had been identified, or alternatively\r\nwould group together the steel grades according to their chemical composition\r\nexpressed in the series of steel grades (the 200-, 300- and 400-series in the\r\nAISI classification). The company also offered yet another method of further\r\ngrouping the steel grades in the 300-series into smaller sub-groups.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission consequently\r\nrecalculated the dumping margin on the basis of the stainless steel groups\r\nbased on the chemical composition as expressed in the series of steel grades\r\n(the 200-, 300- and 400-series in the AISI classification) so as to follow the\r\nsame method as described in recital (30) above. The series of steel grades are\r\na generally used, objective and verifiable criterion whereas\r\nfor this company the use of the PCN does not allow for full reconciliation and\r\ntherefore would not ensure a fair comparison on the basis of reliable data within\r\nthe meaning of the basic Regulation. \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the additional\r\ninformation submitted by the company did however not allow reconciling the data\r\nat the sufficiently detailed level required for the investigation, the\r\nprovisional conclusion that the company\u2019s tracing systems are not sufficiently\r\nreliable is maintained and Article 18 of the basic Regulation is applied for\r\nthe definitive determination of cost of production and the dumping margin\r\ncalculation, which is therefore based on the approach referred to in the\r\nprevious recital.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant submitted\r\nthat the grouping of the product concerned into steel grades prevented the\r\nCommission from performing a correct profitability test in order to determine\r\nthe normal values per PCN. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission performs its\r\nanalysis at a level that is consistent with the exporting and Union producers\u2019\r\ninternal accounting systems, which allow for substantiation of the reported\r\nfigures. The claim is therefore rejected. \n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\r\ncomments, recitals (37) and (38) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal value\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For one exporting producer\r\nfor which Article 18 of the basic Regulation is applied, the determination of\r\nthe normal value has been reviewed following the re-assessment of its cost of\r\nproduction. In the definitive stage, the cost of production was determined\r\nbased on the reported manufacturing costs, to which selling, general and\r\nadministrative costs, inclusive of finance costs, were added using an\r\nallocation method permitted by Article 2(5) of the basic Regulation. \n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the three newly sampled\r\nexporting producers, and the exporting producer granted individual examination,\r\ndomestic sales volumes were found to be representative overall, representing at\r\nleast 5% of the total company\u2019s export sales volume of the product concerned to\r\nthe Union. The same representativity test was also performed for each product\r\ntype sold by the newly sampled producers on their domestic markets and found to\r\nbe comparable with the product types sold for export to the Union, according to\r\nArticle 2(2) of the basic Regulation. \n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By establishing the\r\nproportion of profitable sales to independent customers in the domestic market\r\nduring the IP, the Commission further examined whether the domestic sales of\r\neach newly sampled exporting producer and the exporting producer granted\r\nindividual examination, could be considered as having been sold in the ordinary\r\ncourse of trade, according to Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation. \n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of one of the\r\nnewly sampled exporting producers, the cost allocation initially submitted by\r\nthe company was found to be inadequate since it disregarded the thickness of\r\nthe wire which is a significant cost driver. With the agreement of the company,\r\nthe cost allocation method was adjusted.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of a second\r\nnewly sampled exporting producer, a clerical error in the determination of the\r\ndumping margin was corrected. Furthermore the producer requested the Commission\r\nto make additional adjustments in the profitability test and price allowances.\r\nThese claims were not found to be warranted.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of the\r\nexporting producer granted individual examination, a clerical error in the\r\ncalculations was corrected. The same exporting producer made further claims on\r\nthe Commission\u2019s determination of the level of the selling, general and\r\nadministrative costs and the domestic transport costs and requested an\r\nadjustment for physical differences of the product concerned between the\r\ndomestic and export markets. These adjustments requested by the exporting\r\nproducer were rejected, because the calculations were based on the cost data\r\nsubmitted by the company that had been verified during the verification visit\r\nand because the claim regarding physical differences was not substantiated. \n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence, the\r\nmethodology for determining normal value as described in recitals (39) to (48) to\r\nthe provisional Regulation is confirmed and was applied to the three newly\r\nsampled exporting producers and the exporting producer granted individual\r\nexamination. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export price\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For one exporting producer,\r\nfollowing its claims, certain clerical errors were rectified, relating to the\r\noccasional use of a wrong exchange rate and the inclusion by mistake of certain\r\nintragroup sales in the dumping calculation. \n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For a second exporting\r\nproducer, sales via a related company in the Union were included in the dumping\r\ncalculation.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One newly sampled exporting\r\nproducer claimed that the benefits it had received under the DEPB and DDS\r\nsubsidy schemes needed to be added to the export prices. \n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another newly sampled\r\nexporting producer reported the benefits it received under the DDS subsidy\r\nscheme as negative price allowances, artificially increasing the export prices.\r\n\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission analysed the\r\nprice behaviour of both companies on the Union market and arrived at its\r\nfindings, which result from the application of Article 2(8) of the basic\r\nRegulation and therefore do not require further adjustment. The former\r\ncompany\u2019s claim was therefore rejected and the latter company\u2019s reported\r\nallowance disregarded. \n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One newly sampled exporting\r\nproducer claimed that its export prices should be corrected upward in order to\r\nbring them in line with its domestic prices because the domestic sales were\r\nmade under an own brand name, attracting higher prices. The company could\r\nhowever not substantiate that the invoices for which it made the claim were\r\nindeed referring to branded sales and, consequently, the claim was rejected. \n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\r\ncomments, recitals (50) to (52) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer\r\nclaimed that, since collapsing of all PCN\u2019s took place for the determination of\r\nits cost of production, export prices should be treated in the same way and a\r\nsingle export price should have been used for the comparison to the normal\r\nvalue. \n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission in its\r\ninvestigation aimed at obtaining cost and export price data on a PCN basis,\r\nbut, however, did not obtain from the company concerned the necessary\r\nreconciliations that would have allowed identifying reliable costs of\r\nproduction on a PCN basis. The investigation found however no deficiency with\r\nthe export price levels reported by PCN, and it would therefore not have been\r\nappropriate applying Article 18 of the basic Regulation to the determination of\r\nthe actual export prices. As the Commission does not consider reducing the\r\nlevel of detail of reported prices to be appropriate compared to the standards\r\nof the investigation in order to make a fair comparison, the claim was\r\ntherefore rejected. \n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\r\ncomments, recitals (53) to (55) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margins \n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As provided by Article\r\n2(11) and (12) of the basic Regulation, for each sampled company the weighted\r\naverage normal value established for the like product was compared with the\r\nweighted average export price of the product concerned. \n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nline with the provisions of Article 9(6) of the basic Regulation, due to the\r\napplication of Article 18 of the basic Regulation to two of the three initially\r\nsampled exporting producers, the dumping margin of the cooperating exporting\r\nproducers not included in the sample is established on the basis of the average\r\ndumping margin of the one originally sampled exporting producer for which Article\r\n18 of the basic Regulation is no longer applied and the two newly sampled\r\ncompanies with dumping margins that are not de minimis. On this basis,\r\nthe dumping margin calculated for the cooperating companies not included in the\r\nsample was established at 8.4%.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to all other\r\nexporting producers in India, the Commission first established the level of\r\ncooperation. To this end, a comparison was made between the total export\r\nquantities indicated in the sampling replies and the total imports from India as derived from the Eurostat import statistics. Since the level of cooperation was\r\nhigh, the residual dumping margin was set at the level of the highest dumping margin established for the sampled exporting\r\nproducers. On this basis, the\r\ncountry-wide level of dumping was established at 16.2%.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, the weighted\r\naverage dumping margins, expressed as a percentage of the CIF Union frontier\r\nprice, duty unpaid, are as follows: \n Company || Definitive dumping margin \n GARG Inox || 11.8% \n KEI Industries || 7.7% \n Macro Bars and Wires || 0.0% \n Nevatia Steel & Alloys || 4.1% \n Raajratna Metal Industries || 16.2% \n Venus Group || 11.6 % \n Viraj Profiles || 6.8 % \n Cooperating non-sampled companies || 8.4% \n All other companies || 16.2% \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union industry\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union industry \n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some users questioned the\r\nnumber of Union producers as stated in recital (63) to the provisional\r\nRegulation. They claim that the number of producers was wrongly assessed and in\r\nreality there are fewer producers present on the Union market. \n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission points out\r\nthat the above claim was not substantiated by any evidence. The Commission has\r\nverified the number of Union producers stated in the complaint when verifying\r\nthe standing and also during the investigation. The Commission contacted all 27\r\nknown Union producers in this respect. The investigation confirmed that 27\r\nUnion producers were manufacturing the like product in the Union during the IP.\r\nThe claim is therefore rejected and recital (63) to the provisional Regulation\r\nis confirmed. \n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union production and\r\nSampling of Union producers\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments,\r\nrecitals (64) to (67) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 INJURY\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union consumption \n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some users claimed that the\r\ninjury analysis should have disregarded the data relating to 2009 because the\r\nfinancial crisis which occurred that year had distorting effects in particular\r\non the Union consumption. However, even if 2009 was excluded from the analysis,\r\nthere would still be a growing trend for consumption (+5%) which is an\r\nindication of an improving market. Moreover, the negative effects of the\r\nfinancial crises are recognised in recital (68) to the provisional Regulation.\r\nIn absence of other comments, recital (68) to the provisional Regulation is\r\nconfirmed. \n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports into the Union from the country concerned \n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The dumping margin\r\nestablished for Macro Bars and Wires is below de minimis threshold\r\nforeseen in Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation. Therefore, it is deemed that\r\nthis exporting producer has not dumped in the meaning of Article 1(2) of the\r\nbasic Regulation during the investigation period. As a result, its import\r\nvolumes were excluded from the volume of provisionally established dumped\r\nimports from India. One exporting producer, namely the Venus group submitted\r\nthat certain transactions were mistakenly double counted. The Commission agreed\r\nwith the exporting producer, and adjusted the total volume of dumped imports by\r\neliminating these transactions.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly the volume, market\r\nshare and the average price of the dumped imports were revised.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume and market share of\r\nthe dumped imports:\n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Volume || 15 826 || 27 291 || 34 494 || 33 252 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 172 || 218 || 210 \n Market share || 12.0% || 14.6% || 17.6% || 16.9% \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 121 || 146 || 140 \n Source: Eurostat and questionnaire replies \n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Macro Bars and Wires\r\nexported limited quantities of the product concerned during the IP and the\r\ntransactions of the Venus group mentioned above also constituted limited\r\nquantities, therefore the deduction of these import volumes from the total\r\nvolume of dumped imports from India does not result in significant changes\r\nconcerning the trends as described in recitals (69) and (71) to the provisional\r\nRegulation. Thus these recitals to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Average price of the dumped\r\nimports:\n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Average price || 2380 || 2811 || 3259 || 3207 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 118 || 137 || 135 \n Source: Eurostat and questionnaire replies \n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The adjustment of the\r\nvolume of dumped imports does not result in any significant change of the\r\naverage prices of the dumped Indian imports or the undercutting margin calculations.\r\nThe weighted average undercutting margin is 15%, which confirms the finding in\r\nthe provisional Regulation. \n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An Indian exporting\r\nproducer claimed that the Union sales prices seemed highly implausible and\r\nlikely to be distorted. It is, however, underlined that the prices used in the\r\nundercutting calculations were the result of information collected and verified\r\nduring on-spot investigations at the premises of the sampled Union producers.\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The conclusions drawn from\r\nthe findings described in recitals (75) to (77) to the provisional Regulation\r\nare confirmed. \n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic Situation of the\r\nUnion industry\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some\r\nparties claimed that the results obtained by the Union industry should be\r\nconsidered as reasonably positive in the context of the global economic crisis\r\nand that with the exception of one injury indicator namely, market share, all\r\nother indicators did not point toward the existence of injury. \n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\r\nparty claimed that the average selling prices of the Union industry increased\r\nby around 34% far more than its cost of production which increased by 13% over the\r\nsame period. In this respect it needs to be noted that at the beginning of the\r\nperiod considered, namely in 2009, the Union industry was selling below cost of\r\nproduction, and only managed to sell above cost of production from 2011\r\nonwards. \n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\r\nthat although some injury indicators such as production volumes and capacity\r\nutilisation followed a positive trend, or remained stable such as employment, a\r\nnumber of other indicators relating to the financial situation of the Union industry,\r\nnamely profitability, cash flow, investment and return on investment did not\r\nfollow a satisfactory trend during the period considered. While the indicator\r\nrelating to investments improved in 2010, it dropped below 2009 figures in 2011\r\nand the IP. Although it is true that return on investments improved from 2009\r\nuntil 2011 reaching 6.7%, it dropped again to 0.8% in the IP. Similarly\r\nindicators relating to profitability and cash flow improved until 2011 and they\r\nstarted again to deteriorate in the IP. Therefore, it can be concluded that the\r\nUnion industry started to improve after 2009, but its recovery was slowed down\r\nby the dumped imports from India subsequently. \n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On a request by an\r\ninterested party it is confirmed that the stock levels established in recital\r\n(100) to the provisional Regulation concerned the activity of the sampled Union\r\ncompanies.\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry argued\r\nthat the target profit margin of 5% set at the provisional stage was too low.\r\nThe party did not substantiate its claim sufficiently. Recital (95) to the\r\nprovisional Regulation explains the reasons behind the choice of this profit\r\nmargin and the investigation did not reveal any other reasons to change it.\r\nTherefore, the target profit of 5% is maintained for the purpose of the definitive\r\nfindings.\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer\r\nargued that the Union industry\u2019s difficulties are largely due to structural\r\nproblems and that, therefore, the target profit margin of 5% was unrealistic. \n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that\r\naccording to the case law[8],\r\nthe Institutions need to establish the profit margin which the Union industry\r\ncould reasonably count on under normal conditions of competition, in the\r\nabsence of the dumped imports. In 2007, the profit margin was 3.7%; as of 2008,\r\ndue to the financial and economic crisis, it became negative. The complaint\r\nargued, and the investigation established, that dumped imports started to\r\narrive on the Union market as of 2007, when the volume of imports increased\r\nfrom 17727 tons in 2006 to 24811 tons. Therefore, it was not possible to establish\r\nthe target profit margin based on the profit which could reasonably be counted\r\non by the Union producers of the like product. Consequently, as explained in\r\nrecital (95) to the provisional Regulation, the Commission considered it\r\nappropriate using the profit margin of 5% on the basis of the real profits observed\r\nin other parts of the steel industry, which have not suffered from dumped and\r\nsubsidized imports, as has been done in other recent investigations into\r\nsimilar product in the same sector.[9]\r\nAdditionally, it should be noted that the 3,7% profit margin observed in 2007\r\nis considered in any case too low because of the presence and increase of\r\ndumped imports. Therefore, the target profit of 5% is maintained for the\r\npurpose of the definitive findings.\n5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on injury \n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission therefore\r\nconcludes that the Union industry has suffered material injury within the\r\nmeaning of Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation. In the absence of other\r\ncomments, recitals (78) to (105) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Causation\n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of dumped imports \n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer\r\nclaimed that the provisional Regulation ignored that the Union industry was\r\nable to benefit from the increase in consumption since 2009 and that the\r\nCommission cannot assume that the Union industry will be able to maintain its\r\nmarket share indefinitely. \n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to these\r\narguments it needs to be noted that the investigation revealed the market share\r\nof the dumped Indian imports grew with a higher pace than the consumption in\r\nthe Union market. The volume of Indian dumped imports increased by 110% while\r\nthe consumption increased by 50% over the same period. Furthermore the\r\ninvestigation also showed that the average Indian price was constantly below\r\nthe average price of the Union industry during the same period and undercut the\r\nUnion industry average price by 15% during the IP. As a result, while the Union\r\nindustry indeed benefited from the increased consumption to a certain extent and\r\nit also could increase its sales volumes by 40%, it could not maintain its\r\nmarket share as it could be expected under improving market conditions and\r\ngiven the Union industry\u2019s free production capacity. \n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of other factors\n6.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non-dumped imports\n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the period considered,\r\nthe development of non-dumped imports and prices is comparable to the evolution\r\nof dumped imports and prices. Moreover, prices of dumped imports were\r\nfundamentally at the same level as the prices of the non-dumped imports, in\r\nthat average non-dumped import prices were lower by 0.4%. In addition, the\r\nvolume of non-dumped imports is less than six per cent of total imports from India and slightly more than one percent of market share. Therefore, the Commission\r\nconsiders that the injury caused by non-dumped imports from India does not break the causal link between the dumped imports, from India and the material injury suffered by the Union industry during the IP. \n6.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from third countries\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two Indian exporting\r\nproducers and the Government of India reiterated the claim that imports of\r\nstainless steel wire originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China should have been included in the investigation and that the impact the imports from the\r\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China had on the Union market and the Union industry was\r\nunderestimated. \n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital (115)\r\nto the provisional Regulation, since the initiation stage up to now no evidence\r\nof dumping causing injury to the Union industry has been presented which may\r\nhave justified the initiation of an anti-dumping investigation on imports\r\noriginating in People\u2019s Republic of China. The claim that People\u2019s Republic of China should have been included in the\r\nscope of the investigation is therefore rejected as unfounded. \n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the imports from\r\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China showed an increasing trend during the period\r\nconsidered and reached a market share of 8.3% in the IP as stated in recital (113)\r\nto the provisional Regulation. In addition, the Chinese import prices were\r\nlower than the prices of the Union industry and those of the Indian exporting\r\nproducers in the Union market. It was, therefore, further investigated whether\r\nthe imports from People\u2019s Republic of China could have contributed to the\r\ninjury suffered by the Union industry and broken the causal link between that\r\ninjury and the Indian dumped imports. \n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The information available\r\nat provisional stage suggested that the product mix represented by the Chinese\r\nimports was different and that the ranges where the Chinese products were\r\npresent were different compared to the products sold by the Union industry or\r\neven those of Indian origin products sold in the Union market.\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After publication of the\r\nprovisional measure the Commission received several claims pointing to the\r\npossibility that Chinese low-priced imports during the IP would break the\r\ncausal link between dumped Indian imports and material injury suffered by the\r\nUnion industry.\n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis made on the basis\r\nof the import statistics concerning the two CN codes under investigation showed\r\nthat 29% of Chinese imports were made on the lower end of the market (under CN\r\ncode 7223 00 99). This partly explains why Chinese prices on average are lower\r\nthan those of the Union industry and the Indian exporting producers\u2019. The\r\nstatistics for CN code 7223 00 99 also showed that the customers of the Chinese\r\nproducers were concentrated in the United Kingdom where the Union industry was\r\nbasically not producing. \n Average price (euro/MT) || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n 7223 00 19 || 2 974 || 3 286 || 3 436 || 2 995 \n 7223 00 99 || 765 || 1 458 || 1 472 || 1 320 \n Source: Eurostat \n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As concern CN code 7223 00\r\n19 the analyses carried out on PCN basis showed that both the Union industry\r\nand Indian producers were mainly competing in the higher end of the market\r\nwhere prices could be up to four times higher than prices in the lower end\r\nwithin the same CN.[10]\r\nThe investigation also showed that in general price variations are linked to\r\nthe product type and the nickel content. \n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As concerns the price level\r\nof imports from the People\u2019s Republic of China, it needs to be pointed out that\r\nfrom 2009 until the IP the average price of Chinese imports remained above the\r\nprice of the dumped exports of the product concerned from India, as can be seen\r\nfrom the following table showing the average price of dumped Indian exports\r\nfalling under CN code 7223 00 19. \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Average price (euro/MT) || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2009 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2010 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2011 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IP || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IP+1 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7223 00 19 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2974 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3286 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3436 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2995 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3093 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Source: Eurostat \n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the IP for the first\r\ntime the average Chinese import price dropped below that of the Indian import\r\nprice of dumped imports. However, this observation was found to be of a\r\ntemporary nature since the Chinese price level in the year after the IP\r\nincreased and was again higher than the Indian prices. \n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the comparison\r\nbetween the import volumes from India and People\u2019s Republic of China showed that at any point during the period considered and particularly in the IP, imports from\r\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China were at much lower levels than the imports from India. The import volumes for People\u2019s Republic of China amounted to basically less than\r\nhalf of the total imports from India. \n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, even if the\r\nimports from the People\u2019s Republic of China contributed to the injury suffered\r\nby the Union industry they could not have affected the situation of the Union\r\nindustry to the extent to break the causal link between the dumped imports from\r\n  India and the injury suffered by the Union industry. Therefore, recital (113)\r\nto the provisional Regulation is confirmed.\n6.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competition from other\r\nproducers in the Union\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One party argued that the\r\nUnion producers\u2019 poor financial performance might have been caused by\r\ncompetition from other Union producers which were not complainants or did not\r\nexpress their support to the investigation at the initiation of the case. \n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The market share of other\r\nproducers in the Union developed as follows: \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Union sales of other producers in the Union (MT) || 34 926 || 55 740 || 55 124 || 55 124 \n Index (2009= 100) || 100 || 160 || 158 || 158 \n Market share of other producers in the Union || 26.6% || 29.8% || 28.1% || 27.9% \n Source: complaint and standing replies \n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union producers which\r\nwere not complainants and which did not specifically express support to the investigation\r\naccounted for 44% of total Union sales reported in Recital (86) to the\r\nprovisional Regulation. Their sales volume increased by 58% from an estimated\r\n34926 tons in 2009 to 55124 tons during the period considered. However, such\r\ngrowth is relatively modest if compared to the growth of the dumped imports\r\nfrom India in the same period (+110%). Furthermore, the market share of those\r\nUnion producers remained relatively stable during the period considered and no\r\nindication was found that their prices were lower than those of the sampled\r\nUnion producers. It is therefore concluded that their sales on the Union market\r\ndid not contribute to the injury suffered by the Union industry. \n6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on causation \n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments,\r\nrecitals (121) to (124) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union interest\n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General considerations \n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments,\r\nrecital (125) to the provisional Regulation is confirmed.\n7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the Union\r\nindustry\n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments,\r\nrecitals (126) to (133) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n7.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of unrelated\r\nimporters\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments,\r\nrecitals (142) to (144) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n7.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of users \n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the imposition of\r\nthe provisional measures, seven users and one users\u2019 association contacted the\r\nCommission and showed interest to cooperate in the investigation. Following\r\ntheir request, questionnaires were sent to them in April 2013. However, only\r\ntwo users submitted a full questionnaire reply and overall the cooperating\r\nusers represented 12% of total imports from India during the IP and 2.5% of the\r\ntotal Union consumption, while employing 32 persons involved in manufacturing\r\nfinished products incorporating the product concerned. The economic impact of\r\nthe measures on users was reassessed on the basis of the new data available in\r\nthe questionnaire replies and two users were visited to verify the information\r\nprovided. \n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 Users claimed that the level\r\nof profitability of 9%, stated in recital (136) to the provisional Regulation\r\nwas too high and was not representative for the users\u2019 industry. Following the\r\nreceipt of the additional questionnaire replies the average profitability of\r\nall cooperating users was recalculated and established at 2% on turnover. \n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 It was also found that on\r\naverage concerning the cooperating users, purchases from India constituted 44% of the total purchases of the product concerned, and that India represented the exclusive source of supply for two cooperating users. During the IP,\r\nthe turnover of the product incorporating the product concerned represented on\r\naverage 14% of total turnover of the cooperating users. \n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 Assuming the worst case\r\nscenario for the Union market, i.e. that no potential price increase could be\r\npassed on to the distribution chain and that the users would continue\r\npurchasing from India in previous volumes, the impact of the duty on the users\u2019\r\nprofitability achieved from activities using or incorporating the product\r\nconcerned would mean a decrease to the point where users would become loss\r\nmaking, reaching a (negative) profitability of -0.6%.\n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission acknowledges that the impact in\r\nthe short and medium term will be more important, on an individual level, for\r\nthose users which source their entire imports from India. However, these are\r\nrelatively few in numbers (two of the cooperating users). Furthermore, they\r\nhave the possibility, provided that their Indian producer cooperates, to\r\nrequest the refund of the duties pursuant to Article 11 of the Basic\r\nRegulation, if all conditions for such a refund are met.\n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 Some users reiterated the\r\nconcern that measures would hit certain type of wires not produced in Europe,\r\nnamely types included in the so-called series 200 as described in recital (139)\r\nto the provisional Regulation. According to the users, the absence of\r\nproduction in the Union is due to the limited demand and to the specificity of\r\nthe production process. \n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 However, the investigation\r\nshowed that such type of stainless steel wires are produced by the Union\r\nindustry and that they represent a limited share of the Union market. For\r\nusers, there are also alternative sources of supply available from countries\r\nnot subject to anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures. Furthermore, other\r\nproduct types of stainless steel wires can be used for the same purposes.\r\nTherefore, the imposition of the measures cannot have a significant impact on\r\nthe Union market and on these users. This claim is therefore rejected.\n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 Some users pointed out the\r\nlonger delivery time for the like product by the Union producers compared to\r\nthe delivery time of the product concerned from India. However, the possibility\r\nof merchants and traders of stocking the products and of having them swiftly\r\navailable does not undermine the factual evidence of the negative effects of\r\nthe dumped imports. Therefore, this argument has to be rejected. \n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 Taking the above into\r\nconsideration, even if some users are likely to be negatively affected by the\r\nmeasures on imports from India more than others, it is considered that in\r\nbalance the Union market will benefit from the imposition of the measures. In\r\nparticular, it is considered that restoring fair trade conditions on the Union\r\nmarket would allow the Union industry to align its prices with cost of\r\nproduction; to keep production and employment; to regain the market share\r\npreviously lost and to benefit from increased economies of scale. This should\r\nallow the industry to reach reasonable profit margins that will permit it to\r\noperate efficiently in the medium and long term. In parallel the industry will\r\nimprove its overall financial situation. In addition, the investigation\r\nestablished that the measures will have an overall limited impact on the users\r\nand on unrelated importers. Therefore it is concluded that the overall benefit\r\nof the measures appears to outweigh the impact on the users of the product\r\nconcerned in the Union market. \n7.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on Union\r\ninterest\n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, the\r\nassessment in recitals (145) and (146) to the provisional Regulation is\r\nconfirmed. \n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive anti-dumping\r\nmeasures\n8.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injury elimination level\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 For one exporting producer\r\nthe injury elimination calculation was adjusted downward following its claim\r\nthat clerical errors had been made by confusing the exchange rate on certain\r\ntransactions and the inclusion of intra-group transactions in the calculation. In\r\nthe absence of any other comments, recitals (148) to (151) to the provisional\r\nRegulation are confirmed. \n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 The same exporting producer\r\nclaimed that the Indian exports to the Union are made to wholesalers and that\r\nsales by the Union industry on the Union market are made to end-users and that\r\ntherefore the Commission did not compare at the appropriate level of trade.\r\nHowever, the investigation showed that the Indian exporting producers are\r\nselling to both categories of customers and that they are competing with the\r\nUnion producers for the same categories of clients. \n8.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on injury elimination\r\nlevel\n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 No individual injury margin\r\nwas calculated for Macro Bars and Wires since this company\u2019s definitive anti-dumping\r\nmargin was at de minimis level as stated in recital (51). \n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 The methodology used in the\r\nprovisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. \n8.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive measures\n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the above\r\nand in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, a definitive anti-dumping\r\nduty should be imposed at a level sufficient to eliminate the injury caused by\r\nthe dumped imports taking into account the subsidy margin imposed Commission\r\nRegulation (EU) No 419/2013.\n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the dumping duty rates were established by comparing the injury\r\nmargins to the dumping margins, while taking the subsidy margins into account\r\nby fully deducting them from the relevant dumping margin. Consequently, the definitive\r\nanti-dumping duty rates are as follows:\n Company || Dumping margin || Countervailing duty || Injury margin || Definitive anti-dumping duty rate \n GARG Inox || 11.8% || 3.4% || 22.6% || 8.4% \n KEI Industries || 7.0% || 0.0% || 41.9% || 7.7% \n Macro Bars and Wires || 0.0% || 3.4% || 30.3% || 0.0% \n Nevatia Steel & Alloys || 4.1% || 3.4% || 23.8% || 0.7% \n Raajratna Metal Industries || 16.2% || 3.7% || 17.2% || 12.5% \n Venus group || 11.6% || 3.0% || 23.4% || 8.6% \n Viraj Profiles Vpl.

Therefore,\r\nthey reflect the situation found during that\r\ninvestigation with respect to these companies. These\r\nduty rates (as opposed to the country-wide duty applicable to 'all other\r\ncompanies') are exclusively applicable to imports of products originating in India and produced by the specific legal entities mentioned. Imported products produced by\r\nany other company not specifically mentioned in the operative part of this regulation,\r\nincluding entities related to those specifically mentioned, cannot benefit from\r\nthese rates and shall be subject to the duty rate applicable to 'all other\r\ncompanies'.\n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 One\r\nexporting producer in India offered a price undertaking in accordance with\r\nArticle 8(1) of the basic Regulation. \n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nrecent years, the product concerned has shown a considerable volatility in\r\nprices and therefore it is not suitable for a fixed price undertaking. In order\r\nto overcome this problem, the Indian exporting producer offered an indexation\r\nclause based on raw material costs. In this respect it is noted that no direct\r\nand precise link between the fluctuation of prices and that of the index could\r\nbe established and, thus, indexation is not considered appropriate. In\r\naddition, the investigation established that there are different types of the\r\nproduct concerned which are not easily distinguishable and have considerable\r\ndifferences in prices.\n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\r\nthe exporting producer produces a range of stainless steel products and may\r\nsell these products to the same customers in the European Union via related\r\ntrading companies. This would create a serious risk of cross-compensation and\r\nwould render extremely difficult to monitor effectively the undertaking. \n(125)\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\nthe basis of the above, the Commission concluded that the undertaking offer\r\ncannot be accepted.\n(126)\u00a0\u00a0 Any claim requesting the\r\napplication of an individual company anti-dumping duty rate (e.g. following a\r\nchange in the name of the entity or following the setting up of new production\r\nor sales entities) should be addressed to the Commission[11] forthwith with all relevant\r\ninformation, in particular any modification in the company's activities linked\r\nto production, domestic and export sales associated with, for example, that\r\nname change or that change in the production and sales entities.
