By letter dated 14 June 2013, the Commission notified Denmark and Sweden that it had all the information it considered necessary for the appraisal of the\r\nrequest.\nGeneral context\nDenmark and Sweden have jointly introduced simplified rules on the recovery of VAT in connection with tolls on\r\nthe \u00d6resund fixed link between Denmark and Sweden. This was deemed necessary as\r\nthe normal VAT rules would create excessive paperwork for taxpayers and\r\nadministrations alike.\nUnder the normal VAT rules as contained in\r\nArticles 168, 169, 170 and 171 of the VAT Directive, VAT must be deducted in or\r\nrefunded by the Member State in which it was due or paid. As the \u00d6resund fixed\r\nlink is located partly in the territory of Denmark and partly in the territory of Sweden the VAT paid on the toll charge for using the link would be recoverable\r\nfrom either of these countries to the extent that the charge relates to their\r\nterritory. Specifically 50% would be recoverable from Denmark and 50% from   Sweden.\nIn practice this would mean that taxable\r\npersons established in either Denmark or Sweden would only be able to recover\r\n50% of the VAT on their periodic VAT returns in the Member State of registration. The remaining 50% would have to be claimed back as a refund from the\r\nother Member State via Directive 2008/9/EC[5].\r\nAlso, taxable persons established in Member States other than Denmark and Sweden would be required to recover VAT via two separate refund claims under Directive\r\n2008/9/EC, one submitted to Denmark and the other to Sweden. Likewise taxable\r\npersons established outside the territory of the Union would under Directive\r\n86/560/EEC[6]\r\nneed to send refund claims both to Denmark and to Sweden.\nThe existing derogation for Denmark and Sweden simplifies the VAT rules concerning the recovery of VAT. In effect, under that\r\nderogation, they allow a single claim for the recovery of VAT in relation to\r\nthe toll. The simplified rules applied are as follows:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taxable persons established in\r\nDenmark and Sweden are entitled to deduct, on their domestic VAT return, the\r\nfull amount of deductible VAT on the tolls including that part relating to the\r\nuse of the link in the territory of the Member State in which they are not\r\nestablished.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To recover VAT deductible under\r\nthe procedure laid down in Directive 2008/9/EC regarding taxable persons\r\nestablished in a Member State other than Denmark or Sweden or under the\r\nprocedure laid down in Directive 86/560/EEC for taxable persons established\r\noutside of the Member States, the application should be made to the Swedish\r\nauthorities only.\nDenmark and Sweden request that these existing simplification rules be extended for a further period. \nAccording to the statistical information\r\nprovided by Sweden in Annex I of its request, the derogation created for the\r\ntaxable persons is a significant simplification of the VAT recovery of the\r\n\u00d6resund link tolls, and has proven successful. It is also the Commission's view\r\nthat this type of cross-border deduction is a model of simplification of\r\nbusiness obligations that could be extended through a generalised One Stop Shop\r\nin the long term.\nThe Commission therefore considers that a\r\nfurther extension is appropriate. It proposes a 7 year extension, in line with\r\nthe period of application of Decision 2007/132/EC. \nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nAn existing derogation granted to Denmark and Sweden on 24 January 2000 and extended on 21 January 2003 and on 30 January 2007.\nConsistency with other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nNot applicable.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nNot relevant.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThe proposed Decision aims at simplifying\r\nthe procedure for recovery of VAT on tolls for taxable persons using the\r\n\u00d6resund fixed link between Denmark and Sweden and therefore potentially has a\r\npositive economic impact.\nThe impact will in any case be limited\r\nbecause of the narrow scope of the derogation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nAuthorisation for Denmark and Sweden to\r\napply a measure derogating from Articles 168, 169, 170 and 171 of the VAT\r\nDirective as regards the right of deduction for taxable persons.\nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of Directive 2006/112/EC of 28\r\nNovember 2006 on the common system of value added tax.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThis Decision concerns an authorisation\r\ngranted to two Member States upon their own request and does not constitute any\r\nobligation.\nGiven the limited scope of the derogation,\r\nthe special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: other.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reasons:\nUnder Article 395 of the Directive\r\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax,\r\nderogation from the common VAT rules is only possible on the authority of the\r\nCouncil acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission. A Council Implementing\r\nDecision is the only suitable instrument since it can be addressed to an\r\nindividual Member State.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the Union's budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nReview/revision/sunset clause\nThe proposal includes a sunset clause.\n2013/0283 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nauthorising the Kingdom of Denmark and the\r\nKingdom of Sweden to extend the application of a special measure derogating\r\nfrom Articles 168, 169, 170 and 171 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common\r\nsystem of value added tax \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive\r\n2006/112/EC on 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax[7] , and in particular Article\r\n395(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letters registered with\r\nthe Secretariat-General of the Commission on 3 and 4 April 2013 respectively,\r\nDenmark and Sweden requested authorisation to extend the application of a\r\nspecial measure derogating from Articles 168, 169, 170 and 171 of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC requiring taxable persons to exercise their right to deduct or\r\nobtain a refund of value added tax (hereinafter VAT) in the Member State where\r\nit was paid. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission informed\r\nthe other Member States by letter dated 12 June 2013 of the requests made by Denmark and Sweden. By letter dated 14 June 2013, the Commission notified Denmark and Sweden that it had all the information it considered necessary for appraisal of the\r\nrequests.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These requests for\r\nderogation relate to the recovery of VAT paid on tolls for the use of the\r\n\u00d6resund fixed link between Denmark and Sweden. Under the VAT rules on the place\r\nof supply of services connected with immovable property, part of the VAT on\r\ntolls for the \u00d6resund fixed link is payable to Denmark and part to Sweden.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of derogation from\r\nthe requirement for taxable persons to exercise their right to deduct or obtain\r\na refund of VAT in the Member State where it was paid, Denmark and Sweden were authorised to introduce a special measure enabling taxpayers to recover VAT\r\nfrom a single administration. The authorisation was first granted by Council\r\nDecision 2000/91/EC of 24 January 2000 authorising the Kingdom of Denmark and\r\nthe Kingdom of Sweden to apply a special measure derogating from Article 17 of\r\nthe Sixth Council Directive (77/338/EEC) on the harmonisation of the laws of\r\nthe Member States relating to turnover taxes[8]\r\nand extended by Decisions 2003/65/EC[9]\r\nand 2007/132/EC[10].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legal and factual\r\nsituation which justified that derogation has not changed and continues to\r\nexist. Denmark and Sweden should therefore be authorised to apply the special\r\nmeasure during a further limited period. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogation has no\r\nnegative effect on the Union's own resources accruing from VAT,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nBy way of derogation from the provisions of\r\nArticles 168, 169, 170 and 171 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Sweden and Denmark are hereby authorised to apply the following procedure for the recovery of VAT on\r\ntolls paid for the use of the \u00d6resund fixed link between the two countries:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 taxable persons established in\r\nDenmark may exercise their right to deduct the VAT paid when using the part of\r\nthe link located on Swedish territory by entering it in the periodic returns to\r\nbe lodged in Denmark;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 taxable persons established in\r\nSweden may exercise their right to deduct the VAT paid when using the part of\r\nthe link located on Danish territory by entering it in the periodic returns to\r\nbe lodged in Sweden;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 taxable persons who are not\r\nestablished in either of the above Member States must apply to the Swedish\r\nauthorities to obtain refunds of the VAT on tolls, including that paid for\r\nusing the section of the link located on Danish territory, under the procedure\r\nlaid down in Directive 2008/9/EC or Directive 86/560/EEC.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall apply from 1 January\r\n2014 until 31 December 2020.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark and to the Kingdom of Sweden.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 28, 3.2.2000, p. 38.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 25, 30.1.2003, p. 40.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 57, 24.2.2007, p. 10.\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 44, 20.2.2008, p. 23.\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 326, 21.11.1986, p. 40.\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p.1.\n[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 28, 3.2.2000, p. 38.\n[9]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 25, 30.1.2003, p. 40.\n[10]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 57, 24.2.2007, p. 10.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
