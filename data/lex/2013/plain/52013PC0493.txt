Across the EU, there are around\n20.7 million SMEs representing more than 98 % of all businesses in the EU,\naccounting for approximately 58 % of the EU\u2019s GVA[3],[4] and employing more than\n87 million people (67 % of total employment, and in some key industries as\nmuch as 80 % of all jobs).\nAmongst those SMEs, innovative research-performing\nSMEs form a very dynamic sub-group which can greatly contribute to growth and\njobs, even more so if they are engaged in transnational R&D collaboration. However,\na number of market failures prevent SMEs from easily accessing the necessary\nprivate funding for their R&D; existing national R&D programmes very\nseldom accommodate transnational collaborations and are not sufficiently\nsynchronised and interoperable. In addition, while a number of complementary EU\ninitiatives address innovative SMEs (e.g. the financial instruments such as the\nRisk Sharing Instrument or the newly conceived SME instrument), a programme\nspecifically dedicated to transnational R&D performed by research intensive\nSMEs does not exist at EU level.\nIn 2008, 32[5]\nEuropean countries that were members of the Eureka network[6] decided to adopt a coherent\napproach at European level in the field of research-performing SMEs by setting\nup the Eurostars Joint Programme. The objective of Eurostars is to support\nresearch-performing SMEs by co-financing their market-oriented transnational\nresearch in a bottom-up manner and by providing them with a legal and\norganisational framework.\nUnder the Decision[7] of 9 July 2008 of the European\nParliament and the Council, the European Union participates financially in\nEurostars by way of Article 185 TFEU (ex-Article 169 EC) with a contribution of\nup to one third of the effective contributions of the participating Member\nStates and the other participating countries, within a ceiling of \u20ac 100 million,\nfor the period 2008-2013. The Eurostars Programme is implemented through a\ndedicated implementation structure, the Eureka Secretariat (\u2018the ESE\u2019), which\nis responsible for the execution of the programme, in particular organisation\nof the calls for proposals, verification of the eligibility criteria,\npeer-review evaluation and selection of projects, monitoring of projects and\nallocation of the Union contribution.\nAn interim evaluation of Eurostars[8] was conducted in 2010 by a\nGroup of Independent Experts[9],\nto which the Commission replied with an Interim Evaluation Report[10], adopted in April 2011. The Competitiveness\nCouncil, in its conclusions of 31 May 2011[11]\non the above-mentioned documents, welcomed the view of the Group that Eurostars\nis well aligned with the objectives of Europe 2020, complements well the\nopportunities offered to SMEs in FP7 for international cooperation and has\nproven attractive to the target group by successfully reaching European research-performing\nSMEs. It also welcomed the Group\u2019s recommendation that Eurostars be continued beyond\n2013 and committed to consider its continuation in the overall context of the\nfuture Common Strategic Framework for Research and Innovation Funding.\nThe Council also highlighted a number of\nrecommendations for improving the programme in the future, including the need\nfor participating countries and the EU to provide sufficient funds to finance a\nmaximum of top-ranking projects meeting the Eurostars threshold criteria; the\nneed to further streamline and harmonise the implementation processes and\nfunding rules at national level to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of\nEurostars; and the need to continuously improve the quality of evaluations and to\nkeep a short time to contract as a priority.\nOn 22 June 2012, the Eureka Ministerial\nConference in Budapest endorsed a document (\u2018the Budapest document\u2019) stating the\ninterest of the Eureka countries in supporting the follow-up to the Eurostars Programme.\nThe Budapest document sets out a common vision for a Eurostars-2 and the basis\nfor addressing the above-mentioned recommendations of the interim evaluation. In\nJanuary 2013, the informal financial commitment indicated by the majority of\nthe Eurostars countries for the period 2014-2020 amounted to almost three times\nthe countries\u2019 commitments for Eurostars. The Budapest document invites the EU\nto participate in Eurostars-2.\nThe Commission proposal for Horizon 2020[12] includes a dedicated activity\nfor research-intensive SMEs in \u2018Innovation in SMEs\u2019, which will support the\nnext stage in the Eurostars scheme implemented in partnership with Member\nStates and reoriented along the lines stated in its interim evaluation. This is\nthe only programme under Horizon 2020 specifically dedicated to research-performing\nSMEs, open in any field of research and development, and having an additional\nimpact on furthering integration of national research programmes, therefore\ncontributing to the completion of the ERA. With its bottom-up approach and\nbusiness-driven agenda, Eurostars-2 is well placed under the \u2018Industrial\nLeadership\u2019 part and will strongly contribute to achieving its objectives by\nsupporting projects of direct relevance to a number of leading and enabling\nindustrial technologies and help innovative research intensive SMEs to grow\ninto world-leading companies.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED\nPARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation on the future\non the Eurostars Joint Programme\nAn extensive number of consultations have\nbeen performed during the last three years on Eurostars and its future\ndevelopment. They have covered all internal and external stakeholders. Comments\nhave been received among other things on the identification of the main\nproblems and barriers, on issues linked to subsidiarity and on possible future\noptions and their impacts.\nAn open public consultation on the SME\nsupport measures and on the use of Article 185 TFEU took place as part of the\npublic consultation on the \u2018Green Paper on a Common Strategic Framework for EU\nResearch and Innovation Funding\u2019, European Commission, February\u2013May 2011. Eurostars\nwas addressed or mentioned in 70 of the 849 position papers responding to the\nGreen Paper. The views were positive for more than 80 % of the responding organisations.\nThe few critical comments (10 %) mainly had to do with synchronisation\nissues. Other remarks focused on the fact that Member States\u2019 commitments were not\nalways honoured, on the harmonisation of funding rules, on the budget level and\nthe time to contract.\nThe Green Paper open consultation was\nfollowed up by two open Workshops on \u2018Innovation in Small and Medium\nEnterprises\u2019 in Brussels[13]\ninvolving 160 participants consisting of experts in both R&I and SME\nmatters coming from European and national SME and industry associations and representatives\nof Member States, governmental bodies and SME National Contact Points. The\nworkshop discussions led to two main conclusions on the scope of a future\nEurostars-2: firstly, Eurostars-2 should continue with the same target group (research-performing\nSMEs); secondly, there was no support among the workshop participants for the\nidea of enlarging the scope of Eurostars also to non-research-performing SMEs\nsince the number and size of national programmes supporting other kind of SMEs\n(such as research for the benefit of SMEs) was not sufficient to form a\ncritical mass and to set up a joint programme under Article 185 TFEU.\nPotential and actual final beneficiaries of\nprojects funded under Eurostars (SMEs and\nresearch institutes) and other stakeholders were also\nconsulted in the context of the interim evaluation by the Group of Independent\nExperts in 2010[14].\nThe group recommended continuing the programme subject to the improvements\nalong the lines indicated in the report.\nThe Commission discussed continuing to\nprovide EU support for Eurostars-2 in an Impact Assessment Steering Group (IASG)\ngathering different Commission departments in 2012. The IASG contributed to the\nplanning and roadmap for the preparation of the Impact Assessment Report\naccompanying this proposal, with special reference to the problem statement and\nthe relevance of the Eurostars Joint Programme to other EU policies.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The policy options\nThe Impact Assessment Report included the\nfollowing options:\nOption 1 \u2014 The business as usual (BAU)\noption (baseline)\nThis option corresponds to the continuation\nof the existing Eurostars Joint Programme during the next programming period\n(2014-2020) with its current format, implementation arrangements and overall\nbudget. The EU participation and financial contribution would be the same as\nfor Eurostars 1 (the EU financial contribution is up to \u20ac 100 million under\nFP7). This option is set as the baseline.\nOption 2 \u2014\nThe zero option (no EU involvement in Eurostars-2)\nUnder this option the EU participation and\nfinancial contribution to Eurostars would be stopped after the end of its\ncurrent funding phase (by the end of 2013). Member States would be left to\ndecide whether to continue Eurostars and to what extent to pursue the\nscientific, managerial and financial integration.\nOption 3 \u2014\nThe reinforced partnership option\nThe reinforced partnership option means\nthat the existing Eurostars Joint Programme would be continued in the next\nprogramming period as an Article 185 TFEU initiative in an improved format\nbased on full implementation of the recommendations made in the Interim Evaluation\nReport and with an enhanced degree of integration and on an extended scale.\nStrongly encouraged by the Commission departments,\nEureka member countries have agreed on specific measures to be implemented in\nEurostars-2 which will lead to a short time to contract, more standardisation\nof rules and processes, lean administration and higher synchronisation and\nintegration of funding. In order to enhance the programme and to support a greater\nnumber of research-intensive SMEs with growth potential, Member States committed\nto substantially increasing the financial volume of the programme. This\nresponds to the increasing demand from SMEs since the start of the programme\nand reflects the absorption capacity of the Eurostars target group. Consequently\nand in order to incentivise and support further the above-mentioned\nimprovements, the EU financial contribution would be raised accordingly.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Results of the ex-ante\nimpact assessment\nThe ex-ante impact assessment concluded\nthat Option 3 is the preferred option in view of its effectiveness in achieving\nthe objectives, its efficiency and its coherence across all criteria. This is\nfully supported by the stakeholders, since 99 % of the respondents to a\nsurvey addressed to all HLRs/NPCs in November 2012 (28 Eureka HLRs and/or NPCs\nfrom 22 Eureka member countries replied) considered the option of a \u2018New\nreinforced partnership\u2019 as very suitable and capable of bringing more impact in\n\u2018enhancing the competitiveness of R&D-performing SMEs\u2019.\nIn February 2012, the\nImpact Assessment Board reviewed and approved the Impact Assessment Report. In\nits Opinion it requested improvements to the report, and these have been taken\ninto account. In particular, the report now explains more clearly the policy\ncontext, the relations with other EU initiatives, the remaining problems and\nthe specific measures to address them and links them more closely to the\noptions. The objectives were revised to provide a solid basis for measuring the\nprogress achieved by Eurostars. Finally, the comparison of options in terms of\neffectiveness, efficiency and coherence was improved and the views of\nstakeholders better spelled out.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe proposal for Eurostars-2\nis based on Article 185 of the TFEU, which states that\nthe Union may make provision for the participation of the European Union in\nresearch and development programmes undertaken by several Member States,\nincluding participation in the structures created for the execution of those\nprogrammes.\nThe Horizon 2020 Communication[15] indicates that: \u2018partnership\napproaches on the basis of Articles 185 and 187 of the Treaty will also be\ncontinued\u2019.\nArticle 20(2)(b) of the proposal for a\nRegulation establishing Horizon 2020[16]\nlists a number of criteria for how public-public partnerships are to be\nidentified. Eurostars complies with those criteria: the \u2018Budapest document\u2019 on\nEurostars-2 endorsed by all Eureka countries provides (a) a clear definition of\nthe objectives to be pursued in conformity with the objectives of Horizon 2020\nand broader Union policy objectives indicated in section 1.1, (b) the financial\ncommitments of the participating countries, (c) the added value of action at\nUnion level as mentioned in section 3.2 and (d) the critical mass, with regard\nto the size and the number of national programmes involved.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\nproportionality principle\nThe subsidiarity principle applies as the\nproposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the European Union.\nSubsidiarity is safeguarded by basing the proposal on Article 185 TFEU, which\nexplicitly provides for the participation of the Union in research programmes\nundertaken by several Member States, whereby all operational aspects are\nimplemented where possible at national level, while ensuring a coherent\napproach at the European level of the joint programme.\nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States alone: the national research\nprogrammes supporting research-performing SMEs lack interoperability and\ncompatibility and only very few national programme cycles are synchronised and\nuse a joint international peer review.\nEurostars-2 respects the proportionality\nprinciple as the Member States themselves will be responsible for\nimplementation and all operational aspects. The role of the EU is limited to\nproviding incentives for improved coordination of participating programmes and\nharmonisation of rules and regulations, to the benefit of SMEs interested in\ntransnational R&D activities, and also ensuring synergy with relevant\ncomplementary activities in Horizon 2020.\nThe added value of the Union action is\nsignificant as the EU involvement will enable the creation of a new legal\nframework where EU and national funding can be pooled under a common strategy\nto stimulate transnational collaborative R&D projects initiated and led by research-performing\nSMEs. The pooling of resources from national programmes and from the EU enables\na critical mass to be achieved that can better address the challenges faced by research-performing\nSMEs. This would otherwise not be feasible using the existing structures in Horizon\n2020 and within national programmes. The Union\u2019s contribution shall be equal to\none third of thecontributions of the participating states.\nIn particular, the proposed organisational\nstructure keeps the administrative burden to a minimum, by having the main\nadministrative work carried out through national agencies under the supervision\nand overall responsibility of the common legal structure identified for this\npurpose.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instrument\nThe proposed instrument is a Decision by the\nEuropean Parliament and Council based on Article 185 of the TFEU.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Derogations from the Horizon\n2020 Rules for Participation\nThe proposal allows derogations from a\nnumber of Articles, namely Article 14(5) on the verification of the financial\ncapacity of applicant. Article 16(1) on grant agreements, Article 19 (1), (5)\nto (7) on the implementation of the action, Articles 22 to 28 on funding rules of\nthe action. Those derogations result from the breakdown of responsibilities\nbetween the ESE and the national funding agencies: the ESE is in charge of\nreceiving, distributing and monitoring the European Union contribution\nchannelled to the beneficiaries through the national funding agencies.\nThe main reason for it is that SMEs, the specific\ntarget group of Eurostars-2, in certain cases can feel more at ease with the well-known\nrules of the participating national funding programmes than EU rules. The administrative\nand legal barriers to the participation of these SMEs in transnational research\nand innovation activities is therefore lowered by the application of national\nfunding rules and the provision of the Union\u2019s financial contribution and the\ncorresponding national public support through one grant agreement.\nThe proposal provides appropriate\nsafeguards to guarantee respect for the principles of equal treatment and\ntransparency by the dedicated implementation structure when providing financial\nsupport to third parties, and in order to protect the financial interests of\nthe Union. It also provides for the inclusion of detailed provisions to this end\nin an agreement to be concluded between the Union and the dedicated\nimplementation structure, including strong pressure for the rapid progressive\nharmonisation and alignment of national programme rules.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe Legislative Financial Statement\npresented with this decision sets out the indicative budgetary implications.\nThe maximum Union\u2019s financial contribution, including EFTA appropriations, to\nEurostars-2 shall be EUR 287 million in current prices for the duration of the\nHorizon 2020 Framework Programme. The contributions will be made from the\nfollowing objective[17]\nunder Part II \u2018Industrial Leadership\u2019\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Innovation in SMEs\u2019 \nThe provisions of the Decision and of the\ndelegation agreement to be concluded between the Commission and the dedicated\nimplementation structure must ensure that the EU financial interests are\nprotected.\nLegislative Financial Statement presented\nwith this Decision sets out the indicative budgetary implications.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simplification\nThe proposal\nprovides for the simplification of administrative procedures for public\nauthorities (EU or national) and for private parties.\nIn\nparticular, recipients of the research funding from the new joint programme\nwill benefit from a single contracting and payment scheme using familiar\nnational rules without any need for separate reporting with regard to the Union\u2019s\ncontribution.\nThe EU will\ndeal directly with the dedicated implementation structure of Eurostars-2, which\nwill be in charge of allocating, monitoring and reporting on the use of the Union\u2019s\ncontribution.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review/revision/sunset\nclause\nThe proposal\nincludes a review clause for a mid-term review after three years. The overall\nduration will be limited to seven years.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European Economic Area\nThe proposed\nact concerns an EEA matter and should therefore extend to the European Economic\nArea.\n2013/0232 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the participation of the Union in a\nResearch and Development Programme jointly undertaken by several Member States\naimed at supporting research performing small and medium-sized enterprises \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 185 and the\nsecond paragraph of Article 188 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[18],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Communication\nEurope 2020 A Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth[19] the Commission underscores the\nneed to develop favourable conditions for investment in knowledge and\ninnovation so as to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the\nUnion. Both European Parliament and Council have endorsed this strategy.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Horizon 2020 \u2013 The\nFramework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) established by\nRegulation (EU) No \u2026/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026\n2013[20]\n(hereinafter \"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme\") aims at achieving a\ngreater impact on research and innovation by contributing to the strengthening\nof public-public partnerships, including through Union participation in\nprogrammes undertaken by several Member States in accordance with Article 185\nof the Treaty.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Decision No 743/2008/EC\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on the Community\u2019s\nparticipation in a research and development programme undertaken by several\nMember States aimed at supporting research and development performing small and\nmedium-sized enterprises[21],\nthe Community decided to make a financial contribution to Eurostars, a Joint\nProgramme undertaken by all Member States and five participating countries in\nthe framework of Eureka, an intergovernmental initiative established in 1985\nwith the objective of promoting cooperation in industrial research. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In April 2012, the\nCommission communicated to the European Parliament and the Council a report on\nthe Interim evaluation of Eurostars Joint Programme[22] carried out by a Group of\nIndependent Experts two years after the beginning of the programme. The overall\nopinion of the experts was that the Eurostars programme meets its objectives,\nadds value to European research-performing small and medium-sized enterprises\n(hereinafter \u2018SMEs\u2019) and should be continued after 2013. A number of\nrecommendations for improvement were made, mainly addressing the need of\nfurther integration of national programmes and improvements in the operational\nperformance in order to reach shorter time to contract and more transparency in\nthe procedures. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The definition of SME\nprovided for in Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003\nconcerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises[23] should\napply. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Council\nDecision 2013/\u2026/EU of \u2026 2013 establishing the Specific Programme implementing\nHorizon 2020 - The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)[24], support may be provided to an\naction building on the Eurostars Joint programme and reorienting it along the\nlines stated in its interim evaluation. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Eurostars-2 Programme\n(hereinafter \u201cEurostars-2\u201d), aligned with the Europe 2020 strategy, the related\nFlagship initiative \u2018Innovation Union\u2019[25]\nand \u2018A Reinforced European Research Area Partnership for Excellence and Growth\u2019[26] will aim at supporting\nresearch performing SMEs by co-financing their market oriented research\nprojects in any field. As such, and in combination with the activities under\nthe \u2018Leading and Enabling Technology\u2019 objective set out in the Horizon 2020\nFramework Programme, it will contribute to the goals of the Industrial\nLeadership part of that programme to speed-up development of the technologies\nand innovations that will underpin tomorrow\u2019s businesses and help innovative\nEuropean SMEs to grow into world-leading companies. As part of the improvements\nfrom the previous Eurostars programme, Eurostars-2 should head towards shorter\ntime to grant, stronger integration and lean, transparent and more efficient\nadministration to the ultimate benefit of research performing SMEs. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Eureka Ministerial\nConference on 22 June 2012 in Budapest endorsed a strategic vision for\nEurostars-2 (hereafter \u201cBudapest Document\u201d). The ministers committed to support\nthe continuation of the Eurostars Joint programme after its termination in 2013\nfor the period covered by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. This will\nconsist of a reinforced partnership addressing the recommendations of the\ninterim evaluation of the Eurostars Joint Programme. The Budapest Document sets\nout two main objectives for Eurostars-2. Firstly, a structural-oriented\nobjective to deepen the synchronisation and alignment of the national research\nprogrammes in the field of funding, which is a central element towards the\nrealisation of the European Research Area by the member countries. Secondly a\ncontent-related objective to support research performing SMEs engaging in\ntransnational research and innovation projects. The Budapest Document invites\nthe Union to participate in the programme.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The participating states\nintend to contribute to the implementation of Eurostars-2 during the period\ncovered by Eurostars-2 (2014-2024).\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A ceiling should be\nestablished for the Union\u2019s financial contribution to Eurostars-2 for the\nduration of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. Within that ceiling, the\nUnion\u2019s contribution should be equal to one third of the contribution of the\nparticipating states in order to ensure a critical mass necessary to satisfy\nthe demand from projects deserving financial support, to achieve a high\nleverage effect and ensure stronger integration of national research programmes\nof the participating states. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with the objectives\nof the Horizon2020 Framework Programme, any Member State and any country\nassociated to the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme should be entitled to\nparticipate in Eurostars-2.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union\u2019s financial\ncontribution should be subject to formal commitments from the participating\nstates to contribute to the implementation of Eurostars-2 and to the fulfilment\nof those commitments. Financial support under Eurostars-2 should mainly take\nthe form of grants to projects selected following calls for proposals launched\nunder the Eurostars-2. In order to meet the objectives of Eurostars-2, the\nparticipating states shall ensure sufficient financial contribution to fund a\nreasonable number of proposals selected through each call.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The joint implementation of\nEurostars-2 requires an implementation structure. The participating states have\nagreed on designating the Eureka Secretariat (hereinafter \u201cESE\u201d) as the\nimplementation structure for Eurostars-2. ESE is a non-profit international\nassociation under Belgian law and, since 2008, is responsible for the implementation\nof Eurostars. ESE\u2019s role goes beyond the implementation of Eurostars, being at\nthe same time the secretariat of the Eureka initiative, with its own governance\nlinked to the managing of Eureka projects outside of Eurostars. The Union,\nrepresented by the Commission, is a founding member of the Eureka initiative\nand full member of the Eureka Secretariat association. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve the\nobjectives of Eurostars-2, ESE should be in charge of the organisation of the calls\nfor proposals, the verification of the eligibility criteria, the peer-review\nevaluation and the selection and the monitoring of projects as well as the\nallocation of the Union contribution. The evaluation of proposals should be\nperformed centrally by independent external experts under the responsibility of\nESE following calls for proposals. The projects\u2019 ranking list should be binding\nfor the participating states as regards the allocation of funding from the\nUnion's financial contribution and from contribution from participating states.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overall the programme\nshould demonstrate a clear progress towards further alignment and\nsynchronisation of the national research and innovation programmes as a truly\nJoint Programme featuring stronger scientific, management and financial\nsynchronisation. Stronger scientific integration should be achieved through the\ncommon definition and implementation of activities and should ensure the\nexcellence and the high impact of the projects selected. Management integration\nshould ensure further improvement of operational excellence and accountability\nfor the programme. Stronger financial integration should be based on overall\nand yearly adequate financial contribution by the Eurostars-2 Participating\nStates and a high degree of national synchronisation. This should be achieved\nthrough a progressive harmonisation of national funding rules. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's financial\ncontribution should be managed in accordance with the principle of sound\nfinancial management and with the rules on indirect management set out in\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of 25 October 2012 of the European\nParliament and of the Council on the financial rules applicable to the general\nbudget of the Union[27]\nand Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the\nrules of application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012[28]. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to protect the\nUnion's financial interests, the Commission should have the right to reduce,\nsuspend or terminate the Union's financial contribution if Eurostars-2 is\nimplemented inadequately, partially or late, or if the participating states do\nnot contribute, or contribute partially or late, to the financing of\nEurostars-2. Those rights should be provided for in the delegation agreement to\nbe concluded between the Union and the ESE. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Participation in indirect\nactions funded by Eurostars-2 is subject to Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of \u20262013 laying down the rules for the\nparticipation and dissemination in 'Horizon 2020 \u2013 the Framework Programme for\nResearch and Innovation (2014-2020)[29].\nHowever, due to specific operating needs of Eurostars-2 it is necessary to\nprovide for derogations from that Regulation in accordance with Article 1(3) of\nthat Regulation [Rules for the participation and dissemination in Horizon\n2020].\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\nparticipation of SMEs which are more used to national channels and which would\notherwise carry out research activities only within their national boundaries,\nthe Eurostars-2 financial contribution should be provided in accordance with\nthe well-known rules of their national programmes and implemented through a\nfunding agreement directly administered by the national authorities, combining\nUnion funding with the corresponding national funding. Derogation should\ntherefore be made from Article 14(5), Articles 16(1), 19[(1), (5) to (7)], 22\nto 28 of Regulation (EU) No \u2026 [Rules for the participation and dissemination in\nHorizon 2020].\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Audits of recipients of\nUnion funds provided under Eurostars-2 should be carried out in accordance with\nRegulation (EU) No \u2026/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026\n2013 [the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme]. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's financial\ninterests should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the\nexpenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of\nirregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used\nand, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties in accordance\nwith Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\nconduct an interim evaluation assessing in particular the quality and\nefficiency of Eurostars-2 and progress towards the objectives set, as well as a\nfinal evaluation and prepare a report on those evaluations. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon request from the\nCommission, ESE and the participating states should submit any information the\nCommission needs to include in the reports on the evaluation of Eurostars-2. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of this\nDecision, namely to support transnational research activities performed by\nresearch-intensive SMEs and to contribute to the integration, alignment and\nsynchronisation of national research funding programmes cannot be sufficiently\nachieved by the Member States alone due to lack of transnational dimension and\nof complementarity and interoperability of national programmes and can\ntherefore, by reason of scale and impact of the action, be better achieved at\nUnion level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In\naccordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article,\nthis Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those\nobjectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Decision lays down rules on the participation of\nthe Union in the second Research and Development Programme jointly undertaken\nby several Member States aimed at supporting research performing small and\nmedium-sized enterprises (SME) (hereinafter \"Eurostars-2\") and the\nconditions for its participation. \nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Decision the\nfollowing definitions apply:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"SME\" mean micro-,\nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises, as defined in Commission\nRecommendation 2003/361/EC in the version of 6 May 2003;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"research performing\nSME\" is an SME which reinvests at least 10% of its turnover to research\nand development activities or dedicates at least 10% full-time equivalents to\nresearch and development activities.\nArticle 3\nObjectives\nEurostars-2 shall pursue the following\nobjectives:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 promote research activities that\ncomply with the following conditions:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the activities are carried out by\ntransnational collaboration of research-performing SMEs among themselves or\nincluding other actors of the innovation chain (e.g. universities, research\norganisations) \n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 results of activities are expected to\nbe introduced into the market within two years of the completion of an activity\n\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 increase the accessibility,\nefficiency and efficacy of public funding for SMEs in Europe by aligning,\nharmonising and synchronising the national funding mechanisms of participating\nstates\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 promote the participation of SMEs\nwithout previous experience in transnational research.\nArticle 4\nParticipation in Eurostars-2\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union shall\nparticipate in Eurostars-2 jointly undertaken by Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech\nRepublic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy,\nCyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands,\nAustria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the\nUnited Kingdom as well as Iceland, Israel, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey\n(hereinafter \u201cparticipating states\u201d), in accordance with the conditions set out\nin this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any other Member State and\nany other country associated to the Horizon 2020 \u2013The Framework Programme for\nResearch and Innovation (2014-2020) established by Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013 \u2026\n(hereinafter \u201cHorizon 2020 Framework Programme\u201d) may participate in Eurostars-2\nprovided it fulfils the condition set out in Article 6(1)(c) of this Decision.\nThose Member States and associated countries that fulfil that condition shall\nbe regarded as participating states for the purposes of this Decision.\nArticle 5\nUnion's\nfinancial contribution\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The maximum Union's\nfinancial contribution, including EFTA appropriations, to Eurostars-2 shall be\nEUR 287 million[30].\nThe contribution shall be paid from the appropriations in the general budget of\nthe Union allocated to the relevant parts of the Specific Programme\nimplementing the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, established by Decision \u2026\n/2013/EU in accordance with Article 58(1)(c)(vi), and Articles 60 and 61 of\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without exceeding the\nmaximum amount set out in paragraph 1, the Union's contribution shall be equal\nto one third of the contributions of the participating states referred to in\nArticle 7 (1)(a).
