The overall objectives of EMPIR are\nto:\n\u00b7       \nProvide integrated and fit-for-purpose metrology\nsolutions supporting innovation and industrial competitiveness and measurement\ntechnologies to tackle societal challenges such as health, environment and\nenergy including support to policy development and implementation;\n\u00b7       \nCreate an integrated European Metrology Research\nsystem with critical mass and active engagement at regional, national, European\nand international level.\n1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the proposal\nMetrology, the science of measurement, is\nthe central nerve in the spine of our high-tech world. Every aspect of our\ndaily lives is affected by metrology and ever more precise and reliable\nmeasurements are essential to drive innovation and economic growth within our\nknowledge-based economy. What we cannot measure, we do not understand properly,\nand cannot control, manufacture or process reliably. Thus, advances in\nmetrology have a profound impact on our understanding of and ability to shape\nthe world around us.\nReliable and traceable measurement allows\nthe wider scientific community to build better instruments and do better\nscience. It opens up new territory for industry, creating space and opportunity\nto innovate. It crucially underpins and advances understanding and agreement in\nglobal challenges such as energy, health care and climate change.\nAll governments in technologically advanced\ncountries support a metrology infrastructure because of the benefits it brings\nand its strong character as a public good that justifies public intervention.\nMajor economic powers in the world are increasing their investment in metrology\nresearch and related infrastructures. Given the level of investment in\nmetrology and its role in promoting scientific excellence and industrial\ncompetitiveness, individual Member States or a few acting together could not\ncompete globally.\nThe current European metrology research\nprogramme (EMRP) is a joint initiative[1]\nimplemented by 22 national metrology institutes. It is based on Article 185 of\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which, in\nimplementing the multiannual Framework Programme, makes it possible to\ncoordinate national research programmes. The interim evaluation has recognised\nthe value of the initiative. The main achievement of EMRP is strong integration\nby jointly programming 50 % of dedicated national funding for metrology\nresearch in Europe. It has reduced fragmentation, avoided unnecessary\nduplication and helped achieve critical mass by concentrating resources on key\nareas through close collaboration with the best researchers. EMRP projects\ndeliver European measurement solutions for major societal challenges and\nprovide common European inputs into standards and regulations.\nAlthough substantial progress has been\nachieved under the EMRP, it has become evident that the system needs to tackle\nseveral challenges in order to increase the impact of metrology research on\ngrowth and on solving socio-economic challenges.\nEMPIR, the successor programme, will\ncontribute to a number of flagship initiatives under EUROPE 2020 that are\naffected by metrology research, including \u2018Innovation Union\u2019, \u2018A digital agenda\nfor Europe\u2019, \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019 and \u2018An industrial policy for the\nglobalisation era\u2019. It will do this by developing innovative solutions for the\nmanagement of natural resources, by supporting the standardisation process that\nenables global trade opportunities for new products and services and by\nallowing the efficient testing of communication satellites, for example. EMPIR\nwill strongly contribute to achieving the objectives of Horizon 2020 by\nsupporting topics of direct relevance for a number of Horizon 2020 priorities.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation on the future\nof the European Metrology Research Programme\nThe Commission has carried out extensive\nconsultations on a future European Metrology Research Programme. 624 respondents reacted to the online public\nconsultation carried out in 2012. They expressed\ntheir views on the relevance of metrology research, identified problems the\nEuropean Metrology Research system is facing and assessed a number of policy\noptions. 72 % of responses came from organisations and 28 % from\nindividuals. The main contributions from organisations were received from\nresearch organisations (32 %) and businesses (16 %, of which 69 %\nSMEs). The consultation highlighted a number of problems, including\ninsufficient industrial exploitation, the lack of cooperation of National\nMetrology Institutes (NMIs) with the wider science base, huge capacity gaps\nbetween EU Member States, insufficient mobility of researchers within the NMIs and\nthe lack of engagement with European standardisation.\nAn expert panel\ncarried out an interim evaluation of the EMRP after three years of running of\nthe programme. The Commission adopted its report in April 2012. The interim\nevaluation recognised the value of the initiative and indicated considerable\nprogress on coordination of research. The Panel shared the view that \u2018EMRP\nis a well-managed joint European research programme that has already achieved a\nrelatively high level of scientific, management and financial integration after\nonly two years of implementation.\u2019 and that \u2018EMRP has certainly been\nsuccessful in creating a Metrology ERA (European Research Area)\u2019.\nThe interim\nevaluation was more critical of the lack of progress on opening the system to\nthe best science and capacity building structures. It suggested introducing\ndedicated instruments to support innovation and regulatory/standardisation\nroadmaps in any future initiative to increase the socio-economic impacts of metrology research.\nThe Commission also consulted its services\nthrough the Impact Assessment Steering Group meetings in 2012, which\ncontributed to the plan and roadmap for the preparation of the impact\nassessment report, in particular the problem statement and the relevance of the\nEMPIR to other Directorate Generals of the European Commission.\n2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The policy options\nThe final version of the impact\nassessment report included the following options:\nUnder Option 1 (\u2018No\ndedicated EU action\u2019), EU participation in the EMRP would be discontinued after\nthe end of its current funding phase in 2013. No dedicated provision would be\nmade in EU research policies, programmes or funding to support EMRP objectives.\nAccess to EU funding would be limited to competition for ad-hoc project funding\nthrough Horizon 2020 for topics that include aspects of metrology.\nOption 2 (\u2018Business\nas usual \u2014 EMRP2\u2019) would continue with an identical initiative focused entirely\non coordination and integration of fundamental and challenge driven research.\nThis would include some calls on topics relevant to the industry.\nOption 3 (\u2018Improved\nArticle 185 initiative \u2014 EMPIR\u2019 would build on the success of the EMRP by\nimplementing a more ambitious and inclusive Article 185 initiative that is\naligned with the Europe 2020 objectives. The scope of the programme would be\nbroadened by including dedicated modules on industrial research and\nexploitation, on support for standardisation and on capacity building. Due to\nthe change of scope, the name of the programme would change from \u2018European\nMetrology Research programme\u2019 to European Metrology Programme for Research and\nInnovation\u2019. This option would also involve the stakeholders more and also\ndirectly involve the broader research community. The level of EU financing from\nHorizon 2020 would increase compared to FP7 due to the resources needed to compensate\nfor the increased scope and the increased duration of the programme. The number\nof participating states would increase from 22 to [28].\n2.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Results of the impact\nassessment\nThe impact assessment\nreport concluded that Option 3 is clearly the preferred option, considering its\neffectiveness in achieving the objectives, efficiency and consistency across\nall criteria. This is fully supported by the results of the public consultation\n(93 % of responses rate the option \u2018very suitable\u2019 or \u2018appropriate\u2019). The option\nwill build on the previous achievements of EMRP by continuing the current\nactivities while integrating additional activities right from the start to\naddress the problems that could not be addressed under the setup of the current\ninitiative. In February 2013, the Impact Assessment Board reviewed and approved\nthe report. In its opinion it requested improvements of the impact assessment\nreport, which have been taken into account. In particular, the report now\nbetter explains the specific problems, the underlying drivers and the relation\nbetween objectives and targets. The description of the new programme compared\nto the current initiative was improved in order to better clarify how the new\nprogramme will tackle the identified weaknesses.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe proposal for EMPIR is based on Article\n185 of the TFEU, concerning the participation of the European Union in research\nand development programmes undertaken by several Member States, including\nparticipation in the structures created for the execution of those programmes.\n3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle\nThe subsidiarity principle applies as the\nproposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the European Union.\nSubsidiarity is safeguarded by basing the proposal on Article 185 of the TFEU,\nwhich explicitly provides for the participation of the Union in research\nprogrammes undertaken by several Member States.\nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States alone as the scale and complexity of\nmetrology requirements require investments that go beyond the core research\nbudgets of the European NMIs. The excellence required for research and\ndevelopment of cutting-edge metrology solutions is spread across national\nborders and hence cannot be brought together at national level only. Without a\nconsistent approach at European level with critical mass, there is a high risk\nof duplication of efforts, with the consequence of increased costs.\nThe added-value of public intervention at\nEU level lies in the EU\u2019s capacity to bring together compartmentalised national\nresearch programmes, help design common research and funding strategies across\nnational borders, and achieve a critical mass of actors and investments\nrequired to tackle the challenges the metrology research system faces, while\nraising the efficiency of public spending. The EU is expected to contribute 50 %\nof total funding.\n3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\nArt. 185 of the TFEU invites the Union to\n\u201cmake provision, in agreement with the Member States concerned, for\nparticipation in research and development programmes undertaken by several\nMember States, including participation in the structures created for the\nexecution of those programmes\u201d. Member States are the driving force of the\ninitiative.\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle as Member States will be responsible for developing\ntheir joint programme and all operational aspects. The dedicated implementation\nstructure EURAMET e.V. has already demonstrated for the current initiative\nEMRP that it can implement the programme efficiently and effectively. The Union\nwill provide incentives for improved coordination, ensure synergies with and\ncontribution to EU policies and to the priorities of Horizon 2020, monitor\nimplementation of the programme and ensure the protection of the EU\u2019s financial\ninterests.\n3.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of the instrument\nThe proposed initiative EMPIR will be based\non Article 185 of the TFEU. The conclusions of the interim evaluation and an\nanalysis of the options in the impact assessment have demonstrated that Article\n185 is the most appropriate means for achieving the objectives of EMPIR.\n3.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Derogations from the rules\nfor participation\nIn EMPIR, funding contributed by\nparticipating states mainly represents resources allocated as direct\nexpenditure in the selected projects via institutional funding of the National\nMetrology Institutes (NMI) and Designated Institutes (DI) participating in the\nprojects. Institutional funding of the NMI and DI covers the share of their overheads allocated to the projects\n(indirect costs of the projects) and not reimbursed in EMPIR. \nThe EU contribution for NMI and DI must\nmatch the contribution made by the participating states, taking into account\nnot only the institutional funding as described above, but also the cash\ncontribution of participating states to the administrative costs (up to EUR 30\nmillion) and the proportion of Union funding allocated to other entities (about\nEUR 90 million). It is therefore expected that the EU contribution for NMI and\nDI will be EUR 210 million (43,75%) and the contribution from participating\nstates to NMI and DI will be EUR 270 million (56,25%).\nCompliance with the matching principle will\nbe ensured by adapting the EU contribution and setting a lower flat rate for the\nEU financing of indirect costs for NMI and DI compared to that set by the\nHorizon 2020 Rules for Participation. Considering that data from NMI and DI\nparticipating in EMRP projects on the basis of full indirect costs show that\ntheir indirect eligible costs amount to 140% of the direct eligible costs of\nthe projects in accordance with FP7 rules for participation, NMIs and DIs will\ndeclare indirect eligible costs on the basis of a flat rate of 5% of their\ndirect eligible costs. Other legal entities participating in the projects will\nbe funded according to Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation.\nThis entails derogation from Article 24 for\nNMI and DI.\nThe proposal provides safeguards to ensure\nthat the principles of equal treatment and transparency are respected by the\ndedicated implementation structure when providing financial support to third\nparties, and the EU\u2019s financial interests are protected. It also provides for\ndetailed provisions to this effect in an agreement to be concluded by the Union\nand the dedicated implementation structure.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe Legislative Financial Statement\npresented with this decision sets out the indicative budgetary implications.\nThe maximum Union\u2019s financial contribution, including EFTA appropriations, to EMPIR\nshall be EUR 300 million in current prices for the duration of the Horizon 2020\nFramework Programme. The contributions will be made from the following\nchallenges and themes[2]:\n\u00b7                        \nLeadership in nanotechnologies, advanced\nmaterials, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (EUR 52,5\nmillion)\n\u00b7                        \nLeadership in information and communications\ntechnology (EUR 37,5 million)\n\u00b7                        \nImproving lifelong health and wellbeing (EUR 60\nmillion)\n\u00b7                        \nImproving food security, developing sustainable\nagriculture, marine and maritime research and the bio-economy (EUR 15 million)\n\u00b7                        \nMaking the transition to a reliable, sustainable\nand competitive energy system (EUR 60 million)\n\u00b7                        \nAchieving a European transport system that is\nresource-efficient, environmentally friendly, safe and seamless (EUR 22,5\nmillion)\n\u00b7                        \nAchieving a resource-efficient and climate\nchange resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (EUR 52,5\nmillion)\nThe provisions of the Decision and of the\ndelegation agreement to be concluded between the Commission and the dedicated\nimplementation structure must ensure that the EU financial interests are\nprotected.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n5.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simplification\nThe proposal will simplify the\nadministrative procedures for public authorities and bodies (EU or national)\nand for private parties.\nThe EU will deal directly with the\ndedicated implementation structure of EMPIR, which will be in charge of\nallocating, monitoring and reporting on the use of the EU\u2019s contribution.\n5.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review/revision/sunset\nclause\nThe proposal includes a review clause for\nan interim review not later than 2018.\n5.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European Economic Area\nThe proposed act concerns an EEA matter and\nshould therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n2013/0242 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the participation of the Union in a\nEuropean Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research jointly undertaken by\nseveral Member States\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 185 and the second\nparagraph of Article 188 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\nEconomic and Social Committee[3],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Communication Europe\n2020 A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth[4] the Commission underscores the\nneed to develop favourable conditions for investment in knowledge and\ninnovation so as to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the\nUnion. Both European Parliament and Council have endorsed that strategy.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Horizon 2020 - The\nFramework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) established by Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of \u2026 2013[5]\n(hereinafter \"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme\") aims at achieving a greater impact on\nresearch and innovation by contributing to the strengthening of public-public\npartnerships, including through Union participation in programmes undertaken by\nseveral Member States in accordance with Article 185 of the Treaty. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Decision No 912/2009/EC\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on the\nparticipation by the Community in a European metrology research and development\nprogramme undertaken by several Member States[6],\nthe Community decided to make a financial contribution to the European\nMetrology Research Programme (hereinafter \"EMRP\") matching that of\nthe participating states but not exceeding EUR 200 million, for the duration of\nthe Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research,\ntechnological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013) established\nby Decision No 1982/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18\nDecember 2006[7].\n\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In April 2012, the\nCommission communicated to the European Parliament and the Council a report on\nInterim Evaluation of the European Metrology Research Programme \u2013 EMRP[8]. That evaluation was carried\nout by an expert panel three years after the beginning of the programme. The\noverall opinion of the expert panel was that EMRP is a well-managed joint\nEuropean research programme that has already achieved a relatively high level\nof scientific, management and financial integration. The expert panel noted,\nhowever, limited industrial exploitation, limited opening to excellent science\noutside the metrology institutes and insufficient capacity building. The expert\npanel was also of the opinion that a more inclusive European metrology research\narea could be built by implementing EMRP.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Council\nDecision \u2026 /2013/EU of \u2026 2013 establishing the Specific Programme implementing\nHorizon 2020 - The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)[9] further support may be provided\nto the European Metrology Research Programme.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Metrology\nProgramme for Innovation and Research (hereinafter \"EMPIR\"), aligned\nwith the Europe 2020 strategy and the related flagship initiatives, in\nparticular \u2018Innovation Union\u2019[10],\n\u2018A Digital Agenda for Europe\u2019[11],\n\u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019[12]\nand \u2018An industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era\u2019[13], will be a more ambitious and\ninclusive programme implemented for ten years (2014-2024) by [28] participating states. As part of the\nimprovements from the previous programme, EMPIR will include activities on\ninnovation and industrial exploitation, on research for norms and standards and\non capacity building. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The participating states\nintend to contribute to implement EMPIR during the period covered by EMPIR\n(2014-2024). \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A ceiling should be\nestablished for the Union\u2019s participation in EMPIR for the duration of the\nHorizon 2020 Framework Programme. Within that ceiling, the Union contribution\nshould be equal to the contribution of the participating states to EMPIR in\norder to achieve a high leverage effect and ensure a stronger integration of\nparticipating states programmes.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with the\nobjectives of Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013, any Member State and any country\nassociated to the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme should be entitled to\nparticipate in EMPIR.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union\u2019s financial\ncontribution should be subject to formal commitments from the participating\nstates to contribute to the implementation of EMPIR and fulfilment of those\ncommitments. Participating states\u2019 contributions to EMPIR should include a contribution\nto administrative costs within a ceiling of 5% of the budget of EMPIR. Participating\nstates should commit to increase, if necessary, their contribution to EMPIR by\na reserve funding capability of 50 % to ensure that they are able to fund their\nnational entities (National Metrology Institutes and Designated Institutes)\nparticipating in the selected projects. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The joint implementation of\nEMPIR requires an implementation structure. The participating states have\nagreed on the implementation structure for EMRP and set up in 2007 EURAMET e.V.\n(hereinafter \"EURAMET\"), the European Regional Metrology Organisation\nand a non-profit association under German law. EURAMET also has tasks and\nobligations related to the wider European and global harmonisation of\nmetrology. Membership of EURAMET is open to all European National Metrology\nInstitutes (NMI), as members, and to Designated Institutes (DI), as associates.\nMembership in EURAMET is not conditional upon existence of national metrology\nresearch programmes. Given that, according to the Report on Interim Evaluation\nof EMRP, the governance structure of EURAMET has proved to be efficient and of\nhigh quality for the implementation of the EMRP, EURAMET should also be used\nfor the implementation of EMPIR. EURAMET should be the recipient of\nthe Union\u2019s financial contribution. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve the\nobjectives of EMPIR, EURAMET should provide financial support mainly in the\nform of grants to participants in actions selected at the level of EURAMET. Those\nactions should be selected following calls for proposals under the\nresponsibility of EURAMET. The ranking list should be binding as regards the\nselection of proposals and the allocation of funding from the Union\u2019s financial\ncontribution and from the contributions from participating states for EMPIR\nprojects. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union\u2019s financial\ncontribution should be managed in accordance with the principle of sound\nfinancial management and with the rules on indirect management set out in\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of\nthe Union[14]\nand Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the\nrules of application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012[15].\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to protect the\nUnion's financial interests, the Commission should have the right to reduce,\nsuspend or terminate the Union\u2019s financial contribution if EMPIR is implemented\ninadequately, partially or late, or if the participating states do not\ncontribute, or contribute partially or late, to the financing of EMPIR. Those\nrights should be provided for in the delegation agreement to be concluded\nbetween the Union and EURAMET. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Participation in indirect\nactions funded by EMPIR is subject to Regulation (EU) No \u2026 /2013 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 2013 laying down the rules for the\nparticipation and dissemination in 'Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for\nResearch and Innovation (2014-2020)'[16].\nHowever, due to specific operating needs of EMPIR it is necessary to provide\nfor derogations from that Regulation in accordance with Article 1(3) of that Regulation\n[Rules for the participation and dissemination in Horizon 2020].\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The contribution from\nparticipating states mainly represents institutional funding of the NMI and DI\nparticipating in the selected projects. The contribution from participating\nstates should also include a cash contribution to the administrative costs of\nEMPIR. A proportion of the Union\u2019s contribution should be allocated to entities\nother than NMI and DI participating in the selected projects. The calculation\nof the Union\u2019s financial contribution for NMI and DI participating in EMPIR\nprojects should ensure that the Union\u2019s contribution to EMPIR does not exceed\nthe contribution of the participating states. Considering that the\ninstitutional funding of the NMI and DI by participating states corresponds to\nthe overheads allocated to the EMPIR projects and not reimbursed by the Union\u2019s\ncontribution, the flat rate for the financing of the eligible indirect costs of\nthe NMI and DI should be adapted compared to that set in the Regulation (EU) No\n\u2026 /2013 [laying down the rules for the participation and dissemination in\n\u2018Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation\n(2014-2020)\u2019]. This flat rate should be determined on the basis of the full\nindirect costs declared as eligible by NMI and DI participating in EMRP\nprojects, which are stable and constitute a reliable approximation of the\nindirect costs to be incurred by NMI and DI participating in EMPIR projects.\nSince those indirect costs amount to 140% of the total direct eligible costs of\nNMI and DI, except those for subcontracting and in kind contributions free of\ncharge not used on their premises, the flat rate for the financing of indirect\ncosts of NMI and DI should be lowered from [20%] in accordance with Regulation\n(EU) No \u2026 /2013 to 5%. It is thus appropriate to provide for derogation from\nArticle 24 of that Regulation for NMI and DI. Other entities participating in\nEMPIR projects should be funded in accordance with that Regulation. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appropriateness of the\nfunding model with regard to the matching principle between Union and non-Union\nfunds should be re-assessed at the time of the interim evaluation of EMPIR.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Audits of recipients of\nUnion funds provided in accordance with this Decision should ensure a reduction\nof administrative burden, in compliance with Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013\n[the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme]. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union\u2019s financial\ninterests should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the\nexpenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of\nirregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used\nand, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties in accordance\nwith Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\nconduct an interim evaluation assessing in particular the quality and\nefficiency of EMPIR, progress towards the objectives set and a final evaluation\nand prepare a report on those evaluations. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon request from the\nCommission, EURAMET and the participating states should submit any information\nthe Commission needs to include in the reports on the evaluation of EMPIR. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of the\ndecision is the Union participation in EMPIR, namely to support the provision\nof appropriate, integrated and fit-for-purpose metrology solutions and the\ncreation of an integrated European Metrology Research system with critical mass\nand active engagement at regional, national, European and international level\nthat cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone. The scale and\ncomplexity of metrology requirements calls for investments that go beyond the\ncore research budgets of the National Metrology Institutes and their Designated\nInstitutes. The excellence required for research and development of\ncutting-edge metrology solutions is spread across national borders and hence\ncannot be brought together at national level only. Since the objective can\ntherefore be better achieved at Union level by integrating national efforts\ninto a consistent European approach, by bringing together compartmentalised\nnational research programmes, by helping design common research and funding\nstrategies across national borders, and by achieving the critical mass of\nactors and investments required, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance\nwith the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out\nin that Article, this decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\nachieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nParticipation in the European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union shall\nparticipate in the European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research\n(hereinafter \"EMPIR\") jointly undertaken by Belgium, Bulgaria, the\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France,\nCroatia, Italy, Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania,\nSlovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, as well as [Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland and Turkey] (hereinafter \"participating\nstates\"), in accordance with the conditions set out in this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any other Member State and\nany other country associated to the Horizon 2020 - The Framework Programme for\nResearch and Innovation (2014-2020) established by Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013 \u2026 (hereinafter\n\"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme\") may participate in EMPIR provided\nit fulfils the condition set out in Article 3(1)(c) of this Decision.

measurement\ntechnologies addressing societal challenges such as health, environment and\nenergy including support to policy development and implementation.\n(2) Create an integrated European Metrology Research system with\ncritical mass and active engagement at regional, national, European and\ninternational level.\n1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific objective(s) and\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\nThe main operational objective of this legislative proposal,\nnamely the Union\u2019s participation in a Joint R&D and Innovation Programme\nundertaken between several Member States in the field of metrology, is already\nprovided for in the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for RTD.\nThe specific objective associated with this operational objective is\nthe establishment and operation of EMPIR with R&D projects as the main\noutput.\n1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected result(s) and\nimpact\nSpecify the effects\nwhich the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\nEMPIR will combine Union and national investments\nin metrology research in order to provide appropriate, integrated and fit-for-purpose\nmetrology solutions supporting innovation and industrial competitiveness as\nwell as measurement technologies addressing societal challenges such as health,\nenvironment and energy.\nThis will support the creation of an integrated\nEuropean Metrology Research system with critical mass and active engagement at\nregional, national, European and international level.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\nimpact\nSpecify the\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nThe following results are expected that will be measured through\nrelated indicators:\nBoost industrial uptake and improve standardisation\nIndicators: (a) turnover from new or significantly improved products\nand services that can be attributed to the research activities of EMPIR and its\npredecessors [target: EUR 400 million], (b) share of industry-driven research\nprojects [target: 20 %], (c) value of business investment in EMPIR\nprojects, (d) share of dedicated normative research [target: 10 %], (e)\nCEN/CENELEC/ISO/IEC Technical Committees and equivalent standardisation bodies\nwith potential to benefit directly from EMPIR projects engaging with the\nprogramme.\nUnderpin a coherent, sustainable and integrated European metrology\nlandscape to fully exploit the EU potential.\nIndicators: (f) share of dedicated national metrology research\ninvestments in Europe coordinated or influenced via the programme [target: 50 %],\n(g) participation of non-NMI/DI scientists in the programme [target: double\ncompared to EMRP] (h) level of investments from Structural Funds and other\nEuropean, national or regional programmes in metrology-related activities (i)\nEuropean leadership in international metrology committees.\nProgramme efficiency\nIndicators: (j) quality of the proposal submission, evaluation and\nselection procedure, (k) time to grant, (l) running costs for operating EMPIR\n[target: \u2264 5 %].\nSignificant socio-economic benefits and contribution to key

the\nproposal/initiative\n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term\nEMPIR will combine Union and national resources and ensure that\nmetrology research has a greater impact on growth and solving socio-economic\nchallenges and address the on-going fragmentation and structural weaknesses of\nthe European metrology research and innovation system.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nThe added-value of public intervention at EU level lies in the EU\u2019s\ncapacity to bring together compartmentalised national research programmes, help\ndesign common research and funding strategies across national borders, and\nachieve a critical mass of actors and investments required to tackle the\nchallenges the metrology research system is facing while raising the efficiency\nof public spending.\nEMPIR will enhance measurement capabilities with strategic impact\nfor Europe. This will be done in a coherent and non-fragmented way with higher\ncritical mass and lead to more cost-effective and interoperable solutions.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe interim evaluation of the predecessor EMRP operated under FP7\nidentified certain shortcomings that have been addressed in the design of EMPIR\n(Dedicated support to innovation, standardisation, capacity building and\nopening the programme to the best science).\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nEMPIR will contribute to a number of flagship initiatives under\nEUROPE 2020 which are affected by metrology research, including \u2018Innovation\nUnion\u2019, \u2018A digital agenda for Europe\u2019, \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019 and \u2018An\nindustrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019.\nEMPIR will strongly contribute to achieving the objectives of Horizon\n2020 by supporting topics of direct relevance to Horizon 2020 priorities.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact\nX Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration\n\u2013     \nProposal/initiative in effect from 1/1/2014 to\n31/12/2024\n\u2013     \nFinancial impact from 2014 to 2020 for commitment\nappropriations and 2014 \u2013 2024 for payment appropriations\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged[21]\n\u00a8 Centralised direct management by the Commission\nX Centralised indirect management\nwith the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[22]\n\u2013     \nX\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with\npublic-service mission\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States\n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries\n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\nComments\nA dedicated\nimplementation structure entitled EURAMET (hereinafter EURAMET) has been\nestablished and is governed by the participating states for managing the\ninitiative.
