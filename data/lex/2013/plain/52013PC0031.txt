In the same vein, the Commission adopted on 6 June 2012 the\nCommunication on strengthening the governance of the single market, which\nlikewise stresses the importance of the transport sector[3].\nIn the last decade, the EU railway market\nhas seen massive changes, gradually introduced by three legislative \u2018railway\npackages\u2019 (with some accompanying acts) intended to open up the national\nmarkets and make railways more competitive and interoperable at the EU level,\nwhile maintaining high level of safety. However, despite the considerable\ndevelopment of the \u2018EU acquis\u2019 establishing an internal market for rail\ntransport services, the modal share of rail in intra-EU transport has remained\nmodest. Therefore the Commission has planned to come forward with the Fourth\nRailway Package in order to enhance the quality and efficiency of rail services\nby removing the remaining market obstacles. The present Directive is a\ncomponent of the Fourth Railway Package focusing on the removal of remaining\nadministrative and technical barriers, in particular by establishing a common\napproach to safety and interoperability rules to increase economies of scale\nfor railway undertakings active across the EU, decreasing administrative costs\nand accelerating administrative procedures, as well as to avoiding disguised\ndiscrimination.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal framework for rail\nsafety\nIn order to pursue efforts to establish a\nsingle market for rail transport services, it is necessary to establish a\ncommon regulatory framework for railway safety. Member States have until now\ndeveloped their safety rules and standards mainly on national lines, based on\nnational technical and operational concepts. Simultaneously, differences in\nprinciples, approach and culture have made it difficult to break through the technical\nbarriers and establish international transport operations.\nDirective 91/440/EEC, Council Directive\n95/18/EC of 19 June 1995 on the licensing of railway undertakings[4] and Directive 2001/14/EC of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2001 on the\nallocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for\nthe use of railway infrastructure and safety certification[5] was a first steps towards\nregulation of the European rail transport market by opening the market for international\nrail freight services. However, the provisions on safety proved to be\ninsufficient and differences between safety requirements among the Member\nStates affected the optimum functioning of rail transport in the EU.\nDirective 2004/49/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on Safety on the Community\u2019s\nrailways and amending Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway\nundertakings and Directive 2001/14/EC on the allocation of railway\ninfrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway\ninfrastructure and safety certification[6],\nrepresented a great improvement towards establishment of a common regulatory\nframework for railway safety. The Directive established a framework for\nharmonising the content of safety rules, safety certification of railway\nundertakings, the tasks and roles of the safety authorities and the\ninvestigation of accidents, to discourage Member States from continuing to\ndevelop on national lines their safety rules and standards based on national\ntechnical and operational concepts.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why amend Directive\n2004/49/EC?\nArticle 10 (7) of Directive 2004/49/EC\nprescribes that \u2018Before 30 April 2009 the Agency shall evaluate the development\nof safety certification and submit a report to the Commission with\nrecommendations on a strategy for migration towards a single Community safety\ncertificate\u2019 replacing the current two part system (Part A/B). Single EU safety\ncertificate development and implementation has always been a long term objective.\nIt was never a question of if but when it would be introduced.\nIn its interim report of 2009, the European\nRailway Agency, hereafter \u201cthe Agency\u201d, explained that it was too early to make\na recommendation and that more information was needed in order to ensure an\ninformed debate. The Agency submitted a report in July 2012 with a Recommendation\nproposing a strategy for the migration[7].\nFollowing the Recommendation of the Agency,\nthe Commission considers that the current regulatory framework is sufficiently\nmature to migrate progressively towards a \u2018single safety certificate\u2019. With\nthis objective, the role of the national safety authorities needs to be revised\nand the responsibilities reallocated between them and the Agency.\nThe revision of the Railway Safety\nDirective is also an opportunity to adapt the text to take into account the\nevolution of the railway market where new professional actors or entities have\nbeen created. The lessons from severe railway accidents show that these actors\nmay assume important responsibilities in matter of safety. In the past, the\nvertically integrated railway undertakings were able to control internally the\nquality of all processes, such as the maintenance of rolling stock or loading\noperations. The present trend of outsourcing activities or services is leading\nto the emergence of new actors subject to increasing economic and financial\npressure, while internal control is decreasing. This may have consequences for\nsafety, unless a new way of monitoring is established, through contractual or\nother arrangements, to ensure that risk control measures are duly implemented\nby all relevant actors.\nAnother important reason for amending the\ntext concerns the national rules addressing safety concerns. A Task Force on\nthis subject was established and its findings are taken into account in this\nproposal. \nOther\namendments of the text are related to:\n\u00b7       \nClarification of existing provisions and new\ndefinitions: aimed to improve consistency with similar provisions used in the\nDirective XX on the interoperability of the rail system within the European\nUnion (hereinafter the \u2018Interoperability Directive\u2019).\n\u00b7       \nUpdates due to the evolution of the legislative\nframework: provisions concerning national rules, as well as references to\ncomitology procedures and delegated acts.\n\u00b7       \nEditorial changes: consolidation of previous\namendments in the text of the Directive, renumbering of articles and annexes,\nelimination of obsolete provisions and references to other component of the\nFourth Railway Package.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nDG MOVE prepared an impact assessment to\nsupport legislative proposals on improving efficiency and competitiveness of\nthe Single European Railway Area in the field of interoperability and safety.\nAn Impact Assessment Steering Group (IASG)\nwas created in June 2011. All DGs were invited to participate, however the main\ninterested services are DGs ENTR, EMPL, SG, SJ, HR, RTD, BUDG, REGIO, ENER and\nELARG.\nThe Commission services have discussed the\ndevelopments of Single European Railway Area with sector representatives on an\non-going basis. In 2010-2011 it conducted also an ex post evaluation of\nRegulation 881/2004 establishing the Agency.\nIn order to support the Commission in the\nimpact assessment process, an external consultant was tasked to prepare an\nimpact assessment support study and to undertake a targeted consultation of\nstakeholders.\nThe targeted consultation of interested\nparties started on 18 November 2011 with an internet survey which finished on\n30 December 2011. It was followed by interviews with the most significant\nstakeholders and stakeholder workshop in February 2012.\nGiven the technical nature of the\ninitiative, no public consultation was carried out. However, the Commission has\ntaken care that all interested parties have been consulted in due time and\ndiscussions have covered all the key elements of the initiative.\nMore information on the impact assessment\nand the results of the stakeholder consultation is provided in the Impact Assessment\nReport[8].\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThis section provides detailed comments and\nexplanations concerning the significant changes in the text of the Directive.\nEditorial changes and obvious modifications are not commented.\nCHAPTER I\nArticle 1: no comments.\nArticle 2: adaptation of the scope to make\nit consistent with the \u2018Interoperability Directive\u2019.\nArticle 3: new definitions and a few\namendments to improve consistency with similar definitions used in the\nInteroperability Directive.\nCHAPTER II\nArticle 4: clarification on role and\nresponsibilities of the players in the railway chain to take into account to\nrecent evolution of the market and of the legal framework.\nArticles 5, 6 and 7: updates due to the\nevolution of the legal framework.\nArticle 8: adaptation of the provisions\nrelated to national rules to take into account the evolution of the legal\nframework (adoption of TSI) and alignment with the Interoperability Directive.\nArticle 9: no comments.\nCHAPTER III\nArticle 10: introduction of the system of\nsingle safety certificate for railways undertakings replacing the former system\nof safety certificate and its two parts : \u2018Part A\u2019 and \u2018Part B\u2019.\nArticle 11: former Article 11 adapted to\nthe process of move towards a single safety certificate taking into account the\nnew role of the Agency.\nArticle 12: former Article 11 without major\nchanges\nArticle 13: no comments.\nArticle 14 and 15: re-numbering of the\nformer Article 14a updated.\nFormer Article 15: obsolete.\nCHAPTER IV\nArticle 16 to 18: amendments taking into\naccount the new role of the national safety authorities in the process of move\ntowards a single safety certificate and reallocation of responsibilities\nbetween them and the Agency.\nCHAPTER V\nArticle 19: no comments.\nArticle 20: clarification stressing\ncooperation between the national investigation body and the judicial\nauthorities in case of investigation following an accident.\nArticle 21 to 25: no comments.\nCHAPTER VI\nArticle 26: new provision on delegated acts\ntaking into account the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of\nthe European Union.\nArticle 27: modification of the Committee\nprocedure taking into account the entry into force of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union.\nArticle 28: former article 31 updated.\nArticle 29: former article 32 without\ncomments.\nFormer article 26: obsolete\nFormer articles 29 and 30 of Directive\n2004/49/EC concern amendments to Directives 95/18/EC and 2001/14/EC\nrespectively.

Since further\namendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n\u00ea Corrigendum,\nOJ L 220, 21.6.2004, p. 16 recital 2 (adapted)\nDirective 91/440/EEC,\nCouncil Directive 95/18/EC of 19 June 1995 on the licensing of railway\nundertakings[14]\nand Directive 2001/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n26 February 2001 on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and\nthe levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety\ncertification[15]\nprovide the first steps towards regulation of the European rail transport\nmarket by opening the market for international rail freight services. However,\nthe provisions on safety have proved to be insufficient and differences between\nsafety requirements remain, which affect the optimum functioning of rail\ntransport in the Community. It is of particular importance to harmonise the\ncontent of safety rules, safety certification of railway undertakings, the\ntasks and roles of the safety authorities and the investigation of accidents.\n\u00f2 new\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive\n2004/49 established a common regulatory framework for railway safety, through\nharmonisation of the content of safety rules, the safety certification of\nrailway undertakings, the tasks and roles of the national safety authorities\nand the investigation of accidents. Nevertheless, to pursue efforts to\nestablish a single market for rail transport services, that Directive needs\nthorough revision.\n\u00ea Corrigendum,\nOJ L 220, 21.6.2004, p. 16 recital 3 (adapted)\nMetros, trams and\nother light rail systems are in many Member States subject to local or regional\nsafety rules and are often supervised by local or regional authorities and not\ncovered by the requirements on Community interoperability or licensing. Trams\nare furthermore often subject to road safety legislation and could therefore\nnot be fully covered by railway safety rules. For these reasons and in\naccordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the\nTreaty, Member States should be allowed to exclude such local rail systems from\nthe scope of this Directive.\n\u00f2 new\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Metros,\ntrams and other light rail systems are subject in many Member States to local\nor regional safety rules and are often supervised by local or regional\nauthorities and not covered by the requirements for interoperability or\nlicensing within the Union. Trams are furthermore often subject to road safety\nlegislation and could therefore not be fully covered by railway safety rules.\nFor these reasons such local rail systems should be excluded from the scope of\nthis Directive. This does not prevent Member States from applying the\nprovisions of this Directive to local rail systems on a voluntary basis if they\ndeem this appropriate.\n\u00ea Corrigendum,\nOJ L 220, 21.6.2004, p. 16 recital 4 (adapted)\nSafety levels in the\nCommunity rail system are generally high, in particular compared to road\ntransport. It is important that safety is at the very least maintained during\nthe current restructuring phase, which will separate functions of previously\nintegrated railway companies and move the railway sector further from\nself-regulation to public regulation. In line with technical and scientific\nprogress, safety should be further improved, when reasonably practicable and\ntaking into account the competitiveness of the rail transport mode.\n\u00f2 new\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Safety\nlevels in the Union\u2019s rail system are generally high, in particular compared to\nroad transport. In line with technical and scientific progress, safety should\nbe further improved, when reasonably practicable and taking into account the expected\nimprovement in the competitiveness of rail transport.\n\u00ea Corrigendum,\nOJ L 220, 21.6.2004, p. 16 (adapted)\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All those operating The main actors in the railway system, infrastructure managers and\nrailway undertakings, should bear the\nfull responsibility for the safety of the system, each for their own part.\nWhenever it is appropriate, they should\ncooperate in implementing risk control measures.

To avoid\nthe risk that the responsibilities are not properly assumed, each relevant actor\nshould be made responsible for its particular process. Each actor in the rail system\nshould be responsible in respect to the other actors for complete and truthful\ncommunication of all relevant information to check if the vehicles are fit to\nrun. In particular that concerns information on the status and history of the\nvehicle, maintenance files, traceability of loading operations, and consignment\nnotes.\n\u00ea Corrigendum,\nOJ L 220, 21.6.2004, p. 16 recital 7 (adapted)\nRequirements on\nsafety of the subsystems of the trans-European rail networks are laid down in\nDirective 96/48/EC and Directive 2001/16/EC. However, those Directives do not\ndefine common requirements at system level and do not deal in detail with the\nregulation, management and supervision of safety. When minimum safety levels of\nthe subsystems are defined by technical specifications for interoperability\n(TSIs) it will be increasingly important to establish safety targets at the\nsystem level as well.\n\u00f2 new\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each\nrailway undertaking, infrastructure manager and entity in charge of maintenance\nshould ensure that its contractors and other parties implement risk control\nmeasures. To this end, they should apply the methods for monitoring set out in\nthe common safety methods (CSMs). Their contractors should apply this process\nthrough contractual arrangements. Because such arrangements are an essential\npart of the safety management system of railway undertakings and infrastructure\nmanagers, railway undertakings and infrastructure managers should disclose\ntheir contractual arrangements on request of the European Union Agency for\nRailways (hereafter \"the Agency\") or the national safety authority in\nthe context of supervision activities.\n\u00ea Corrigendum,\nOJ L 220, 21.6.2004, p. 16 recital 8 (adapted)\nCommon safety targets\n(CSTs) and common safety methods (CSMs) should be gradually introduced to\nensure that a high level of safety is maintained and, when and where necessary\nand reasonably practicable, improved.

It is\nthus necessary to establish common safety indicators (CSIs) in order to assess\nthat the system complies with the CSTs and to facilitate the monitoring of\nrailway safety performance.

In order to\neliminate the obstacles to interoperability, the amount of national rules\nshould be reduced as a consequence of extending the scope of the TSIs to the\nwhole Union\u2019s rail system and of closing open points in the TSIs.

The\nintroduction of new specific national rules which are not based on such common\nstandards should be kept to a minimum. New national rules should be in line\nwith Community legislation and facilitate migration towards a common approach\nto railway safety. All interested parties should therefore be consulted before\na Member State adopts a national safety rule that requires a higher safety\nlevel than the CSTs. In such cases the new draft rule should be subject to\nexamination by the Commission, which should adopt a Decision if it appears that\nthe draft rule is not in conformity with Community legislation or constitutes a\nmeans of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on rail transport\noperation between Member States.\n\u00f2 new\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nview of the gradual approach to eliminating obstacles to the interoperability\nof the rail system and of the time consequently required for the adoption of\nTSIs, steps should be taken to avoid a situation where Member States adopt new\nnational rules or undertake projects that increase the diversity of the present\nsystem. The safety management system is the recognised tool for preventing\naccidents and railway undertakings are responsible for taking immediate\ncorrective action to prevent re-occurrence of accidents.

Both are to be estimated by\nRailway Undertakings/Infrastructure Managers on the basis of their experience.\nAlso includes costs related to leasing rolling stock, as a consequence of non\navailability due to damaged vehicles.\n5.5. \u2018Cost of delays as a consequence of accidents\u2019\nmeans the monetary value of delays incurred by users of rail transport\n(passengers and freight customers) as a consequence of accidents, calculated by\nthe following model:\n VT || = || monetary value of travel time savings Value of time for a passenger of a train (an hour) VTP = [VT of work passengers]*[Average percentage of work passengers per year] + [VT of non-work passengers]*[Average percentage of non-work passengers per year] VT measured in EUR per passenger per hour Value of time for a freight train (an hour) VTF = [VT of freight trains]*[(Tonne-Km)/(Train-Km)] VT is measured in EUR per freight tonne per hour Average tonnes of goods transported per train in one year = (Tonne-Km)/(Train-Km) \n CM || = || Cost of 1 minute of delay of a train Passenger train CMP = K1*(VTP/60)*[(Passenger-Km)/(Train-Km)] Average number of passengers per train in one year = (Passenger-Km)/(Train-Km) Freight train CMF = K2* (VTF/60) Factors K1 and K2 are between the value of time and the value of delay, as estimated by stated preference studies, to take into account that the time lost as a result of delays is perceived significantly more negatively than normal travel time. Cost of delays of an accident = CMP*(Minutes of delay of passenger trains) + CMF*(Minutes of delay of freight trains) \nScope of the model\nCost of delays is to be calculated for all accidents,\nboth significant and non-significant.\nDelays are to be calculated as follows:\n\u2013                        \nreal delays on the railway lines where accidents\noccurred, \n\u2013                        \nreal delays or, if not possible, estimated delays on\nthe other affected lines.\n6.
