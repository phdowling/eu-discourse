The measures took the form of an ad valorem duty at the level of 71.8%. Individual anti-dumping duty rates were granted to two Chinese exporters (0% and 24.5% respectively). \n   || Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. \n Consultation of interested parties and impact assessment \n   || Consultation of interested parties \n   || Interested parties concerned by the proceeding have had the possibility to defend their interests during the investigation, in line with the provisions of the basic Regulation. \n   || Collection and use of expertise \n   || There was no need for external expertise. \n   || Impact assessment This proposal is the result of the implementation of the basic Regulation. The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. \n Legal elements of the proposal \n   || Summary of the proposed action On 10 October 2012, the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union[2], the initiation of an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of persulphates originating in the PRC. The review was initiated following a substantiated request lodged by two European producers (RheinPerChemie GmbH&Co. KG and United Initiators GmbH&Co. KG) representing 100% of the total Union production of persulphates. The review investigation found likelihood of recurrence of dumping and injury should anti-dumping measures be lifted. It was further established that the maintenance of measures was not against the interest of the Union. Therefore, it is suggested that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Regulation, which should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union by 9 January 2014 at the latest, in order to prolong the existing measures. \n   || Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. \n   || Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n   || Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n   || The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n   || Indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n   || Choice of instruments \n   || Proposed instruments: regulation. \n   || Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n Budgetary implication \n   || The proposal has no implication for the Union budget. \n2013/0404 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on\nimports of peroxosulphates (persulphates) originating in the People's Republic\nof China following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1225/2009\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community [3]\n('the basic Regulation'), and in particular Article 9(4) and 11(2), (5) and (6)\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission ('Commission') after consulting the Advisory Committee,\nWhereas:\nA.

The measures with\nregard to the PRC took the form of an ad valorem duty of 71,8% for all\ncompanies except two Chinese exporting producers to whom individual duties were\ngranted.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation of an expiry\nreview\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n10 October 2012, the Commission announced by a notice (\u2018Notice of initiation\u2019)[5], published in the Official Journal of the European Union,\nthe initiation of an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to\nimports of persulphates originating in the PRC.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The review was initiated\nfollowing a substantiated request lodged by two European producers,\nRheinPerChemie GmbH&Co. KG and United Initiators GmbH&Co. KG (\u2018the\napplicants\u2019), representing 100% of the total Union production of persulphates.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request was based on\nthe grounds that the expiry of the measures would be likely to result in a recurrence\nof dumping and injury to the Union industry.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review investigation period\nand period considered\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation of a continuation\nor recurrence of dumping covered the period from 1 October 2011 to 30 September\n2012 (\u2018the review investigation period\u2019 or \u2018RIP\u2019). The examination of the\ntrends relevant for the assessment of the likelihood of a continuation or\nrecurrence of injury covered the period from 1 January 2009 to the end of the\nRIP (\u2018the period considered\u2019).\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the\ninvestigation\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the applicants, exporting producers in the PRC, unrelated importers and\nusers known to be concerned, producers in the potential analogue countries and\nthe representatives of the PRC of the initiation of the expiry review.\nInterested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in\nwriting and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the Notice of\ninitiation.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the potentially\nlarge number of exporting producers in the PRC and unrelated importers in the Union involved in the investigation, sampling was envisaged in the Notice of Initiation, in\naccordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. In order to enable the\nCommission to decide whether sampling would be necessary and, if so, to select\na sample, the above parties were invited, under Article 17 of the basic\nRegulation, to make themselves known within 15 days of the publication of the\nnotice of initiation and to provide the Commission with the information\nrequested in the Notice of initiation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 None of the importers made\nitself known. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Only one exporting\nproducer from the PRC replied to the questionnaire. Therefore, it was not\nnecessary to select a sample of exporting producers.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sent\nquestionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to those who made\nthemselves known within the deadlines set in the Notice of initiation. Replies\nwere received from two Union producers, one exporting producer in the PRC and\none producer in Turkey, considered as a potential analogue country.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sought and\nverified all the information it deemed necessary for the determination of the\nlikelihood of a continuation or recurrence of dumping and resulting injury and\nof the Union interest. Verification visits were carried out at the premises of\nthe following companies: \n(a)         \nUnion producers \n\u2013              \nRheinPerChemie GmbH & Co. KG, Germany\n\u2013              \nUnited Initiators GmbH & Co. KG, Germany\n(b)         \nExporting producer in the PRC\nUnited Initiators (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., Shanghai[6]\nB. PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE\nPRODUCT\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned is\nthe same as that covered by the original investigation , namely peroxosulphates\n(persulphates), including potassium peroxymonosulphate sulphate (\u2018product\nconcerned\u2019), currently falling within CN codes 2833 40 00 and ex 2842 90 80.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned is\nused as an initiator or as an oxidising agent in a number of applications. Some\nexamples include its use as polymerisation initiator in the production of\npolymers, as an etching agent in the production of printed circuit boards, in\nhair cosmetics, in textile desizing, in paper manufacturing as a denture\ncleanser and as a disinfectant. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation confirmed\nthat, as in the original investigation, the product concerned and that\nmanufactured and sold on the domestic market of the PRC, as well as that\nproduced and sold by the Union industry on the Union market have the same basic\nphysical and technical characteristics and the same basic uses and are\ntherefore considered to be alike within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the\nbasic Regulation.\nC.\nLIKELIHOOD OF A CONTINUATION OR RECURRENCE OF DUMPING\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General remarks\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n11(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether dumping was currently\ntaking place and whether dumping was likely to continue or recur upon a\npossible expiry of the measures in force on certain imports from the PRC.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As explained in recital (9), only one Chinese exporting\nproducer cooperated in the investigation and it did not export the product\nconcerned to the Union during\nthe RIP. As mentioned below in recital (22) and as explained in detail in\nrecitals (51) to (53), the investigation showed that basically all imports from\nthe PRC during the RIP were made by one exporter which was found not to be\ndumping in the original investigation, and which is not subject to the current\nreview. Hence, no dumping analysis could be done in this case.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of imports in\ncase the measures are repealed\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to assess the\nlikelihood of recurrence of dumping, the information provided by the\ncooperating Chinese exporting producer, the information collected in accordance\nwith Article 18 of the basic Regulation and facts available with regard to the\nnon-cooperating exporting producers were taken into account. The facts\navailable were found in the request for the expiry review, in the information\npublished in the framework of an expiry review initiated in March 2013 by the\nUnited States of America (USA)[7],\nin the statistics available to the Commission i.e. the monthly data transmitted\nby Member States under Article 14 (6) of the basic Regulation (\"the 14.6\ndatabase\u201d) and in the Eurostat import data.\n(a)              \nPrices and volume of imports into the Union from the PRC and other third countries\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The data available in the\ninvestigation showed that basically all imports from the PRC during the RIP were\nmade by one Chinese exporter which was not found to be dumping in the original\ninvestigation[8]. These imports are thus not subject to anti-dumping measures. The prices of these imports remained below the Union industry prices\nduring that period.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the fact that\nChinese import prices into the Union increased by 29% in the period considered,\nthey were still low and were undercutting the price of the Union industry\nduring the RIP. The sales prices of the Union industry in the Union market also\nincreased but at a less pronounced rate of 7%.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsole co-operating Chinese exporter which is subject to the current anti-dumping\nmeasures was not exporting the product concerned to the Union during the RIP. However, the investigation\nshowed that it was exporting at dumped prices to third country markets and that\nits prices were even lower than those of the current imports from the PRC in\nthe Union market. This is an indication that exporters in China are continuing to practice dumping and that their prices are low.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union market roughly\nconsists of imports from three countries: China, Turkey and the USA, each representing between 8% and 10% of market share and two Union producers with a\nmarket share of around 65 to 75%. The investigation showed that the USA continued to be present on the Union market and represented around one third of total\nimports during the RIP. The US import prices were on average 10% above the\nimport prices from the PRC. This finding, combined with the observed\nundercutting of the Union industry\u2019s prices, indicates that the Chinese imports\ncontinued to exercise a downward pressure on the sales prices in the Union.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned above in\nrecital (18), Chinese imports during the RIP were made by one exporter which\nwas found not to be dumping in the original investigation. Between 2009 and the RIP, the volume of these imports increased by\n24% and the corresponding market share increased from 8% to 9,6% of total Union\nconsumption in the same period.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis noteworthy to recall that in the years 1995 to 2001 anti-dumping measures\nwere imposed against persulphates from the PRC. As these measures were repealed,\nimport volume from the PRC increased from less than 200 tonnes in 2001 to more\nthan 4000 tons in 2003 and more than doubled to almost 9000 tons in 2006. In\nother words, Chinese imports took more than 20% of the Union market in few\nyears. Over the period 2003-2006, whilst consumption increased by 7%, Chinese\nmarket share doubled. This shows that Chinese exporters are able to take\nconsiderable market share in the Union market in the absence of anti-dumping\nmeasures.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above facts\nand considerations, in particular the Chinese reaction to the repeal of the\nmeasures in the Union market in 2001, the level of Chinese prices during the RIP\nand the continued dumping practices in third country markets, it is considered\nthat there is a likelihood that in the short term low-priced Chinese imports\nwould resume in large quantities into the Union market should the current\nmeasures be repealed. \n(b)              \nPricing behaviour of Chinese producers on\nother export markets\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital (16)\nabove, the cooperating Chinese company did not export to the Union during the\nRIP, and it was not possible to compare its normal values on the domestic\nmarket with export prices to the Union. It was however assessed, as mentioned\nin recital (24) above, whether the company\u2019s exports to third countries were\nmade at dumped prices during the RIP. Since the company was granted MET in the\noriginal investigation, normal values were established based on its own data.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the three types of the\nproduct concerned for which domestic sales were representative and made in the\nordinary course of trade, average normal values were established on the basis\nof the prices paid by independent customers in the domestic market. For one\ntype, normal value had to be constructed based on the cost of production, in\naccordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation. The company\u2019s cost of\nmanufacturing, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A) and profit\nachieved on the domestic sales made in the ordinary course of trade in\naccordance with Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation were used to establish the\nnormal value of that type.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison between the\nnormal weighted average value and the weighted average export price, on an\nex-works basis to third countries established on the basis of the reported and\nverified data, showed a weighted average dumping margin of 9,4\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to pricing behaviour, the existence of the anti-dumping\nmeasures in India and in the USA is also a clear indication of dumping\npractices by Chinese exporting producers on other markets.\n(c)              \nAttractiveness of the Union market\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat the cooperating Chinese company exported to a wide variety of third\ncountries such as Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan,  Thailand and the United Arab Emirates. The exports prices of the cooperating\nChinese company to third markets were thus compared to the level of Union\nindustry sales prices and the import price for the PRC during the RIP in the\nUnion market. This comparison showed that the cooperating Chinese exporter was significantly\nundercutting, up to 40%, the prices of the Union industry during the RIP.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This analysis shows on the\none hand, that prices in the Union market are higher and thus very attractive,\nand, on the other, that prices offered by other Chinese exporter are lower than\nthe current Chinese import price in the Union market.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also noteworthy that the\nnormal values of the cooperating company during the RIP were generally lower\nthan Union industry sales prices. This confirms the attractiveness of the Union\nmarket as it would clearly generate higher profits for Chinese producers. The\nlow price level in China does not seem to be based on any other ground than the\nabundant capacity and offer of the product concerned\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned above in\nrecital (28), certain third country markets, such as the USA and India, have become less attractive for Chinese exporters due to the existence of\nanti-dumping measures. Additionally, in relative terms, the other third country\nmarkets were found to operate at lower price levels than in the Union market. With\nregard to other third country markets, not under\nmeasures, they are already supplied by companies that are present in those\nmarkets, thus any spare capacity in the PRC would likely be used for exports to\nthe Union market.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the above, it is\nexpected that Chinese imports would resume in larger volumes and exercise more\nprice pressure on the Union market should the current measures be lifted.\n(d)              \nProduction capacity and excess capacity\navailable for exports\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naccordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, in the absence of other\ninformation available, the analysis of the spare capacity in the PRC was based\non the facts available, namely the limited information provided by the\ncooperating Chinese exporting producer on the market situation in the PRC, by\nthe Union industry and from publicly available information at the level of 5\nmain producers identified in the PRC and data collected at initiation stage.\nThe information delivered by these sources was found to be consistent.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based\non this information, it is assumed that more than 100 thousand tonnes of\nproduction capacity is available in the PRC, which represents around three\ntimes the volume of Union consumption during the RIP.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the capacity\nutilisation rate of the cooperating producer, it was concluded that there are\npotentially significant capacities available in the PRC which could be used to\nincrease production and re-directed it to the Union market in case the\nanti-dumping measures would be allowed to lapse.\n(e)              \nConclusion on the likelihood of\nrecurrence of dumping\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nview of the above, it was considered that there is a likelihood that dumping\nwould recur if the current measures were allowed to lapse. In particular the level\nof the normal values established in China, the dumping behaviour of the\ncooperating producer in third country markets, the existence of anti-dumping\nmeasures against Chinese exporters in India and the USA, the attractiveness of\nthe Union market compared to other markets and the availability of significant production\ncapacity in the PRC point to a likelihood of recurrence of dumping in case the\ncurrent measures are repealed. \nD. SITUATION ON THE UNION MARKET \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definition of the Union\nindustry \n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ncurrent investigation confirmed that persulphates are manufactured only by two\nproducers in the Union. They\nconstitute 100% of total Union production during the RIP. Both producers supported\nthe review request and cooperated with the investigation.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These two companies thus constitute\nthe Union industry within the meaning of Article 4(1) and 5(4) of the basic\nRegulation and will hereafter be referred to as the 'Union industry'.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remark \n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To\nprotect confidentiality under Article 19 of the basic Regulation the data relating\nto the two Union producers is presented in indexed form or in ranges.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information on imports have\nbeen analysed at CN code level for the three main types of the like product,\nammonium persulphate, sodium persulphate, potassium persulphate, on TARIC code\nlevel for the fourth type, potassium peroxymonosulphate. The analysis of\nimports was supplemented by data collected under Article 14(6) of the basic\nRegulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union Consumption\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union consumption was\nestablished on the basis of the sales volume of the Union industry on the Union\nmarket, and import data from Eurostat, at CN code and TARIC\ncode level.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union consumption in the\nRIP was slightly higher than at the beginning of the period considered. There\nwas an increase of 22% noted between 2009 and 2010 but further on the\nconsumption steadily decreased by around 18%.\n   Table 1 \n Consumption \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RIP \n Consumption (tonnes) || 25 000 \u2013 35 000 || 35 000 \u2013 45 000 || 35 000 \u2013 45 000 || 25 000 \u2013 35 000 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 122 || 114 || 103 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, Eurostat, Article 14(6) database   \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume, Prices and market\nshare of imports from the PRC\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nvolumes and market shares of imports from the PRC were analysed on the basis of\nEurostat and the data collected in accordance with Article 14(6) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\nof the above mentioned databases indicates that all imports from the PRC originate\nfrom the one company which was found not to be dumping in the original\ninvestigation.

This\n7% increase in the average sales price of the Union industry can be explained\nby the change in the product mix they were selling during the period\nconsidered.

Subsequently,\nin the period 2010 - RIP, profitability remained above 10%. The sudden jump in\nthe profitability index between 2009 and 2010 thus results from very low base\nlevel in 2009 which was a critical year for the Union industry. In 2011 the high\nprofitability resulted from an extraordinary cost saving event, which will not\nrepeat itself in the future.

The recovery is however recent\nand a certain decline in various injury indicators such as profitability, cash\nflow, return on investment and investment was observed in the Union market\nduring the RIP.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the\nsituation of the Union industry\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation showed that the imports of low-prices dumped products from the\nPRC ceased on the Union market right after the imposition of the original\nmeasures in 2007 and they were not present during the period considered or the\nRIP. The imports from the PRC present on the Union market originate from the\nsole Chinese producer found not to be dumping in the original investigation. This\nallowed the Union industry to achieve high level of production, increase its sales\nvolume, average sales price, market share and profitability and to improve its\noverall financial situation.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore concluded\nthat the Union industry did not suffer material injury during the RIP. Given\nthe decline in consumption and the deterioration in certain injury indicators\nas described above during the RIP, the situation of the Union industry is still\nvulnerable.\nE.

Furthermore, there are several small producers\ndispersed in the country which make this figure even higher.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the lack of\ncooperation from Chinese exporters there is no data available indicating the\nprecise percentage of this capacity which is spare and which could be used for\nexporting the product concerned to the Union market. However, the investigation\nshowed that the sole Chinese cooperating producer has a spare capacity of around\n30%. Extrapolating this information to all Chinese companies would mean that a spare\ncapacity of more than 30 thousand tonnes currently exists in the PRC.\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the above, even if\nthe Chinese companies would not work at their full capacity, 20-25 thousand\ntonnes of the product concerned would be available for export in the PRC. Given\nthe findings made and the conclusions reached in recitals (22) to (44) above,\nit is clear that in case the measures would not be extended, the available spare\ncapacity in China will be intended to be exported to the Union market. This potential\nadditional export volume should be seen in the context of a Union consumption\nof around 25 000-35 000 tonnes in the RIP.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export From the PRC\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital (20)\nabove, the investigation showed that Chinese exports to third countries were\nmade at dumped prices. Furthermore, the results of expiry reviews conducted by\nthe relevant authorities in the USA and in India led to the recommendation that\nthe anti-dumping measures in force on persulphates from the PRC should be\nextended. In this situation it is expected that free production capacity of the\nChinese exporters will be mainly used to produce for export to the Union market\nif the measures are allowed to lapse. As explained in recital (32) above, given\nthat the supply to other third country markets, not under measures, is already ensured\nby companies that are present in those markets, any spare capacity available in\nthe PRC would likely be used to export the product concerned to the Union\nmarket.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account past\ndumping practice of Chinese exporters that led to the imposition of the\nmeasures in force and their current dumping behaviour in third countries, it\ncan be concluded that these volumes of exports to the Union would be made at dumped\nprices.\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, as mentioned in\nrecital (23) above, it is recalled that in the years 1995 to 2001 anti-dumping measures\nwere imposed against export of persulphates from the PRC. As these measures\nwere not extended, imports from the PRC increased from less than 200 tonnes in\n2001 to almost 10 thousand tonnes in 2006, and thus took more than 20% of the\nUnion market.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the findings of\nthe investigation, namely the spare capacity available in the PRC, the\ncontinuation of Chinese dumping to the third countries, the limited ability of\nthe Chinese exporters to sell in other main third countries markets and their proven\nability to redirect export volumes to the Union market, it is considered that\nthe repeal of the measures would weaken the position of the Union industry in\ntheir core market and the injury suffered would recur due to likely Chinese\nimports at dumped prices. There are no reasons to believe that the improvement\nof the performance of the Union industry due to the measures in force would\nremain or strengthen if the measures were repealed. On the contrary, there are favourable\nconditions for a likely shift of the Chinese imports to the Union market at\ndumped prices and in considerable volumes and that would likely undermine the\npositive developments in the Union market reached over the period considered. The\nlikely Chinese dumped imports would be able to exercise pressure on the Union\nindustry\u2019s sales prices and make it lose market share and as a consequence\nwould negatively impact the Union industry\u2019s financial performance which is\nstill vulnerable as explained in recital (66) above.\nF.

The\ndetermination of the Union interest was based on an appreciation of the various\ninterests involved, i.e. those of the Union industry, of importers and of\nusers. The interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views\nknown pursuant to Article 21(2) of the basic Regulation.\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As this investigation is a\nreview of the existing measures, it allowed for assessment of any undue\nnegative impact of the existing anti-dumping measures on the interested parties.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the Union\nindustry\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\nwas concluded in recital (70) above that the Union industry would be likely to\nexperience a serious deterioration of its situation in case the anti-dumping\nmeasures were allowed to lapse. Therefore, the continuation of measures would\nbenefit the Union industry because the Union producers should be able to maintain\nits sales volumes, market share, profitability and its overall positive economic\nsituation. By contrast, the discontinuation of the measures would seriously threaten\nthe viability of the Union industry because there are reasons to expect a shift\nof the Chinese imports to the Union market at dumped\nprices and in considerable volumes that would cause\nrecurrence of injury.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of users \n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 None\nof the 44 contacted users replied to the questionnaire or cooperated. Users did\nnot cooperate in the original investigation either. In absence of interest from\nusers, it was concluded that measures would not be against the users\u2019 interest\nto maintain them. In addition, the investigation revealed that the impact of\nthe product concerned on the costs of downstream products is rather marginal\nand the maintenance of the measures would not adversely impact the user\nindustry. The investigation also revealed that due to the nature of the product\nas well as the several sources of supplies available on the market users can\neasily switch suppliers.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of importers\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 None of the 14 contacted importers\nreplied to the questionnaire or cooperated. Importers did not cooperate in the\noriginal investigation either. In absence of interest from importers, it was\nconcluded that it would not be against their interest to maintain measures. The\ninvestigation revealed that importers can easily buy from different sources\nthat are currently available on the market, in particular from the Union\nindustry, US exporters and Chinese exporters selling at non-dumped prices.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, it is\nconcluded that there are no compelling reasons of Union interest against the\nmaintenance of the current anti-dumping measures.\nG. ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All parties were informed\nof the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended\nto recommend that the existing measures be maintained. They were also granted a\nperiod to submit comments subsequent to that disclosure.
