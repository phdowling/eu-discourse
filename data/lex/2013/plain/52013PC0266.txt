However obstacles to a fully integrated internal\nmarket for financial services remain. Recent initiatives at EU level have\nsought to help the single market to develop its full\npotential by ending market fragmentation and\neliminating barriers and obstacles to the movement of services, while also strengthening\ncitizens' confidence in their internal market and ensuring that its benefits\nare passed on to consumers. \nThe Single Market Act\n(SMA) I, adopted by the Commission in April 2011, outlined twelve levers to boost growth and strengthen citizens' confidence in\nthe single market. In the field of retail financial services, SMA I stated that particular regard\nshould be given \"to the transparency of bank fees and better protection of\nborrowers in the mortgage market\". The Commission also announced \"an\ninitiative concerning access to a basic payment account for all citizens at a\nreasonable cost, wherever they live in the EU\" in order to enable all\ncitizens to participate actively in the single market. \nThe SMA II, adopted on 3 October 2012,\nidentified a legislative initiative on bank accounts in the EU as one of the\ntwelve priority actions to generate real effects on the ground and make\ncitizens and businesses confident to use the single market to their advantage.[1] Its aim is to \"give all EU\ncitizens access to a basic payment account, ensure bank account fees are\ntransparent and comparable, and make switching bank accounts easier\".[2] Furthermore, the Commission\nannounced proposals in the area of transparency and comparability of bank fees and\nbank account switching as part of the Commission's Work Programme for 2013.[3]\nPrevious initiatives in the field of retail\nbanking have not only improved the ability of payment service providers to\noperate cross border, but have brought substantial benefits to many European consumers,\nin particular through cheaper transactions, faster payments and more\ntransparent conditions and prices. The Payment Services Directive (2007/64/EC)\nprovides certain transparency obligations with respect to the fees charged by\npayment service providers. This initiative has contributed to substantially shortening\nthe time required to execute transactions and increase the consistency of the\ninformation provided to consumers in relation to their payment services. The\nrecent Regulation on the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) has created a coherent\nframework for carrying out secure and fast payment transactions within the\nEurozone, simplifying the provision of payment services and facilitating customer\nmobility.\nWhile measures to complete the single\nmarket for financial services should generate growth and enhance business\nopportunities for providers of financial services, their impact on consumers is\nalso of vital importance. At present, the opacity of payment\naccount fees make it difficult for consumers to make informed choices. Even\nwhere fees are comparable, the process for switching from one payment account\nto another is often lengthy and complex. As a result, consumers still show a\nvery high degree of inertia with respect to payment accounts. A survey on\nretail financial services conducted in 2012[4]\nshowed that a large share of consumers tends to remain attached to their\npayment providers. Only 16% of the respondents who already held a financial\nproduct had opened a new payment account in the previous five years. Further,\nonly 3% of the respondents declared having opened a payment account\ncross-border. Consumers were dissuaded from purchasing retail financial\nproducts cross-border by unclear information (21%), lack of clarity of the\nrights available to the consumer (18%) or the process being too complicated\n(15%). Consumer inertia makes it more difficult for financial service providers\nto attract new clients and may make the entering of new markets less attractive,\nin particular in a cross-border context. In turn, this raises prices and lowers\nthe quality of services provided to the consumers. \nThe impact of EU measures aimed at ensuring\na sound and robust framework to fully develop the benefits of the internal\nmarket for financial services is reduced by the fact that a large portion of\nthe EU population is still unbanked. The World Bank estimated that about 58\nmillion EU consumers do not have a payment account[5] and approximately 25 million of\nthem would like to open one. Moreover, surveys and consultations undertaken by\nthe Commission and complaints from consumers demonstrate that many citizens\nhave faced difficulties in opening a payment account due to their lack of a\npermanent address in the Member State where the payment service provider is\nlocated. This situation also affects a large number of EU consumers living in\nanother Member State (12.3 million people in 2010). All these factors\nnegatively impact upon consumers' ability to obtain payment accounts,\nespecially cross-border. As noted in the recently adopted package on social\ninvestment, payment accounts are a vital tool for people to participate in the\neconomy and society[6].\nMoreover, the fact that a large number of\nconsumers do not currently participate in the internal market for financial\nservices has negative consequences for both payment service providers and\nconsumers. On the one hand, providers are less incentivised to offer their\nservices in the Union and to enter new markets, which stifles the competitive\nprocess and in turn leads to less favourable conditions for consumers. On the\nother hand, unbanked consumers are excluded from the benefits of the internal\nmarket. The economy is steadily moving towards an increase of cashless\ntransactions. This trend affects companies and consumers. It also affects public\nadministrations, which have realised the advantages of non-cash transactions.[7] Furthermore, the lack of access\nto a payment account prevents consumers from fully benefiting from the internal\nmarket, for example, by hindering the purchase of goods cross-border or online.\nAs payment accounts are the financial\nservices product most likely to be purchased cross-border, identifying adequate solutions to the\nproblems outlined above is vital. The consequences of inaction are potentially serious,\nincluding the inhibited development of a fully-functioning internal market with\nsignificant impacts upon payment service providers, consumers, and the wider\neconomy. Furthermore, the financial crisis has brought to light the importance\nof effective measures to restore a high level of consumer confidence towards\nfinancial institutions. \nIn light of this, and with a view to\nenhancing the integration of the EU payment account market, this proposal aims\nto improve the transparency and comparability of fee information relating to\npayment accounts, facilitate switching between payment accounts, eliminate\ndiscrimination based on residency with respect to payment accounts and provide\naccess to a payment account with basic features within the EU. It will\ncontribute to easier market entry, increased economies of scale and therefore\nincreased competition in the banking and payment industries, both within and\nacross Member States. Taking steps to simplify the comparison of services and\nfees offered by payment services providers and facilitate the process of\nswitching between payment accounts will, in turn, improve prices and services\nfor consumers. This proposal will also guarantee access to basic payment\nservices to all EU consumers and prohibit discrimination based on residency\nagainst consumers who intend to open a payment account abroad, to the benefit\nof both payment service providers and consumers. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing provisions in the\narea of the proposal\nTransparency and comparability of payment\naccount fees\nThe Payment Service Directive (2007/64/EC)\nprovides certain transparency obligations with respect to the fees charged by\npayment service providers but it does not provide a framework to define the\nmanner of presentation of such information, nor does it contain any provisions\nconcerning the comparability of fees. \nIn 2010 the European Commission invited the\nEuropean Banking Industry Committee (EBIC), representing the banking industry\nat EU level, to develop, through self-regulation, a framework ensuring\nincreased transparency on payment account fees. In May 2011 EBIC presented the\nEuropean Commission with its proposal, which proved unsatisfactory. In\nparticular, this self-regulatory attempt failed to establish a consistent\nterminology within a reasonable time-frame.\nPayment account switching\nIn 2008, EBIC adopted the Common Principles\nfor Bank Account Switching which define the process to facilitate payment\naccount switching within a Member State. Implementation of the Common\nPrinciples was meant to be completed by the end of 2009. However, as of 2012,\nthe enforcement of these guidelines remained unsatisfactory.\nIn particular, not all payment services\nproviders have followed the principles established by the EBIC and the\napplication of these principles has been often patchy and not homogeneous. This\nled to several difficulties for consumers trying to switch accounts. Many consumers\nfaced problems with the misdirection of their payment orders, which may\nsometimes even lead to fines. Also, the duration of the switching process in\ncertain countries exceeds substantially the 15 days prescribed by the Common\nPrinciples. Moreover, consumers are often not provided with clear information as\nregards the availability of the switching mechanism and its basic features.\nAccess to a payment account with basic\nfeatures\nOn 18 July 2011 the Commission issued a\nRecommendation on access to a basic payment account.[8] The Recommendation invited\nMember States to put in place the measures necessary to ensure that payment\naccounts with basic features are offered to consumers within 6 months of its\npublication. As a follow-up, on 22 August 2012 the Commission services issued a\nReport on \"National Measures and practices as regards access to basic\npayment accounts\"[9]\nto evaluate the extent to which Member States are complying with the\nRecommendation and concluded that only a few Member\nStates appear to comply with its main principles.\nIn particular, to date eleven Member States have no measure in force\nconcerning the right to open an account, features of such an account and\nassociated charges. Only a few Member States appear to be close to complying\nwith the principles of the Recommendation. In the remaining Member States, some\nrules or systems are in place or about to be put in place, although with widely\ndiffering standards and degrees of implementation. In some countries the\nmeasures in place do not amount to legislative initiatives but are limited to\nself-regulatory actions, only impacting those banks which voluntarily chose to adhere\nto the principles in question. Their effectiveness is thus limited and the\napplication inconsistent. In other Member States, only generic and general\nprovisions with respect to access are in force whilst structured measures in\nthis respect are still lacking. \n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with the EU\u2019s\nother policies and objectives of the Union\nThe proposal is consistent with the\npolicies and objectives pursued by the Union. The\nmeasures envisaged will foster the development of the internal market and enable all consumers in all Member States to\nenjoy the full benefits deriving from it. By enhancing competition between\npayment service providers and facilitating consumers\u2019 participation in the\nsingle market, the proposal will also increase the volume of transactions\nwithin the Union and will contribute to the attainment of the wider objectives\nof economic growth. \nThis proposal complements the measures\nadopted by the Commission with the Payment Service Directive. The Payment\nService Directive provides harmonised rules on fee transparency, with the aim\nof reducing the cost of payment systems for payment service providers. The\npresent proposal, on the other hand, directly targets the harmonisation of fee terminology\nand presentation, and establishes quality standards for information tools to\nfacilitate comparison between payment accounts. Further, it provides a\nprocedure for the effective switching of payment accounts as well as\nguaranteeing access to basic payment services.\nThe proposal is consistent with the Union\u2019s policy in the fight\nagainst money laundering and terrorism financing. Consumers will still need to\nbe able to satisfy identity requirements before opening an account, as required\nby the Third Anti-Money Laundering Directive[10].\nHowever, it will no longer be possible to refuse the opening of a payment\naccount by alleging anti-money laundering concerns based on the mere fact that\nthe consumer is not a resident of the Member State where he or she wants to\nopen an account.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of interested\nparties\nConsultation methods, main sectors\ntargeted and general profile of respondents\nThe Commission services launched a public\nconsultation on 20 March 2012. The objective of the consultation was to collect\nstakeholders\u2019 views on the transparency of payment\naccount fees, switching between payment accounts and on\naccess to basic payment accounts in order to assess the need for action at European Union level and\nidentify what measures, if any, should be taken. The European Commission\nreceived 124 responses from stakeholders in 19 Member States and one EEA member\nas well as from representative bodies at EU and international level. \nSummary of responses and how they have\nbeen taken into account\nRegarding transparency of payment accounts\nfees, a majority of respondents in all categories of stakeholder reported that\nproblems were encountered in the retail banking sector with respect to the\nmanner of presentation and the comparability of such fees. Unanimous support\nemerged among consumers for EU level action aimed at ensuring a level playing\nfield in these areas. However, more diverging positions were expressed by Members States and the industry on the possible means to tackle these issues. Some Member\nStates supported EU action or considered this possibility, while others\nconsidered that further measures should be conducted at national level\ninitially. The majority of stakeholders from the financial services industry\ndid not see the need for legislation at EU level and expressed the view that,\nif EU action were to be pursued, it should be flexible and take account of\nefforts made at national level. \nWith regard to switching, consumers and\nrepresentatives of civil society argued that banks do not always offer\nswitching services and even where such services are provided, they do not fully\ncomply with the provisions of the Common Principles. The financial services\nindustry, on the other hand, considered that most providers offer a switching\nservice in line with the Common Principles. The views of public authorities\ntended to fall between these. There were mixed views as to whether the Common\nPrinciples should be made compulsory. Several Member States as well as the\nfinancial services industry believed that the Common Principles should remain\nvoluntary. Respondents from other Member States were more open to making the\nCommon Principles compulsory, as this would guarantee a more effective\nenforcement of the provisions. Consumers and representatives of civil society\nstrongly believed that the Common Principles should be made binding.\nStakeholders were also split as to whether any initiative should cover\ncross-border switching. Consumers mostly appeared in favour of cross-border\nswitching, while most respondents from the industry opposed this option. As for\nMember States, while several respondents were not supportive of a cross-border\ndimension, others took the view that this option would favour the achievement\nof the single market. \nWith respect to access, the consultation provided mixed results. On the\none hand, the financial services industry, as well as some Member States,\nargued that there were no major obstacles to consumers accessing a basic\naccount as the financial services industry either adheres to a national provision\non access or the EU Recommendation. They therefore concluded that no action\nshould be taken in this area. The financial services industry further\nemphasised that if any measure were to be taken, it should be at national level\nto accommodate the different legal and regulatory landscapes across the EU. On\nthe other hand, consumers, representatives of civil society and some other Member\nStates took the view that the current situation is unsatisfactory and that\nmajor difficulties exist in accessing basic account services. They would,\ntherefore, strongly support an initiative that ensures access to a basic\naccount. Consequently, they argued in favour of legislative measures at EU\nlevel, albeit with some flexibility for national circumstances.\nCommission services also met with Member States, payment service providers, industry representatives, and consumer\nrepresentatives, throughout the process. \n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact Assessment\nIn line with its \"Better\nRegulation\" policy, the Commission prepared an impact assessment of policy\nalternatives. Policy options related to the scope of the new provisions, the\nlevel of standardisation, the setting up and functioning of measures on\ntransparency and comparability of fees, switching between payment accounts, improved\naccess to basic payment services and how to ensure their effective application\nfor consumers. \nA number of studies and surveys supported\nthe impact assessment. This included: the Eurobarometer Survey; a study on\n\"Quantification of economic impacts of EU action to improve fee\ntransparency, comparability and mobility in the internal market for bank\npersonal current accounts\"; a study on \"Bank fees transparency and\ncomparability and bank mobility\"; and a survey of consumers' switching experiences\nwith reference to the Common Principles on Bank Account Switching. \nThe impact assessment identified a series\nof problems concerning the transparency and comparability of payment account\nfees. Fee information provided to consumers is overly complex. Diversity in pricing\nmodels adds to the complexity of choosing an appropriate product. This leads to\ninformation asymmetries and impairs a consumer\u2019s ability to understand what\nfees represent, hindering consumer choice and, ultimately, competition.\nMoreover, wide price variations have been observed for payment accounts,\ncalling into question the degree of price competition in the market. Price\nvariations also feed the perception that payment accounts are not fairly\npriced, denting consumer confidence and trust in the sector.\nBased on these findings and following an\nanalysis of the available options, the Commission concluded that the\nrecommended set of policy measures should consist of the introduction of a\nstandard list of fees charged for services offered on payment accounts; measures\naimed at ensuring the independence of websites comparing fees for services\noffered on payment accounts at Member state level and mandating the creation of\nsuch websites where they do not already exist; and requiring payment service\nproviders to provide ex-post information at least annually on the fees incurred\nby consumers on their payment accounts. \nThe impact assessment also demonstrated\nthat payment account mobility in the EU is still limited. This is partly caused\nby insufficient and often inconsistent information on the switching process,\nand a lack of assistance by the staff of payment service providers. Switching\nis frequently perceived by customers to be costly or time-consuming; it is also\noften unclear how long the process will take and what would happen to direct\ndebits/credits in the \u2018transitional period\u2019 (i.e. the period when the new\naccount is opened but not all recurring payments have been transferred to it).\nFinally, the deadlines set in the Common Principles are often not respected.\nThe impact assessment also highlighted that\nthere is no common framework in place to facilitate cross-border switching or\ncomparability of payment account fees. Although there is significant potential\ndemand, consumers may be deterred by the complexity of the process in practice.\nIn a fully functioning internal market, comparable information on payment\naccount prices across the EU would broaden consumer choice and facilitate\ndomestic and cross-border switching. \nIn light of the above issues, and following\na thorough assessment of the available options, the Commission concluded that\nin order to improve the functioning of the switching process, measures to give\nbinding legal force to the provisions of the Common Principles on account\nswitching are necessary. Moreover, such measures should broaden the scope of\nthe Common Principles by extending them to cross-border switching. This will\nhelp consumers receive clear and comprehensible information by payment account\nproviders and therefore identify the payment account most suitable for their\nneeds. Moreover if consumers, based on such information, decide to move to\nanother account, a switching service will be at their disposal. \nWith respect to access, the impact assessment concluded that it is\nnecessary to ensure the right of access to a payment account with basic\nfeatures for every EU consumer by means of binding European legislation. 58 million EU consumers do not have a payment account. Several\nfactors were identified as the main drivers for this, including the lack of a consistent\nregulatory framework across the EU, refusal based on nationality or lack of\nresidence, the high price of the account as well as consumers' lack of\nfinancial education and awareness and low confidence in the financial system. \nThe impact assessment considered a range of\npolicy options and sub-options.[11]\nIt concluded that the most appropriate policy measure to address the issue\nidentified is to impose a legal obligation on Member States to ensure the right\nof access to a payment account with basic features for every consumer. The\nfeatures of basic payment accounts should be enlarged from those contained in\nthe Recommendation to include internet banking and online purchasing. The new measures will improve the availability, accessibility, and\naffordability of basic payment services. This, in turn, is expected to\nsubstantially reduce consumer detriment, enhance financial and social inclusion\nand consumer confidence, encourage cross-border mobility and promote the full\nparticipation of the greatest possible number of consumers in the internal\nmarket. \nThe impact assessment was first submitted\nto the Impact Assessment Board on 27 July 2012. The Board asked for\nresubmission with additional information on the problem definition, on\nsubsidiarity aspects, and a critical review of the proportionality and EU value\nadded of the presented options involving binding measures. The Board also asked\nfor the presentation of the options and their expected impacts to be improved\nand for the report to more consistently refer to the views of different\nstakeholder groups throughout. The impact assessment was resubmitted on 29\nOctober 2012. On 28 November the Board stated it could\nnot issue a positive opinion and proposed some further amendments concerning mostly\nthe issue of cross-border switching. In response, the Commission services made\nadditional changes to the text, including reinforcing the interlinks between\nthe problem areas, clarifying the trans-national dimension of the problem, and\nproviding further detail on stakeholder views as well as additional insight\nwith respect to the issue of cross-border switching.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union. As explained above, by setting\nup an EU level framework in the fields covered by the proposal, it aims to\nremove the remaining barriers to the free movement of payment services and, more broadly, to the free movement of goods, persons, services\nand capital for which a fully integrated and developed single\nmarket for payment services is vital. The proposal also prevents any further\nfragmentation of the single market which could occur if Member States were to\ntake diverging and inconsistent regulatory actions in this field. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle\nAccording to the principle of\nsubsidiarity, EU action may only be taken if the envisaged aims cannot be\nachieved by Member States alone. EU intervention is\nneeded to improve the proper functioning of the\ninternal market and avoid the distortion of competition in the field of retail\nbanking. \nDifferent regulatory frameworks, or the\nlack thereof, raise barriers to entry across borders. An EU initiative will\nbetter address factors that prevent the pursuit of business or raise the cost\nof doing business in another Member State relative to the costs faced by\ndomestic providers. Credit institutions that seek to operate across borders not\nonly need to meet differing requirements but are also prevented from making\nfull use of economies of scale in developing processes and in operations in\nareas such as back office activities. \nLow customer\nmobility in general and inefficient switching mechanisms in particular, create\nobstacles to market entrants gaining new clients. Inaction or action from\nMember States alone is likely to result in different sets of rules, leading to\nuncompetitive markets and unequal levels of consumer protection in the EU. However,\ncommon criteria established at EU level for the functioning of the retail banking\nsector will provide consumers with the necessary information required to make\ninformed choices. This, in turn, will contribute to the strengthening of\ncompetition and to the efficient allocation of resources within the EU\nfinancial retail market to the benefit of businesses and consumers. \nMoreover, an\nEU-level playing field will allow consumers to participate in e-commerce and\nthe digital market, and thereby take advantage of more attractive products and\nservices in other Member States. As regards transparency of bank fees and\nswitching of accounts, self-regulatory initiatives have been tested but have\nproven unsatisfactory and ineffective. Finally, for access to payment accounts\nwith basic features in particular, implementation of the 2011 Recommendation on\naccess to a basic payment account has been insufficient. Rules on access\ntherefore remain patchy throughout the EU and is unlikely to change in the near\nfuture, especially given the global financial turmoil and the retrenchment of national\nmarkets. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\nThe actions entailed by EU level\nintervention are limited to those necessary to achieve the stated objectives.\nThe elements of the package are complementary and provide the right balance\nbetween effectiveness in ensuring a fully functioning internal market for\nretail financial services with a high level of consumer protection and due\nregard to efficiency.\nWith respect to the transparency and\ncomparability of payment account fees the proposal takes a flexible approach,\nfor example, by mandating standardised terminology at a national level and only\nstandardising terminology at an EU level where it is possible to do so. In\nrelation to switching, the time allowed for the switching of payment accounts\ncross border is doubled (this provision will be subject to review after 5\nyears). For access, whilst this initiative establishes a right of access to a\npayment account with basic features, it leaves considerable flexibility to\nMember States to determine how this is implemented. \nFor discrimination in relation to place of\nresidence, the proposal includes a general provision building on the approach\nfollowed in Article 20 of Directive 2006/123 for non-financial services. A more\nspecific obligation is only established for payment accounts with basic\nfeatures. \nOnly binding legislation will ensure a\nlevel playing field throughout the EU, minimising costs and maximising the\nscope for economies of scale for account providers seeking to operate\ncross-border. Although adopting binding legislation imposes an implementation\nburden for stakeholders in terms of time and money, this burden will be similar\nto that incurred under a Recommendation or self-regulation, if properly\napplied. \n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instrument\nProposed instrument: Directive.\nThe attempts to address the issues of\ncomparability of payment account fees and account switching through\nself-regulatory measures were largely unsuccessful. The implementation of the\nCommon Principles for payment account switching in the Member States was mostly\nevidenced to be unsatisfactory. This may, to a large degree, be the result of\nthe lack of monitoring and enforcement measures within a self-regulatory\napproach. The efforts made to develop, together with the industry, a self-regulatory\ninitiative to increase the comparability of payment account fees did not lead\nto a successful outcome either. Self-regulation would not, therefore, be an\neffective solution. \nCompliance with the Commission's\nRecommendation on access to a basic payment account was also largely inadequate.\nOnly three Member States broadly complied with it and more than half the Member\nStates had no framework in place at all to promote the right of access. As with\ncomparability and transparency and switching, a non-binding measure proved to\nbe unsuccessful.\nThe introduction of a\nbinding measure is the most effective and efficient way of achieving the set\nobjectives. Only a binding legislative instrument can guarantee that the policy\noptions are introduced in all 27 Member States and that the rules are\nenforceable. A Directive allows for consideration of national specificities in\nthe payment account market. This would help to ensure a level playing field for\nboth consumers and businesses throughout the EU. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis proposal has no implication for the\nbudget of the EU or those of EU agencies.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review/revision/sunset\nclause\nThe proposal includes a review clause.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European Economic Area\nThe proposed act concerns the internal\nmarket and should therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed explanation of\nthe proposal \nThe following short summary aims at\nfacilitating the decision making process by outlining the main substance of the\nDirective.\nArticle 1 (subject\nmatter and scope) defines the scope of the Directive. \nArticle 2\n(definitions) contains the definitions of the terms used in the Directive. \nArticle 3 (List of\nthe most representative payment services subject to a fee at national level and\nstandardised terminology) requires Member States to establish a list of the\nmost representative payment services subject to a fee at national level and standardised\nterminology for these services. \nArticle 4 (Fee\ninformation document and glossary) requires Member States to establish the\nobligation for payment service providers to provide consumers with the list of\nthe most representative payment services subject to a fee at national level\nfrom Article 3 and their corresponding fees. This information should be\nprovided in a standard format. The provision also requires Member States to\nestablish the obligation for payment service providers to make available a\nglossary of at least the services contained in the list.\nArticle 5 (Statement\nof fees) requires Member States to establish the obligation for payment service\nproviders to provide customers with information on all fees incurred at least\nannually. This information should be provided in a standard format. \nArticle 6 (Contractual\nand commercial information) requires payment service providers to use the standardised\nterminology from Article 3 in their contractual and commercial information,\nwhere relevant. \nArticle 7 (Comparison\nwebsites) establishes an obligation on Member States to ensure that consumers\nhave access to at least one website comparing payment account fees. Member\nStates shall establish an accreditation scheme for private operators. \nArticle 8 (Packaged\noffers) requires Member States to establish the obligation on payment service\nproviders, when offering a payment account together with another financial\nservice or product as part of a package, to provide the customer with the\nnecessary information on the separate components. \nArticle 9 (Provision\nof the switching service) requires Member States to establish a general\nobligation for payment service providers to make a switching service available\nto any consumer who holds an account with a payment service provider located in\nthe Union.\nArticle 10 (The\nswitching service) establishes the specific roles and obligations for the\nreceiving and transferring payment service providers in the context of the\nswitching service. \nArticle 11 (Fees\nconnected with the switching service) establishes principles to guarantee that\nthe charges related to the switching services, if any, are appropriate and in\nline with the costs incurred.\nArticle 12 (Financial\nloss for consumers) establishes the obligation for payment service providers to\nrefund charges incurred by consumers due to their mistake or delay during the\nswitching service. It also aims to prevent consumers from financial loss, as a\nresult of misdirected credit transfers or direct debits by third parties.\nArticle 13 (Information\nabout the switching service) establishes the obligation for payment service\nproviders to make information available to consumers about the switching\nservice. \nArticles 14 (Non-discrimination) requires\nMember States to ensure that consumers are not discriminated against on the\nbasis of their nationality or residence when applying for a payment account or\nin their use of a payment account. \nArticle 15 (Right of access to a payment\naccount with basic features) establishes a right of access to a basic payment\naccount for consumers in any Member State. It also establishes an obligation on\nMember States to designate at least one payment service provider to offer a\nbasic payment account.\nArticle 16 (Characteristics of a payment\naccount with basic features) specifies the list of payment services that a\npayment account with basic features should include. \nArticle 17 (Associated fees) requires Member\nStates to ensure that the services indicated in Article 16 are offered by\npayment service providers free of charge or for a reasonable fee. \nArticle 18 (Framework contracts and\ntermination) recalls that Directive 2007/64/EC is\napplicable to payment accounts with basic features. However it provides for a\nlimited list of grounds that may justify the termination of the framework\ncontract of a payment account with basic features by the payment service\nprovider.\nArticle 19 (General information on payment\naccounts with basic features) requires Member States to ensure that measures\nare in place to raise awareness of basic payment accounts.\nArticle 20 (Competent\nauthorities) regulates the procedures for designating the national authorities responsible\nfor the application of provisions in the Directive.\nArticle 21 (Alternative\ndispute resolution) requires Member States to establish specific requirements\nfor the settlement of disputes between consumers and payment service providers.\n\nArticles 22\n(Administrative measures and sanctions) requires Member States to establish\nrules on sanctions for breaches of the national provisions adopted to implement\nthis Directive. \nArticles 23\n(Delegated acts) and 24 (Exercise of the delegation) empower the Commission to\nadopt delegated acts and sets out how this power should be used.\nArticle 25 (Implementing\nacts) empowers the Commission to adopt implementing acts and sets out how this\npower should be used.\nArticles 26 (Evaluation)\nand 27 (Review clause) sets out the mechanisms for assessing the effective\napplication of the provisions in the Directive and, if needed, propose changes\nto it.\nArticle 28 (Transposition)\nprovides the obligation for Member States to adopt the legislative measures\nnecessary to implement the present Directive.\nArticle 29 (Entry\ninto force) states the date upon which the Directive enters into force.\nArticle 30 (Addressees)\nstates that this Directive is addressed to Member States.\n2013/0139 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nOn the comparability of fees related to\npayment accounts, \npayment account switching\nand access to payment accounts with basic features \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\nEconomic and Social Committee[12],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[13],\n\nAfter consulting the European Data\nProtection Supervisor[14],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n26(2) TFEU the internal market is to comprise an area without internal\nfrontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is\nensured. Fragmentation of the internal market is detrimental to\ncompetitiveness, growth and job creation within the Union. Eliminating direct\nand indirect obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market is\nessential for its completion. EU action with respect to the internal market in\nthe retail financial services sector has already substantially contributed to\ndeveloping cross-border activity of payment service providers, improving\nconsumer choice and increasing the quality and transparency of the offers. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, Directive\n2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on\npayment services in the internal market amending Directives 97/7/EC,\n2002/65/EC, 2005/60/EC, and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 97/5/EC\n(\"Payment Services Directive\") has established basic transparency\nrequirements for fees charged by payment service providers in relation to\nservices offered on payment accounts. This has substantially facilitated the\nactivity of payment service providers, creating uniform rules with respect to\nthe provision of payment services and the information to be provided, reduced the\nadministrative burden and generated cost savings for payment service providers.\n\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, more can be done\nto improve and develop the single market for retail banking. In particular, the\nlack of transparency and comparability of fees as well as the difficulties in\nswitching payment accounts still pose barriers to the deployment of a fully integrated\nmarket. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current conditions of\nthe Single Market may deter payments services providers from exercising their\nfreedom to establish or to provide services within the Union because of the\ndifficulty in attracting customers when entering a new market. Entering new\nmarkets often entails large investments. Such investments are only justified if\nthe provider foresees sufficient opportunities and a corresponding demand from\nconsumers. The low level of mobility of consumers with respect to retail financial\nservices is to a large extent due to the lack of transparency and comparability\nas regards the fees and services on offer, as well as difficulties in relation\nto the switching of payment accounts. These factors also stifle demand. This is\nparticularly true in the cross-border context. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, significant\nbarriers to the completion of the single market in the area of payment accounts\nmay be created by the fragmentation of existing national regulatory frameworks.\nExisting provisions at national level with respect to payment accounts, and\nparticularly with respect to the comparability of fees and payment account\nswitching diverge. For switching, the lack of uniform binding measures at EU\nlevel has led to divergent practices and measures at national level. These\ndifferences are even more marked in the area of comparability of fees, where no\nmeasures, even of a self-regulatory nature, exist at EU level. Should these\ndifferences become more significant in the future, as banks tend to tailor\ntheir practices to national markets, this would raise the cost of operating\ncross-border relative to the costs faced by domestic providers and therefore make\nthe pursuit of business cross-border less attractive. Cross-border activity in\nthe internal market is hampered by obstacles to consumers opening a payment\naccount abroad. Existing restrictive eligibility criteria may prevent European\ncitizens from moving freely within the Union. Providing all consumers with access\nto a payment account will permit their participation in the internal market and\nallow them to obtain the benefits of the single market.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, since some\nprospective customers do not open accounts, either because they are denied them\nor because they are not offered adequate products the potential demand for\npayment account services in the EU is currently not fully exploited. Wider\nconsumer participation in the internal market would further incentivise payment\nservice providers to enter new markets. Also, creating the conditions to allow\nall consumers to access a payment account is a necessary means to foster their\nparticipation in the internal market and to allow them to reap the benefits the\nSingle Market has brought about. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transparency and comparability\nof fees have been addressed in a self-regulatory initiative, initiated by the\nbanking industry. However, no final agreement was found on these guidelines. As\nregards switching, the common principles established in 2008 by the European\nBanking Industry Committee provide a model mechanism for switching between bank\naccounts offered by payment service providers located in the same Member State. However, given their non-binding nature, these principles have been applied\nin an inconsistent manner throughout the EU and with ineffective results.\nMoreover, the Common Principles only address bank account switching at national\nlevel and do not address cross-border switching. Finally, as regards access to\na basic payment account, the Commission Recommendation 2011/442/EU of 18 July\n2011 invited Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure its\napplication at the latest six months after its publication. To date, only few\nMember States comply with the main principles of the Recommendation. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis vital, therefore, to establish a uniform set of rules to tackle the issue of\nlow customer mobility and in particular to improve\ncomparison of payment account services and fees and to incentivise payment\naccount switching as well as avoid that consumers who intend to purchase a\npayment account cross-border are discriminated on the basis of residency. Moreover,\nit is essential to adopt adequate measures to foster\ncustomers\u2019 participation in the payment accounts market.\nThese measures will incentivize entry for payment\nservice providers in the internal market and ensure a level playing field, thereby\nstrengthening competition and the efficient allocation\nof resources within the EU financial retail market to the benefit of businesses\nand consumers. Also, transparent fee information and switching possibilities\ncombined with the right of access to basic account services will allow EU\ncitizens to move and shop around more easily within the Union and therefore benefit\nfrom a fully functioning internal\nmarket in the area of retail financial services and contribute to its further\ndevelopment.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive applies to\npayment accounts held by consumers. Consequently, accounts held by businesses,\neven small or micro enterprises, unless held in a personal capacity, are\noutside its scope. Furthermore, this Directive does not cover savings accounts,\nwhich may have more limited payments functions.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The definitions contained\nin the Directive are aligned with those contained in other Union legislation,\nand in particular those of Directive 2007/64/EC and those of Regulation (EU) No\n260/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2012\nestablishing technical and business requirements for credit transfers and\ndirect debits in euro and amending Regulation (EC) No 924/2009[15].\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is vital for consumers\nto be able to understand fees so that they can compare offers from different payment\nservice providers and make informed decisions as to which account is most suitable\nfor their needs. Comparison between fees cannot be achieved where payment\nservice providers use different terminology for the same payment services and\nprovide information in different formats. Standardised terminology, coupled\nwith targeted fee information for the most representative payment services in a\nconsistent format, can help consumers to both understand and compare fees. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumers would benefit most\nfrom information that is concise and easy to compare between different payment\nservice providers. The tools made available to consumers to compare payment\naccount offers would not have a positive impact if the time invested in going\nthrough lengthy lists of fees for different offers outweighed the benefit of\nchoosing the offer that represents the best value. Accordingly, fee terminology\nshould only be standardised for the most representative terms and definitions\nwithin Member States in order to avoid the risk of excessive information. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fee terminology should\nbe determined by national competent authorities, allowing for consideration of\nthe specificities of local markets. To be considered representative, services\nshould be subject to a fee at a minimum of one payment service provider in\nMember States. In addition, where possible, fee terminology should be\nstandardised at EU level, thus allowing for comparison across the Union. The European Banking Authority (EBA) should establish guidelines to assist Member\nStates to determine the most representative payment services subject to a fee\nat national level. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once national competent\nauthorities have determined a provisional list of the most representative\nservices subject to a fee at national level together with terms and\ndefinitions, the Commission should review them to identify, by means of\ndelegated acts, the services that are common to the majority of Member States\nand propose standardised EU level terms and definitions for them. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to help consumers\ncompare payment account fees throughout the single market easily, payment\nservice providers should provide consumers with a list of fees charged for the\nservices listed in the standardised terminology. This would also contribute\ntowards establishing a level playing field between credit institutions\ncompeting in the payment account market. The fee information document should\nonly contain information on the most representative payment services in each Member State, using the terms and definitions established at EU level where relevant. In\norder to help consumers understand the fees they have to pay for their payment\naccount, a glossary providing explanations for at least the fees and services contained\nin the list should be made available to them. The\nglossary should serve as a useful tool to encourage a better understanding of\nthe meaning of fees, contributing towards empowering consumers to choose from a\nwider choice of payment account offers. An obligation\nshould also be introduced for payment service providers to inform consumers, at\nleast annually, of all the fees charged on their account. Ex-post information should be provided in a dedicated summary. It\nshould provide a complete overview of the fees incurred to enable a consumer to\nunderstand what fee expenditures relate to, and to assess the need to either\nmodify consumption patterns or move to another provider. This benefit would be\nmaximised by the ex-post fee information covering the same services as the\nex-ante information. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To meet the needs of consumers,\nit is necessary to ensure that fee information on payment accounts is accurate,\nclear and comparable. This Directive should therefore lay down common presentation\nrequirements for the fee information document and the statement of fees, in\norder to ensure that they are understandable and comparable for consumers. The\nsame format, order of items and headings should be followed for every fee\ninformation document and statement of fees in each Member State, allowing\nconsumers to compare the two documents, thereby maximising understanding and use\nof the information. The fee information document and statement of fees should\nbe clearly distinguishable from other communications. They should be identified\nby a common symbol.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nconsistent use of applicable EU level terminology across the Union, Member\nStates should establish an obligation for payment service providers to use the\napplicable EU level terminology together with the remaining national standardised\nterminology identified in the provisional list when communicating with\nconsumers, including in the fee information document and the statement of fees.\nExcept for in the fee information document and statement of fees, payment\nservice providers may use brand names to denote services.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\nwebsites are an effective means for consumers to assess the merits of different\npayment account offers in a single space. They can provide the right balance\nbetween the need for information to be clear and concise, yet complete and\ncomprehensive, by enabling users to obtain more detailed information where this\nis of interest to them. They can also reduce search costs as consumers will not\nneed to collect information separately from payment service providers. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to obtain impartial information on bank fees, consumers should be able to\naccess comparison websites which are operationally independent from payment\nservice providers. Member States should therefore ensure that at least one such\nwebsite is available to consumers in their respective territories. Such\ncomparison websites may be operated by competent authorities, other public\nauthorities and/or accredited private operators. Member\nStates should establish a voluntary accreditation\nscheme allowing private operators of comparison websites to apply for\naccreditation in accordance with specified quality criteria. A comparison\nwebsite operated by a competent authority or other public authority should be\nestablished where a privately operated website has not been accredited. Such\nwebsites should also comply with the quality criteria.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is current practice for\npayment service providers to offer a payment account in a package with other\nfinancial products or services. This practice can be a means for payment\nservice providers to diversify their offer and to compete against each other,\nand in the end it can be beneficial for consumers. However the Commission study\non tying practices in the financial sector conducted in 2009 as well as\nrelevant consultations and consumer complaints have showed that payment service\nproviders may offer bank accounts packaged with products not requested by\nconsumers and which are not essential for payment accounts, such as household\ninsurance. Moreover, it has been observed that these practices may reduce\ntransparency and comparability of prices, limit purchasing options for\nconsumers and negatively impact upon their mobility. Therefore, Member States\nshould ensure that when payment service providers offer packaged payment\naccounts consumers are provided with information on the applicable fees for the\npayment account and for each other financial service included in the package\nseparately. These obligations should not apply to services which are naturally\nconnected to the use of the payment account, such as withdrawals, wire\ntransfers or payment cards. As a result, these services should be excluded from\nthe scope of this provision. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumers are only\nincentivised to switch accounts if the process does not entail an excessive\nadministrative and financial burden. The procedure for switching payment\naccounts to another payment service provider should be clear and quick. The\nfees, if any, charged by payment service providers in relation to the switching\nservice should be in line with the actual cost incurred by payment service\nproviders. In order to have positive impact on competition, switching should\nalso be facilitated at cross-border level. Given that switching cross-border\ncould be more complex than the switching at national level and may require\npayment service providers to adapt and refine their internal procedures, longer\ndeadlines for the cross-border switch should be foreseen. The need to maintain\ndifferent deadlines should be evaluated in the context of the review of the\nproposed Directive. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The switching process\nshould be as straightforward as possible for the consumer. Accordingly Member\nStates should ensure that the receiving payment service provider is responsible\nfor initiating and managing the process on behalf of the consumer.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumers should be allowed\nto ask the receiving payment service provider to perform the switch of all or\npart of the recurring payments, as well as transferring the remaining balance,\nideally within a single meeting with the receiving payment service provider. To\nthis end, consumers should be able to sign one authorisation giving consent to\nthe mentioned tasks. Before giving the authorisation the consumer should be\ninformed of all the steps of the procedure necessary to complete the switch.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The co-operation of the\ntransferring payment service provider is necessary for the switch to be\nsuccessful. The receiving payment service provider should be provided by the\ntransferring payment service provider with all the information it considers\nnecessary to reinstate the recurrent payments on the new payment account.\nHowever, such information should not exceed what is necessary to carry out the\nswitch and the receiving payment service provider should not ask for\nsuperfluous information.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumers should not be\nsubject to penalties or any other financial detriment caused by the\nmisdirection of incoming credit transfers or direct debits. This is\nparticularly important for certain categories of payer and payee, such as utilities\ncompanies, which use electronic means (e.g. databases) to store information on\nconsumers' account details and perform numerous periodical transactions\ninvolving large numbers of consumers. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\nguarantee that consumers who intend to open a payment account are not\ndiscriminated against on the basis of their nationality or place of residence.\nWhile it is important for payment service providers to ensure that their\ncustomers are not using the financial system for illegal purposes such as fraud,\nmoney laundering or terrorism financing, they should not impose barriers to\nconsumers who want to benefit from the advantages of the single market by\npurchasing payment accounts cross-border. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumers who are legally\nresident in the Union and who do not hold a payment account in a certain Member\nState should be in a position to open and use a payment account with basic\nfeatures in that Member State. In order to ensure the widest possible access to\nsuch accounts, consumers should\nhave access to them irrespective\nof their financial circumstances, such as unemployment or personal bankruptcy,\nand of their place of residence. Moreover, the right to access a payment account with basic features in any\nMember State should be granted in conformity with the requirements set out in\nDirective 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\nOctober 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the\npurpose of money laundering and terrorist financing[16], in particular with regard to\ncustomer due diligence procedures. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should ensure\nthat at least one payment service provider offers a payment account with basic\nfeatures to consumers. Access should not be overly difficult and should not entail\nexcessive costs for consumers. In this respect, Member States should consider\nfactors such as the location of the designated payment service providers in\ntheir territory. In order to minimise the risk for consumers to become\nfinancially excluded, Member States should improve financial education,\nincluding at school, and combat over-indebtedness. Furthermore, Member States\nshould promote initiatives of payment service providers in order to facilitate\nthe combination of providing payment accounts with basic features and financial\neducation.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To exercise their right to\naccess a basic payment account, consumers should not already hold a payment\naccount in the same territory. When it is not possible to use electronic\nsystems to establish whether or not a consumer already holds a payment account,\npayment service providers should accept a declaration by consumers as a reliable means of verifying that they do not already hold a payment account. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumers should be\nguaranteed access to a range of basic payment services, for which a minimum\nnumber of operations shall be determined by Member States in a way that should\ntake into account both the needs of the consumers and the commercial practices\nin the Member State concerned. Beyond this list of minimum services, banks may\napply their regular fees. Services linked to basic payment accounts should\ninclude the facility to deposit and withdraw money. Consumers should be able to\nundertake essential payment transactions such as receiving income or benefits,\npaying bills or taxes and purchasing goods and services, including via direct\ndebit, credit transfer and the use of a payment card. Such services should\nallow the purchase of goods and services online and should give consumers the\nopportunity to initiate payment orders via the payment service provider\u2019s\nonline banking facility, where available. However, a payment account with basic\nfeatures should not be restricted to online usage as this would create an\nobstacle for consumers without internet access. Consumers should not be given access\nto an overdraft facility with a payment account with basic features. However, Member\nStates may allow payment services providers to offer buffering facilities for\nvery small amounts in relation to payment accounts with basic features. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\nbasic payment accounts are available to the widest possible range of consumers,\nthey should be offered free of charge or for a reasonable fee. Furthermore, any\nadditional charges to the consumer for non-compliance with the terms laid down\nin the contract should be reasonable. Member States should establish what\nconstitutes a reasonable charge according to national circumstances. In order\nto ensure consistency and efficiency in the implementation of the principle of\na reasonable charge, the EBA should be tasked with issuing guidelines as\nregards the general criteria identified in this Directive. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The payment service provider should refuse to open or should terminate a contract for a payment account\nwith basic features only in specific circumstances, such as non-compliance with\nthe legislation on money laundering and terrorist financing or on the\nprevention and investigation of crimes. Even in these cases, a refusal can only\nbe justified where the consumer does not comply with the provisions of that\nlegislation and not because the procedure to check compliance with the legislation\nis too burdensome or costly. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Clear and comprehensible\ninformation on the right to a bank account with basic features should be\nprovided by Member States and payment service providers to consumers. The\ninformation should cover the main features and conditions for using the account\nand also the steps consumers should follow to exercise their right to open a\npayment account with basic features. Notably, consumers should be informed that\nthe purchase of additional services is not compulsory in order to access a\npayment account with basic features.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\ndesignate competent authorities that are empowered to ensure enforcement of\nthis Directive and that are granted investigation and enforcement powers.\nDesignated competent authorities shall have adequate resources for the\nperformance of their duties. Member States should be able to designate\ndifferent competent authorities in order to enforce the wide ranging\nobligations laid down in this Directive.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumers should have\naccess to effective and efficient out-of-court\nredress procedures for the settlement of disputes arising out of rights and\nobligations established under this Directive. Such access is already ensured by\nDirective 2013/\u2026/EU insofar as relevant contractual disputes are concerned.\nHowever, consumers should also have access to out-of-court redress procedures\nin the event of -pre-contractual disputes concerning rights and obligations\nestablished by this Directive, e.g. when they are denied access to a payment\naccount with basic features. Compliance with the provisions laid down in this\nDirective requires the processing of consumers\u2019 personal data. Such processing\nis governed by Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the\nprocessing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[17]. The present Directive should\ntherefore comply with the rules established in Directive 95/46/EC and the\nnational laws implementing them.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to attain the\nobjectives set out in this Directive, the power to adopt acts in accordance\nwith Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect\nof identifying the standardised terminology at EU level for payment services\ncommon to a number of Member States and the related definitions for these terms\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should\nbe conferred on the Commission. These powers relate to the definition of the\nformat of the fee information document, its common\nsymbol and the order in which the services contained in\nit shall be presented, as well as to the format of the statement\nof fees, its common symbol and the order in which the\nservices contained in it shall be presented. These powers should be exercised\nin accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and\nof the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles\nconcerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise\nof implementing powers.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Within three years from\nentry into force of this Directive and every two years thereafter, Member\nStates should obtain reliable annual statistics on the functioning of the\nmeasures introduced by the present Directive. They should use any relevant\nsources of information and communicate\nthat information to the\nCommission. \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A review of this Directive\nshould be carried out five years after its entry into force in order to take\naccount of market developments, such as the emergence of new types of payment\naccounts and payment services, as well as developments in other areas of Union\nlaw and the experiences of Member States. The review should assess whether the\nmeasures introduced have improved consumer understanding of payment account\nfees, the comparability of payment accounts and the ease of switching accounts.\nIt should also determine how many basic payment accounts have been opened\nincluding by previously unbanked consumers. It should also assess whether\nextended deadlines for payment service providers performing cross-border\nswitching are to be maintained for a longer period.
