The\nfree movement of goods is the most developed and best established of the four fundamental\nfreedoms laid down in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\n(TFEU) that make up the internal market. But it would be complacent to believe\nthat the job is done. True, harmonisation rules[1]\nhave now been put in place for most products and the free movement provisions\nof the TFEU, supplemented by the mutual recognition principle, are sufficient\nfor the rest. But even a good legislative framework is only as effective as\nthose using it allow it to be. Alongside responsible economic operators,\nprepared to adapt their methods and incur the costs necessary to comply with\nthe law, there will always be those traders who cut corners or deliberately\nflout the rules to \u2018make a fast buck\u2019 or gain a competitive edge.\nThese sharp practices not only skew the single\nmarket against the type of trader we wish to encourage, damaging its\neffectiveness and causing detriment to consumers and business, they also\nthreaten the public interests that our legislation is designed to protect. In\naddition to financial burden, the European citizen is exposed to potentially\ndangerous products. The environment is put at risk. Public security may even be\nundermined.\nMarket surveillance is the answer. If high\nquality legislation, based on a sound evaluation of market needs is one side of\nthe coin, market surveillance is the other. It should enable unsafe or\notherwise harmful products to be identified and kept or taken off the market\nand unscrupulous or even criminal operators punished. It should also act as a\npowerful deterrent.\nMarket surveillance has not kept pace with\ndevelopments in the Union regulatory framework. In a single market in which\nproducts circulate freely throughout 27 (and in some sectors up to 32)[2] national territories, market\nsurveillance needs to be highly coordinated and capable of reacting rapidly\nover a huge area. Advances have been made over the last decade, in particular\nwith the implementation of Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and\nof the Council on general product safety[3]\n(the \"General Product Safety Directive\" or simply GPSD) which had to\nbe transposed by 2004 and with the coming into application in 2010 of\nRegulation (EC) 765/2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and\nmarket surveillance[4].\nHowever, overlap of market surveillance rules and obligations of economic\noperators laid down in various pieces of Union legislation (the GPSD, the\nRegulation (EC) 765/2008 and sector-specific Union harmonisation legislation)\nhas led to confusion on the part of both economic operators and national\nauthorities and has seriously hampered the effectiveness of market surveillance\nactivity in the Union.\nThis proposal aims at clarifying the regulatory\nframework for market surveillance in the field of non-food products. It merges\nthe rules on market surveillance of the GPSD, Regulation (EC) 765/2008 and many\nsector-specific pieces of Union harmonisation legislation into a single legal\ninstrument that applies horizontally across all sectors.\nMarket surveillance action by national\nauthorities has important implications for small and medium-sized enterprises.\nConsequently, their situation should be taken into account particularly in\nrelation to action that could impose additional administrative burdens.\nThe proposal is part of the \"Product\nSafety and Market Surveillance Package\" which also includes a proposal for\na regulation on consumer product safety (replacing the GPSD) and a multi-annual\naction plan for market surveillance covering the period 2013-2015. After the\nSingle Market Act (2011)[5]\nhad identified the revision of the GPSD and the drawing up of a multi-annual\naction plan for market surveillance as initiatives that will contribute to\nboosting growth and creating jobs, the Commission added this proposal for a\nsingle market surveillance regulation to the other two initiatives in response\nto calls from the European Parliament and from stakeholders in industry and\npublic administrations. The Single Market Act II[6],\nadopted in 2012, confirms the \"Product Safety and Market Surveillance\nPackage\" as a key action \"to improve the safety of products\ncirculating in the EU through better coherence and enforcement of product\nsafety and market surveillance rules\".\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nFrom 2009 to 2011, the Commission held\nextensive public consultations on the revision of the GPSD (for more details\nsee the Proposal for a Consumer Product Safety Regulation). One of the main\nsubstantive areas related to the improvement of market surveillance cooperation\nand coordination, including the functioning of RAPEX. \nOne of the outcomes of the public consultation\nprocess and the dialogue with interested parties was to transfer the market\nsurveillance rules from the current GPSD into a new standalone Market\nSurveillance Regulation to be developed and adopted hand in hand with the\nproposal for the revision of the GPSD. \nThe impact assessment prepared by the\nCommission thus covers aspects related to both the GPSD revision and this\nproposal. \nThe Commission's Impact Assessment Board\ndelivered a favourable opinion in September 2012.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nMain elements\nThe overarching objective of this new\nregulation is to simplify the Union market surveillance framework fundamentally\nso that it works better for its main users: market surveillance authorities and\neconomic operators. At present, different product evaluation requirements and\nprocedures apply depending on the category of product involved. Market\nsurveillance authorities should be able to do their job of evaluating the risk\npresented by products without being hindered by unnecessary complexities and to\nshare the results of their work efficiently. \nThe new Regulation will get rid of overlaps,\nclose gaps, reduce the need to categorise products to a minimum and assimilate\nas far as possible the rules and procedures applicable to all products. This\nwill result in a more even application of market surveillance rules across the\nMember States, providing better protection for consumers and other users, more\nuniform trading conditions for economic operators, reduced administrative\nburdens and enhanced information- and work-sharing between market surveillance\nauthorities. This is particularly important in the context of the economic\ncrisis and responds to the need to make the internal market for goods more\nefficient and competitive.\n\u00b7              \nReducing the number of pieces of legislation\ncontaining market surveillance rules\nAt first sight, this might seem to be a rather\ncosmetic objective but the current set of market surveillance rules is spread\nacross the GPSD, Regulation 765/2008 and a range of sector-specific legislation\n(which is increasingly based on the reference provisions of Decision 768/2008).\nThis \u20183-tier\u2019 system causes problems for market surveillance authorities and economic\noperators alike and was expressly targeted for criticism by the European\nParliament. The new Regulation would produce a one tier system in which all of\nthose rules are brought together in a single instrument. It may be complemented\nby sector-specific rules laid down in the relevant Union harmonisation\nlegislation. \n\u00b7              \nEliminating overlaps in the current system\nRegulation 765/2008 and sector-specific\nlegislation apply to all harmonised products regardless whether they are\nintended (or likely) to be used by consumers or professionals. The GPSD applies\nto all consumer products regardless whether they are non-harmonised or\nharmonised. This obviously creates overlaps in relation to harmonised products\nintended or likely to be used by consumers. The current system tries to deal\nwith this by means of complicated lex specialis provisions but this is universally\nregarded as unsatisfactory. \nThe new market surveillance Regulation would\ndispense with the distinction between consumer and professional products for\nmarket surveillance purposes. It would also avoid making a distinction between\nharmonised products and non-harmonised products except where this is\nunavoidable in applying certain specific provisions. To the greatest extent\npossible the applicable rules are the same for all products.\n\u00b7              \nDovetailing the RAPEX and Union evaluation\nprocedures\nAt present, two separate procedures operate,\nsometimes in parallel, which require the Member States to notify to the Commission\nand the other Member States certain market surveillance action taken at\nnational level. This is an especially problematic aspect of the overlapping categories\nof products mentioned above. Under the new Regulation the two procedures become\na single procedural flow with certain events triggering a single notification\nto the other Member States and the Commission (made using either the proven RAPEX\nrapid alert system or the Information and Communication System for Market\nSurveillance in accordance with the distinction made in this Regulation). \nIn the case of products which are subject to sector-specific\nUnion harmonisation legislation, in the event of disagreement among Member\nStates about action taken by one of their number, the proposal would empower\nthe Commission to decide whether the measures taken by the original notifying\nMember State are reasonable, necessary and proportionate and should be followed\nby all Member States in the interests of the single market. In this way, the\nmarket surveillance process may be brought to a definite close. This is not\nextended to products not subject to sector-specific Union harmonisation\nlegislation as such a decision cannot be taken in the absence of the essential\nrequirements for products that are laid down in that legislation.\nIn urgent situations the Commission is\nempowered to adopt temporary or permanent measures requiring consistent action\nacross the EU against products presenting a serious risk where the risk cannot\nbe satisfactorily addressed by one or several individual Member States. \n\u00b7              \nMaking the legislation more accessible and\nuser-friendly\nApart from being spread across three tiers of\nEU legislation (and in the case of directives, also in national implementing\nmeasures), current market surveillance provisions are not based around a chronological\nflow of events - from the identification by market surveillance authorities of\na product that may present a risk, through risk assessment, involvement of the economic\noperators, action by the national authorities, notification to the other Member\nStates, up to possible action across the Union by all Member States and, where\nnecessary, evaluation and decision by the Commission at Union level. Instead, market\nsurveillance authorities and economic operators must hunt around in the\nlegislation for the provisions that affect them directly. \nThe new Regulation sets out the whole process\nof a market surveillance exercise in a chronological, sequential manner. It\npresents a chain of events, incorporating relevant provisions on natural\njustice aspects, publication of information, notification etc. at each stage of\nthe procedure. This approach substantially improves the accessibility and\nuser-friendliness of the legislation, and hence its effectiveness.\nLegal basis\nThe proposal is based on Articles 33, 114 and\n207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nSubsidiarity\nMarket surveillance is an activity which is\ncarried out by the authorities of the Member States of the Union. This will not\nchange. However, in order to be effective, the market surveillance effort must\nbe uniform across the Union. If market surveillance is \u2018softer\u2019 in some parts\nof the Union than others, weak spots are created which threaten the public\ninterest and create unfair trading conditions. Furthermore, much of the risk\npresented by products to the various public interests that Union legislation\ntries to protect derives from products entering the Union from third countries.\nThere must be effective market surveillance along the entire length of the\nUnion\u2019s external borders.\nThere is therefore a need for Union legislation\nwhich creates uniform obligations in relation to the activities to be carried\nout, the resources to be attributed and the powers and duties of market\nsurveillance authorities. Equally, there must be an obligation to cooperate and\nto coordinate market surveillance and mechanisms and tools must be established\nto make possible and facilitate these endeavours. Penalties, financing and\nreporting also all need to be addressed at Union level.\nProportionality\nIn accordance with the principle of\nproportionality, the proposed modifications do not go beyond what is necessary\nto achieve the objectives set. The modifications introduced by the Regulation\ndo not impose unnecessary burdens or costs on industry, having particular\nregard to small and medium-sized enterprises, or administrations. Many\nmodifications to the existing legislative framework relate to improving its\nclarity and workability without introducing significant new requirements with\ncost implication. Where a modification has an impact on burdens or costs, the impact\nanalysis indicated that it represents the most proportionate response to the\nproblem identified. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe budgetary implications are already envisaged\nin existing or proposed programmes and respect the Commission proposal for the\nnew multiannual financial framework. This initiative will be financed through\nredeployment of existing resources. The details are set out in the financial\nstatement attached to this proposal.\n2013/0048 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non market surveillance of products and\namending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC, and Directives 94/9/EC,\n94/25/EC, 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 1999/5/EC, 2000/9/EC, 2000/14/EC, 2001/95/EC,\n2004/108/EC, 2006/42/EC, 2006/95/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2008/57/EC, 2009/48/EC,\n2009/105/EC, 2009/142/EC, 2011/65/EU, Regulation (EU) No 305/2011, Regulation\n(EC) No 764/2008 and Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and\nof the Council\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 33, 114 and 207\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[7],\nAfter consulting the European Data\nProtection Supervisor,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to guarantee the\nfree movement of products within the Union, it is necessary to ensure that they\nfulfil requirements providing a high level of protection of public interests\nsuch as health and safety in general, health and safety in the workplace,\nprotection of consumers, protection of the environment and public security.\nRobust enforcement of these requirements is essential to the proper protection\nof these interests and to create the conditions in which fair competition in\nthe Union goods market can thrive. Rules are therefore necessary on market\nsurveillance and on controls of products entering the Union from third\ncountries.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market surveillance\nactivities covered by this Regulation should not be directed exclusively\ntowards the protection of health and safety but should also be applicable to the\nenforcement of Union legislation which seeks to safeguard other public\ninterests, for example, by means of regulating the accuracy of measurement,\nelectromagnetic compatibility and energy efficiency. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to\nestablish an overall framework of rules and principles in relation to market\nsurveillance which should not affect the substantive rules of existing Union legislation\ndesigned to protect public interests such as health and safety, consumer\nprotection and the protection of the environment, but should aim at enhancing\ntheir operation.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting\nout the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the\nmarketing of products[8]\nwas adopted to establish a framework for market surveillance to complement and\nstrengthen existing provisions in Union harmonisation legislation relating to\nmarket surveillance and the enforcement of such provisions. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of\nensuring the equivalent and consistent enforcement of Union harmonisation\nlegislation, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 introduced a Union market surveillance\nframework, defining minimum requirements against the background of the\nobjectives to be achieved by Member States and a framework for administrative\ncooperation including the exchange of information among Member States.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2001/95/EC of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general\nproduct safety[9]\nestablished rules to ensure the safety of products intended for or likely to be\nused by consumers. Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 maintained the possibility for\nmarket surveillance authorities to take the more specific measures available to\nthem under that Directive.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Resolution of 8\nMarch 2011 on the revision of the General Product Safety Directive and market\nsurveillance[10]\nthe European Parliament states that having one single regulation is the only\nway to have one single market surveillance system for all products and\ntherefore urges the Commission to establish a single market surveillance system\nfor all products, based on one act covering both Directive 2001/95/EC and\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should\ntherefore integrate the provisions of Regulation 765/2008, Directive 2001/95/EC\nand several sector-specific acts of Union harmonisation legislation relating to\nmarket surveillance into a single regulation which covers products in both the\nharmonised and non-harmonised areas of the Union legislation, regardless\nwhether they are intended for use, or are likely to be used, by consumers or\nprofessionals. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union legislation\napplicable to products and processes of the food chain, and in particular\nRegulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29\nApril 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of\ncompliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules[11], establishes a comprehensive\nframework for the performance of official controls and other official\nactivities to verify compliance with feed and food law, rules on animal health\nand welfare, genetically modified organisms, plant health and plant\nreproductive material, plant protection products, and pesticides. These areas\nshould therefore be excluded from the scope of this Regulation. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union legislation\nconcerning medicinal products, medical devices, in vitro diagnostic medical\ndevices and substances of human origin contain special provisions to ensure\npost-market safety based in particular on sector-specific vigilance and market\nsurveillance systems. Those products should therefore also be excluded from the\nscope of this Regulation, with the exception of its provisions on control of\nproducts entering the Union market which should apply insofar as the relevant\nUnion legislation does not contain specific rules relating to the organisation\nof border controls. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2010/35/EU of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2010 on transportable\npressure equipment[12]\napplies not only to new transportable pressure equipment for the purpose of\nmaking it available on the market but also to certain other transportable\npressure equipment for the purposes of its periodic inspections, intermediate\ninspections, exceptional checks and use. It provides for the specific\nPi-marking and for a Union safeguard procedure and particular procedures for\ndealing with transportable pressure equipment presenting a risk at national\nlevel, with compliant transportable pressure equipment which presents a risk to\nhealth and safety and with formal non-compliance. Therefore, the procedures for\nthe controls of products within the Union laid down in this Regulation should\nnot apply to transportable pressure equipment subject to Directive 2010/35/EU.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should\nestablish a comprehensive framework for market surveillance in the Union. It\nshould define the scope of the products covered and those excluded, impose an\nobligation on Member States to organise and carry out market surveillance,\nrequire Member States to appoint market surveillance authorities and to specify\ntheir powers and duties, and make Member States responsible for setting up\ngeneral and sector-specific market surveillance programmes.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some Union harmonisation\nlegislation contains provisions on market surveillance and safeguard clauses. These\nmay be based on the reference provisions on market surveillance and safeguard\nclauses contained in Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products[13]. This Regulation should\ncontain all of the market surveillance provisions applicable to the products\nfalling within its scope. This Regulation should therefore include the reference\nprovisions on market surveillance and safeguard clauses contained in Decision\nNo 768/2008/EC. Provisions in existing Union harmonisation legislation that\nrelate to market surveillance and safeguard clauses, whether drafted before the\nadoption of Decision No 768/2008/EC or based on its reference provisions,\nshould be removed from that harmonisation legislation unless there are specific\nsectoral reasons for retaining them. Exemptions from the safeguard provisions should\nbe made in relation to products subject to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the\nRegistration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH),\ncertain fittings subject to Directive 2009/142/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 30 November 2009, certain pressure equipment subject to\nDirective 97/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 May 1997\nand certain pressure vessels subject to Directive 2009/105/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to make the entire\nmarket surveillance process transparent and easy to follow for both market\nsurveillance authorities and economic operators, the Regulation should clearly set\nout the chronological steps of that process, from the moment when market\nsurveillance authorities identify a product which they believe may present a\nrisk, to the assessment of the risk presented, the corrective action to be\ntaken by the relevant economic operator within a specified period and the\nmeasures to be taken by market surveillance authorities themselves if economic operators\ndo not comply or in cases of urgency. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market surveillance should\nbe based on the assessment of the risk presented by a product taking all\nrelevant data into account. A product that is subject to Union harmonisation\nlegislation which lays down essential requirements relating to protection of\ncertain public interests should be presumed not to present a risk to those\npublic interests if it complies with those essential requirements. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Products subject to Union\nharmonisation legislation that does not lay down essential requirements but\nwhich is designed to ensure the protection of certain public interests should\nbe presumed not to present a risk to those public interests provided that they\ncomply with that legislation.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly, a product that\nis not subject to Union harmonisation legislation but which complies with\nnational rules on the health and safety of persons or with European standards\nreferenced in the Official Journal of the European Union should be\npresumed not to present a risk to health and safety.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of this Regulation\nrisk assessment should be carried out to identify products which have the\npotential to affect adversely the public interests protected by [Regulation\n(EU) No xxxx (on consumer product safety)], sector-specific Union harmonisation\nlegislation and other Union legislation on products that are subject to this\nRegulation. It should include, where available, data on risks that have\nmaterialised previously with respect to the product in question. Account should\nalso be taken of any measures that may have been taken by the economic\noperators concerned to alleviate the risks. The particular potential\nvulnerability of consumers, as opposed to professional users, should be taken\ninto account as should the increased vulnerability of certain categories of\nconsumer such as children, the elderly or the disabled.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both new and second hand\nproducts originating outside the Union may be placed on the market only after\nthey have been released for free circulation. Effective controls are required\nat the external borders of the Union to suspend the release of products that may\npresent a risk if placed on the market in the Union pending evaluation and a\nfinal decision by market surveillance authorities. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Obliging the authorities\nresponsible for the control of products entering the Union market to carry out\nchecks on an adequate scale therefore contributes to a safer Union market for\nproducts. In order to increase the effectiveness of such checks, cooperation\nand exchange of information between those authorities and market surveillance\nauthorities concerning products presenting a risk should be enhanced.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market surveillance\nauthorities should be given the power to destroy products, render inoperable or\norder their destruction by the relevant economic operator, if they deem it\nnecessary and proportionate to ensure that such goods cannot pose any further\nthreats.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The release for free\ncirculation of products that are imported in the physical possession of persons\nentering the Union for their personal, non-commercial\nuse should not be suspended or refused under this Regulation by the authorities\nresponsible for the control of products entering the Union market.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There should be effective,\nspeedy and accurate exchange of information among the Member States and between\nthe Member States and the Commission. It is therefore necessary to provide for\neffective tools for such exchange. The Union rapid information system (RAPEX) has\nproved its effectiveness and efficiency. RAPEX enables measures to be taken across\nthe Union in relation to products that present a risk beyond the territory of a\nsingle Member State. To avoid unnecessary duplication, this system should be\nused for all alert notifications required by this Regulation relating to products presenting a risk. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherent and cost-effective\nmarket surveillance activity throughout the Union also requires well-structured,\ncomprehensive archiving and sharing among Member States of all pertinent\ninformation on national activities in this context, including a reference to\nnotifications required by this Regulation, to form a complete database of\nmarket surveillance information. The Commission has established a database\ncalled \u2018Information and Communication System for Market Surveillance\u2019 which is\nsuited for this purpose and should therefore be used. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the size of the Union\nmarket for goods and as there are no internal borders, it is imperative that\nthe market surveillance authorities of the Member States are willing and able\nto cooperate with each other effectively and to coordinate joint support and\naction. Accordingly, mechanisms for mutual assistance should be established.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate\nmarket surveillance of products entering the Union market from third countries,\nthis Regulation should provide a basis for cooperation between market\nsurveillance authorities of Member States and the authorities of those\ncountries.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A European Market\nSurveillance Forum composed of representatives from market surveillance\nauthorities should be established.

This proposal amalgamates the provisions of the Regulation 765/2008/EC and of the General Product Safety Directive regarding the market surveillance into one single piece of legislation covering products in both the harmonised and non-harmonised acquis, regardless whether they are destined for use, or are likely to be used, by consumers or professionals. This proposal will have an impact on economic operators and national authorities who will be better informed on their obligations regarding market surveillance actions. The proposal will also enhance the protection of consumers and other users of products through more effective enforcement of product-related requirements. \n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\nimpact \nSpecify the\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n- Number of notifications regarding unsafe products in the\nGRAS-RAPEX information system; \n- % of RAPEX notifications entailing at least one reaction (by other\nMember States\n- Ratio number of reactions / number of notifications (serious\nrisks)- \n- Volume and quality of data exchanged the general information\nsupport system ICSMS,\n- Number and results of joint market surveillance actions, \n- Work- and resource-sharing.\n- Product safety enforcement indicators (budgets, inspections,\nlaboratory tests, measures taken etc.)\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the proposal \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term \nThe general objective of this initiative is to improve the\nfunctioning of the single market and to achieve a high level of protection of\nconsumers, other users and other public interests through the reduction of\nnumber of unsafe or non-compliant products.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nDespite the existence of the single European market, the enforcement\nof product safety requirements is the Member States' competence. Due to the\nexisting differences in the national organisation of market surveillance in the\nMember States and to the interdependence of the national market surveillance\nauthorities, problems still appears. The EU has the right to act on the basis\nof Article 114 TFEU, in order to ensure the proper functioning of the single\nmarket for consumer products and to increase the efficiency of cross-border market\nsurveillance. Article 169(1) of TFEU complements this right to act. It\nstipulates that in order to promote the interests of consumers and to ensure a\nhigh level of consumer protection, the Union shall, amongst others, contribute\nto protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers. However,\nin order to comply with the subsidiarity principle, this proposal does not\naffect the competence of the Member States to carry out procedures and actions\nagainst concrete products posing risks. \n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nAlthough the EU has achieved the Single Market and the free movement\nof goods is the most developed and best established of the four freedoms making\nup the internal market, there are still things to be done. Public health and\nsafety in the workplace, protection of consumers, protection of the environment\nand other public interests may be undermined due to some traders who do not\ncomply with the law and place on the market dangerous products. Market surveillance\nis meant to be an answer to all these issues. Nevertheless, market surveillance\nhas not kept pace with developments in the Union regulatory framework. It needs\nto be highly coordinated and capable of reacting rapidly throughout EU. It is\ntrue that progress has been made with the implementation of the General Product\nSafety Directive and with the Regulation 765/2008/EC, but the fragmentation of\nmarket surveillance rules among different pieces of EU legislation (the General\nProduct Safety Directive, the Regulation 765/2008/EC and many sectorial\ndirectives) has led to confusion of both economic operators and national\nauthorities and to a reduced effectiveness of market surveillance activity in\nthe Union. Therefore, this proposal for a single, self-standing market\nsurveillance regulation would be essential to tackle these problems.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nThis initiative is entirely coherent with the acquis on the free\nmovement of goods, in particular Directive 2009/48/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 on the safety of toys, Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n8 June 2011 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in\nelectrical and electronic equipment, Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE),\nDirective 2012/19/EU of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on waste electrical and\nelectronic equipment (WEEE), Directive 2006/95/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the harmonisation of the laws of\nMember States relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain\nvoltage limits, Directive 2009/142/EC of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 30 November 2009 relating to appliances burning gaseous fuels.[43]\nThis proposal is also coherent with the accompanying proposal for a\nRegulation on Consumer Product Safety which will replace Directive 2001/95/EC\non General Product Safety.\nThe proposal creates synergies with regard to the notification of\nunsafe products and of safeguard measures under sectoral legislation which in\nthe future will need to be notified only once under the revised RAPEX system.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact \nProposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged \nX Centralised direct management\nby the Commission \nX Centralised indirect management\nwith the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u00b7              \nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u00b7              \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[44] \n\u00b7              \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service\nmission \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\n\"Comments\" section.\nComment:\nThis initiative does not require new budgetary resources but will be\nfinanced through redeployment of existing resources. Some actions will be\nmanaged by the Executive Agency for Health and Consumers (EAHC): In accordance\nwith Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 of 19 December 2002 laying down the\nstatute for Executive Agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the\nmanagement of Community programmes[45],\nthe Commission has entrusted[46]\nthe Executive Agency for Health and Consumers with implementation tasks for the\nmanagement of the Programme of Community Action in the field of Consumer policy\nfor 2007-2013. The Commission may therefore decide to entrust the Executive\nAgency for Health and Consumers also with implementation tasks for the\nmanagement of the Consumers Programme 2014-2020, which, once adopted, should be\nthe legal basis for procurement and grants in the field of product safety. The\nenvisaged programme delegation will be the extension of tasks already\nexternalised to the EAHC. \nFurthermore, this initiative does not require additional budget\nresources for the costs related to the management, maintenance and adaptations\nfor both IT systems, i.e. GRAS-RAPEX and ICSMS, compared to those already\nincluded in the operational budgets of DG SANCO and DG ENTR proposed for the\nMFF 2014-2020. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules \nSpecify frequency\nand conditions.\nThe future market Surveillance Forum (EMSF) will be the platform for\ndiscussions regarding the proper implementation of the future regulation.\nA final provision also proposes that the Commission makes an\nevaluation and drafts a report regarding the implementation five years after\nits entry into force. This should identify possible problems and shortcomings\nof the Regulation and could be the starting point for further actions,\nincluding a possible proposal to amend it, in view of further improvement of\nmarket surveillance framework.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nRisks relating to the proper functioning of RAPEX (e.g. increase of\nnumber of notifications diverting attention from really dangerous products or\nreducing its credibility; IT-related probems such as breakdown of the system,\nconfidentiality issues).\nThe risks related to the functioning of ICSMS relate mainly to\nIT-related probems such as a possible breakdown of the system and\nconfidentiality issues.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control method(s) envisaged\n\nThe control methods envisaged are laid down in the Financial\nRegulation and Rules of Application.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\nand irregularities \nSpecify existing or\nenvisaged prevention and protection measures.\nThe Commission must ensure that the financial interests of the Union\nare protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud,\ncorruption and other illegal activities, by effective checks and by the\nrecovery of amounts unduly paid and, if irregularities are detected, by effective,\nproportionate and dissuasive penalties, in accordance with Regulations (EC,\nEuratom) No 2988/95, (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 and (EC) No 1073/1999. In\naddition to the application of all regulatory control mechanisms, the competent\nCommission services will devise an anti-fraud strategy in line with the\nCommission's new anti-fraud strategy (CAFS; adopted on 24 June 2011) in order\nto ensure inter alia that its internal anti-fraud related controls are\nfully aligned with the CASF and that its fraud risk management approach is\ngeared to identify fraud risk areas and adequate responses. Where necessary,\nnetworking groups and adequate IT tools dedicated to analysing fraud cases\nrelated to the Consumer Programme will be set up. In particular a series of\nmeasures will be put in place such as:\n\u00b7              \ndecisions, agreements and contracts resulting\nfrom the implementation of the Consumer Programme will expressly entitle the\nCommission, including OLAF, and the Court of Auditors to conduct audits,\non-the-spot checks and inspections;\n\u00b7              \nduring the evaluation phase of a call for\nproposals/tender, the proposers and tenderers are checked against the published\nexclusion criteria based on declarations and the Early Warning System (EWS);\n\u00b7              \nthe rules governing the eligibility of costs\nwill be simplified in accordance with the provisions of the Financial\nRegulation.\n\u00b7              \nregular training on issues related to fraud and\nirregularities is given to all staff involved in contract management as well as\nto auditors and controllers who verify the beneficiaries' declarations on the\nspot.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \nExisting expenditure budget lines\nIn order of\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Description\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.] || Diff./non-diff.
