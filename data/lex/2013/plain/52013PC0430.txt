PES are responsible for implementing active labour market policies and\nproviding employment services in the public interest. They are part of relevant\nministries, public bodies or (non for profit) corporations falling under public\nlaw. The services offered by PES to workers and employers include labour market\ninformation, support for job search, counselling, vocational guidance,\nplacement and support of occupational and geographic mobility. PES are also\nfrequently in charge of unemployment and other social benefit systems. The efficiency of PES is an essential factor for successful\nemployment policies.\nStrengthening cooperation between PES in\nthe EU has been recognised as a crucial element to achieve the employment\ntargets of the Europe 2020 Strategy[1]. The Commission has regularly\nadvocated for the modernisation of PES service delivery, for partnerships\nbetween PES and other employment services, and for transforming PES into \"transition management agencies\" delivering a new\ncombination of \"active\" and \"passive\" employment policies[2]. The Council recently called\nfor partnerships between public and private employment services, employers,\nsocial partners and youth representatives when delivering youth guarantee\nschemes[3].\nPES are also directly addressed in the current European\nguidelines for the employment\npolicies of the Member States, the \u2018employment guidelines\u2019[4].\nShrinking public budgets and the need for increased PES cost-effectiveness\nhave prompted several Member States to undertake PES reforms in the shape of\nmergers with unemployment benefit providers, outsourcing of services to private\nproviders, regionalisation and municipalisation of employment services, and enhancing\nservice delivery through ICTs and self-service tools. At the same time, PES\nexpenditure (excluding unemployment benefits) is constantly changing: a regular\nsurvey among PES[5]\nrevealed that between 2007 and 2010 expenditure increased, whilst in 2011 it\nmostly decreased. The latest budget projections show that the majority of PES\nanticipate higher expenditure in 2013 than in the previous year.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nDue to national diversity in terms of PES business models,\ninstruments, labour market conditions and legal context\nPES have different levels of effectiveness when delivering labour market\nprograms. While Member States remain responsible for\norganising, staffing and running their PES, this legislative proposal\nestablishes a European Network of Public Employment Services providing a platform\nfor comparing their performance at European level, identifying good practices\nand fostering mutual learning in order to strengthen service capacity and\nefficiency. Experience has shown that Member States do not engage sufficiently\nin mutual learning and benchmarking activities by themselves. \n\nPES collaboration at EU level dates back to 1997\nwhen the Commission set up an informal advisory group of PES in order to promote cooperation, exchange and mutual learning between its\nmember organisations[6] and to receive specialist feedback on policy initiatives in the\nemployment field. Despite progress over the years the\ncurrent co-operation model shows considerable limitations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nParticipation of national PES in these activities remains voluntary,\nthus hampering the prospects of early identification of low performance by PES and\npotential structural labour market problems deriving from this. A reporting\nmechanism is also missing, meaning that policy designers at national and\nEU-level are not systematically informed about the results of the existing\nbenchmarking and mutual learning practices.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nEfforts to make PES more comparable by clustering them according to\nbusiness models have not succeeded so far. The linkages between benchmarking\nand mutual learning activities are weak and inconsistent and the evidence-base\nfor the activities of the existing Mutual Learning Programme is not\nscientifically robust. Participation in mutual learning\nis limited to a small group of PES and therefore the effects are not\nsufficiently widespread.\nPES are required to adapt their\norganisation models, business strategies and processes to a rapidly changing if\nthey are to become \"learning organisations\" and contribute to the\nwork of the Employment Committee. In\nits recent document \"PES Strategy EU 2020\"[7] \u2013 the PES Network identified\nfive key areas for change to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy. i) connect with the demand side; ii) adopt a conductor role by\ncooperation/partnerships; iii) develop skills oriented operations; iv) pursue sustainable\nactivation outcomes v) improve careers.\nThis legislative proposal aims to expand, reinforce\nand consolidate on-going initiatives for the benefit of all PES. A proposal for\nenhanced cooperation between PES constitutes a concerted action to modernise\nand empower them to successfully act in unison in the face of the current\neconomic crisis.\nA European network of PES established on\nsolid legal ground would be able to increase comprehensively\ncoordinated activities among PES and provide the network with legitimacy to\nact. A formalised structure is the pre-condition to increase\nthe network\u2019s potential to contribute to the development of innovative, evidence-based\npolicy implementation measures in line with the Europe 2020 objectives. It will\nalso facilitate the implementation of labour market projects financed by the European Social Fund (ESF). The proposed initiative could\ncontribute to improved cost-efficiency.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe PES Network established under this\nDecision will carry out initiatives in the nature of incentive measures\ndesigned to improve cooperation between Member States in the employment field.\nThese come in addition to the co-operation of PES within EURES on basis on Article\n45 and 46 of the Treaty. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nIn accordance with the greater emphasis\nplaced on evidence-based policy development, this proposal is founded on a\nnumber of evaluation studies and stakeholder consultations. \nOf\nparticular relevance were: Studies on PES business models[8], on PES performance measurement\nsystems and geographical labour mobility[9],\non the role of the PES related to \u2018flexicurity\u2019[10], on the role of\nPES related to anticipating skill needs of the labour force and equipping\npeople for new jobs[11].\nThe results of the PES mutual learning programme[12] and the results of the PES crisis response questionnaire 2009-2013[13] have been taken into account\nas well as results of the current PES benchmarking\nproject[14],\nco-financed by the Commission. \nThe future of the PES benchmarking\ninitiative was discussed several times in 2012 and 2013 with the current advisory\ngroup of PES. A consultation of the group on major elements of this proposal\ntook place in March and May 2013; the members were invited to comment on\npotential objectives, initiatives and policy options of this proposal. \nIn January 2013 the group issued a\ndiscussion note 'Towards an integrated European Public Employment Services\nbench-learning initiative\". The informal meeting of Employment, and Social Ministers (\"informal EPSCO\") and the\nEmployment Committee (EMCO) discussed this PES note. The informal EPSCO\nacknowledged that greater and more focused cooperation between the PES would\nlead to an improved sharing of best practice and asked for a detailed proposal\non a 'bench learning' initiative.[15] \nThe above-mentioned consultations and\nstudies confirm that there is general agreement among stakeholders on the need\nfor enhanced co-operation among PES. All PES should become active players\nwithin the network. Equally, there was broad support for extending the scope of\nthe benchmarking mechanism and for better linking the benchmarking and mutual\nlearning activities.\nPES have also been involved in a timely and\ntransparent manner in the run up to the announcement of this Decision in the\nCWP 2013-14 and the more in-depth preparations of this text herewith presented.\nTheir views have been gathered both in written form and through open\nconsultation meetings and have been considered in relation to key aspects of\ndirect concern to them i.e.: initiatives/activities of\nthe network; governance structure of the network; role of the Commission; cooperation\nwith other employment service providers and cooperation with the Council in\nparticular the Employment Committee (EMCO).\nGiven that the legislative proposal will\nmostly have indirect impacts and that the main technical elements of the\nbenchmarking and mutual learning initiative will be defined in a Delegated act,\nan impact assessment was considered not to be proportionate. Equally, no\nbudgetary impacts are to be expected.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThe right to act derives from Article 149\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which states that \"the European Parliament and the Council, \u2026\u2026, may adopt incentive\nmeasures designed to encourage cooperation between Member States and to support\ntheir action in the field of employment through initiatives aimed at developing\nexchanges of information and best practices, providing comparative analysis and\nadvice as well as promoting innovative approaches and evaluating experiences,\nin particular by recourse to pilot projects. \u2026.\".\nUnion action is also justified on the\nground that the legislative proposal on enhanced cooperation between PES will\ncontribute to the objectives of the treaty, notably promoting\nfull employment (Art. 3 TEU).\nThe entire proposal on enhanced cooperation\nbetween PES is an incentive measure in the sense of Article 149. In light of the nature of the incentive measure proposed the choice\nof the legal instrument \u2013 a Decision of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil \u2013 is the most appropriate. \nIncreased cooperation by incentivising the\nPES to work together on specific initiatives complies\nwith the subsidiarity principle in so far as it seeks to provide support to\nMember States to modernise their Public Employment Services within the context\nof the current economic crisis and with a view to reaching the Europe 2020\nemployment target.\nOverall, in the area of PES coordination\nthere is an added value in Union's interventions compared to Member States\nacting alone. Public Employment Services have a mandate to pursue national\ninterests and priorities; they normally do not interact in an EU-wide context. The\nbenchmarking and mutual learning activities on EU level add value to similar\nsmaller scale level activities of possibly only a few national PES volunteering\nto shape EU wide cooperation.\nThe proposal conforms with the\nproportionality principle since it is proposed in the form of an incentive\nmeasures for Public Employment Services and its duration is limited to the time\nspan of the Europe 2020 strategy as agreed by the Council.\u00a0 \n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe Commission's proposal for a\nMulti-Annual Financial Framework includes a proposal of a EUR 958, 19 million on\na European Union Programme for Social Change and Innovation (PSCI) for the\nperiod 2014-2020. Funding for the enhanced cooperation between PES will come\nfrom the PSCI/PROGRESS/Employment section. An indicative annual amount of 4 Mio\nEUR is foreseen for the above described incentive measure. Around 3 Mio EUR are\nforeseen for the benchmarking and mutual learning activities; several calls for\ntenders might be published. Up to 1 Mio EUR is likely to be used for network\nmeetings and scientific studies on PES issues. \nThe legislative proposal is budget-neutral\nand does not require additional staff resources. The\nCOM staff \u2013 2 \u00bd FTE - currently working in DG EMPL on PES issues will become\nthe PES Network Secretariat.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DELEGATED ACTS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThe legislative proposal includes a\nprovision to grant the Commission the power to adopt\ndelegated acts. This will mainly concern a delegated act for putting in place\nthe general framework for the implementation of the benchmarking and mutual\nlearning initiatives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThe choice of using the legal instrument of\ndelegated acts is justified as this will complement the basic act with more\ndetailed non-essential elements, in this case the general\nframework for the implementation of the benchmarking and mutual learning\ninitiatives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThe general framework will include the\ntechnical elements of the benchmarking systems such as the methodology, the basic\nquantitative and qualitative indicators to assess the outputs,\noutcomes, impact and costs of the different PES business models, processes,\nperformances and tools as well as other criteria for\nidentification of best practices. It will define the monthly and/or annual data\ndelivery requirements for the PES, the learning instruments of the integrated\nmutual learning programme such as workshops, peer reviews, technical assistance,\nstudy visits and the terms for participation in the benchmarking and mutual\nlearning activities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nIt is planned to externalise the data\ncollection and analysis of the benchmarking exercise. The PES will be\nassociated to this process in order to ensure ownership of the benchmarking\nresults.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nSubject to agreement by the PES it is anticipated that major parts\nof the current voluntary PES benchmarking projects can be used. There are time\nseries available for several indicators measuring the transitions of jobseekers\ninto employment such as transition to employment from\nunemployment, transition to employment before unemployment lasts long, transition\nfrom training measures to employment. Access to\nvacancies and match with suitable candidates as well as satisfaction of jobseekers\nand employers with the provided services are also measured with several\nindicators. \n\nAdditional indicators and context variables will need to be defined\nin order to assess the interdependence between business models and processes\nagainst results.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThe general framework will define most elements\nof the benchmarking and mutual learning activities. Technical details that may\nchange over time will be included in the annual work programme of the PES\nnetwork. \n2013/0202 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nOn enhanced co-operation between Public\nEmployment Services (PES)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 149 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[16],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[17],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)                   \nOn 17 June 2010 the European Council[18] endorsed the Commission proposal for a Europe 2020 Strategy for\njobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth[19]. The\nEuropean Council advocated full mobilisation of the appropriate EU instruments\nand policies to support achievement of the common objectives and invited the\nMember States to step up coordinated action. The Public\nEmployment Services (PES) have a central role in achieving the Europe 2020 target of 75 % employment\nrate for women and men aged 20 to 64 by 2020.\n(2)                   \nArticle 45 of the Treaty secures the freedom of\nmovement for workers within the Union while Article 46 sets out the measures to\nbring about this freedom, in particular by ensuring close cooperation between\nthe PES. The PES Network established under this Decision, however, covers besides\ngeneral aspects of geographical mobility a wide range of objectives and\ninitiatives in the nature of incentive measures designed to improve cooperation\nbetween Member States in the employment field. Art 149 of the Treaty is\ntherefore the appropriate legal base for this Decision.\n(3)                   \nIn accordance with Article 148(4) of the Treaty\non the Functioning of the European Union, the Council adopted guidelines for\nemployment policies on 21 October 2010. These\nintegrated guidelines give orientations to the Member States on defining their\nnational reform programmes and on implementing reforms. The employment\nguidelines form the basis for country-specific recommendations that the Council\naddresses to the Member States under Article 148(4) of the TFEU. In\nrecent years these have included specific\nrecommendations on the functioning and capacity of PES and the effectiveness of\nactive labour market policies in Member States.\n(4)                   \nThese recommendations would benefit from being\nfurther supported by an enhanced evidence-base,\nfeedback on success of policy implementation and co-operation between the PES\nof Member States. To this end, the PES Network to be\nestablished under this Decision should carry out concrete initiatives such as common evidence-based\nbenchmarking systems, corresponding mutual learning activities, mutual\nassistance between the network members and the implementation of strategic actions\nfor the modernisation of PES.. The specific knowledge of the network and its\nindividual members should also be used to provide, upon request of the Employment,\nSocial Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) and the Employment\nCommittee (EMCO), evidence for the development of employment policies.\n(5)                   \nThe informal meeting of EPSCO ministers acknowledged that greater and more focused cooperation between the\nPES would lead to an improved sharing of best practice and asked for a detailed\nproposal on a 'bench learning' initiative.[20] \n(6)                   \nThe PES Network established under this Decision\nshould work in close co-operation with EMCO based on Article 150 TFEU and\ncontribute to its work as a provider for factual evidence and reports on policy\nimplementation. Contributions from the PES Network to the Council will be\nchannelled through EMCO. In particular, the combined knowledge of the PES\nNetwork on delivery aspects of employment policies and the comparative analysis\nof PES can serve policy decision makers at both national and Union level in the\nassessment and design of employment policies. \n(7)                   \nThe PES network should contribute\nto the implementation of policy initiatives in the employment field such as the\nCouncil Recommendation on Establishing a Youth Guarantee[21]. The\nnetwork may also support initiatives aimed at facilitating the\ntransition from education and training to work, including through enhanced\ntransparency of skills and qualifications.\n(8)                   \nThe PES Network should reinforce co-operation\nbetween its members, develop joint initiatives aimed at\nexchanges of information and best practices in all areas covered by PES, comparative analysis and advice as well as promotion of innovative\napproaches in the delivery of employment services. By\nestablishing this network an inclusive, evidence-based and performance-oriented\ncomparison of all PES leading to the identification of best practices will be\npossible. With these results members of the network should be able to shape the\ndesign and delivery of employment services within their specific\nresponsibilities. The initiatives carried out by the Network should improve PES\neffectiveness and allow for more efficient public spending.\n(9)                   \nIn order to put in place\na general framework for the implementation of the benchmarking and mutual learning\ninitiatives, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of defining the technical\nelements of the benchmarking systems and mutual learning activities. This\nshould include the methodology,\nthe basic quantitative and qualitative indicators to assess PES performance,\nthe learning instruments of the integrated mutual learning programme and the terms for participation in these\ninitiatives. . It is of\nparticular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations\nduring its preparatory work, including at expert level, in particular PES\nexperts. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should\nensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\ndocuments to the European Parliament and Council.\n(10)               \nDue to the variety of PES models, tasks and\nforms of service delivery it is up to each Member State to nominate from the\nsenior management of its Public Employment Services one member for the Board of\nthe PES Network. Where applicable the member should represent in the Board the\nother Public Employment Services from the Member State. The appointed members\nshould have the capacity to take decisions on behalf of their sending\norganisations. In order to ensure an involvement of all PES in the workings of\nthe Network, activities should be open to all levels of participation. \n(11)               \nThe PES Network should build on the experience\nof and replace an existing informal advisory\ngroup of EU/EEA PES that the Commission has supported since 1997. The views of this group have been taken into account in the drafting\nof this Decision.\n(12)               \nThe key areas for action identified by this informal expert group in its paper \u201cPES Strategy 2020\"[22] should serve as an orientation for putting\ninto practice the envisaged concept for modernisation and strengthening of PES.\n(13)               \nThe PES Network should provide mutual assistance to the benefit of its members and help support each other in the modernisation of organisational structures and service delivery by enhancing co-operation, in particular transfer of knowledge, study\nvisits, and staff exchanges. \n(14)               \nThe PES Network and its initiatives should be\nfunded through the PROGRESS/employment section of the 'Programme for Social\nChange and Innovation' within the appropriations set by the budgetary\nauthority. \n(15)               \nFor projects developed by the network or\nidentified in the mutual learning activities and then implemented in the\nindividual PES, Member States have access to funding from the European Social Fund (ESF), the Regional Development Fund (ERDF)\nand Horizon 2020.\n(16)               \nThe Commission will take the necessary administrative\nsteps to set up the network. \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nEstablishment\nAn EU wide network of Public Employment\nServices (PES) - hereinafter referred to as 'the Network' - is established for\nthe period expanding from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020.
