Parallel proposal to impose definitive anti-dumping measures. \n Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n Consultation of interested parties \n Interested parties concerned by the proceeding have had the possibility to defend their interests during the investigation, in line with the provisions of the basic Regulation. \n Collection and use of expertise \n There was no need for external expertise. \n Impact assessment This proposal is the result of the implementation of the basic Regulation. The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n Summary of the proposed action On 9 January 2012, the Commission initiated an anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of certain organic coated steel products originating in the People's Republic of China. The investigation found subsidisation of the product concerned, which caused injury to the Union industry. The investigation also found that it was not against the Union interest to impose anti-subsidy measures. Therefore, it is proposed that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Regulation in order to impose definitive anti-subsidy measures on imports of certain organic coated steel products originating in the People's Republic of China. \n Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019) \n Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n Indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n Choice of instruments \n Proposed instrument: Regulation. \n Other means would not be adequate because the basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the EU\nbudget.\n2013/0052 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a countervailing duty on imports\nof certain organic coated steel products originating in the People's Republic\nof China\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n597/2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of\nthe European Community[1],\nand in particular Article 17 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 22 February 2012, the\nEuropean Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of\nthe European Union[2]\n('Notice of initiation'), the initiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding with\nregard to imports into the Union of certain organic coated steel products\noriginating in the People's Republic of China ('PRC' or the 'country\nconcerned').\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The anti-subsidy\nproceeding was initiated following a complaint lodged on 9\nJanuary 2012 by EUROFER ('the complainant') on behalf of producers representing in this case more than 70% of the total Union production of certain organic coated\nsteel products. The complaint contained prima facie evidence of subsidisation\nof the said product and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was\nconsidered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prior\nto the initiation of the proceeding and in accordance with Article 10(7) of the\nbasic Regulation, the Commission notified the Government of the PRC ('the GOC')\nthat it had received a properly documented complaint alleging that subsidised\nimports of certain organic coated steel products originating in the PRC were\ncausing material injury to the Union industry. The GOC was invited for\nconsultations with the aim of clarifying the situation as regards the contents\nof the complaint and arriving at a mutually agreed solution. The GOC accepted\nthe offer of consultations and consultations were subsequently held. During the\nconsultations, no mutually agreed solution could be arrived at. However, due\nnote was taken of comments made by the authorities of the GOC in regard to the\nallegations contained in the complaint regarding the lack of countervailability\nof the schemes. Following the consultations, submissions were received from the\nGOC. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anti-dumping\nproceeding\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 21 December 2011, the\nEuropean Commission had announced by a notice published in the Official Journal\nof the European Union[3], the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports\ninto the Union of certain organic coated steel products originating in the PRC.\n\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 20 September 2012, the\nCommission, by Regulation (EU) No 845/2012[4],\nimposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain organic coated\nsteel products originating in the PRC.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The injury analyses\nperformed in the present anti-subsidy and the parallel anti-dumping\ninvestigation are identical, since the definition of the Union industry, the\nrepresentative Union producers and the investigation period are the same in\nboth investigations. For this reason, comments on injury aspects put forward in\nany of these proceedings were taken into account in both proceedings.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the\nproceeding\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the complainants, other known Union producers, the known exporting\nproducers in the PRC, importers, traders, users, suppliers and associations\nknown to be concerned, and the representatives of the PRC of the initiation of\nthe proceeding. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their\nviews known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in\nthe notice of initiation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the apparent\nhigh number of exporting producers, Union producers and unrelated importers,\nall known exporting producers and unrelated importers were asked to make\nthemselves known to the Commission and to provide, as specified in the notice\nof initiation, basic information on their activities related to the product\nconcerned during the period from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2011. This\ninformation was requested under Article 27 of the basic Regulation in order to\nenable the Commission to decide whether sampling would be necessary and if so,\nto select samples. The authorities of the PRC were also consulted.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initially 19 Chinese\nexporting producers/groups of producers provided the requested information and\nagreed to be included in a sample. On the basis of the information received\nfrom the exporting producers and in accordance with Article 27 of the basic\nRegulation the Commission initially proposed a sample of 3 exporting\nproducers/groups of exporting producers. However one of the exporting producers\nincluded in this sample withdrew its cooperation. Consequently it was replaced\nwith the next exporting producer with the highest volume of exports sales to\nthe EU. Following the notification also this exporting producer withdrew its\ncooperation.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order not to cause any\nfurther delay to the proceeding it was decided to limit the sample to two\ngroups of exporting producers, which had the highest export volume to the Union, i.e. Zhangjiagang Panhua Steel Strip Co., Ltd and its related companies and Zhejiang\nHuadong Light Steel Building Material Co., Ltd and its related companies. The\nsample of these two groups of exporting producers serves as the basis to\ndetermine the level of subsidisation for those groups as well as the level of\nsubsidisation for all cooperating exporting producers not included in the\nsample, as required by Articles 15.2 and 15.3 of the basic Regulation.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nregards the Union producers, the Commission announced in the notice of\ninitiation that it had provisionally selected a sample of Union producers. This\nsample consisted of six Union producers that were known to the Commission to\nproduce the like product selected on the basis of sales, production volume,\nsize and geographical location in the Union. The sampled Union producers accounted for 46% of the Union\nproduction and 38% of the Union sales. Interested parties were also invited in\nthe notice of initiation to make their views known on the provisional sample.\nOne of the Union producers stated that it did not wish to be included in the\nsample and was replaced in the sample by the next largest producer. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Five unrelated importers\nprovided the requested information and agreed to be included in the sample. In\nview of the limited number of cooperating importers, sampling was deemed to be\nno longer necessary. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sent\nquestionnaires to the representatives of the PRC, the two sampled exporting\nproducers in the PRC, 14 other exporting producers in the PRC that requested\nso, the six sampled Union producers, the five cooperating importers in the Union and to the known users.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Replies\nwere received from the representatives of the PRC, nine exporting producers and\nrelated companies in the PRC, the six sampled Union producers, two unrelated\nimporters and ten users.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sought and\nverified all information deemed necessary for the determination of\nsubsidisation, resulting injury and Union interest. Verification visits were\ncarried out at the premises of the following State authority and companies: \n(a)              \nGovernment of the People Republic of China\n\u2013                   \nChinese Ministry of Commerce, Beijing, China\n(b)              \nUnion producers\n\u2013                   \nArcelorMittal Belgium, Belgium and related sales company ArcelorMittal Flat Carbon Europe SA, Luxembourg\n\u2013                   \nArcelorMittal Poland, Poland\n\u2013                   \nThyssenKrupp Steel Europe AG, Germany\n\u2013                   \nvoestalpine Stahl GmbH and voestalpine Stahl\nService Center GmbH, Austria\n\u2013                   \nTata Steel Maubeuge SA (formerly known as Myriad\nSA), France\n\u2013                   \nTata Steel UK Ltd, United Kingdom\n(c)              \nGroups of Exporting producers (and\nrelated companies) in the PRC\n\u2013                   \nZhangjiagang Panhua Steel Strip Co., Ltd and its\nrelated companies: Chongqing Wanda Steel Strip Co., Ltd, Zhangjiagang Wanda\nSteel Strip Co., Ltd, Jiangsu Huasheng New Construction Materials Co. Ltd and\nZhangjiagang Free Trade Zone Jiaxinda International Trade Co., Ltd;\n\u2013                   \nZhejiang Huadong Light Steel Building Material\nCo. Ltd and its related company Hangzhou P.R.P.T. Metal Material Company Ltd;\n(d)              \nImporters in the Union \n\u2013                   \nThyssenKrupp Mannex,\n Germany\n\u2013                   \nMacrometal, Hamburg, Germany\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently all parties\nwere informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which\nit was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive countervailing duties\non imports of certain organic coated steel products originating in the PRC\n('the final disclosure'). All parties were granted a period within which they\ncould make comments on the final disclosure.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comments submitted by\nthe interested parties were considered and taken into account where\nappropriate.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation period and\nperiod considered\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation of\nsubsidisation and injury covered the period from 1 October 2010 to 30 September\n2011 (the \u2018investigation period\u2019 or \u2018IP\u2019). The examination of trends relevant\nfor the assessment of injury covered the period from 1 January 2008 to the end\nof the IP (\u2018the period considered\u2019). \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE\nPRODUCT\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product concerned\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the notice of initiation\nthe product subject to the investigation was certain organic coated steel\nproducts ('OCS'), i.e. flat-rolled products of non-alloy and alloy steel (not\nincluding stainless steel) which are painted, varnished or coated with plastics\non at least one side, excluding so-called 'sandwich panels' of a kind used for\nbuilding applications and consisting of two outer metal sheets with a\nstabilising core of insulation material sandwiched between them, and excluding\nthose products with a final coating of zinc-dust (a zinc-rich paint, containing\nby weight 70% or more of zinc). \n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product exclusion requests\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The China Iron and Steel\nAssociation, two importers and two users, proposed the exclusion of five\nproduct types. These requests were received and have been analysed as follows:\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OCS with metallic coating of\nchromium or tin\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\nuser of OCS submitted a request to exclude OCS with a substrate with a metallic\ncoating of chromium or tin from the product scope. The investigation has\nestablished that the metallic coating of chromium or tin renders this product\ntype physically and technically different to the OCS under investigation.\nMoreover, OCS with a substrate with a metallic coating of chromium or tin is\nalmost exclusively used in the food packaging and cable industries. Finally,\nthe Union industry explained that it did not intend for the above-mentioned\nproduct type to be included in this investigation. Given the above-mentioned\nreasons, OCS with a substrate with a metallic coating of chromium or tin is not\nincluded in the product scope. \n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hot-rolled plates with\nprotective primer, whether organic or inorganic\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nrequest was rejected because these products do not fall under the CN codes\nunder investigation. The painting or coating is only for rust protection and\ntherefore fall under CN heading 7208 and not CN heading 7210. Hot-rolled plates\nwith a protective primer, whether organic or inorganic, arenot included in the\nproduct scope and as a result cannot be removed from it.\n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OCS with substrate thickness\nbetween 0.6 and 2.0 mm\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CISA\nand two importers requested the exclusion of OCS with substrate thickness\nbetween 0.6 and 2.0 mm, representing 5 \u2013 10% of imports from China, stating\nthat there was only direct competition between Chinese exports and Union\nindustry production for OCS with substrate thickness of between 0.25 and 0.6\nmm.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nrequest was rejected, given that both Chinese exporters and the Union industry\nmanufacture and sell OCS with a substrate thickness of between 0.6 and 2.0 mm\nand that therefore these products are clearly in competition with each other.\nNo evidence was provided to show that OCS with a substrate thickness of over\n0.6 mm does not compete with OCS with a substrate thickness of less than 0.6 mm\nand that therefore this would constitute a different product type. OCS with\nsubstrate thickness of less than and above 0.6mm have the same basic physical\nand technical characteristics and same end uses and therefore are the same\nproduct.\n2.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OCS with aluminium-zinc\nalloy coated substrate\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ntwo importers alleged that only four Union producers have the licence to\nproduce this product type and that only one company was in fact producing it.\nThey also alleged that this product differs from zinc coated OCS in terms of\nproduct characteristics.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nrequest was rejected as the two product types are interchangeable with\noverlapping uses and at least two cooperating Union producers manufactured this\nproduct type during the investigation period. It should be noted that only one\ncooperating Chinese exporting producer exported this product type to the Union\nduring the investigation period.\n2.2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OCS with zinc alloy coated\nsubstrate\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nrequest was rejected because, contrary to the assertion by one user, this\nproduct is produced and sold in significant quantities by several Union producers\nand has the same essential physical and technical characteristics and end uses\nas other types of OCS.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product\ninclusion request\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\nassociation requested that OCS with a metallic coating of chromium or tin,\nclassified under TARIC codes 7210 12 20 10 and 7210 50 00 10 be included in the\nproduct scope. This request was rejected as these codes were not included in\nthe original complaint and the products covered by such codes have different\nphysical and technical characteristics from the products covered by the\ncomplaint.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product\nconcerned\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given\nthe acceptance of the exclusion of OCS with metallic coating of chromium or\ntin, as outlined in recital (21), the product concerned is amended by this\nexclusion.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned is therefore\ncertain organic coated steel products ('OCS'), i.e. flatrolled products of\nnon-alloy and alloy steel (not including stainless steel) which are painted,\nvarnished or coated with plastics on at least one side, excluding so-called\n'sandwich panels' of a kind used for building applications and consisting of\ntwo outer metal sheets with a stabilising core of insulation material\nsandwiched between them, excluding those products with a final coating of\nzinc-dust (a zinc-rich paint, containing by weight 70 % or more of zinc), and\nexcluding those products with a substrate with a metallic coating of chromium\nor tin, currently falling within CN codes ex 7210 70 80, ex 7212 40 80, ex 7225\n99 00, ex 7226 99 70, and originating in the People's Republic of China ('the\nproduct concerned').\n2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like\nproduct\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has shown\nthat OCS produced and sold by the Union industry in the Union, OCS produced and\nsold on the domestic market of the PRC and OCS imported into the Union from the\nPRC have the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and the same\nbasic end uses. Therefore these products are considered to be alike within the\nmeaning of Article 2(c) of the basic Regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SUBSIDISATION \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both the GOC and the sampled\nChinese exporting producers submitted questionnaire replies and accepted\non-spot visits in order to verify the replies. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With\nrespect to the GOC, following the analysis of the questionnaire reply, the\nCommission sent a deficiency letter and two pre-verification letters. The\nCommission provided to the GOC ample time for the preparation and submission of\nits representations whenever this was requested and justified. Indeed\nsubstantial deadline extensions were granted to the GOC, i.e. 20 days extension\nfor the reply to the questionnaire which resulted in an eventual deadline of 57\ndays for the submission of the questionnaire reply and 25 days for the reply to\nthe deficiency letter.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nits replies to the questionnaire, deficiency letters and various other\nsubmissions the GOC provided a reply only concerning schemes used by the\nsampled exporting producers and argued that it should not be requested to\nprovide replies to questions relating to alleged subsidy schemes available also\nto non-sampled producers or producers which had not made themselves known.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission respectfully disagreed with this approach and explained to the GOC\nthat the purpose of the questionnaire sent to the GOC is for the Commission to\nobtain information of subsidisation of the industry producing organic coated\nsteel in China and to determine to what extent Union imports of the product\nconcerned are subsidised. The Commission informed the GOC that broader\ninformation on the extent of subsidisation is required in order to address any\nsignificant non-cooperation by exporters which are alleged to have received\nbenefits under particular subsidy schemes not used by the sampled or\ncooperating companies and possible requests for individual examination by\ncooperating exporting producers. However the GOC did not alter its approach and\ndid not provide information on most of the other subsidy schemes alleged in the\ncomplaint but not used by the sampled companies.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prior\nto the on-spot verification visit, the GOC requested the Commission to provide\nfurther information in writing, in particular a list of all the questions that\nit intended to ask during the verification plus a list of the Government\ndepartments which were expected to participate in the on-spot visit. In the\nabsence of these, it was argued that the GOC \"was left unaware of what\nshould have been prepared or could be expected during the verification\"\nand that the pre-verification letter \"certainly does not provide any\nindication of what the Commission actually intends to verify\u2026\". \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission could not grant the GOC's request. In this respect it is noted that\nthe Commission has fulfilled all the relevant conditions of Article 26 of the\nbasic Regulation. A detailed pre-verification letter had been sent to the GOC confirming\nthe agenda (days and group of schemes to be discussed per verification day) and\nrequesting the presence of the authorities responsible for the relevant schemes\nand of the officials involved in the preparation of the GOC submissions. The\nCommission also explained before the on-spot verification visit that only the\nGOC could identify the authorities responsible for the schemes under\ninvestigation as well as those officials which are best placed to take part in\nthe verification and answer questions. As regards the list of specific\nquestions, the Commission explained that such a list is not required by EU\nlegislation (nor by WTO requirements) and that the purpose of this\ninvestigation is to verify the GOC reply to the questionnaire and the relevant\nsupplementary submissions; therefore the verification would follow the\nstructure of these documents. The Commission would also seek to obtain and\nclarify further information necessary for the on-going proceeding but precise\nquestions in this context would depend on the GOC's replies to the initial\nverification of its replies. It was also made clear to the GOC before the\non-spot verification visit that refusals to provide necessary information or to\nassist the investigating authority in verifying information and data deemed\nnecessary for the purposes of the proceeding might seriously undermine the\ninvestigation process. The GOC was also reminded of the consequences of the\nprovision of Article 28 of the basic Regulation. \n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During\nthe on-spot verification visit to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce in Beijing,\nthe Commission endeavoured to verify information provided on the basis of the\nsupporting documents that were used to prepare the GOC's response, in line with\nthe provisions of Articles 11 and 26 of the basic Regulation. In doing so, the\nCommission came preliminarily to the conclusion that the lack of information\nand supporting documents available did not allow a proper verification of the\nreply to the questionnaire. Moreover, certain information was not submitted at\nall although it was specifically requested and certain questions were simply\nnot replied to. Consequently, the GOC was made aware of the consequences of\nnon-cooperation in accordance with Article 28(1) and (6) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also submitted that\nthe Commission was imposing an unreasonable burden on the GOC and had requested\nirrelevant and unnecessary information in the questionnaire and subsequent\ndeficiency letter. \n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to the\nrequested information it is noted that the Commission requested only\ninformation concerning allegations in the complaint that is deemed necessary\nfor the purposes of arriving at a representative finding and remained\nconsistent in its requests by asking for the same data and information during\nthe investigating process and requesting the GOC to explain the submitted\ninformation and its implication for the investigated schemes. In other words,\nthe Commission only requested information that was necessary to assess the\nexistence and level of subsidisation available to the product concerned\npursuant to other subsidy schemes alleged in the complaint. Such information\nwould have allowed for an adequate determination of the amount of subsidisation\ngranted pursuant to the other subsidy schemes under investigation available\nto the non-cooperating exporting producers. Since neither the representatives\nof the PRC nor the non-cooperating exporting producers provided the necessary\ninformation to determine whether the other subsidy schemes were available to the\nnon-cooperating exporting producers, on the basis of best facts available, the\nCommission concluded that the other alleged subsidy schemes were indeed\navailable to the other non-cooperating exporting producers, and proceeded to\ncalculate the amounts of benefit conferred through those schemes on the basis\nof best facts available.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individual\nExamination ('IE')\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Claims for IE were\nsubmitted by two cooperating exporting producers pursuant to Article 27(3) of\nthe basic Regulation, i.e. Union Steel China (Union Steel) and Shenzhen Sino\nMaster Steel Co. Ltd. It was not possible to grant these IEs to both companies\nas, due to the high number of alleged subsidy schemes and time consuming nature\nof anti-subsidy investigation, it would be unduly burdensome and could prevent\ncompletion of the investigation in good time.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, Union Steel had\nalready been individually examined in the parallel anti-dumping investigation\nand consequently individual injury margin was calculated for this company. \n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that the GOC provided\nonly a reply concerning schemes used by the sampled exporting producers as\nexplained in recital (34) above, it was practically impossible to analyse some\nof the subsidy schemes possibly used by Union Steel. Consequently, on the basis\nof facts available under Article 28 of the Basic Regulation, the average\nsubsidy rate applicable to other co-operating companies was attributed to this\ncompany.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific Schemes\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the\ninformation contained in the complaint the Commission sought information\nrelated to the following schemes, which allegedly involved the granting of\nsubsidies by the Governmental authority:\n(I)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Government\nProvision of Goods and Services for Less than Adequate Remuneration (\u201cLTAR\u201d)\n\u2013              \nProvision of inputs at less than adequate\nremuneration: Hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel\n\u2013              \nProvision of land use rights for less than\nadequate remuneration\n\u2013              \nProgrammes consisting of provision of water\nfor less than adequate remuneration\n\u2013              \nProgramme consisting of provision of electricity\nfor less than adequate remuneration\n\u2013              \nProgramme consisting of provision of\nelectricity and water at less than adequate remuneration in the Jiangsu Province\n\u2013              \nProvision of various inputs for less than\nadequate remuneration\n(II)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preferential loans and interest\nrates to the OCS industry\n(III)\u00a0\u00a0 Equity programmes\n\u2013              \nDebt for equity swaps\n\u2013              \nEquity infusions\n\u2013              \nUnpaid dividends\n(IV)\u00a0\u00a0 Income and other direct taxes\n\u2013              \nTax policies for the deduction of research\nand development expenses\n\u2013              \nTax concessions for Central and Western regions\n\u2013              \nIncome tax credit for the purchase of\ndomestically manufactured production equipment\n\u2013              \nPreferential tax policies for companies that\nare encouraged as high and new technology enterprises\n\u2013              \nIncome tax concessions for the enterprises\nengaged in the comprehensive resource utilisation ('special raw materials')\n\u2013              \nTax credit concerning the purchase of special\nequipment\n\u2013              \nPreferential income tax policy for the\nenterprises in the Northeast region\n\u2013              \nIncome Tax exemption for investment in\ndomestic technological renovation\n\u2013              \nVarious local tax discounts (Shandong Province,\nChongqing City, Guangxi Region Zhuang, Tax privileges to develop central and\nwestern regions)\n\u2013              \nDividend exemption between qualified resident\nenterprises\n\u2013              \nTwo free, three half tax exemptions for the\nproductive FIEs\n\u2013              \nLocal income tax exemption and reduction\nprogrammes for the productive FIEs\n\u2013              \nIncome tax credit for FIEs purchasing\ndomestically produced equipment\n\u2013              \nIncome tax subsidies for FIEs based on\ngeographical location\n(V)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indirect Tax and Import Tariff\nProgrammes\n\u2013              \nImport tariff and VAT exemptions for FIEs and\ncertain domestic enterprises using imported equipment in encouraged industries\n\u2013              \nVAT refunds to FIEs purchasing domestically\nproduced equipment\n\u2013              \nVAT deduction on fixed assets in the Central\nregion\n\u2013              \nOther tax privileges of Ma'anshan\n(VI)\u00a0\u00a0 Grant Programmes\n\u2013              \nChina World Top Brand programme\n\u2013              \nFamous Brands programme\n\u2013              \nThe State key technology project fund\n\u2013              \nProgrammes to rebate anti-dumping legal fees \n(VII)\u00a0 Purchase of goods by the Government\nfor higher than adequate remuneration\n(VIII) Other regional programmes\n\u2013              \nSubsidies provided in the Tianjin Binhai New\nArea and the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area\n\u2013              \nProgrammes related to the Northeast Region\n\u2013              \nGrants under the Science and technology\nprogramme of Jiangsu Province\n\u2013              \nGrants under the Science and Technology\nprogramme of Hebei Province\n(IX) Ad hoc subsidies referred to in the\ncomplaint\n3.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Government Provision of Goods and Services for Less than\nAdequate Remuneration (\u201cLTAR\u201d)\n3.3.1.1.\u00a0 Provision of hot-rolled and\ncold-rolled steel (HRS and CRS) for less than adequate remuneration\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The allegation in the\ncomplaint was that the GOC controls certain upstream industries and products so\nas to provide favourably priced inputs to producers of OCS. On this basis OCS producers\nreceive countervailable subsidies through the purchase from State-owned\nenterprises (SOEs) of government-produced HRS and CRS at a below the market\nprice and thus at less than adequate remuneration for the SOEs.\nNon-cooperation\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission requested from the GOC detailed information concerning SOEs\nproviding HRS and CRS to the Chinese exporting producers of OCS in order to\nverify the allegations in the complaint and to establish whether these SOEs are\npublic bodies. In particular, the Commission created Appendix B to the\nquestionnaire for the GOC intended for the SOEs and invited the GOC to provide\ninformation requested therein. In the deficiency letter the Commission again\nasked the GOC to provide the information requested in Appendix B and encouraged\nGOC to coordinate the responses with the SOEs concerned.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, GOC did not\nprovide a reply to any of the questions in Appendix B and also failed to\nprovide relevant information requested in the main questionnaire (e.g. on the\nownership and control of Chinese government of the SOEs in the steel sector and\nits involvement in the reorganisation of Chinese steel industry). Instead of\nproviding the requested information the GOC stated in its response to the\nquestionnaire that the complainants have failed to demonstrate that the HRS and\nCRS producers are public bodies.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because\nof the lack of cooperation from the GOC the Commission had to look into other\nbest information available. The Commission notified GOC about this course of\naction. In assessing whether the SOEs providing HRS and CRS to the Chinese\nexporting producers of OCS are public bodies the Commission considered the\nlimited information provided by the GOC, information in the complaint, publicly\navailable factual information from similar proceedings conducted by other\ninvestigating authorities, as well as other publicly available information, and\nbased its findings on the totality of the information on the file.\n(a)              \nSOEs providing OCS producers with\nhot-rolled and cold-rolled steel are public bodies\nPreliminary remarks\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ncomplainant claims that SOEs in China are public bodies within the meaning of\nArticle 2(b) of the basic Regulation which provide goods (HRS and CRS) to OCS\nproducers at below-market prices and thus confer a benefit to them.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The WTO Appellate Body\n(AB), in its report in United States \u2013 Definitive Anti-Dumping and\nCountervailing Duties on Certain Products from China[5] (the AB\nreport) defined a public body as an entity that \"possesses, exercises or\nis vested with governmental authority\"[6]. The AB\nalso considered that public bodies are also characterised by the\n\"performance of governmental functions\"[7] which\nwould \"ordinarily be considered part of governmental practice in the legal\norder of the relevant Member\"[8].\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the WTO AB\nconclusions, there are two questions for the analysis, i.e. (a) whether the\nSOEs in question perform functions which are ordinarily considered part of\ngovernmental practice in China and (b) if so, whether they exercise government\nauthority when doing so?\nPerformance of governmental functions\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of the GOC,\nthere is ample evidence to show that the government is deeply involved in the\nmanagement of the economy. The primary role of the Chinese government in the\neconomy is guaranteed by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.\nAccording to Article 7 of the Constitution reads: \"The state economy is\nthe sector of socialist economy under ownership by the whole people; it is\nleading force in the national economy. The state ensures the consolidation and\ngrowth of the state economy\". Similarly Article 15 of the Constitution\nreads: \"The state practices economic planning on the basis of socialist\npublic ownership\". Also the Constitution of the Communist Party of\nChina prescribes the primary role of the public ownership, e.g. preamble of the\nConstitution of CCP reads: \"the Party must uphold and improve the basic\neconomic system, with public ownership playing a dominant role\u2026\" Also\nthe various 5-year plans promulgated by the National Development and Reform\nCommission (NDRC) and adopted by the China's highest legal authority State\nCouncil point to the very strong grip of the Chinese government in the economy.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the steel\nsector, the information on the file suggests that the SOEs producing HRS and\nCRS in China often perform governmental functions described, inter alia, in the\nsectoral plans for iron and steel industry. These plans confirm that the GOC\nhas chosen to be closely involved in the management and development of the\nsteel industry in China and their implementation by SOEs can therefore be\nconsidered to fall under the heading of governmental practices. The plans\nprovide targets and goals for all operators in the iron and steel industry and\ndirect the whole sector to produce specific outcomes. In fact, the GOC is using\nthe iron and steel SOEs as a prolonged arm of the state in order to achieve\ngoals and targets set in the plans.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Order No. 35 of the NDRC\n\u2013 Policies for Development of Iron and Steel Industry, inter alia, outlines\na policy to decrease the number of iron and steel smelting enterprises and sets\ngoals on the output for those steel enterprise groups that rank top 10 in the\ndomestic market (Article 3), for the production capacity prohibits the establishment\nof new iron and steel associated enterprises (Article 10), prescribes the\nconditions to access into the iron and steel industry on the equipment level\nand also prescribes the technical and economic indexes steel and iron\nenterprises should follow (Article 12), sets rules for the changes in the\norganisational structure of steel enterprises (article 20), manages investments\n( Articles 22, 23), conditions access to financial funds (Articles 25,26),\ngives state the right to intervene in the purchase of raw materials (Article\n30).\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Twelfth 5 Year\nDevelopment Plan for the Steel Industry summarises the achievement of goals\nset in the previous plan, covers the development strategy and sets goals for\nthe entire steel industry. Similarly to the Order No.35 it sets very specific\ntargets on the industrial clustering level (Section III.(III).6), encourages\ncertain projects and discourages other (Section IV(IV))and discriminates in\nsupport for iron and steel industry in different provinces (Section IV(V),\nprovides for support of large-scale steel enterprises and gives a leading role\nto the biggest state-owned Chinese steel producers such as Bao Steel, Anshan\nIron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel etc.[9] The\nplan also provides for the strengthening of the regulation and management of\nthe existing steel enterprises' production operation (Section V(IV).\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Law of the People's\nRepublic of China on the State-owned Assets of Enterprises also obliges the\nSOEs (or State-invested enterprises (SIEs) are referred to in this law) to\ncomply with the national industrial policies[10].\nSimilarly the Tentative Measures for the supervision and Administration of\nthe Investments by Central Enterprises oblige SOEs (SIEs) to follow\ndevelopment plans and industrial policies of the state[11].\nAccording to Measures for the Administration of Development Strategies and\nPlans of Central Enterprises all SIEs shall formulate a development and\nstrategy plan which State-owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission\nof the State Council (SASAC) must examine and approve. When performing such\nexamination and prior the approval SASAC must consider, inter alia, whether or\nnot this plan complies with the national development planning and industrial\npolicies and whether or not it complies with the strategic adjustment of the\nlayout and structure of the State-owned economy[12].\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The concrete examples of\nthe implementation of the measures described in the plans such as the\nrelocation of the Capital Steel Corporation[13] or\nnumerous mergers of steel enterprises[14] show\nthat the plans are not only indicative documents which serve as guidelines but\nthey result in concrete actions by the state-owned steel enterprises\norchestrated by the government (represented by the NDRC and State Council).\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All of the specific actions\ndescribed in the above paragraphs must be followed and executed by the\nenterprises covered by the plans. It is concluded that through this direct\ngovernment involvement in steel enterprises' commercial behaviour, the\nstate-owned steel enterprises act like an arm of the government in performing\ngovernmental functions which subsequently lead to the fulfilment of goals and\ntargets set in the plans.\nGovernment control of SOEs\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having established that\nSOEs are performing government functions, the question remains as to whether\nthey exercise government authority in doing so. In this regard, a key question\nis whether they are meaningfully controlled by the government[15]. If this is the case, it is reasonable to determine, in the light\nof all the relevant evidence, that SOEs act as an arm of government and\neffectively implement policy set out in the plans above.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The governmental control\ndescribed below indicates that SOEs possess, exercise or are vested with\ngovernmental authority. Control can be exercised, inter alia, through\ngovernment ownership, administrative regulation and involvement of SASAC,\nboards of directors, government plans.\nGovernment ownership\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As already mentioned in the\nsection above concerning non-cooperation (recitals (46) to (48)), GOC did not\nprovide the requested information on the ownership structure of the producers\nof HRS and CRS in China. With the reply to the questionnaire the GOC submitted\na list of 54 companies in which the GOC is the largest shareholder, but during\nthe verification visit it claimed that the list is not correct and also\nincludes privately owned companies. The GOC did not correct the list and also\ndid not specify which of the companies are privately owned and which are owned\nby the GOC. Because of the non-cooperation the Commission had to look at other\nevidence on the file and publicly available information.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant provided\nevidence that the major HRS and CRS producers are state owned and submitted\ndetailed information in this respect in Annex 10 to the complaint[16]. Also other publicly available information[17]\nconfirms that the GOC has ownership stake in many of the producers of HRS and\nCRS.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account all the\ninformation on the file it is reasonable to conclude that the GOC has a\nsignificant ownership stake in many of the Chinese HRS and CRS producers.\nAdministrative regulation and involvement\nof SASAC\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SASAC\nperforms the responsibilities of the State as an investor and manages the\nstate-owned assets under its supervision. It is noted that although the GOC in\nits response to the questionnaire and subsequent submissions claimed that SASAC\nis not involved in the commercial operations of SOEs and supported this claim\nwith reference to Article 7 of the Interim Measures for the Supervision and\nAdministration of State-owned Assets of Enterprises[18], other\narticles of the same law and also other evidence on file[19]\nsuggest otherwise.\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, the GOC reply to\nthe anti-subsidy questionnaire shows that SASAC, authorised by the State\nCouncil, appoints and removes the top executives of the supervised enterprises,\nand evaluates their performances through legal procedures. It is also\nresponsible for urging the supervised enterprises to carry out the guiding\nprinciples and policies, has responsibility for the fundamental management of\nthe state-owned assets of enterprises and directs and supervises the management\nwork of local state-owned assets according to the law.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SASAC\nis also responsible for remuneration and assessment of the SOEs' managers;\nfurthermore, it appoints and decides on the rewards and punishments to the SOE\nmanagers[20]. In fact, all the evidence suggests that the careers of SOE\nmanagers depend on SASAC. These circumstances show that\nhe SASAC clearly is vested with Governmental authority.\nBoard of directors\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The composition of the\nBoards of SOEs also demonstrates the high level of control by the GOC of the\nSOEs. The evidence on file[21] shows that many of the members of boards of directors and boards of\nsupervisors hold or held in the past government and/or party functions and that\ntheir selection is strongly influenced by governmental authorities such as\nSASAC or Communist Party of China (CCP).\nGovernment plans\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC's policies,\ninterests and goals concerning steel industry are set in various governmental\nplans on central and also sub-central level, The SOEs are encouraged to follow\nthese policies (the non-compliant companies are even subject to sanctions) and\nfrom the recent actions of some major steel SOEs in China it is obvious that\nthese policies are adhered to and the steel SOEs are working towards reaching\nthe targets and goals set in the plans.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the Twelfth\n5 Year Development Plan for the Steel Industry only the \"enterprises\nthat comply with the nation's policies for the iron and steel industry and the\nStandards and Conditions for Production and Operation of the iron and steel\nindustry play a primary role in merging and reorganization.\"[22]\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A number of provincial and\nlocal level plans also mention specific SOEs and set goals and targets for\nthem. The complainant provided extracts from these plans[23]. All\nthese plans were requested from the GOC in the questionnaire and in the\ndeficiency letter for the purpose of verification and clarification but the GOC\ndecided not to provide them. It is however noted that the GOC did not dispute\nthe accuracy of these citations during the proceeding. Moreover, companies\nmentioned in the provincial and local plans admit their cooperation with\nauthorities and describe how they act or acted in the past in line with the\nplans[24].\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although the GOC claims\nthat some of the above plans are only indicative, not binding and are supposed\nto serve merely as a guidance, this allegation is not supported by other\nevidence on file. On the contrary, many laws and regulations which certainly\nare legally binding[25] make the state development plans and industrial policies obligatory\nfor the SOEs.\nConclusion\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC formulates the goals and targets for the iron and steel industry through\nthe 5-year plans and other relevant official documents and achieves these goals\nvia the functions and activities described therein. Since these plans and\ndocuments are formulated by departments of the Chinese Government such as\nNational Council or NDRC the functions and activities to which they refer\nshould be considered governmental. Since as described above the steel SOEs are\nobliged to follow the plans and policies they act as an arm of the government\nand, since the government exercises meaningful control over them, they are in\nfact exercising government authority.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nview of the lack of cooperation from the GOC, the scope of those entities which\nare considered \"public bodies\" was not defined to the full extent. In\nany event, any SOE in which the government is the majority or the largest\nshareholder is a public body. Entities in which the government has no\nshareholding are private bodies. Having that said, there is no need to draw a\nbright line between public and private bodies here, since in recitals (85) to (98)\nbelow, it is demonstrated that all private bodies in the steel sector are\nentrusted and directed by the State and so, for all relevant purposes, behave\nin the same way as public bodies.\n(b)              \nBenefit (public bodies)\nGeneral considerations\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to assess whether\nthere is a benefit in accordance with Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation, it\nis necessary to compare the prices of HRS and CRS paid by the exporting\nproducers concerned to the relevant benchmark. The AB report confirmed that in\na case where the market of the country of provision is distorted by the role of\nthe government, the use of external benchmarks was permitted. It also noted\nthat \"where the government is the predominant supplier, it is likely\nthat private prices will be distorted, but a case-by-case analysis is still\nrequired\"[26]. The AB also stated that: \"\u2026.we are not suggesting that\nthere is a threshold above which the fact that the government is the\npredominant supplier in the market alone becomes sufficient to establish price\ndistortion, but clearly, the more predominant a government's role in the market\nis, the more likely this role will result in the distortion of private\nprices\"[27]. The AB further stated that: \"when the government is a\n\"significant\" supplier, evidence pertaining to factors other than\ngovernment market share will be needed, as the government's role as a\nsignificant supplier cannot, on its own, prove distortion of private\nprices\". Therefore, the first question to be answered is whether the\ngovernment share of the production of HRS and CRS in China is predominant or\nmerely significant.\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission requested\nfrom the GOC information on the market of HRS and CRS in respect to the\nproportion of output of HRS and CRS produced by the SOEs and private companies\nbut the GOC did not submit any relevant information in this respect[28].\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission used other information available[29]\nconcerning this issue on the basis of which it was established that at least\n63% of HRS in China is produced by steel SOEs. It is important to note that\nthis 63% share of SOEs was arrived at after very conservative analysis and\nrepresents the absolute minimum figure. The fact that many of the allegedly\nprivate suppliers reported by the exporters seem to be trading companies (which\nmay well have purchased from the product from SOEs), the non-cooperation of the\nGOC (see recitals (46) to (48) above) and findings of other investigating\nauthorities (see footnote 32) leads to the conclusion that the real share of\nSOEs on the HRS market is much higher. Also the strong involvement of the GOC\nin this sector HRS market (see recitals (85) to (94) below) limits the\nmanoeuvring of the private operators.\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking the above into\nconsideration it was established that the SOEs are predominant in the HRS\nmarket in China. This predominance of SOEs in the HRS market is so considerable\nthat the private producers have no choice but to align their prices with the\nSOEs, as is demonstrated below.\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to CRS, the\nreported share of SOEs from the Chinese exporting producers (18%) was much lower\nthan in the case of HRS, however it was contradicted with other information\n(see recital (79) below). In view of non-cooperation from the GOC, the fact\nthat many of the allegedly private suppliers reported by the exporters seem to\nbe trading companies (which may well have purchased from the product from SOEs)\nand the limitations on commercial activities of private operators caused by the\nstrong involvement of the GOC in this sector (see recitals (85) to (94) below)\nit is concluded (partly on the basis of facts available (see recital (79)\nbelow) within the meaning of Article 28 of the basic Regulation) that SOEs also\npredominate in the CRS market in China.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nconclusion is corroborated by the World Steel Capacity Book, which contradicts\nthe 18% share reported by the Chinese exporters and shows that more than 70% of\nthe whole production capacity of CRS in China is state-owned[30]. \n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission requested\ninformation from the GOC on prices of HRS and CRS by state-owned and privately\nowned companies sold on Chinese market. In the reply to the questionnaire the\nGOC did not provide any such information. The investigation at the exporters of\nOCS established that the prices paid by the four exporting producers/groups\nduring the IP for the HRS and CRS sourced from private producers of HRS and CRS\nor from traders were consistently very close to the prices of SOEs[31]. Thus the observed data, together with the predominance of SOEs in\nthis sector, demonstrates that the price of private suppliers effectively\ntracks the prices paid to SOEs. Furthermore, in the contract submitted by one\nof the sampled exporting producers for the provision of HRS by a privately\nowned supplier there is even a condition to link the price to the SOE supplier\nprice.\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the\ntotality of the information on the file it is established that the prices of\nHRS and CRS sold by SOEs in China are distorted, as a result of the strong\npredominance of the SOEs in the HRS and CRS market in China. The prices of HRS\nand CRS of private suppliers are aligned with the prices of SOEs. Taking this\ninto account it is concluded that there are no reliable market prices in China\nfor the HRS and CRS. Since there are no \"prevailing market terms and\nconditions\" on the HRS and CRS market in China, the Commission, in\naccordance with Article 6(d) of the basic Regulation, had to look for an\nalternative benchmark. Since the whole of the Chinese market is distorted, it\nis considered impractical to adjust costs and prices in China in any meaningful\nway and import prices would appear to be similarly distorted by the\npredominance of SOEs. Therefore, in accordance with Article 6(d)(ii) of the\nbasic Regulation, an external benchmark was sought.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The most appropriate\nbenchmark appears to be a constructed benchmark on the basis of the world\nmarket prices of HRS and CRS regularly published in various specialised steel\njournals like Steel Business Briefing, MEPS and CRU.\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparing the SOE prices to\nthe out of country benchmark (constructed as explained in recital (103) below)\nshowed that these prices were well below the benchmark prices and consequently\nresulted in benefit for the Chinese exporting producers of OCS within the\nmeaning of Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation.\n(c)              \nSpecificity\n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This subsidy programme is\nspecific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(c) of the basic Regulation given\nthat the HRS and CRS is only used by limited number of industries and\nenterprises in China in their production.\n(d)              \nEntrustment and direction of private\nsuppliers\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nnext question to be addressed is whether the private producers of HRS and CRS,\nwhich are not public bodies, are nevertheless entrusted or directed by the GOC\nto provide HRS and CRS to the OCS producers, within the meaning of Article\n3.1(a)(iv) of the basic Regulation.\nGovernment policy\n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At\nthe outset, it has already been established that the GOC has a policy to\nprovide HRS and CRS to the OCS sector, because public bodies, which are part of\nthe government, are engaged in such provision and hold a predominant place in\nthe market, which enables them to offer below-market prices. And in any event,\nregardless of the characterisation of those bodies as \"public\" or\nnot, the same evidence shows the existence of government policy strongly\ninterfering in this sector. It now has to be determined whether that policy\nextends to private suppliers.\nExtension of policy to private suppliers of\nHRS and CRS\nGovernment plans providing guidance and\nencouragement\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a number of government\nplans and policy documents there are indications that steel producers in China\n(both SOEs and privately owned) are encouraged and supported by the GOC.\nCertain sections of these documents suggest that there is a direct link between\nthe government and the conduct of the private steel companies and on a number\nof occasions it can be observed that this \"guidance\" resulted in\naction by steel companies as is recommended in the plans.\n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For example, Order of\nthe NDRC No.35- Policies for the development of Iron and Steel Industry\nencourages the steel companies to act in certain way[32], sets\nconditions on investments and makes investment subject to approval by the\nauthorities[33], influence competition for resources[34] and\neven provide for sanctions for non-complying companies[35]. Also\nthe Twelfth 5 Year Development Plan for the Steel Industry influences\nthe business decisions of the steel companies which consequently can have\nimpact on cost structure and prices[36].\n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to this the\ncomplainant provided in the Annex 24 to the complaint a collection of extracts\nfrom various policy documents of different government organisations\nhighlighting the GOC support to the steel industry in general or organic coated\nbusiness specifically[37].\n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, there is\npublicly available information showing that the privately owned companies act in\naccordance with different government plans and policy documents[38].\nExport restrictions on hot-rolled and\ncold-rolled steel\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC has taken steps to\ndiscourage the export of HRS and CRS by means of export restrictions imposed\nthrough the complex VAT refund system. More specifically HRS and CRS is subject\nto the payment of VAT at 17%. VAT for domestically sold OCS produced from CRS\n(which is produced from HRS) is refundable at 13% whereas if the company\nchooses to export HRS or CRS the VAT is not at all refunded. This system means\nthat the privately owned producers of HRS and CRS are not able to act with\nnormal commercial freedom and has the effect of increasing the domestic supply\nof HRS and CRS and inevitably depressing its price on the Chinese market. Thus\nprivate-owned HRS and CRS producers (in the same way as SOEs) are unable to act\nindependently from the GOC policy. \nPricing of private suppliers\n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the section above\nconcerning benefit for public bodies, it was established that due to the\npredominance of the steel SOEs in the HRS and CRS market the private producers\nof HRS and CRS have no choice but to align their prices with the SOEs prices.\nIn other words they do not set the prices but they rather take them. This is\nanother sign that the private producers of HRS and CRS cannot act independently\nfrom the actions of GOC and other public bodies.\n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This fact is also supported\nby the information provided by the Chinese exporting producers which submitted\nreplies to the anti-subsidy questionnaires which shows that the prices of\nprivate suppliers of HRS and CRS are almost aligned with those of SOEs.\nFurthermore, in the contract submitted by one of the sampled exporting\nproducers for the provision of HRS by a privately owned supplier there is even\na condition to link the price to the SOE supplier price.\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nview of the above finding that SOE prices are at below-market levels, it is\nclear that the prices of privately owned suppliers, being aligned to those of\nSOEs, are also at below-market levels.\n(e)              \nFinancial contribution\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article\n3.1(a)(iv) \u2013 second indent - of the basic Regulation, a financial contribution\nexists where a government: \"entrusts or directs a private body to carry\nout one or more of the type of functions illustrated in points (i), (ii) and\n(iii) which would normally be vested in the government, and the practice, in no\nreal sense, differs from practices normally followed by governments;\". The\nWTO Appellate Body has interpreted \"direction\" as referring to\nsituations where a government exercises its authority, including some degree of\ncompulsion, over a private body, and \"entrustment\" as referring to\nsituations in which a government gives responsibility to a private body[39].In addition, the WTO panel on US-Export Restraints[40], established a three-pronged test for the existence of entrustment\nand direction, which requires the existence of (a) a government action, which\nis (b) addressed to particular party and (c ) the objective of which is a\nparticular task or duty[41].\n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, the\ninclusion of private suppliers in the GOC policy to supply HRS and CRS\nconstitutes government \"entrustment\" and \"direction\" of\nprivate suppliers for the following reasons:\nA government \"action\":\n\u2013              \nThe GOC \"policy\" (see recital (86)\nabove), constitutes an \"action\" or \"actions\". The policy is\ncarried out by public bodies (SOEs), which are predominant in the market and\nsell at below-market prices and by the GOC, through plans and the manipulation\nof export restrictions. The overall effect is that private suppliers are\neffectively compelled to follow the below-market prices of public bodies.\n\"Addressed to a particular party\":\n\u2013              \nThe government policy (notably the plans and\nexport restrictions) applies to all HRS and CRS producers, both state-owned and\nprivate. In this sense the policy is \"addressed\" to all producers.\nThis is evidenced by the fact that SOE and private prices are aligned and that\nprivate suppliers sell at prices which are commercially unreasonable.\n\"the objective of which is a particular\ntask or duty\":\n\u2013              \nThe objective of the government policy, as\nevidenced by the price levels in China, is the provision of HRS and CRS at\nbelow-market prices. The actions of the GOC and SOEs leave private suppliers\nwith no other choice but to follow the practices of public bodies and this\neffectively imposes a particular task or duty on them. The GOC policy,\nespecially through the plans and VAT manipulation, severely restricts the\nfreedom of private suppliers from this task or duty.\nConclusion\n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking\nall of the above factors into consideration it can be concluded that the GOC\nexport restriction, government planning and the predominance of SOEs limits the\nfreedom of private suppliers of HRS and CRS, obliging them to act in a\nnon-commercial manner and to accept economically irrational (below-market)\nprices which they would not do in a free and open market. This confirms that\nthe government policy to supply HRS and CRS (including to the organic coated\nsteel sector) extends to private suppliers.\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\nin view of the above analysis, the evidence on the file and other publicly\navailable information led the Commission to the conclusion that private\nproducers of HRS and CRS in China are entrusted and directed by the GOC to\nprovide goods in line with Articles 3.1(a)(iii) and 3.1(a)(iv) of the Basic\nregulation and act in the same way as steel SOEs.\n(f)               \nBenefit (private suppliers)\n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission established\nthat the private suppliers of HRS and CRS act under entrustment and direction\nof the GOC and the investigation showed that the prices of privately owned\nsuppliers of HRS and CRS are aligned with SOEs prices (see the section above).\n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 Taking this into account it\nis concluded that the findings concerning benefit and specificity from the\nprovision of HRS and CRS for below market prices by the SOEs also apply to the\nprovision of HRS and CRS by privately owned suppliers.\n(g)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 Two sampled exporting\nproducers have benefited from this programme. One exporting producer (Panhua\nSteel Group) has benefited from the provision of HRS for less than adequate\nremuneration and the other exporting producer (Huadong Steel Group) has\nbenefited from the provision of CRS for less than adequate remuneration.\n(h)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipient, which is found to exist during the IP. That benefit is calculated by\ntaking the sum of the differences between the actual purchase values and\nappropriate benchmark values of the HRS and CRS purchases. The resulting amount\nwas then allocated over the total sales turnover of the cooperating exporting\nproducer during the IP, because the subsidy is not contingent upon export\nperformance and was not granted by reference to the quantities manufactured,\nproduced, exported or transported. \n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 Since\nthe Chinese market for HRS and CRS is distorted, world market prices of HRS and\nCRS were considered appropriate bases for constructing benchmark prices for HRS\nand CRS. On the basis of various steel journals (SBB and MEPS) domestic prices,\nnet of taxes, of five countries/regions were selected (i.e. Europe, USA, Turkey,\nJapan and Brazil). In order to arrive at the representative benchmark the\nCommission selected the biggest market for each relevant geographical region,\ni.e. Europe (EU), North America (USA), Latin America (Brazil), Asia (Japan) and\nMiddle East/North Africa (Turkey). The monthly average prices for the IP period\nof each of the five countries/regions were arithmetically averaged so as to\narrive at the monthly benchmark prices. The five countries/regions selected did\nnot have the highest prices during the IP, they are all members of WTO, are among\nthe ten biggest steel producers worldwide and are located in different\ncontinents. The benchmark prices thus established are therefore considered\nreasonable and appropriate.\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate established\nwith regard to this scheme during the IP for the sampled exporting producers\namounts to 23,02% for the Huadong Group and 27,63% for the Panhua Group. \n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 The weighted average subsidy\nrate for the cooperating companies not included in the sample is 25,37%.\n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the low level of\ncooperation, the subsidy rate for all non-cooperating companies is set at the\nlevel of the highest subsidy rate established for this scheme for an entity\nrelated to one of the sampled cooperating companies, i.e. 32,44%.\n3.3.1.2.\u00a0 Provision of land use rights\nfor less than the adequate remuneration\n(a)              \nIntroduction\n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant alleged that\nthere is no functioning market for land in China and the amount paid by the\ncompanies for the use of land is below the normal market rate. In its reply to\nthe anti-subsidy questionnaire the GOC stated that \"In accordance with the\nLand Administration Law of the PRC, land in urban districts shall be owned by\nthe State; land in rural areas and suburban areas, except otherwise provided\nfor by the State, shall be collectively owned by peasants\". GOC claimed\nthat there is a standardised and orderly competitive land market, land use\nrights must be publicly traded in accordance with the law in the land market.\nGOC also stated that industrial and commercial land should be obtained by\ncompensation for the use in open market by bidding, auction and competition.\nThe GOC did not provide any data with respect to the actual land-use rights\nprices, minimum land prices formulated by the government which were mentioned\nin the reply to the anti-subsidy questionnaire and during the verification\nvisit.\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 During the verification the\nCommission requested from the GOC evidence to support its claim that all the\nindustrial land in China is assigned through bidding, quotation or auction. GOC\nwas not able to provide such evidence during the verification visit, but\nsubmitted some information in this respect after the verification visit.\nHowever, all this evidence shows is that from thirteen land-use rights\ntransactions concerning sampled exporting producers, only six were to be\nsubject to bidding or auction process. No information on the auction/bidding\nprocess participant was provided as requested by the Commission and in fact on\nall occasions the final price paid by the company was same as the price\narbitrarily set by the local authorities.\n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission also requested from the GOC, under the assumption that there is no\nmarket price for land in the PRC, its views on possible benchmarks. Although\nthis was only an assumption and by no means a finding or conclusion at the time\nwhen the questionnaire was sent to the GOC, the GOC expressed its view that\nthis assumption is false and did not provide any possible benchmarks. GOC also\npointed out to the alleged deficiency in the complaint that on one hand the\ncomplainant alleges that there is no market for land in China and \"out of\ncountry benchmark\" should be used, but on the other hand alleges that the\nSOEs receive land from the government at favourable terms vis-\u00e0-vis private industry\nand suggested that should any benchmark be used it should be the prices that\n\"not favoured\" Chinese industries are paying, but did not provide any\ninformation on these prices. In this context it should be noted that the\ncomplainant alleged that the land use rights market in China was distorted as a\nwhole and both state-owned and private OCS producers have received land-use\nrights for less than adequate remuneration.\n(b)              \nLegal basis\n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 The land-use right provision\nin China falls under Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of China\nand Real Right Law of the People's Republic of China.\n(c)              \nPractical implementation\n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article 2 of\nthe Land Administration Law, all land is government-owned since, according to\nthe Chinese constitution and relevant legal provisions, land belongs\ncollectively to the People of China. No land can be sold but land-use rights\nmay be assigned according to the law. The State authorities can assign it\nthrough public bidding, quotation or auction. \n(d)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 The cooperating exporting\nproducers have reported information regarding the land they hold as well as\nmost of the relevant land-use rights contracts/certificates, but only very\nlimited information was provided by the GOC about pricing of land-use rights.\n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned above the GOC\nclaimed that the land-use rights in China are assigned through bidding, auction\nand competition. This is also provided for in the Article 137 of the Real Right\nLaw of the People's Republic of China[42].\nPanhua Group Co. Ltd.\n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 However,\nduring the verification of cooperating exporting producers it was found that\nthis system as described by the GOC does not always work like that in practice.\nFor example out of six land-use rights purchased by Chongqing Wanda Steel Strip\nCo. Ltd. (part of Panhua Group Co. Ltd) for four of them, as confirmed by\ncompany officials, there was no bidding process. Chongqing Wanda was the only\nparticipant and the final transaction price paid by the company was in fact\nexactly the same as the initial price arbitrarily set by the local Land\nResources Bureau. As for the remaining two land-use rights there was a bidding\nprocess, but no evidence for this was provided neither by the company nor by\nthe GOC. In fact, from the documents submitted by the GOC after the\nverification visit it appears that also these two land-use rights were\npurchased for the price identical to the price set by the local Land Resources\nBureau. Zhangjiagang Panhua Steel Strip Co., Ltd (also part of Panhua Group Co.\nLtd) obtained three land-use rights by transfer from private companies in\nexchange for share in Panhua Group Co. Ltd.\nZhejiang Huadong Light Steel Building\nMaterial Co., Ltd\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 Zhejiang\nHuadong Light Steel Building Material Co., Ltd obtained two of its land-use rights\nfrom local Land and Resources Bureau, Xiaoshan District and one from the\nprivate company. No evidence on bidding or auction could be provided as\naccording to the GOC for the land-use rights purchased before 1 September 2006\nthere were no sales confirmation for land use rights transactions and in fact\nthe GOC did not confirm or deny that these transactions were subject to bidding\nor auction. \n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nfindings of the proceeding confirm that the situation concerning land provision\nand acquisition in China is unclear and non-transparent and the prices are\noften arbitrarily set by the authorities. The authorities set the prices\naccording to the Urban Land Evaluation System which instruct them among other\ncriteria to consider also industrial policy when setting the price of\nindustrial land. Also, at least in the steel sector, the access to industrial\nland is by law limited only to companies respecting the industrial policies set\nby the State[43].\n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 Also, the independent\ninformation submitted by the complainant suggest that the land in China is\nprovided for below the normal market rates[44]. \n(e)              \nConclusion\n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly,\nthe provision of land-use rights by the GOC should be considered a subsidy\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(iii) and Article 3(2) of the basic\nRegulation in the form of provision of goods which confers a benefit upon the\nrecipient companies. As explained in recitals (114) - (115) above, there is no\nfunctioning market for land in China and the use of an external benchmark\ndemonstrates that the amount paid for land-use rights by the cooperating\nexporters is well below the normal market rate. The\nsubsidy is specific under Article 4 2(a) and 4 2(c) of the basic Regulation\nbecause the access to industrial land is by law limited only to companies respecting\nthe industrial policies set by the State, only certain transactions were\nsubject to a bidding process, prices often being set by the authorities and\ngovernment practices in this area are unclear and non-transparent.\n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, this subsidy\nis considered countervailable. \n(f)               \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nit was concluded that the situation in China with respect to land-use rights is\nnot market-driven, there appear to be no available private benchmarks at all in\nChina. Therefore, an adjustment of costs or prices in China is not practicable.\nIn these circumstances it is considered that there is no market in China and,\nin accordance with Article 6(d)(ii) of the basic Regulation, the use of an\nexternal benchmark for measuring the amount of benefit is warranted. Given that\nthe GOC did not cooperate or failed to submit any proposal for an external\nbenchmark the Commission had to resort to facts available in order to establish\nan appropriate external benchmark. In this respect it is considered appropriate\nto use information from the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan as an\nappropriate benchmark. \n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission considers that the land prices in Taiwan offer the best proxy to the\nareas in China where the cooperating exporting producers are based. The\nmajority of the exporting producers are located in the eastern part of China,\nin developed high-GDP areas in provinces with a high population density.\n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the\nrecipients is calculated by taking into consideration the difference between\nthe amount paid by each company for land use rights and the amount that should\nhave been normally paid on the basis of the Taiwanese benchmark. \n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 In doing this calculation,\nthe Commission used the average land price per square meter established in Taiwan\ncorrected for currency depreciation and GDP evolution as from the dates of the\nrespective land use right contracts. The information concerning industrial land\nprices was retrieved from the website of the Industrial Bureau of the Ministry\nof Economic affairs of Taiwan. The currency depreciation and GDP evolution for Taiwan\nwere calculated on the basis of inflation rates and evolution of GDP per capita\nat current prices in USD for Taiwan as published by the IMF in its 2011 World\nEconomic Outlook. In accordance with Article 7(3) of the basic Regulation this\nsubsidy amount (numerator) has been allocated to the IP using the normal life\ntime of the land use right for industrial use land in China, i.e. 50 years.\nThis amount has then been allocated over the total sales turnover of the\nco-operating exporting producers during the IP, because the subsidy is not\ncontingent upon export performance and was not granted by reference to the\nquantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported. \n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate established\nwith regard to this scheme during the IP for the cooperating exporting producers\namounts to 0,34% for the Huadong Group and 1,12% for the Panhua Group.\n(125)\u00a0\u00a0 The weighted average subsidy\nrate for the cooperating companies not included in the sample is 0,73%.\n(126)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the low level of\ncooperation, the subsidy rate for all non-cooperating companies is set at the\nlevel of the highest subsidy rate established for this scheme for an entity\nrelated to one of the sampled cooperating companies, i.e. 1,36%.\n3.3.1.3.\u00a0 Programme consisting of\nprovision of water for less than adequate remuneration\n(a)              \nIntroduction\n(127)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint alleged that\nwater prices in China are exclusively determined by public authorities and that\nthe pricing structure is set according to industrial macro-policies. It also\nreported that water prices were different in the various local areas and that\nthere was also a differentiation of rates on a company-by-company basis. The\ncomplaint alleged that it was likely that OCS producers had benefitted from\nwater prices for less than adequate remuneration in accordance with the policy\nto encourage high-added value steel products.\n(128)\u00a0\u00a0 The water supply and market\nin China is administered by the NDRC, the Ministry of Water Resources and the\nMinistry of Environment. The water supply market is still largely dominated by\nlocal state-owned companies, although the entrance of foreign investment\ncompanies in some water supply projects of certain cities has broken the\nmonopoly of state suppliers. However, the GOC was unable to provide a detailed\nlist of water suppliers with their service area and volumes supplied (see\nrecital (129) below), but limited its reply to a list of water suppliers in the\nareas of the sampled exporting producers.\n(129)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nfor pricing, the NDRC formulates the main pricing policy and the local\nauthorities set the local water price after a hearing procedure with the aim to\npursue a sustainable utilisation of water resources. The prices reflect the\ncosts together with a reasonable profit for the local water suppliers. The GOC\nsubmitted the relevant price lists applicable in the municipalities where the\nsampled OCS producing exporters were located. It was clarified that the various\nmunicipal prices apply to all industrial users uniformly and do not vary by\ncompany or users.\n(b)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(130)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation confirmed\nthat the NDRC sets the basic price of water, and the municipal price\nadministrative authorities set the price for each municipality on the basis of\nseveral parameters (e.g. costs of distribution, profit, and reasonable\nsurplus). The water price is supplemented by a 'sewage treatment' fee also set\nat municipal level.\n(131)\u00a0\u00a0 While the basic water price,\nthe sewage treatment fee and other possible local surcharges are equally\napplicable to all users falling in the same categories, it was found that one\nof the two sampled exporters, Zhejiang Huadong Group, did not pay the sewage\ntreatment fee.\n(132)\u00a0\u00a0 The exporter claimed that it\npaid this fee as a lump-sum amount to the Environment Protection Bureau.\nHowever, it is not considered that this payment was made on the place of the\nsewage treatment fee for the following three reasons: (1) the official document\nreads \"waste water emission\" fee and not \"sewage treatment\"\nfee; (2) the payment is not proportional to the actual water consumption; (3)\nthe total amount paid is quite small as compared to the actual amount that\nwould have been payable if the sewage treatment fee on the actual water\nconsumption had been due.\n(c)              \nFinancial contribution\n(133)\u00a0\u00a0 Zhejiang Huadong Group\nreceived a financial contribution within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(iii) of\nthe basic Regulation in that the government provided water through the local\npublic water supply company (i.e. Hangzhou Xiaoshan Water Supply Co. Ltd.).\nThis constitutes a government financial contribution in the form of provision\nof goods other than general infrastructure within the meaning of the basic\nRegulation. Alternatively, this could be viewed as revenue foregone by the\ngovernment because a public body did not collect revenue otherwise due in the\nsense of Article 3(1)(a)(ii).\n(d)              \nBenefit\n(134)\u00a0\u00a0 Huadong Steel Group received\na benefit within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation to the\nextent that the government has provided water for less than adequate\nremuneration. It has been established that this exporter has not paid the full\nprice for water supply normally applicable to the category of users to which it\nbelongs, as the \"sewage treatment fee\" component of the water price\nhas not been paid. \n(e)              \nSpecificity\n(135)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy in form of\nprovision of water to one of the cooperating exporters is specific within the\nmeaning of Article 4(2)(c) of the basic Regulation, since the sewage treatment\nfee is not waived for all enterprises. Notwithstanding the absence of\nlegislation limiting this subsidy to certain enterprises, the possibility for a\ncertain enterprise producing the product concerned to obtain water supply for\nless than adequate remuneration, coupled with the apparent discretion conferred\nwith the local authorities to waive part of the rate normally paid for water,\nmakes the subsidy in fact specific. The Commission could not collect any\nfurther evidence concerning the basis on which this fee was waived as the\nexporting producer was unable to provide it.\n(f)               \nCalculation of subsidy amount\n(136)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. That benefit is considered\nto be the amount of sewage treatment fee not paid for water consumption during\nthe IP. In accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, this subsidy\namount (numerator) has been allocated over the total sales turnover of the\ncooperating exporting producers during the IP, because the subsidy is not\ncontingent upon export performance and was not granted by reference to the\nquantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported.\n(137)\u00a0\u00a0 Zhejiang Huadong Group has\nbenefited from the non-payment of the sewage treatment fee. The subsidy rate\nestablished for it is 0,01%.\n(138)\u00a0\u00a0 The weighted average subsidy\nrate for the cooperating companies not included in the sample is 0,01%.\n(139)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the low level of\ncooperation, the subsidy rate for all non-cooperating companies is set at the\nlevel of the highest subsidy rate established for this scheme for the sampled\ncooperating companies, i.e. 0,01%.\n3.3.1.4.\u00a0 Programme consisting of\nprovision of electricity for less than adequate remuneration\n(a)              \nIntroduction\n(140)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint alleged that\nthe GOC has provided electricity for less than adequate remuneration through\npreferential rates. In particular, the complaint asserted that electricity\nrates were set differently in different provinces and also that preferential\nrates were used as an industrial policy tool to encourage high added-value\nsteel products and discourage outdated production capacities.\n(141)\u00a0\u00a0 The NDRC is responsible for\nregulating the electricity market and setting the pricing in China. The\ntrans-provincial and provincial grids are operated by two state-owned\nsuppliers: State Grid Corporation of China and China Southern Power Grid\nCorporation. The electricity suppliers at municipal level are subsidiaries of\nthese companies. A competition mechanism is in the process of being introduced\nin China through a few pilot projects, but its impact is still negligible at\nthis stage.\n(142)\u00a0\u00a0 The electricity prices are\nset by the NDRC on the basis of a procedure that includes cost investigation,\nexpert appraisal, public hearings, and final price determination and\npublication. The NDRC publishes the prices applicable to each province into\nNotices, and then the local price bureaux publish a corresponding notice at\nlocal level implementing the prices decided by the central NDRC. The final\nprice reflects purchasing costs, transmission costs and losses, and government\nsurcharges. The prices are differentiated by province depending on the local\nsituation and policy objectives pursued in the various provinces. They are set\nfor different end user categories (e.g. residential, industrial users). An\nadditional price differential exists for different industrial users to pursue\nthe industrial policies set by the GOC and reflected in the catalogue contained\nin Decision No. 40 (2005) of the NDRC (see further explanation in recital (182)).\nUsers falling in the 'encouraged' enterprises according to the NDRC catalogue\npay the basic electricity rate, whereas users falling in the 'outdated' or\n'prohibited' enterprises pay a surcharge on top of the basic rate. Users not\nfalling into any category listed in the catalogue fall in the default category\nof 'allowed' enterprises and also pay the basic rate without surcharges. OCS\nproducers would normally fall in the category of 'encouraged' enterprises\naccording to Decision No. 40 of the NDRC.\n(b)              \nNon \u2013cooperation\n(143)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission requested\nfrom the GOC the regulatory framework of the electricity market and pricing and\nthe role that all relevant bodies or entities play. The GOC failed to submit\nthe full set of the relevant pricing decisions issued by the NDRC and the local\nprice bureaux not only with regard to the non-sampled producing exporters, but\nalso with regard to the sampled producing exporters. The GOC also failed to\ndescribe accurately the role of the NDRC and the local price bureaux in the\nsetting of the prices. The Commission informed the GOC of these shortcomings\nwith regard to the sampled producing exporters in its letter of 12 August 2012.\nIt was also discovered after the verification visits that the GOC indicated an\nincorrect electricity rate applicable to one of the sampled cooperating exporters.\n(c)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(144)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation confirmed\nthat it is the NDRC that sets the prices of electricity applicable in the\nvarious provinces. It was verified that the local price bureau merely acts as\nan executive arm of the decision taken at central level by the NDRC. This is\nalso confirmed by the fact that the NDRC issues Notices in which it sets the\nactual prices set for each province and then these notices are formally\ntransposed into local notices adopted by the local price bureaux and\nimplemented at local level. The investigation also established that\ndifferential electricity rates applicable for certain sectors and/or at\nprovincial and local level are set in accordance with certain factors,\nincluding notably the pursuit of the industrial policy goals set by the central\nand local governments in their 5-year plans and in the sectoral plans.\n(145)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation of the\ncooperating sampled exporters showed that one of them, i.e. Chongqing Wanda\nSteel Strip (\"CWSS\") benefited from an electricity rate lower than\nthe rate generally applicable for large industrial users. It was found that in\nthe specific area where this exporter was located a sub-category of certain\nindustrial users, including those producing the product concerned, were\nentitled to this lower rate.\n(d)              \nFinancial contribution\n(146)\u00a0\u00a0 One\nof the cooperating sampled exporters (CWSS) received a financial contribution\nin the sense of Article 3(1)(a)(iii) of the basic Regulation in that the\ngovernment provided electricity through the local public electricity supply\ncompany. This constitutes a government contribution in the form of provision of\ngoods other than general infrastructure within the meaning of the basic\nRegulation.\n(e)              \nBenefit\n(147)\u00a0\u00a0 CWSS received a benefit\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation to the extent that\nthe government has provided electricity for less than adequate remuneration. It\nhas been established that this exporter was entitled to a rate lower than the\nrate generally applicable to other large industrial users. \n(f)               \nSpecificity\n(148)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy in form of\nprovision of electricity to one of the cooperating exporters is specific within\nthe meaning of Article 4(2)(a) and 4(3) of the basic Regulation. The lower\nelectricity rate is set out in the relevant NDRC Notice and incorporated in the\nNotice issued by the local Price Bureau, i.e. it is mandated by a central\nauthority and administered at local level. This lower rate is limited to\ncertain enterprises in certain specified sectors (mainly producers of\nferroalloy in electronic furnace and fertilizer companies) included in a\nsub-category of large-scale industrial users. Therefore, this lower rate is\nlimited de jure only to companies falling into these categories in the meaning\nof Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation.\n(149)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsubsidy is also limited to a certain region in that it only applies in a\nlimited designated geographical area where the exporting producer is located.\nThis area is encouraged according to legislation issued by the Central Government,\ni.e. the Circular of the State Council Concerning Several Policies on\nCarrying out the Development of China's Vast Western Regions (see for more\ndetails recital (233) below). This Circular explicitly mentions price mechanism\nin electricity transmission and provision as one of the tools to achieve\ndevelopment of certain sectors. As the electricity rates applicable in this\narea are set by a central authority, this subsidy is also regionally specific\nwithin the meaning of Article 4(3) of the basic regulation.\n(g)              \nCalculation of subsidy amount\n(150)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit to the exporting\nproducers has been calculated by considering the difference between the actual\nelectricity rate per Kwh paid and the rate that should have been paid per Kwh\nfor large industrial users, multiplied by the electricity volume consumed\nduring the IP. In accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation this\namount (numerator) has then been allocated over the total sales turnover of the\ncooperating exporting producers during the IP, because the subsidy is not\ncontingent upon export performance and was not granted by reference to the\nquantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported.\n(151)\u00a0\u00a0 One of the cooperating\nsampled exporting producers belonging to the Panhua Group of companies (i.e.\nCWSS) has benefited from this lower electricity rate. The subsidy rate\nestablished for the Panhua Group is 0,14%.\n(152)\u00a0\u00a0 The weighted average subsidy\nrate for the cooperating companies not included in the sample is 0,07%.\n(153)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the low level of\ncooperation, the subsidy rate for all non-cooperating companies is set at the\nlevel of the highest subsidy rate established for this scheme for an entity\nrelated to one of the sampled cooperating companies, i.e. 0,17%%.\n3.3.1.5.\u00a0 Provision of various goods\nfor less than adequate remuneration\n(154)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint referred to a\nnumber of other goods provided by the GOC to OCS producers through its SOEs. In\nparticular, the complaint listed a number of specific transactions concerning\nthe provision of several steel outputs manufactured by SOEs, including iron ore\nconcentrate, pellets, sintered ore, scrap, billet, sintered ore, alloys and\nmany others. The complaint showed that the price for the provision of these\ngoods was set by reference to different elements and/or benchmarks, and that\nthere were price caps or adjustments depending on the different goods and on\nwhether the transaction concerned related parties.\n(155)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC replied that it did\nnot have this programme for steel makers during the IP. Given the lack of\nfurther information provided by the GOC on this programme, the Commission based\nits findings on the information available on file according to Article 28 of\nthe basic Regulation.\n(156)\u00a0\u00a0 To the extent that prices\nfor the various goods mentioned above do not reflect adequate remuneration,\nthis programme is countervailable according to Article 3(1)(a)(iii) and Article\n6(d) of the basic Regulation. However, the complexity of the various\ntransactions for the provision of these goods and of the underlying contracts\nwhich were not available in the record of the proceeding did not enable the\nCommission to come to a firm conclusion on this programme. Therefore the\nCommission has decided not to assess this programme further.\n3.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preferential\nloans and interest rates to the OCS industry\n(a)              \nIntroduction\n(157)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ncomplainant alleged that the OCS producers benefit from low (subsidised)\ninterest rates from state-owned commercial banks and government banks in\naccordance with the GOC policy to support and develop the expansion of the\nChinese steel industry under the five year plans. \n(b)              \nNon-cooperation and the use of facts\navailable\n(158)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission requested from the GOC information concerning the proportion of\nloans provided by the banks where the GOC is the largest or sole shareholder,\nbanks where the GOC has a shareholding stake but is not the largest\nshareholder, banks where the GOC is not a shareholder and banks which are\nforeign owned, to both industry as a whole and to the industry concerned by\nthis proceeding. The GOC replied that it does not retain records of the amounts\nand percentages of the loans provided by the state-owned banks and that the GOC\nalso does not retain the records of loans for steel industry. GOC did not\nsuggest any alternative source for this information.\n\n(159)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission also sought information about the state ownership of the banks and\nfinancial institutions but the GOC did not provide the information claiming\nthat it does not retain such records. Although it is unlikely that the GOC is\nnot aware of the assets it owns, it is noted that according to the publicly\navailable information[45][46] the GOC is a major shareholder in many of the major banks\nestablished in China and therefore, as in the case of the SOEs producing HRS\nand CRS, it has access to banks' Articles of Association where the information\non shareholdership should be described in detail. In this respect it is also\nnoted that according to Article 61 of the Law on Commercial Banks [2003] the\nbanks \"shall report the balance sheets, statements of profits, and\nother financial statement and statistical reports and documents to the banking\nregulatory organ of the State Council and People's Bank of China\". \n(160)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission also requested information (by means of a specific questionnaire \u2013\nAppendix A) concerning the structure of government control in the Chinese banks\nconcerned and the pursuit of government policies or interests with respect to\nthe steel industry (i.e. board of directors and board of shareholders, minutes\nof shareholders/directors meetings, nationality of shareholders/directors,\nlending policies and assessment of risk with respect to loans provided to the\ncooperating exporting producers). Nevertheless, in the reply to the\nquestionnaire the GOC submitted only one Appendix A which contained some\ngeneral information (mostly compiled from websites of the banks). Most of the\nspecific information requested in Appendix A was not provided. To some of the\nquestions the GOC replied that it does not have such information at this time\nand to some it only provided information on selected banks (e.g. Articles of\nAssociation were only provided for eight banks). In the deficiency letter, the\nCommission repeated its request and invited the GOC to provide all the\ninformation as originally requested in the questionnaire. In its reply to the\ndeficiency letter the GOC submitted some additional information. However, the\nanswer was still very incomplete and much of the requested information (e.g.\nthe percentage of government ownership in state-owned banks, the Articles of\nAssociation of some banks listed in the questionnaire, complete replies\nquestions in Appendix A) was not provided. \n(161)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe questionnaire, deficiency letter and again during the on-spot verification\nvisit the Commission requested circulars of the People's Bank of China (PBOC)\nconcerning expansion of financial institutions' loan interest rate policy\n(YinFa [2003] No.250 and YinFa [2004] No 251). The Commission learned about the\nexistence of these circulars in the course of previous investigation[47]. However, instead of providing these circulars the GOC referred the\nCommission to the PBOC website to find out about the financial institutions'\nloan interest rate policy. During the verification two exhibits were submitted\nin this respect, but these were only printouts from the website. It is noted\nthat no complete content of these Circulars could be found on the PBOC website.\n(162)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission requested also the Circular of PBOC concerning the changes of 8 June\n2012 to be submitted during the on-spot verification. The GOC did not provide\nthe Circular and instead it only provided general information printed from the\nPBOC website concerning adjustment of benchmark interest rates. \n(163)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission also asked the GOC to arrange meetings with specific banks in order\nto verify information concerning preferential lending to the OCS industry. However\nthe GOC failed to organise such meetings and claimed that it was unable to\nintervene with state-owned banks to arrange such meetings. It is also noted\nthat in the pre-verification letter of 7 June 2012 the Commission explained\nthat it would be prepared to start the verification one day earlier and in fact\nallow more time for the verification should the GOC consider that banks are\nbest placed to provide clarifications and explanations concerning preferential\nlending. The Commission therefore requested the GOC to confirm the presence of\nthe banks before the verification so that necessary arrangements could be made\nby the verification team. In its letter of 15 June 2012 the GOC stated that it\nwould continue to request the banks to cooperate but that it could not coerce\nthem to do so. Eventually, it was only during the first day of the verification\nthat the Commission team was informed that the representative of the China\nConstruction Bank was available for the questions and explanations. Since the\nCommission had not been informed about this (although specifically requested in\nthe pre-verification letter) it was not possible to address specific questions\nabout contracts and loan terms but only questions of a general character. In\nany event, no supporting documentation was provided for the statements made by\nthe representative of the China Construction Bank with the explanation that all\nthe documents that the Commission requested would be confidential and of an\ninternal character.\n(164)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC was made aware of the consequences of non-cooperation in accordance with\nArticle 28(1) and (6) of the basic Regulation. In view of this lack of\ncooperation, it has been necessary, in addition to taking account of relevant\nGOC documents submitted by other parties, to use information from secondary\nsources, including the complaint and publicly available information retrieved\nfrom internet. \n(c)              \nFindings of the investigation\nState involvement in the banking sector \n(165)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has established that the Chinese financial\nmarket is characterised by government intervention because most of the major\nbanks are state-owned. The Chinese authorities have provided only very limited\ninformation concerning shareholding/ownership of banks in China. However, as\nfurther outlined below, the Commission compiled available information in order\nto arrive at a representative finding. In performing its analysis whether banks\nare entities vested with or exercising government authority (public bodies) the\nCommission also sought information concerning not only the government ownership\nof the banks but also other characteristics such as the government presence on\nthe board of directors, the government control over their activities, the\npursuit of government policies or interests and whether entities were created\nby statute.\n(166)\u00a0\u00a0 From\nthe available information it is concluded that the state-owned banks in China\nhold the highest market share and are the predominant players in the Chinese\nfinancial market. According to the 2006 Deutsche Bank Research on China's\nbanking sector[48], the state-owned banks' share may amount to more than 2/3 of the\nChinese market. For the same matter the WTO Trade Policy Review of China noted\nthat \u201cThe high degree of state ownership is another notable feature of the\nfinancial sector in China\u201d[49] and \"there has been little change in the market structure\nof China's banking sector, which is dominated by state-owned banks\"[50]. It is pertinent to note that the five largest state-owned\ncommercial banks (Agricultural Bank, Bank of China, Construction Bank of China,\nBank of Communications and Industrial and Commercial Bank) appear to represent\nmore than half of the Chinese banking sector[51]. \n(167)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission also\nrequested information concerning the structure of government control in those\nChinese banks and the pursuit of government policies or interests with respect\nto the steel industry (i.e. board of directors and board of shareholders,\nminutes of shareholders/directors meetings, nationality of\nshareholders/directors, lending policies and assessment of risk with respect to\nloans provided to the cooperating exporting producers). Nevertheless, as noted\nin recital (160) above, the GOC provided only very limited information in this\nrespect. Consequently, the Commission had to use the information available. It\nconcluded on the basis of the available data that those banks are controlled by\nthe government and exercise government authority in a manner that their actions\ncan be attributed to the State. The relevant data used in order to arrive at\nthe aforesaid findings is derived from information submitted by the GOC, the\nannual reports of Chinese banks that were either submitted from GOC or publicly\navailable, information retrieved from the 2006 Deutsche Bank Research on\nChina's banking sector, WTO Policy review on China (2010 and 2012), China 2030\nWorld Bank Report, information submitted from the co-operating exporting\nproducers and information existing in the complaint. As for foreign banks,\nindependent sources estimate that they represent a minor part of the Chinese\nbanking sector and consequently play an insignificant role in policy lending;\nwith relevant information suggesting that this may represent as little as 1% of\nthe Chinese market[52]. Relevant publicly available information also confirms that Chinese\nbanks, particularly the large commercial banks, still rely on state-owned\nshareholders and the government for replenishment of capital when there is a\nlack of capital adequacy as result of credit expansion[53]. \n(168)\u00a0\u00a0 With\nrespect to the banks that provided loans to the cooperating exporting\nproducers, the great majority of them are state-owned banks. Indeed on the\nbasis of the available information it was found that at least 14 out of the 17\nreported banks are state-owned banks, including the major Commercial banks in China\nlike Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank\nof China. With respect to the remaining state-owned banks concerned, again the\nCommission requested the same information mentioned above concerning the\ngovernment control and the pursuit of government policies or interests with\nrespect to the steel industry. No such detailed information was provided. It is\ntherefore concluded that the banks are controlled by the government and\nexercise government authority in a manner that their actions can be attributed\nto the State. For this reason the state-owned commercial banks in China should\nbe considered public bodies.\n(169)\u00a0\u00a0 Another sign of GOC involvement\nin Chinese financial market is the role played by the PBOC in setting the\nspecific limits on the way interest rates are set and fluctuate. Indeed, the\ninvestigation established that the PBOC has specific rules regulating the way\ninterest rates float in China. According to the information available, these\nrules are set out in the PBOC's Circular on the Issues about the Adjusting\nInterest Rates on Deposits and Loans-Yinfa (2004) No 251 (\"Circular\n251\"). Financial institutions are requested to provide loan rates within a\ncertain range of the benchmark loan interest rate of the PBOC. For commercial\nbank loans and policy bank loans managed commercially there is no upper limit\nrange but only a lower limit range. For urban credit cooperatives and rural\ncredit cooperatives there are both upper and lower limit ranges. For\npreferential loans and loans for which the State Council has specific\nregulations the interest rates do not float upwards. The Commission sought\nclarifications from the GOC on the definition and wording stated in the\nCircular 251 as well as to its preceding legislation (Circular of PBOC\nconcerning expansion of Financial Institution's Loan Interest Rate Float Range\n\u2013 YinFa [2003] No. 250). However as described in the recitals (161) and (162)\nabove, the GOC refused to provide these Circulars which prevented the\nCommission to verify their content and seek explanations. Since the GOC did not\nprovide any relevant information in this respect which would suggest the\nsituation changed since May 2011 when the Commission concluded its anti-subsidy\ninvestigation concerning Coated Fine Paper[54] it is\nestablished that the PBOC is involved and influences setting of interest rates\nby state-owned commercial bank.\nThe GOC did not provide any evidence that the situation as established in the\nCoated Fine Paper investigation has changed, therefore on the basis of facts\navailable and the other evidence cited above, it was concluded that the\nsituation concerning the methodology for determining interest rates should\nremain the same during the entire IP.\nEntrustment and direction\n(170)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission also endeavoured to analyse whether the privately owned commercial\nbanks in China are entrusted or directed by the GOC to provide preferential\n(subsidised) loans to the organic coated steel producers, within the meaning of\nArticle 3.1(a)(iv) of the basic Regulation.\nGOC policy\n(171)\u00a0\u00a0 From the section above\nconcerning state involvement in the banking sector (recitals (165) to (169)) it\nis clear that the GOC has a policy to provide preferential lending to the\norganic coated steel sector, because public bodies (state-owned commercial\nbanks)[55]\nare engaged in such provision and hold a predominant place in the market, which\nenables them to offer below-market interest rates. It now has to be determined\nwhether that policy extends to private suppliers.\nExtension of policy to private banks\n(172)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commercial banking law\n[2003] applies in the same way to state-owned commercial banks and privately\nowned commercial banks. For example Article 38 of this law instructs all\nCommercial banks (i.e. also those which are privately owned) to \"determine\nthe loan rate in accordance with the upper and lower limit of the loan rate set\nby the PBOC\", Article 34 of the Commercial Banking Law instructs the\ncommercial banks to \"carry out their loan business upon the needs of\nnational economy and the social development and with the spirit of state\nindustrial policies\".\n(173)\u00a0\u00a0 Also the Order No.35 -\nPolicies for the development of Iron and Steel Industry, in particular\nArticles 24 and 25 which limit the provision of loans only to those companies\nwhich comply with the national development policies for the Iron and steel\nindustry do not distinguish between state-owned and privately-owned commercial\nbanks.\n(174)\u00a0\u00a0 Further the above mentioned\n(recitals (161) and (162)) Circulars of the PBOC are also binding for privately\n\u2013owned commercial banks.\n(175)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nabove citations from laws and regulations relevant for the banking sector show\nthat the GOC policy to provide preferential lending to the organic coated steel\nproducers extends also to privately-owned commercial banks and in fact the GOC\ninstructs them to \"carry out their loan business upon the needs of\nnational economy and the social development and with the spirit of state\nindustrial policies\"[56].\nCredit risk assessment\n(176)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission requested\nrelevant information from the GOC in order to assess how the banks in China are\nperforming credit risk assessment of the OCS companies before deciding whether\nto grant them or not loans and deciding on the conditions of the loans which are\ngranted. In the Appendix A to the questionnaire the Commission requested\ninformation on how do the banks take account of risk when granting loans, how\nis the creditworthiness of the borrower assessed, what are the risk premiums\ncharged for different companies/industries in China by the bank, which are the\nfactors the bank takes into account when assessing the loan application, the\ndescription of loan application and approval process etc. However, neither the\nGOC nor the individual banks identified in the questionnaire provided any\nevidence in this respect. The GOC provided only replies of general nature not\nsupported by any evidence whatsoever that any kind of credit risk assessment\nactually takes place.\n(177)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission also\nrequested the similar information from the cooperating exporting producers and\nattempted to verify it during the on-spot verification visits of sampled\nexporting producers. Both groups of sampled exporting producers replied that\nbanks request certain documents and perform some kind of credit risk analyses\nbefore the loans are granted. However, they could not support their claims with\nany evidence. During the on-spot verification the Commission asked for the\nevidence that the banks requested such documents or that these documents were\nprovided to the banks by the companies or any kind of report issued by the\nbanks proving that such credit risk analyses was performed. However the sampled\ngroups of exporting producers were not able to provide such evidence, neither\nwere they able to provide any other evidence supporting their claims. It is\nalso noted that none of the sampled groups of exporting producers or individual\ncompanies within these groups has a credit rating assigned.\n(178)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninformation concerning credit risk assessment was repeatedly requested from\ninterested parties as it is considered crucial inter alia account taken\nof (i) the finding of the IMF 2006 report which suggested that the bank\nliberalisation in China is incomplete and credit risk is not properly reflected[57], (ii) the IMF 2009 report which highlighted the lack of interest\nrate liberalisation in China[58], (iii) the IMF 2010 Country Report which stated that cost of\ncapital in China is relatively low, credit allocation is sometimes determined\nby non-price means and high corporate saving is partly linked to low cost of\nvarious factor inputs (including capital and land)[59] and\n(iv) the OECD 2010 Economic Survey of China[60] and\nOECD Economic Department Working Paper No. 747 on China's Financial Sector\nReforms[61] which stated that ownership of financial institutions remains\ndominated by the State raising issues as the extent to which banks' lending\ndecisions are based purely on commercial considerations while banks'\ntraditional role appears to be that of government agencies with ties to the\ngovernment.\n(d)              \nFinancial Contribution\n(179)\u00a0\u00a0 Having\nregard to the totality of the evidence, it is concluded that the vast majority\nof loans to the 2 sampled groups of exporting producers are provided by\nstate-owned banks which are considered to be public bodies because they are\nvested with government authority and exercise government functions. There is\nfurther evidence that these banks effectively exercise government authority\nsince as it is explained in recital (169) there is a clear intervention by the\nState (i.e. PBOC) in the way commercial banks take decisions on interest rates\nfor loans granted to Chinese companies. In these circumstances, the lending\npractices of these entities are directly attributable to the government. The\nfact that banks exercise government authority is also confirmed by the way NDRC\nOrder No.35- Policies for the development of Iron and Steel Industry[62], Decision 40 and Article 34 of the Law on Commercial\nBanks act with respect to the fulfilment of the government industrial policies.\nThere is also a great deal of circumstantial evidence, supported by objective\nstudies and reports, that a large amount of government intervention is still\npresent in the Chinese financial system as already explained in recital (178)\nabove. Finally, the GOC failed to provide information which would have enabled\na greater understanding of the state-owned banks' relationship with government\nas explained in recitals (159) to (164). Thus, in the case of loans provided by\nstate-owned commercial banks in China , the Commission concludes that there is\na financial contribution to the organic coated steel producers in the form of a\ndirect transfer of funds from the government within the meaning of Article\n3(1)(a)(i) of the basic Regulation. In addition, the\nsame evidence shows that SOCBs (as well as privately owned banks) are entrusted\nor directed by the government and this consequently means that a financial\ncontribution exists within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(iv) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(180)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nview of the analysis in Recitals (170) to (175) above, it is also determined\nthat privately-owned banks are entrusted and directed by the GOC to provide\nloans to the OCS producers and that a financial contribution exists under\nArticles 3(1)(a)(i) and 3(1)(a)(iv) of the basic Regulation.\n(e)              \nBenefit\n(181)\u00a0\u00a0 A benefit within the meaning\nof Articles 3(2) and 6(b) of the basic Regulation exists to the extent that the\ngovernment loans are granted on terms more favourable than the recipient could\nactually obtain on the market. Since it has been established that\nnon-government loans in China do not provide an appropriate market benchmark\n(privately owned banks being entrusted and directed by the GOC), such a\nbenchmark has been constructed using the method described in recitals (191) and\n(192) below. \n(f)               \nSpecificity\n(182)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsteel industry belongs to the encouraged category according to the Decision No.\n40. Decision No 40, is an Order from the State Council, which is the highest\nadministrative body in the PRC and in that regard the decision is legally\nbinding for other public bodies and the economic operators. It classifies the\nindustrial sectors into 'Encouraged, Restrictive and Eliminated Projects'. This\nAct represents an industrial policy guideline that along with the Directory Catalogue\nshows how the GOC maintains a policy of encouraging and supporting groups of\nenterprises or industries, such as the steel/ OCS industry, classified by the\nDirectory Catalogue as an 'Encouraged industry'. With respect to the number of\nindustries listed as 'Encouraged' it is noted that these represent only a\nportion of the Chinese economy. Furthermore, only certain activities within\nthese encouraged sectors are given \"encouraged\" status. Decision No\n40 also stipulates under Article 17 that the 'Encouraged investment projects'\nshall benefit from specific privileges and incentives, inter alia, from\nfinancial support. On the other hand, with reference to the 'Restrictive and\nEliminated Projects', Decision No 40 empowers the state authorities to intervene\ndirectly to regulate the market. In fact, Articles 18 and 19 provide that the\nrelevant authority prevents financial institutions from supplying loans to such\n'Restrictive and Eliminated Projects'. It is clear from the above that Decision\nNo 40 provides binding rules to all the economic institutions in the form of\ndirectives on the promotion and support of encouraged industries, one of which\nis the part of OCS industry:\n(183)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, Order No. 35\nof the NDRC - Policies for the development of Iron and Steel Industry, in\nparticular Articles 24 and 25, limit the provision of loans only to steel\nenterprises which fully comply with the development policies for the iron and\nsteel industry.\n(184)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant also\nprovided evidence that some other government plans and documents are\nencouraging and instructing for the financial support of steel industry in\ngeneral and also in specific geographical regions of China[63][64].\n(185)\u00a0\u00a0 Taking all the above into\nconsideration it becomes clear that the authorities only allow the financial\ninstitutions to provide preferential loans to limited number of\nindustries/companies which comply with the development policies of the GOC. On\nthe basis of the evidence on the file and in the absence of the cooperation\nfrom the GOC on this matter it is concluded that the subsidies in form of\npreferential lending are not generally available and are therefore specific in\nthe meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation. Moreover there was no\nevidence submitted by any of the interested parties suggesting that the subsidy\nis based on objective criteria or conditions under Article 4(2)(b) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(186)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat the two groups of sampled exporting producers benefited from the\npreferential lending in the investigation period.\n(g)              \nConclusion\n(187)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, the financing\nof the organic coated steel industry should be considered a subsidy.\n(188)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the existence of\na financial contribution, a benefit to the exporting producers and specificity,\nthis subsidy should be considered countervailable.\n(h)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(189)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. According to Article 6(b) of\nthe basic Regulation the benefit conferred on the recipients is considered to\nbe the difference between the amount that the company pays on the government\nloan and the amount that the company would pay for a comparable commercial loan\nobtainable on the market.\n(190)\u00a0\u00a0 As explained above (recitals\n(165) to (178)), since the loans provided by Chinese banks reflect substantial\ngovernment intervention in the banking sector and do not reflect rates that\nwould be found in a functioning market, an appropriate market benchmark has\nbeen constructed using the method described below. Furthermore, due to the lack\nof cooperation by the GOC, the Commission has also resorted to facts available\nin order to establish an appropriate benchmark interest rate.\n(191)\u00a0\u00a0 When\nconstructing an appropriate benchmark, it is considered reasonable to apply\nChinese interest rates, adjusted to reflect normal market risk. Indeed, in a\ncontext where the exporters' current financial state has been established in a\ndistorted market and there is no reliable information from the Chinese banks on\nthe measurement of risk and the establishment of credit ratings, it is\nconsidered necessary not to take the creditworthiness of the Chinese exporters\nat face value, but to apply a mark-up to reflect the potential impact of the\nChinese distorted market on their financial situation. \n(192)\u00a0\u00a0 With\nrespect to the above as explained in recitals (160), (163) and (164) both the\nGOC and the cooperating exporting producers were requested to provide\ninformation on the lending policies of the Chinese banks and the way loans were\nattributed to the exporting producers. Parties failed to provide such\ninformation, although repeatedly requested to do so, and refused access to the\nstate-owned banks. Accordingly in view of this lack of cooperation and the\ntotality of facts available, and in line with the provisions of Article 28(6)\nof the basic Regulation, it is deemed appropriate to consider that all firms in\nChina would be accorded the highest grade of \"Non-investment grade\"\nbonds only (BB at Bloomberg) and apply the appropriate premium expected on\nbonds issued by firms with this rating to the standard lending rate of the\nPeople's Bank of China. The\nbenefit to the exporting producers has been calculated by taking the interest\nrate differential, expressed as a percentage, multiplied by the outstanding\namount of the loan, i.e. the interest not paid during the IP. This amount was\nthen allocated over the total turnover of the co-operating exporting producers.\n(193)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate established\nwith regard to this scheme during the IP for the sampled exporting producers\namounts to 0,25% for the Huadong group of companies and 0,89% for the Panhua\ngroup of companies. \n(194)\u00a0\u00a0 The weighted average subsidy\nrate for the cooperating companies not included in the sample is 0,58%.\n(195)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the low level of\ncooperation, the subsidy rate for all non-cooperating companies is set at the\nlevel of the highest subsidy rate established for this scheme for an entity\nrelated to one of the sampled cooperating companies, i.e. 0,97%.\n3.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Equity Programmes\n(196)\u00a0\u00a0 A\nnumber of alleged subsidy programmes concerning equity were detailed in the\ncomplaint in relation to exporting producers not selected in the sample and/or\nnot cooperating with the investigation. The Commission asked the GOC to submit\ninformation about these programmes in the original and supplementary\nquestionnaires, and subsequently gave ample opportunity to the GOC to provide\nreplies on these programmes. The GOC took the view that it would only provide\nreplies on alleged subsidy programmes concerning the two sampled exporting\nproducers and confirmed this stance throughout the proceeding. \n(197)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsignificant level of non-cooperation in this proceeding hindered the\npossibility for the Commission to acquire information and evidence on these\nprogrammes mentioned in the complaint. The Commission verified that the sampled\nexporting producers did not make use of these programmes. Therefore the\nCommission had to determine the existence of the subsidy programmes and\nestablish the residual duty with regard to all the other programmes for which\nthe GOC did not submit information and that were not available for or used by\nthe sampled exporting producers on the basis of the evidence available on file\nin accordance with the provisions of Article 28(1) of the basic Regulation.\n3.3.3.1.\u00a0 Debt for equity swaps\n(a)              \nDescription\n(198)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint contained\nevidence that several steel producers were involved in debt for equity swaps in\nthe year 2000 for a combined total of 62.5 billion RMB of debts. It is alleged\nthat outstanding debt due by State-owned steelmakers to State-owned commercial\nbanks (\"SOCBs\") was cancelled in exchange for equity through the\ninvolvement of four Chinese Asset Management Companies (\"AMCs\") which\nwas not on the basis of market considerations. The complaint further asserted\nthat AMCs were specifically created to dispose of massive non-performing loans\nin key industries including the steel sector and to restructure the debts of\nSOEs through inter alia debt to equity swaps. Given that the GOC has failed to\nprovide any information on this programme, the Commission draws its findings on\nthe basis of the information available in the file according to Article 28 of\nthe basic Regulation (see recitals (33) - (35) above). For the same reason,\nArticle 28 of the basic Regulation was applied with regard to the Equity\nInfusion and Unpaid Dividend programmes described in recitals (204) - (215)\nbelow.\n(b)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(199)\u00a0\u00a0 The findings on this\nprogramme are based on the information contained in the complaint. Debt for\nequity swaps constitute a financial contribution in the form of equity infusion\nand/or loan within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(i) of the basic Regulation or\nin the form of revenue forgone resulting from debt cancelled or not repaid\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation. This\nfinancial contribution was provided by the government through public bodies\ninvolved in these transactions, i.e. the four AMCs and various SOCBs (refer to\nrecital (168) above). In the absence of any cooperation from the GOC, the\nevidence on the record demonstrates that AMCs are public bodies because they\nwere specifically created by the GOC to dispose of massive non-performing loans\nin key industries including the steel sector and to restructure the debts of\nSOEs. Consequently, they are considered to exercise government authority.\n(200)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the complainant\nhas provided prima facie evidence that the huge amount of debt cancellation was\nnot subject to normal commercial considerations as the GOC did not carry out an\nassessment that a normal private investor would carry out with respect to the\nexpected reasonable rate of return these equity swaps would generate over time.\nInstead, complaint alleged that the GOC exchanged massive amounts of debt in\nexchange for equity with the objective to reduce the liabilities-to-assets\nratio of steel producers to increase their competitiveness aside from\ncommercial considerations that a private investor would make. The Commission,\nafter careful analyses of the information provided in the complaint and in the\nabsence of any other information on the file concluded that, the measures are\ntherefore considered to confer a benefit within the meaning of Article 6(a) of\nthe basic Regulation.\n(201)\u00a0\u00a0 This subsidy is specific in\nthe sense of Article 4(2) of the basic Regulation as it is restricted only to\nselected entities participated by the State and the award of this financing is\ndiscretionary and no objective criteria exist. Therefore it is concluded that\nthis programme constitutes a countervailable subsidy for exporting producers of\nthe product concerned.\n(c)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount \n(202)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the\nrecipients is a non-recurring benefit and is considered to be the full amount\nof the debt for equity swaps, i.e. the amount of debt forgiven. In the absence\nof other information for the assessment of this benefit submitted by the GOC, the\nCommission based its findings on information contained in the complaint. In\naccordance with Article 7(3) of the basic Regulation the subsidy amount so\ncalculated has been allocated to the IP on the basis of the normal depreciation\nperiod of assets of the recipient companies. The amount has been adjusted by\nadding interest during this period in order to reflect the value of the benefit\nover time and thereby establish the full benefit of this scheme to the\nrecipients. In accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, this\nsubsidy amount has been allocated over the level of production of the product\nconcerned during the IP, because the subsidy is not contingent upon export\nperformance and was not granted by reference to the quantities manufactured,\nproduced, exported or transported.\n(203)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nobtained for all non-cooperating companies amounts to 0,05%. It was not\nnecessary to calculate the subsidy rate for the sampled and other cooperating\nproducers for the reasons described in recitals (196) and (197).\n3.3.3.2.\u00a0 Equity infusions\n(a)              \nDescription\n(204)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ncomplaint alleges that the GOC has provided over the years substantial amounts\nof cash to steel producers through equity infusions. According to the\ncomplaint, the GOC (through various state-owned entities) acquired shares in\ncompanies in which it was already the main shareholder without acquiring\nadditional shareholder rights. The complaint also details specific transactions\ninvolving State-controlled entities, including China International Capital\nCorporation (CICC) and SASAC.\n(b)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(205)\u00a0\u00a0 Since the GOC failed to\nprovide any information on this programme (see recitals (196) and (197) above),\nthe findings on this programme are based on the information contained in the\ncomplaint, as supported by adequate sources. Equity infusions constitute a\ndirect transfer of funds within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(i) of the basic\nRegulation. These financial contributions were provided by the government\nthrough public bodies involved in these transactions, including CICC and SASAC.\nThe complaint contains specific evidence on equity infusions concerning an SOE\nsteel producer where CICC acted as the lead underwriter and manager of the\nshare issuance. According to information in the complaint, CICC is 51%\nstate-owned and it is ultimately controlled by SASAC, which in the specific\ntransactions documented in the complaint also acted as the GOC entity controlling\nthe steel producer SOE (for the analysis of SASAC's functions see recitals (64)\nto (66)) above). Therefore, these transactions were carried out by the GOC\nthrough public bodies within the meaning of Article 2(b) of the basic\nRegulation and the relevant WTO jurisprudence. \n(206)\u00a0\u00a0 These equity infusions are\nconsidered to confer a benefit to the recipient companies within the meaning of\nArticle 6(a) of the basic Regulation as they are inconsistent with the usual\ninvestment practice of private investors. The inconsistency of these equity\ninfusions with private investors' practice is proven in detail in the\ncomplaint. With regard to these specific transactions, the complaint shows\nfirstly that the SOE steel producer paid an overvalued price of its portion of\nthe new share issue not in line with fair market conditions, and secondly that\nit used the funds raised to purchase state-owned assets and equity investments\nat below-market prices. The complaint also shows that the GOC paid the same\nprice as other investors despite its shares were worth less as they had\ndifferent rights and prospects than the shares sold to other shareholders.\n(207)\u00a0\u00a0 These subsidies are specific\nin the sense of Article 4(2)(c) of the basic Regulation because they were\nprovided to a limited number of selected entities in which the government\nparticipated. Therefore it is concluded that this programme constitutes a\ncountervailable subsidy for exporting producers of the product concerned.\n(c)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(208)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the\nrecipients is considered to be the amount of the equity infusions. In the\nabsence of other information for the assessment of this benefit submitted by\nthe GOC, the Commission based its findings on information contained in the\ncomplaint. In accordance with Article 7(3) of the basic Regulation the subsidy\namount so calculated has been allocated to the IP on the basis of the normal\ndepreciation period of assets of the recipient companies. The amount has been\nadjusted by adding interest during this period in order to reflect the value of\nthe benefit over time and thereby establish the full benefit of this scheme to\nthe recipients. In accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, this\nsubsidy amount has been allocated over the total level of production of the\nrecipients during the IP as appropriate denominator, because the subsidy is not\ncontingent upon export performance and was not granted by reference to the\nquantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported.\n(209)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nobtained for all non-cooperating companies amounts to 0,08%. It was not\nnecessary to calculate the subsidy rate for the sampled and other cooperating\nproducers for the reasons described in recitals (196) and (197).\n3.3.3.3.\u00a0 Unpaid dividends\n(a)              \nDescription\n(210)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint alleged that\naccording to GOC policy, state-owned enterprises including the steel companies\nproducing OCS do not have to pay dividends to the government as their owner\neven when they earn profits. As a result, SOE steel producers are able to\nfinance massive investment through retained profits not distributed as\ndividends according to this programme.\n(b)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(211)\u00a0\u00a0 Since the GOC failed to\nprovide any information on dividend distributions by the SOE steel producers\n(see recitals (196) and (197) above), the findings on this programme are based\non the information contained in the complaint, as supported by adequate sources.\nUnpaid dividends must be considered as a disguised grant in the meaning of\nArticle 3(1)(a)(i) of the basic Regulation or as revenue forgone under Article\n3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation in that the GOC does not collect dividends\nthat are normally paid to private investors on their shares. These disguised\ngrants were provided by the government through the entity directly holding the\nshares in the SOE steel producers, in principle SASAC. The analysis concerning\nSASAC shows that it performs Government functions (see for details recitals (64)\nto (66) above).\n(212)\u00a0\u00a0 The full amount of unpaid\ndividends is considered to confer a benefit to the recipient SOE steel\nproducers within the meaning of Article 6(a) of the basic Regulation as this is\ninconsistent with the usual investment practice of private investors that\nrequire dividend distributions normally attached to their shares. For SOEs\npartially owned by private investors, the amount of the benefits equals the amount\nof unpaid dividends distributed to them on a pro rata basis. \n(213)\u00a0\u00a0 These subsidies are specific\nunder Article 4(2) of the basic Regulation because they were provided to a\nlimited number of selected entities in which the government participated. Therefore\nit is concluded that this programme constitutes a countervailable subsidy for\nexporting producers of the product concerned.\n(c)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(214)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the\nrecipients is considered to be the amount of the unpaid dividends. In the\nabsence of other information for the assessment of this benefit submitted by\nthe GOC, the Commission based its findings on publicly available financial\ninformation on the recipients. In accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic\nRegulation, the subsidy amount so calculated has been allocated over the total\nturnover of the recipients during the IP as appropriate denominator, because\nthe subsidy is not contingent upon export performance and was not granted by\nreference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported.\n(215)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsubsidy rate thus obtained for all non-cooperating companies amounts to 1,36%. It was not necessary to calculate the subsidy rate for the sampled\nand other cooperating producers for the reasons described in recitals (196) and\n(197).\n3.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Income\nand other direct tax Programmes\n3.3.4.1.\u00a0 Tax Policies for the deduction\nof research and development (R&D) expenses\n(216)\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme provides a\nbenefit to companies which introduce new technologies, new products or new\ntechniques in their production. The eligible companies can decrease their\ncorporate income tax by 50% of the actual expenses for approved projects.\n(217)\u00a0\u00a0 It is noted that although\nthe GOC limited its reply to the questionnaire and deficiency letter to the\nschemes used by the sampled companies it did not provide any information on\nthis scheme, despite the fact that one of the sampled companies reported\nbenefits under this scheme in its questionnaire reply. When requested again\nduring the on spot verification to provide the necessary information, GOC\nprovided a partial supplementary response concerning this programme. Despite\nthe late provision of this information the verification team asked for\nclarifications on several issues (see recital (219) below) however these were\nnot provided. As a result the Commission had to base its findings on the best\nfact available.\n(a)              \nLegal Basis\n(218)\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme is provided as\npreferential tax treatment by Article 30(1) of the Corporate Income Tax Law of\nthe PRC (Order No 63 of the President of the People's Republic of China,\neffective from 1 January 2008), Article 95 of the Regulations on the\nImplementation of Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC (Decree No 512 of the\nState Council of the PRC) and the Guide to Key Fields (Notification n.6, 2007).\nThe GOC did not provide Decree No 512 and Notification No 6 in this proceeding.\n(b)              \nEligibility\n(219)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nnoted above the GOC did not provide any relevant information for this scheme in\nthe replies to the questionnaire and deficiency letter. In the document\nsubmitted during the on spot verification GOC stated that only the \"research\nand development fees incurred by Enterprises in the development of new\ntechnology, new products and new skills\" may be computed in the\ntaxable income for the purpose of deduction. However, the GOC did not elaborate\non the meaning of terms \"new technology\", \"new product\" and\n\"new skills\". The Commission also endeavoured to find the exact\nmeaning of these terms during the verification of Zhejiang Huadong but the\ncompany was not able to provide any concrete explanation and replied that these\nare general terms only.\n(220)\u00a0\u00a0 However, in the Coated Fine\nPaper investigation, it was established that only R&D projects of the\ncompanies of New and High Tech Sectors Receiving Primary Support from the State\nand projects listed in the Guide to Key Fields of High Tech Industrialization under\nthe current Development Priority promulgated by the NDRC are eligible for this\nscheme[65].\nGiven the fact that no new relevant information was provided in this proceeding\nwhich would rebut this conclusion it is established that the scheme is not\ngenerally available, as only selected industries/companies/projects are\neligible.\n(c)              \nPractical implementation \n(221)\u00a0\u00a0 According to the GOC reply,\ncompanies which intend to apply for this tax concession shall file their Income\nTax Return and \"other relevant documents\" with the taxation authority\nwithout specifying which these other relevant documents are. In the Coated\nFine Paper investigation it was established that any company that intends\nto apply for the benefit from this scheme must file detailed information about\nthe R&D projects with the local Science and Technology Bureau and that only\nafter examination will the Tax Bureau issue the notice of approval. Following\nthe approval the amount subject to corporate income tax is decreased by 50% of\nactual expenses for approved projects[66].\n\n(d)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(222)\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme was used by one\nof the cooperating exporting producers, Zhejiang Huadong Light Steel Building\nMaterial Co. Ltd during the IP. Because of the lack of cooperation from the GOC\nand because of its late and incomplete reply concerning this scheme, it was not\npossible to determine the application and approval procedure which must be\nundertaken by the companies benefiting from this scheme. As noted above, the\nCommission had to partially rely on the facts established in the Coated Fine\nPaper investigation. \n(e)              \nConclusion\n(223)\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme should be\nconsidered a subsidy within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) and Article 3(2)\nof the basic Regulation in the form of foregone government revenue which confers\na benefit upon the recipient companies.\n(224)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC was requested to\nprovide information on the eligibility criteria for obtaining benefits from\nthis scheme and on the use of the subsidy, in order to determine to what extent\naccess to the subsidy is limited to certain enterprises and whether it is\nspecific according to Article 4 of the basic Regulation. The GOC provided no\nsuch information in its reply to the questionnaire and to the deficiency letter.\nIn addition, the information submitted in this respect during the on-spot\nverification visit appears to be incomplete in view of the findings concerning\nsame scheme found to be used by the companies in Coated Fine Paper\ninvestigation. The Commission, mindful of the requirement of Article 4(5) of\nthe basic Regulation that any determination of specificity shall be 'clearly\nsubstantiated' on the basis of positive evidence, therefore had to base its\nfindings on the facts available in accordance with Article 28 of the basis\nRegulation. The best facts available included the findings of the Coated\nFine Paper investigation. \n(225)\u00a0\u00a0 This subsidy scheme is\nspecific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation given\nthat the legislation itself, pursuant to which the granting authority operates,\nlimited the access to this scheme only to certain enterprises and industries\nclassified as encouraged, such as those belonging to OCS industry. In addition,\nthere do not seem to be objective criteria to limit eligibility and no\nconclusive evidence to conclude that the eligibility is automatic in accordance\nwith Article 4(2)(b) of the basic Regulation. It is noted that the lack of\ncooperation from the GOC authorities does not permit the Commission to assess\nthe existence of such objective criteria.\n(226)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, this subsidy\nshould be considered countervailable.\n(f)               \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(227)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the\nrecipients is considered to be the amount of total tax payable according to the\nnormal tax rate, after the subtraction of what was paid with the additional 50%\ndeduction of the actual expenses on R&D for the approved projects. In\naccordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, this subsidy amount\n(numerator) has been allocated over the total sales turnover of the cooperating\nexporting producers during the IP, because the subsidy is not contingent upon\nexport performance and was not granted by reference to the quantities\nmanufactured, produced, exported or transported.\n(228)\u00a0\u00a0 One of the cooperating\nsampled exporting producers, namely the Huadong Group of companies, has\nbenefited from this scheme. The subsidy rate established for the Huadong Group\nis 0,19%.\n(229)\u00a0\u00a0 The weighted average subsidy\nrate for the cooperating companies not included in the sample is 0,09%.\n(230)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the low level of\ncooperation, the subsidy rate for all non-cooperating companies is set at the\nlevel of the highest subsidy rate established for this scheme for the sampled\ncooperating companies, i.e. 0,19%.\n3.3.4.2.\u00a0 Tax concessions for Central\nand Western Regions\n(231)\u00a0\u00a0 This\nscheme provides a benefit to companies located in the Central and Western\nRegions. The eligible companies are subject to preferential income tax rate of\n15% instead of normal income tax rate of 25% applicable in China.\n(232)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC was requested to\nprovide information on this scheme in the questionnaire, in the deficiency\nletter and again during the on-spot verification visit. In its responses to the\nquestionnaire and deficiency letter the GOC did not reply to any of the\nquestions and stated that this programme is no longer valid as it expired on 31\nDecember 2010 and also claimed that no sampled companies benefited from this\nscheme in the IP. However, this was in contradiction with the responses of one\nof the exporting producers (Chongqing Wanda Steel Strip Co., Ltd) and with the\nevidence collected during the on-spot verification visit of this company. \n(a)              \nLegal Basis\n(233)\u00a0\u00a0 This\nscheme is provided for as preferential tax treatment by the Notice on\nFavourable Tax Policies for Western Region Development (issued by the\nMinistry of Finance , General Tax Bureau and General Customs Office, effective\nfrom 1 January 2001) which was updated by the Notice on Further\nImplementation on Tax Policies of the Western Development Strategy (issued\nthe Ministry of Finance ,General Tax Bureau and General Customs Office,\neffective from 1 January 2011 onwards) which extends the period of validity of\nthis programme until 31 December 2020.\n(b)              \nEligibility\n(234)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis noted that the GOC did not provide answers to any of the questions\nconcerning this scheme in its response to the questionnaire, deficiency letter\nor during the on-spot verification visit. However, according to the Notice\non Favourable Tax Policies for Western Region Development this preferential\ntax treatment is available for the encouraged type of enterprises in the\nWestern Region (encouraged refers to those enterprises with major business\naccounting for 70% or more of total income as described in the Catalogue of\nindustry, product & technologies encouraged by the State). During the\non-spot verification of Chongqing Wanda, the company confirmed that the reason\nfor the preferential tax rate is that they belong to the encouraged category of\nindustries in the Western and Central region.\n(c)              \nPractical implementation\n(235)\u00a0\u00a0 Neither the GOC, nor the\nChongqing Wanda Steel Strip Co., Ltd provided information on the operation and\nadministration of this programme. According to the Circular of the State\nCouncil Concerning Several Policies on Carrying out the Development of China\u2019s\nVast Western Regions, an approval of people\u2019s governments of the provincial\nlevel is necessary for the reduction of the normal tax rate of 25% to the\npreferential rate of 15%. On the company's annual income tax declaration form\nthe deducted (exempted) income tax amount is listed under item 28 \u2013 deducted\ntax. \n(d)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(236)\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme was used by one\nof the cooperating exporting producers, Chongqing Wanda Steel Strip Co., Ltd\nduring the IP. Because of the non-cooperation from the GOC it is difficult to\ndiscern the application and approval procedure which must be undertaken by the\ncompanies benefiting from this scheme. The Commission had to draw its own\nconclusions from submitted documents which form the legal basis for this scheme\nwithout being able to seek the explanations from the GOC. \n(e)              \nConclusion\n(237)\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme should be\nconsidered a subsidy within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) and Article 3(2)\nof the basic Regulation in the form of foregone government revenue which\nconfers a benefit upon the recipient companies.\n(238)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC was requested to\nprovide information on the eligibility criteria for obtaining benefits from\nthis scheme and on the use of the subsidy in order to determine to what extent\naccess to the subsidy is limited to certain enterprises and whether it is\nspecific according to Article 4 of the basic Regulation. The GOC provided no\nsuch information. The Commission, mindful of the requirement of Article 4(5) of\nthe basic Regulation that any determination of specificity shall be 'clearly\nsubstantiated' on the basis of positive evidence, therefore had to base its\nfindings on the facts available in accordance with Article 28 of the basis\nRegulation. \n(239)\u00a0\u00a0 This subsidy scheme is\nspecific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) and 4(3) of the basic Regulation\ngiven that the legislation itself, pursuant to which the granting authority\noperates, limited the access to this scheme only to certain enterprises and\nindustries classified as encouraged, such as those belonging to the OCS\nindustry, and in addition located in certain regions of China. In addition,\nthere do not seem to be objective criteria to limit eligibility and no\nconclusive evidence to found to determine that the eligibility is automatic in\naccordance with Article 4(2)(b) of the basic Regulation. It is noted that the\nlack of cooperation from the GOC authorities does not permit the Commission to\nassess the existence of such objective criteria.\n(240)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, this subsidy\nshould be considered countervailable.\n(f)               \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(241)\u00a0\u00a0 The\namount of countervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred\non the recipients which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred\non the recipients is considered to be the amount of tax payable according to\nthe normal income tax rate, after the deduction of the amount of tax paid\naccording to the preferential income tax rate. In accordance with Article 7(2)\nof the basic Regulation this subsidy amount (numerator) has been allocated over\nthe total sales turnover of the co-operating exporting producers during the IP,\nbecause the subsidy is not contingent upon export performance and was not\ngranted by reference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported or\ntransported.\n(242)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate established\nfor the Panhua Group is 0,03%.\n(243)\u00a0\u00a0 The weighted average subsidy\nrate for the cooperating companies not included in the sample is 0,02%.\n(244)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the low level of\ncooperation, the subsidy rate for all non-cooperating companies is set at the\nlevel of the highest subsidy rate established for this scheme for an entity\nrelated to one of the sampled cooperating companies, i.e. 0,04%.\n3.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other\nIncome tax Programmes for which the GOC provided insufficient or no replies\n(245)\u00a0\u00a0 A number of alleged subsidy\nprogrammes were detailed in the complaint in relation to exporting producers\nnot selected in the sample and/or not cooperating with the investigation. The\nCommission asked the GOC to submit information about these programmes in the\noriginal and supplementary questionnaires, and subsequently gave ample\nopportunity to the GOC to provide replies on these programmes. The GOC took the\nview that it would only provide replies on alleged subsidy programmes\nconcerning the two sampled exporting producers and confirmed this stance\nthroughout the proceeding. However, the GOC did submit for some of these\nprogrammes information and evidence indicating that they had been terminated\nand were not in force during the IP. The Commission took into account this\nevidence submitted by the GOC in its findings.\n(246)\u00a0\u00a0 For all the other\nprogrammes, the GOC failed to submit any information or evidence. The\nsignificant level of non-cooperation in this proceeding hindered the\npossibility for the Commission to acquire information and evidence on these\nprogrammes included in the complaint by the exporting producers. The Commission\nverified that the sampled exporting producers were not eligible or did not make\nuse of these programmes (mainly due to the fact that they were privately owned,\nor their being outside the area of application of the programme, or their\nrelatively limited size). Therefore the Commission had to determine the\nexistence of this programme and establish the residual duty with regard to all\nthe other programmes for which the GOC did not submit information and that were\nnot available for or used by the sampled exporting producers on the basis of\nthe evidence available on file in accordance with the provisions of Article\n28(1) of the basic Regulation.\n3.3.5.1.\u00a0 Income tax credit for the\npurchase of domestically manufactured production equipment\n(a)              \nDescription\n(247)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme allows a\ncompany to claim tax credits on the purchase of domestic equipment if a project\nis consistent with the industrial policies of the GOC. A tax credit up to 40%\nof the purchase price of domestic equipment may apply to the incremental\nincrease in tax liability from the previous year.\n(b)              \nLegal basis\n(248)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal bases of this\nprogramme are the Provisional measures on enterprise income tax credit for\ninvestment in domestically produced equipment for technology renovation\nprojects of 1 July 1999 and the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation\non Stopping the Implementation of the Enterprise Income Tax Deduction and\nExemption Policy of the Investments of an Enterprise in Purchasing Home-made\nEquipment, No. 52 [2008] of the State Administration of Taxation, effective 1\nJanuary 2008.\n(c)              \nNon cooperation\n(249)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC replied that this\nprogramme has been terminated as from January 2008 according to the mentioned\nNotice No. 52 and that to the best of its knowledge no programme has replaced\nthis programme. The Commission asked the GOC to provide relevant additional\ninformation, namely details of the timetable for the phase-out of benefits. The\nGOC did not provide this information and limited its reply on the actual\nbenefits accrued to all OCS producers by simply referring to the questionnaire\nreplies of the sampled producers. The Commission has already explained the\nreasons why the GOC was required to provide information with regard to all the\nOCS producers and not just the sampled producers (see recitals (34) and (35)\nabove). Furthermore, the GOC also failed to provide information with regard to\nthe sampled producers as it merely referred to their replies. The Commission\nconsiders that it is not sufficient to provide evidence of termination of a\nprogramme without providing additional evidence on the phasing out of the\nactual benefits under the programme and potential replacement programmes. With\nregard to this programme, a tax benefit (i.e. a tax credit) accrued in a\ncertain year may actually be used in a different tax year and thus the benefits\ncan extend beyond its period of validity even if the programme has in the\nmeantime been terminated. Other \"terminated\" tax programmes have\nturned out to continue to confer benefits for some years after their official\nexpiry date. It may also be the case that unusually large amounts of benefit\ncan be allocated over time. In the absence of information provided by the GOC\nin this respect, the Commission bases its findings on the information on the\nrecord (in this case complaint) in accordance with Article 28 of the basic\nRegulation.\n(d)              \nFindings of the investigation \n(250)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme constitutes a\nsubsidy as it provides a financial contribution in the form of revenue forgone\nby the GOC according to Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation. This\nprogramme provides a benefit to the recipients for an amount equal to the tax\nsaving in the meaning of Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation. This subsidy is\nspecific under Article 4(4)(b) of the basic Regulation since the tax saving is\ncontingent on the use of domestic over imported goods.\n(e)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(251)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. Since this programme has not\nbeen examined in an anti-subsidy proceeding by the Union institutions yet, and\nin the absence of precise quantification elsewhere, the most appropriate source\nof information for the assessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has\nbeen a comparable decision by the US authorities. When basing subsidy amounts\non findings in other investigations, account is taken throughout this regulation\nof, inter alia, whether there have been any significant changes in the scheme\nin question and whether the subsidy amount may have diminished over time. It is\nnoted that the amount of recurring subsidies will normally not diminish in this\nway. In the absence of any such changes or diminution of the subsidy amount,\nthe original rate from the investigation in question is used as the amount of\nsubsidy in the present case.\n(252)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsubsidy rate thus established with regard to this scheme during the IP for all\nnon-cooperating companies is set at 0,38% which is the rate for this scheme as\nestablished in the US Decision Memorandum of 17 November 2008 on Circular\nWelded Carbon Quality Steel Line Pipe (Page No. 26) (Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 227, page\n70961 / 24 November 2008). With regard to\ninvestigations conducted by the US authorities, it is noted that the methodology\nused for calculating the amount of benefit from tax programmes is substantially\nthe same as that employed by the EU[67].\n3.3.5.2.\u00a0 Preferential tax policies for\ncompanies that are recognised as high and new technology companies\n(a)              \nDescription\n(253)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme allows an\nenterprise applying for a Certificate of High and new technology Enterprise to\nbenefit from a reduced income tax rate of 15% as compared to the ordinary rate\nof 25%. This programme has been found countervailable by the EU in the Coated\nFine Paper investigation and also by the US authorities. [68]\n(b)              \nLegal basis\n(254)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis of this\nprogramme are Article 28 of the PRC Law on Enterprise Income Tax (No. 63\npromulgated on 16 March 2007) along with the Administrative Measures for the\nDetermination of High and New Technology Enterprises, and the Notice of the\nState Administration of Taxation on the issues concerning Enterprises Income\nTax Payment of High and New Technology Enterprises (Guo Shui Han [2008] No.\n985).\n(c)              \nNon cooperation\n(255)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC replied that none of\nthe sampled companies made use of this programme during the IP and referred to\nthe responses of the sampled producers for information concerning any benefits\nthat may have been received pursuant to this programme. The Commission refers\nto the arguments developed above with regard to the request to the GOC to\nprovide full replies not limited to the sampled exporters (recitals (34) - (35)\nabove). Therefore the Commission bases its findings on this programme on the\ninformation available on record (Coated Fine Paper findings and the\ncomplaint in this case) in accordance with Article 28 of the basic Regulation.\n(d)              \nFindings of the investigation \n(256)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme constitutes a\nsubsidy as it provides a financial contribution in the form of revenue forgone\nby the GOC according to Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation. The\nbenefit for the recipient is equal to the tax saving enjoyed through this\nprogramme according to Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation. This subsidy is\nspecific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation since it\nis limited to certain enterprises and industries classified as encouraged, such\nas those operating in the steel sector. Furthermore, there are no objective\ncriteria established by the legislation or the granting authority on the\neligibility of the scheme and this is not automatic pursuant to Article 4(2)(b)\nof the basic Regulation.\n(e)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(257)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the\nrecipients is considered to be the amount of total tax payable according to the\nnormal tax rate, after the deduction of what was paid with the reduced preferential\ntax rate. In the absence of information for the assessment of this benefit and\nsince this programme has already been examined in a previous anti-subsidy\nproceeding by the Union institutions, the most appropriate source of\ninformation for the assessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has\nbeen the assessment made for this programme in the Council Implementing\nRegulation (EU) No 452/2011 of 6 May 2011 imposing a definitive anti-subsidy\nduty on imports of coated fine paper origination in the People's Republic of\nChina, duly adjusted if needed as mentioned in recital (252) above.\n(258)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished for all non-cooperating companies is set at 0,9% which is the\narithmetical average of the rates established for this programme in the\nRegulation mentioned in the preceding recital.\n3.3.5.3.\u00a0 Income tax concessions for\nthe enterprises engaged in comprehensive resource utilisation (special raw\nmaterials')\n(a)              \nDescription\n(259)\u00a0\u00a0 This tax programme allows\ncompanies that use any of the materials listed in the Catalogue of Income tax\nConcessions for Enterprises engaged in Comprehensive Resource utilisation as\nits major raw material and which manufacture products listed in the same\nCatalogue in a way that meets relevant national and industrial standards, to\ninclude the income they thereby obtain in the total income at the reduced rate\nof 90%. Therefore, 10% of income can be deducted when the companies calculate\nthe income tax. This exemption is granted for 5 years.\n(b)              \nLegal basis\n(260)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal bases of this\nprogramme are: Article 33 of the PRC Law on Enterprise Income Tax, Article 99\nof Regulations on Implementation of the PRC Law on Enterprise Income Tax by the\nState Council and the Catalogue of Income Tax Concessions for Enterprises\nengaged in Comprehensive Resource Utilisation.\n(c)              \nNon-cooperation\n(261)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC stated that none of\nthe sampled companies made use of this programme during the IP and referred to\nthe responses of the sampled producers for information concerning any benefits\nthat may have been received pursuant to this programme. The Commission refers\nto the arguments developed above with regard to the request to the GOC to\nprovide full replies not limited to the sampled exporters (recitals (34) - (35)\nabove). The Commission thus bases its findings on this programme on the\ninformation available on record (in this case complaint), in accordance with\nArticle 28 of the basic Regulation.\n(d)              \nFindings of the investigation \n(262)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme constitutes a\nsubsidy since it provides a financial contribution in the form of revenue\nforgone by the GOC within the terms of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic\nRegulation. The scheme provides a benefit for the recipient equal to the amount\nof tax savings according to Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation. This subsidy\nis specific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation as it\nis limited only to certain enterprises using as primary raw materials the\nresources listed in the above-mentioned Catalogue of Tax Concessions for\nthe purpose of manufacturing products enlisted in that Catalogue.\n(e)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(263)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the\nrecipients is considered to be the amount of total tax payable according to the\nnormal tax rate, after the deduction of what was paid with the reduced\npreferential tax rate. In the absence of other information for the assessment\nof this benefit, the Commission based its findings on information contained in\nthe complaint. In accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, the\nsubsidy amount so calculated has been allocated over the total turnover of the\nrecipients during the IP as appropriate denominator because the subsidy is not\ncontingent upon export performance and was not granted by reference to the\nquantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported.\n(264)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished for all non-cooperating companies amounts to 0,01%.\n3.3.5.4.\u00a0 Tax credit concerning the\npurchase of special equipment\n(a)              \nDescription\n(265)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme allows firms\nto offset 10% of the purchase cost of special equipment used for environmental\nprotection, energy and water saving and production safety against the corporate\nincome tax payable in the year of purchase. The remaining part of the 10% of\nthe amount invested can be carried forward to the following 5 years.\n(b)              \nLegal basis\n(266)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal bases of this\nprogramme are: Article 34 of the PRC Law on Enterprise Income Tax, Article 100\nof Regulations on Implementation of the PRC Law on Enterprise Income Tax by the\nState Council.\n(c)              \nNon-cooperation\n(267)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC replied that none of\nthe sampled companies made use of this programme during the IP and referred to\nthe responses of the sampled producers for information concerning any benefits\nthat may have been received pursuant to this programme. The Commission refers\nto the arguments developed above with regard to the request to the GOC to\nprovide full replies not limited to the sampled exporters (recitals (34) - (35)\nabove). The Commission thus bases its findings on this programme on the\ninformation available in accordance with Article 28 of the basic Regulation.\n(d)              \nFindings of the investigation \n(268)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme confers a\nsubsidy as it provides a financial contribution in the form of revenue forgone\nby the GOC within the terms of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation. The\nscheme gives a benefit for the recipient equal to the amount of tax savings\naccording to Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation.\n(269)\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to the\nspecificity of this programme, it is considered that there is insufficient\ninformation on the record for the Commission to make further findings and\nsubsequently to reach a definitive finding of specificity of the programme.\nTherefore the Commission could not assess this programme any further.\n3.3.5.5.\u00a0 Preferential income tax\npolicy for the enterprises in the Northeast region\n(a)              \nDescription\n(270)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme allows\ncompanies located in the Northeast Region (including Liaoning, Jilin, and\nHeilongjiang Provinces, and Dalian Municipality), first, to reduce the\ndepreciation life of fixed assets by up to 40% for tax purposes, thereby\nincreasing the annual amount of depreciation deductible from the income tax\nand, second, to shorten the period of amortisation of intangible assets by up\nto 40% for tax purposes, resulting in a larger annual deduction. Under a\ndocument released by the Ministry of Finance and State Administration of\nTaxation, corporate taxpayers in certain specified sectors including the\nmetallurgical sector may also benefit from other VAT, resource tax, and\ncorporate income tax advantages, namely in connection with purchase of fixed\nassets.\n(b)              \nLegal basis\n(271)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal bases of this\nprogramme are the Preferential policies regarding enterprise income tax for\nrevitalization of companies of the old industrial base in the Northeast\n(Caishui, No 153, 20 September 2004), Notice of the Ministry of Finance and the\nState Administration of taxation on the Assets Depreciation and the\nImplementation Calibre of Amortization Policy in the Northeast Old Industrial\nBase (Caishui, No 17, 2 February 2005). The GOC submitted the legal basis\nshowing termination of this programme on 1 January 2008, namely the Notice of\nthe Ministry of Finance and State Administration of Taxation on Several\nPreferential Policies in Respect of Enterprise Income Tax (No 1 [2008]).\n(c)              \nNon cooperation\n(272)\u00a0\u00a0 Apart from providing the\naforementioned legal basis showing termination of the programme, the GOC simply\nreferred to the responses of the sampled producers for information concerning\nany benefits that may have been received pursuant to this programme. The\nCommission refers to the arguments developed above with regard to the request to\nthe GOC to provide full replies not limited to the sampled exporters (recitals (34)\n- (35) above). Furthermore, the Commission notes that as this programme\nprovides for subsidies linked to purchase of fixed assets that may be amortised\nover several years and the GOC has failed to provide any details on the\nphasing-out of benefits under the programme or on the outstanding benefits\nstill not fully amortised, the Commission has decided to base its findings on\nthis programme on the information available on record (in this case the\ncomplaint and relevant US findings) in accordance with Article 28 of the basic\nRegulation.\n(d)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(273)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme provides a\nsubsidy in the form of revenue forgone by the GOC within the meaning of Article\n3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation. The benefit under Article 3(2) of the\nbasic Regulation amounts to the tax savings generated for eligible companies by\nthe deduction of accelerated depreciation and amortisation expenses linked to\nthe purchase of fixed assets. This subsidy is specific within the meaning of\nArticle 4(3) of the basic Regulation since it is limited to enterprises located\nin a designated geographical area, i.e. the Northeast Region.\n(e)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(274)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of countervailable\nsubsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the recipients,\nwhich is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the recipients\nis considered to be the difference between the amount of tax that would have\nbeen paid during the IP under the normal depreciation schedule for the assets\nconcerned and the amount actually paid under accelerated depreciation. Since\nthis programme has not been examined in an anti-subsidy proceeding by the Union\ninstitutions yet, and in the absence of precise quantification elsewhere, the\nmost appropriate source of information for the assessment of the benefit to the\nexporting producers has been a comparable decision (based on similarity in the\nnature of the programme[69])\nby the US authorities. As noted in recital (252) above, when basing subsidy\namounts on findings in other investigations, account is taken throughout this\nregulation of, inter alia, whether there have been any significant changes in\nthe scheme in question and whether the subsidy amount may have diminished over\ntime. It is noted that the amount of recurring subsidies will normally not\ndiminish in this way. In the absence of any such changes or diminution of the\nsubsidy amount, the original rate from the investigation in question is used as\nthe amount of subsidy in the present case.\n(275)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished with regard to this scheme during the IP for all non-cooperating\ncompanies is set at 0,08% which is the rate for the 'Income Tax Exemption for\nInvestors in Designated Geographical Regions Within Liaoning' Scheme as\nestablished in the US Decision Memorandum of 3 June 2010 on Wire Decking (Page\nNo. 25) (Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 111, page 32902 / 10 June 2010). With regard to investigations conducted by the US authorities, it\nis noted that the methodology used for calculating the amount of benefit from\ntax programmes is substantially the same as that employed by the EU[70].\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n3.3.5.6.\u00a0 Income tax exemption for\ninvestment in domestic technological innovation\n(a)              \nLegal basis\n(276)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal bases for this\nprogramme are the Technological Transformation of Domestic Equipment Investment\nCredit management of Enterprise Income Tax Audit, adopted by the State tax\nAdministration, No 13 of 17 January 2000, and the Notice concerning the Promulgation\nand Circulation of Measures for the Administration of national Key\nTechnological Renovation Projects.\n(b)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(277)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC replied that this\nprogramme was terminated since 1 January 2008 by the Notice of the State\nAdministration of Taxation on Stopping the Implementation of the Enterprise\nIncome Tax Deduction and Exemption Policy for the Investments of an Enterprise\nin Purchasing home-made Equipment No. 52 [2008] of the State Administration of\nTaxation. As this programme provides recurring tax benefits that have\nterminated since 2008 and there is no evidence on outstanding benefits still\nbeing amortised during the IP, the Commission concludes that this programme is\nnot countervailable.\n3.3.5.7.\u00a0 Various local tax discounts\n(a)              \nDescription\n(278)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint lists a number\nof tax discounts available in several provinces (i.e. Shandong, Chongqing Municipality,\nGuangxi Region Zhuang, Central and Western Regions) in the form of a reduced\ncorporate tax rate of 15% as opposed to the generally applicable tax rate of\n25%.\n(b)              \nLegal basis\n(279)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint reports the\nlegal basis of Shandong tax discount, namely Reduced Income Taxes based on\nGeographical Location (Zheijang and Shandong Provinces): Income Tax Law of the\nPRC for Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises, Article 7,\nadopted on 9 April 1991, No. 45.\n(c)              \nNon-cooperation\n(280)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC simply stated that\nnone of the sampled companies made use of this programme during the IP and\nreferred to the replies of the sampled companies for information relating to\nbenefits which may have been received by them. In addition to the arguments on\nthe obligation for the GOC to provide full replies (see recitals (34) - (35)\nabove), the Commission notes that at least one of the lower tax rates listed\nunder this section benefited one of the cooperating exporters (see recitals (231)\nand following above). Therefore the Commission is resorting to the information\navailable on record (in this case the complaint and relevant US findings) in\naccordance with Article 28 of the basic Regulation for the assessment of this\nprogramme.\n(d)              \nFindings of the investigation \n(281)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme confers a\nsubsidy in the form of revenue forgone by the GOC within the meaning of Article\n3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation. This recurring benefit is equal to the\namount of tax savings generated by the lower corporate tax rate according to\nArticle 3(2) of the basic Regulation. The programme is specific since it is\nlimited to companies located in designated geographical areas within the\nmeaning of Article 4(3) of the basic Regulation.\n(e)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(282)\u00a0\u00a0 The\namount of countervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit\nconferred on the recipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit\nconferred on the recipients is considered to be the amount of total tax payable\naccording to the normal tax rate reduced by the amount paid under the\npreferential tax rate. Since this programme has not been examined in an\nanti-subsidy proceeding by the Union institutions yet, and in the absence of\nprecise quantification elsewhere, the most appropriate source of information\nfor the assessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has been a\ncomparable decision (based on similarity in the nature of the programme) by the\nUS authorities. As noted before, when basing subsidy amounts on findings in\nother investigations, account is taken throughout this regulation of, inter\nalia, whether there have been any significant changes in the scheme in question\nand whether the subsidy amount may have diminished over time. It is noted that\nthe amount of recurring subsidies will normally not diminish in this way. In\nthe absence of any such changes or diminution of the subsidy amount, the\noriginal rate from the investigation in question is used as the amount of\nsubsidy in the present case.\n(283)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished with regard to this scheme during the IP for all non-cooperating\ncompanies is set at 0,66% which is the rate for the 'Reduced Income Taxes Based\nOn Geographic Location' Scheme as established in the US Decision Memorandum of\n12 June 2009 on Certain Tow Behind Lawn Groomers and Certain Parts Thereof\n(Page No. 11) (Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 117, page 29180 / 19 June 2009).\nWith regard to investigations conducted by the US authorities, it is noted that\nthe methodology used for calculating the amount of benefit from tax programmes\nis substantially the same as that employed by the EU[71].\n3.3.5.8.\u00a0 Dividend exemption between\nqualified resident enterprises\n(a)              \nDescription\n(284)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme consists of a\npreferential tax treatment for Chinese resident enterprises that are\nshareholders in other Chinese resident enterprises in the form of tax exemption\non income from certain dividends, bonuses and other equity investments for the\nresident parent enterprises. This programme was countervailed by the EU in the\nanti-subsidy proceeding concerning Coated Fine Paper[72]\n(b)              \nLegal basis\n(285)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis are Article\n26 of the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, Article 83 of the Regulations\non the Implementation of Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, Decree no. 512\nof the State Council, promulgated on 6 December 2007.\n(c)              \nNon-cooperation\n(286)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC replied that none of\nthe sampled companies made use of this programme during the IP and referred to\nthe responses of the sampled producers for information relating to any benefits\nthat may have been received pursuant to this programme. The Commission refers\nto it arguments on the request to the GOC to provide full replies (recitals (34)\n- (35) above). Therefore it has decided to base its findings on this programme\non the information available on file according to Article 28 of the basic\nRegulation, namely the findings as included in the decision on Coated Fine\nPaper.\n(d)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(287)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme confers a\nsubsidy in the form of revenue forgone within the meaning of Article\n3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation. This benefit is equal to the amount of tax\nsavings given by the tax exemption on dividends, bonuses and other equity\ninvestments for Chinese resident enterprises according to Article 3(2) of the\nbasic Regulation. The programme is de jure specific within the meaning\nof Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation given that the legislation pursuant\nto which the granting authority operates limits its access only to enterprises\nresident in China receiving dividend income from other resident enterprises, as\nopposed to enterprises investing in non-resident enterprises. The programme is\nalso specific under Article 4(2)(b) of the basic Regulation given that this\nprogramme is reserved exclusively to important industries and projects\nencouraged by the State, such as the steel industry (see e.g. recital (182)\nabove) and also that there are no objective criteria to limit eligibility for\nthis programme and no conclusive evidence to conclude that eligibility is\nautomatic.\n(e)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(288)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the\nrecipients is considered to be the amount of total tax payable with the\ninclusion of the dividend income coming from other resident enterprises in China,\nafter the subtraction of what was actually paid with the dividend tax\nexemption. In the absence of information for the assessment of this benefit and\nsince this programme has already been examined in a previous anti-subsidy\nproceeding by the Union institutions, the most appropriate source of information\nfor the assessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has been the\nassessment made for this programme in Coated Fine Paper proceeding, duly\nadjusted if needed as mentioned in recital (252) above.\n(289)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished for all non-cooperating companies is set at 0,77% which is the\narithmetical average of the rates established for this programme in the Coated\nFine Paper proceeding. \n3.3.5.9.\u00a0 Preferential Tax Programme\nfor Foreign Invested Entities (FIEs)\n(290)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint lists the\nfollowing preferential income tax schemes in favour of FIEs:\n\u2013              \nTwo free, three half-tax exemptions for the\nproductive FIEs\n\u2013              \nLocal income tax exemption and reduction\nprogrammes for the productive FIEs \n\u2013              \nIncome tax credit for FIEs purchasing\ndomestically produced equipment\n\u2013              \nIncome tax subsidies for FIEs based on\ngeographical location\n(291)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC submitted the\nrelevant legal bases to show that programmes concerning FIEs had been\nterminated with the adoption on 16 March 2007 of the Corporate Income Tax\nLaw of 2008 at the 5th Session of the 10th National People's Congress of\nthe People's Republic of China, namely:\n\u2013              \nNotice of the State Council on the\nImplementation of the Transitional Preferential Policies in respect of Enterprise\nIncome Tax No. 39 [2007] of the State Council;\n\u2013              \nNotice of the State Administration of\nTaxation on Stopping the Implementation of the Enterprise Income Tax Deduction\nand Exemption Policy for the Investments of an Enterprise in Purchasing\nHome-made Equipment, No. 52 [2008] of the State Administration\nof Taxation\n(292)\u00a0\u00a0 These provisions show that\nincome tax benefits for FIEs have been progressively phased out until the end\nof 2011. The GOC has also stated that there is no replacement programme for\nFIEs and the tax treatment of FIEs is now the same as for other corporate\ntaxpayers. The Commission notes that these preferential income tax programmes\nconcerning FIEs are still countervailable as OCS producers may still enjoy\noutstanding benefits at least for a part of the IP until the end of 2011 and it\ncannot be ruled out that there exists a replacement programme for FIEs as from\n2012. Nevertheless, the Commission has decided not to assess them further\nconsidering the need to reduce the administrative burden for all the parties\nconcerned, also in consideration of the approaching end of the progressive\nphase-out period and the absence of indications on a possible replacement\nprogramme.\n3.3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indirect Tax and Import Tariff\nProgrammes\n3.3.6.1.\u00a0 Import tariff and VAT\nexemptions for FIEs and certain domestic enterprises using imported equipment\nin encouraged industries\n(a)              \nDescription\n(293)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme provides an\nexemption from VAT and import tariffs in favour of FIEs or domestic enterprises\nfor imports of capital equipment used in their production. To benefit from the\nexemption, the equipment must not fall in a list of non-eligible equipment and\nthe claiming enterprise has to obtain a Certificate of State-Encouraged\nprojects issued by the Chinese authorities or by the NDRC in accordance with\nthe relevant investment, tax and customs legislation. This programme was\ncountervailed by the Union in the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning Coated\nFine Paper[73].\n\n(b)              \nLegal basis\n(294)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal bases of this\nprogramme are Circular of the State Council on Adjusting Tax Policies on\nImported Equipment, Guo Fa No. 37/1997, Announcement of the Ministry of\nFinance, the General Administration of Customs and the State Administration of\nTaxation [2008] No. 43, Notice of the NDRC on the relevant issues concerning\nthe Handling of Confirmation letter on Domestic or Foreign-funded Projects\nencouraged to develop by the State, No. 316 2006 of 22 February 2006 and\nCatalogue on Non-duty-exemptible Articles of importation for either FIEs or\ndomestic enterprises, 2008.\n(c)              \nNon cooperation\n(295)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that none of\nthe sampled companies benefited from this programme during the IP and referred\nto the responses of the sampled producers for information relating to any\nbenefits that may have been received pursuant to this programme. The Commission\nrefers to its arguments on the request to the GOC to provide full replies\n(recitals (34) and following above), and thereby will base its findings on this\nprogramme on the information available on file according to Article 28 of the\nbasic Regulation, namely its findings in the Coated Fine Paper\nproceeding.\n(d)              \nFindings of the investigation \n(296)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme is considered\na subsidy in the form of revenue forgone by the GOC within the meaning of\nArticle 3(1)(a)(ii) as FIEs and other eligible domestic enterprises are\nrelieved from payment of VAT and/or tariffs otherwise due if they did not\nobtain the relevant NDRC certificate of State-encouraged project. It therefore confers\na benefit on the recipient companies in the sense of Article 3(2) of the basic\nRegulation. The programme is specific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of\nthe basic Regulation since the legislation pursuant to which the granting\nauthority operates limits its access to enterprises that invest under specific\nbusiness categories defined exhaustively by law and obtaining the Certificate\nof State-encouraged Projects. In addition, there are no objective criteria to\nlimit eligibility for this programme and no conclusive evidence to conclude\nthat eligibility is automatic under Article 4(2)(b) of the basic Regulation.\n(e)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(297)\u00a0\u00a0 The\namount of countervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit\nconferred on the recipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit\nconferred on the recipients is considered to be the amount of VAT and duties\nexempted on imported equipment. In the absence of information for the\nassessment of this benefit and since this programme has already been examined\nin a previous CVD proceeding by the EU, the most appropriate source of\ninformation for the assessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has\nbeen the assessment made for this programme in the Coated Fine Paper\ninvestigation, duly adjusted if needed as mentioned in recital (252) above.\n(298)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsubsidy rate thus established for all non-cooperating companies is set at 0,89%\nwhich is the arithmetical average of the rates established for this programme\nin the Coated Fine Paper investigation.\n3.3.6.2.\u00a0 VAT refunds to FIEs\npurchasing domestically produced equipment\n(a)              \nDescription\n(299)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme provides\nbenefits in the form of VAT refunds for the purchase of domestically produced\nequipment by FIEs. The equipment must not fall into the \u2013Non-Exemptible\nCatalogue and the value of the equipment must not exceed the total investment\nlimit on an FIE according to the 'trial Administrative Measures on Purchase of\nDomestically Produced Equipment'. This programme was countervailed by the EU in\nthe anti-subsidy proceeding concerning Coated Fine Paper[74]and by the US authorities in a\ncountervailing duty proceedings concerning Coated Free Sheet from the PRC[75].\n(b)              \nLegal basis\n(300)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal bases of this\nprogramme are Circular of State Administration of taxation on the release of\nthe provisional measures for the Administration of tax refunds for purchase\ndomestically-manufactured equipment by FIEs No 171, 199, 20.09.1999; Notice of\nthe Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation on Stopping\nthe Implementation of the Policy of Refunding Tax to Foreign-funded Enterprises\nfor Their Purchase of Home-made Equipment, No 176 [2008] of the Ministry of\nFinance.\n(c)              \nNon-cooperation\n(301)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that this\nprogramme was terminated by the Notice No 176 [2008] referred to above\nas from of 1 January 2009. The Commission requested the GOC to provide\ninformation on the actual termination of benefits that would have to be\nallocated over a longer period of time since this programme is linked to the\npurchase of domestically-manufactured assets. The GOC simply referred to the\nreplies of the sampled producers for information relating to any benefits that\nmay have been received pursuant to this programme. The Commission refers to its\narguments on the request to the GOC to provide full replies (recitals (34) and\nfollowing above). The Commission also notes that that the Notice No 176\nprovides for a transitional period for the acquisition of eligible fixed assets\nand filing of the application to obtain benefits until 30 June 2009. As the GOC\nfailed to provide any information on the phasing-out of benefits and given that\nsuch benefits, being linked to fixed assets, may be allocated over time and\ncontinue into the IP, the Commission issues its findings on this programme on\nthe basis of the information available according to Article 28 of the basic Regulation,\nnamely the findings in the Coated Fine Paper proceeding.\n(d)              \n Findings of the investigation \n(302)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme is considered\na subsidy in the form of revenue forgone by the GOC within the meaning of\nArticle 3(1)(a)(ii) and thus conferring a benefit to the recipient companies in\nthe sense of Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation. The programme is specific\nwithin the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation given that the\nlegislation itself pursuant to which the granting authority operates limits its\naccess to certain enterprises (FIEs) for purchase of equipment not falling into\nthe Catalogue of non-exemptible equipment. There is no indication of\nnon-specificity according to Article 4(2)(b) of the basic Regulation because\nthere are no objective criteria to limit eligibility for this programme and no\nconclusive evidence to conclude that eligibility is automatic. In addition, the\nprogramme is also specific within the terms of Article 4(4)(b) of the basic\nRegulation as the subsidy is contingent upon the use of domestic over imported\ngoods.\n(e)              \n Calculation of the subsidy amount\n(303)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the\nrecipients is considered to be the amount of VAT reimbursed on the purchase of\ndomestically produced equipment. In the absence of information for the\nassessment of this benefit and since this programme has already been examined\nin a previous CVD proceeding by the EU, the most appropriate source of\ninformation for the assessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has\nbeen the assessment made for this programme in the Coated Fine Paper\nproceeding, duly adjusted if needed as mentioned in recital (252) above.\n(304)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished for all non-cooperating companies is set at 0,04% which is the\narithmetical average of the rates established for this programme in the Coated\nFine Paper proceeding.\n3.3.6.3.\u00a0 VAT deduction on fixed assets\nin the Central region\n(a)              \n Description\n(305)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme covers VAT\ntaxpayers mainly active in certain listed industries, including the\nmetallurgical industry. The programme provides that eligible VAT taxpayers\nlocated in 26 cities of the old industrial bases of the central region that\nmake investments in certain fixed assets can deduct the amount of VAT paid on\nthe fixed assets from its total VAT payable.\n(b)              \n Legal basis \n(306)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal bases of this\nprogramme are Notice on Ministry of Finance and State administration of\nTaxation issuing the Interim Measures for Expanding the Scope of Offset for\nValue Added Tax in the Central Region, No. 75, 2007, Notice of the Ministry of\nFinance and the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues concerning\nthe National Implementation of Value-added Tax reform, No 170 [2008] of the\nMinistry of Finance. \n(c)              \n Non-cooperation\n(307)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that this\nprogramme was terminated by the Notice No 170 [2008] since 1 January\n2009 and referred to the replies of the sampled producers for information\nrelating to any benefits that may have been received pursuant to this\nprogramme. The Commission refers to its arguments on the request to the GOC to\nprovide full replies (recitals (34) and following above). The Commission notes\nthat the Notice No. 170 does state that VAT benefits for companies located in\nthe Central Region terminate at the end of 2008 and can only be carried forward\nuntil January 2009. However, such benefits, being linked to fixed assets, may\nbe allocated over time and continue into the IP ; in addition, the Notice also\nseems to contain another preferential VAT system for these enterprises located\nin the Central Region as from January 2009 consisting of half of the applicable\nVAT rates. In the absence of clarification by the GOC on the phasing-out of\noutstanding benefits under this programme or on the details of any replacement\nprogramme, the Commission bases its findings on this programme on the evidence\navailable on the file under Article 28 of the basic Regulation.\n(d)              \n Findings of the investigation \n(308)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme is considered\na subsidy in the form of revenue forgone by the GOC within the meaning of\nArticle 3(1)(a)(ii) and thus conferring a benefit to the recipient companies in\nthe sense of Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation equal to the amount of VAT\nsavings generated by the deduction on the purchase of fixed assets. The\nprogramme is specific according to Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation\ngiven that the legislation limits access to certain enterprises, i.e. industries\nthat operate in the listed sectors. This programme is also specific under\nArticle 4(3) of the basic Regulation given that it is limited to certain\ndesignated areas, i.e. the cities of the old industrial bases of the Central\nregion.\n(e)              \n Calculation of the subsidy amount\n(309)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the\nrecipients is considered to be the amount of VAT savings generated by the\ndeduction on the purchase of fixed assets. In the absence of information for\nthe assessment of this benefit and since a comparable VAT programme has already\nbeen examined in this proceeding, the most appropriate source of information for\nthe assessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has been the\nassessment made in recitals (297) and (298).\n(310)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished for all non-cooperating companies is set at 0,89%.\n3.3.6.4.\u00a0 Other tax privileges of\nMa'anshan\n(a)              \n Findings of the investigation\n(311)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint listed\nmiscellaneous tax privileges from 2008 to 2010 enjoyed by OCS producers located\nin Ma'anshan and Wuhan, including exemptions from city maintenance and\nconstruction tax, and extra charges on education funds. The Commission asked\nthe GOC to provide information on these tax benefits. The GOC replied that the\nrequested information were irrelevant for the investigation because none of the\nsampled exporting producers was located in Ma'anshan. The Commission refers to\nits explanation that the GOC was requested to submit information also with\nregard to the subsidy allegations concerning the non-sampled companies\n(recitals (34) - (35) above).\n(312)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of\ninformation provided by the GOC, the Commission concludes that the tax\nprivileges available in Ma'anshan and Wuhan are to be considered a subsidy in\nthe form of revenue forgone by the GOC in accordance with Article 3(1)(a)(ii).\nThey confer a benefit to the recipient companies in the meaning of Article 3(2)\nof the basic Regulation in that they provide a tax saving equal to the\ndifference between the tax paid and the amount of tax normally payable in the\nabsence of this programme. The programme is specific within the meaning of\nArticle 4(3) of the basic Regulation given that it is limited to the\nenterprises established in certain designated regions or municipalities in\nMa'anshan.\n(b)              \n Calculation of the subsidy amount\n(313)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. In the absence of other\ninformation for the assessment of this benefit the Commission based its\nfindings on information contained in the complaint. In accordance with Article\n7(2) of the basic Regulation, the subsidy amount so calculated has been\nallocated over the total turnover of the recipients during the IP as\nappropriate denominator, because the subsidy is not contingent upon export\nperformance and was not granted by reference to the quantities manufactured,\nproduced, exported or transported.\n(314)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished for all non-cooperating companies amounts to 0,08%.\n3.3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grant Programmes\n(315)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint alleged that\nas from the year 2005 until recently (including the year 2009) the companies\nproducing the product concerned received benefits under several grant\nprogrammes and sub-programmes. It cannot be ruled out that payments under this\nprogramme either are still on-going or have been effected on a non-recurring\nbasis in connection with capital investment and thus there are still on-going\nbenefits not fully amortised during the chosen 15-year amortisation period. The\nGOC was requested to submit information on these programmes but has failed to\nprovide a meaningful reply on any of these programmes. Therefore, in the\nabsence of replies by the GOC on all these aspects, the Commission is basing\nits findings on the best evidence available in compliance with Article 28 of\nthe basic Regulation\n3.3.7.1.\u00a0 China World Top Brand\nprogramme\n(a)              \nLegal basis\n(316)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal bases of this\nprogramme as reported in the complaint are the following: \n\u2013                        \nCircular on Carrying out Evaluation of\nProducts to be Recognised as China World Top Brand, GZJH [2005] No 95\n\u2013                        \nAnnouncement No 5, 2005 of China Promotion\nCommittee for Top Brand Strategy, Promulgating the List of China Top Brand\nProducts\n\u2013                        \nCircular on application of China World Top\nBrands in 2006, ZJZH [2006] No 11;\n\u2013                        \nAnnouncement No 6, 2006 of China Promotion\nCommittee for Top Brand Strategy, Promulgating the List of China Top Brand\nProducts;\n\u2013                        \nAnnouncement No 6, 2007 of China Promotion\nCommittee for Top Brand Strategy, Promulgating the List of China Top Brand\nProducts;\n\u2013                        \nCircular on application of China World Top\nBrands in 2008, ZJZH [2008] No 23;\n\u2013                        \nMeasures for the Administration of Chinese\nTop-Brand Products issued by the GOC\n(b)              \nEligibility\n(317)\u00a0\u00a0 Only producers granted the\ndesignation of \"China World Top Brand\" are entitled to the benefits\nof this programme. The complaint reports a number of steel products produced by\nthe steel companies subject to this investigation as being granted this\ndesignation. \n(c)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(318)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the lack of\ncooperation of the GOC, the findings are based on the information present on\nthe file in accordance with Article 28 of the basic Regulation.\n(319)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme provides\nfinancial contributions in the form of grants, below-market loans and other\nincentives, which constitute a direct transfer of funds conferring a benefit\nupon the recipients within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(i) and Article 3(2)\nof the basic regulation.\n(320)\u00a0\u00a0 This subsidy is specific\nwithin the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation because the\nlegislation limits access to certain enterprises only, that is the enterprises\nthat have received the designation \"China World Top Brand\" for their\nproducts. Furthermore, there are no objective criteria established by the\ngranting authority with regard to the eligibility of the scheme, which is not\nautomatic under Article 4(2)(b) of the basic Regulation.\n(d)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(321)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. In the absence of precise\nquantification elsewhere, the most appropriate source of information for the\nassessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has been comparable\ndecisions by the US authorities. As mentioned before, when basing subsidy\namounts on findings in other investigations, account is taken throughout this regulation\nof, inter alia, whether there have been any significant changes in the scheme\nin question and whether the subsidy amount may have diminished over time. It is\nnoted that the amount of recurring subsidies will normally not diminish in this\nway. In the absence of any such changes or diminution of the subsidy amount,\nthe original rate from the investigation in question is used as the amount of\nsubsidy in the present case.\n(322)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished with regard to this scheme during the IP for all non-cooperating\ncompanies is set at 0,13% which is the arithmetical average rate for similar\nprogrammes as established in the US Decision Memorandum of 6 April 2009 on\nCitric Acid and Certain Citrate Salts (Page No. 6) (Federal Register Vol. 74, No.\n69, page 16836 / 13 April 2009), the US Decision Memorandum of 14 May 2010 on\nPre-Stressed Concrete Steel Wire Strand (Page No. 29) (Federal Register Vol.\n75, No. 98, page 28557 / 21 May 2010), the US Decision Memorandum of 28 May\n2010 on Certain Steel Grating (Page No. 18) (Federal Register Vol. 75, No. 109, page 32362 / 8 June 2010),\nthe US Decision Memorandum of 28 March 2011 on Aluminium Extrusions (Page No.\n19) (Federal Register Vol. 76, No. 64, page 18521 / 4 April 2011) and the US\nDecision Memorandum of 11 October 2011 on Multi-layered Wood Flooring (Page No.\n17) (Federal Register Vol. 76, No. 201, page 64313 / 18 October 2011). With\nregard to investigations conducted by the US authorities, it is noted that the\nmethodology used for calculating the amount of benefit from grant programmes is\nsubstantially the same as that employed by the EU[76].\n3.3.7.2.\u00a0 Famous Brands programme and\nsub-programmes (Chongqing Famous Brands, Hubei Province Famous Brands,\nMa'anshan Famous Brands, Shandong Province Top Brands, Wuhan Famous Brands)\n(a)              \nLegal basis\n(323)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal bases of this\nprogramme as reported in the complaint with regard to the Shandong\nsub-programme are the following:\n\u2013                        \nNotice on Printing and Distribution of 2003\nPolicies for Encouraging and expanding Foreign Trade Export to Shandong,\nLWJMJCZ, [2003] No 180;\n\u2013                        \n2004 Policies for Encouraging the Development\nof Foreign Trade & Economic Cooperation in Shandong, LWJMJCZ, [2003] No\n1037;\n\u2013                        \n2005 Policies for Encouraging the Development\nof Foreign Trade & Economic Cooperation in Shandong;\n\u2013                        \nNotice on Printing and Distribution of 2006\nPolicies for Encouraging the Development of Foreign Trade & Economic\nCooperation in Shandong, LCQ [2006] No 5.\n\u2013                        \nSpecial Award Fund Budget for the Development\nof Self-Exporting Brands, Lucaiqizhi, 2008, No 75.\n(b)              \nEligibility\n(324)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme confers\nbenefits to producers of products designated as \"Famous Brands\" and\nmeant for export markets. The complaint refers to a number of producers of the\nproduct concerned having benefited from this programme until at least 2009. \n(c)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(325)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint asserts that\nthis programme was designed to promote domestic advanced industries and\nencourage exports of their products to the world markets. The main framework of\nthis programme is set in the central programme, and provincial and local\ngovernments develop their own famous brands programmes consistently with the\ncentral programme to promote the export of local products. The USA have\nchallenged this grant programme at the WTO (DS 387). In addition, the US\nauthorities have countervailed this programme in several proceedings referred\nto in the complaint. The Commission has also countervailed the benefits under\nthis programme in the Coated fine paper case[77].\n(326)\u00a0\u00a0 The 'famous brands' programme\nprovides financial contributions in the form of subsidised interest loans,\nR&D funding, and cash grant rewards for exporting. These incentives\nconstitute a direct transfer of funds conferring a benefit upon the recipients\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(i) and Article 3(2) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(327)\u00a0\u00a0 This subsidy is specific\nunder Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation because the legislation limits\naccess only to those enterprises recognised to export products designated as\n'famous brands'. Furthermore, given the apparent absence of objective criteria\nand conditions for the application of this programme by the granting authority,\nspecificity is also found under Article 4(2)(b) of the basic Regulation. The\npreferential treatment under this programme is also specific according to\nArticle 4(4)(a) of the basic Regulation because its benefits are contingent\nupon export performance of the relevant 'famous brand' products.\n(d)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(328)\u00a0\u00a0 The\namount of countervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit\nconferred on the recipients, which is found to exist during the IP. In the\nabsence of precise quantification elsewhere, the most appropriate source of\ninformation for the assessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has\nbeen comparable decisions (based on similarity in the nature of the programme)\nby the US authorities. As mentioned before, when\nbasing subsidy amounts on findings in other investigations, account is taken\nthroughout this regulation of, inter alia, whether there have been any\nsignificant changes in the scheme in question and whether the subsidy amount\nmay have diminished over time. It is noted that the amount of recurring\nsubsidies will normally not diminish in this way. In the absence of any such changes\nor diminution of the subsidy amount, the original rate from the investigation\nin question is used as the amount of subsidy in the present case.\n(329)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsubsidy rate thus established with regard to this scheme during the IP for all\nnon-cooperating companies is set at 0,13% which is the arithmetical average\nrate for similar programmes as established in the US Decision Memorandum of 6\nApril 2009 on Citric Acid and Certain Citrate Salts (Page No. 6) (Federal\nRegister Vol. 74, No. 69, page 16836 / 13 April 2009), the US Decision\nMemorandum of 14 May 2010 on Pre-Stressed Concrete Steel Wire Strand (Page No.\n29) (Federal Register Vol. 75, No. 98, page 28557 / 21 May 2010), the US\nDecision Memorandum of 28 May 2010 on Certain Steel Grating (Page No. 18) (Federal\nRegister Vol. 75, No. 109, page 32362 / 8 June 2010), the US Decision Memorandum of 28 March 2011\non Aluminium Extrusions (Page No. 19) (Federal Register Vol. 76, No. 64, page\n18521 / 4 April 2011) and the US Decision Memorandum of 11 October 2011 on\nMulti-layered Wood Flooring (Page No. 17) (Federal Register Vol. 76, No. 201,\npage 64313 / 18 October 2011). With regard to\ninvestigations conducted by the US authorities, it is noted that the\nmethodology used for calculating the amount of benefit from grant programmes is\nsubstantially the same as that employed by the EU[78].\n3.3.7.3.\u00a0 The State key technology\nproject fund\n(a)              \nNon- cooperation by the Government of China\n(330)\u00a0\u00a0 In its questionnaire reply\nGOC only stated that this programme has been terminated in 2003 and that none\nof the sampled exporters has benefited from it. As the GOC has not supplemented\nthis reply with any underlying evidence or further clarification, the\nCommission analyses this programme on the basis of facts available pursuant to\nArticle 28 of the basic Regulation. \n(b)              \nLegal basis\n(331)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal bases of this\nprogramme referred to in the complaint are the following:\n\u2013                        \nState Circulars: Guojingmao Touzi No 886 of\n1999, Guojingmao Touzi No 122 of 1999, Guojingmao Touzi No 1038 of 1999,\nGuojingmao Touzi No 822 of 2000 and\n\u2013                        \nMeasures for the Administration of National\nDebt Special Fund for National Key Technology Renovation Projects\n(c)              \nEligibility\n(332)\u00a0\u00a0 According to quotations of\nthe main legal basis contained in the complaint, enterprises supported under this\nprogramme \"shall be mainly selected from large-sized state holding\nenterprises among the 512 key enterprises, 120 pilot enterprise groups and the\nleading enterprises of the industry.\" There is also a geographical\npreference for enterprises located in the old industrial bases in north-east,\ncentral and west areas.\n(d)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(333)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the lack of\ncooperation of the GOC, the Commission relies on the elements included in the\ncomplaint and/or on the other sources mentioned in the complaint[79].\n(334)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint reports that\nthis programme sought to provide financial support to eligible enterprises to\npromote: technological renovation in key industries, enterprises and products;\nfacilitation of technology upgrades; improvement of product structure;\nimprovement of quality; increase of supply; expansion of domestic demand;\ncontinuous and healthy development of the State economy. According to the\ncomplaint, the fund has supported 47 iron and steel enterprises with respect to\ninvestments totalling RMB 75 billion. The US authorities have countervailed\nthis programme in at least two proceedings.\n(335)\u00a0\u00a0 The programme constitutes a\nsubsidy as it provides financial contributions in the form of grants for the\nacquisition of fixed assets in accordance with Article 3(1)(a)(i) of the basic\nRegulation, which confers a benefit to the recipient. Since the subsidy is\nlinked to fixed assets and is allocated over time, it is concluded, on the\nbasis of facts available, that this benefit continues into the IP. \n(336)\u00a0\u00a0 This subsidy is specific in\nthe meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation as the support is\nlimited to certain large-sized state-owned enterprises and state-holding\nenterprises among 512 key enterprises and 120 pilot enterprise groups. In so far\nas the project focuses on companies located in specifically designated\ngeographical regions of the old industrial base in north-east, central and west\nareas, it is also specific within the meaning of Article 4(3) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(e)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(337)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. In the absence of precise\nquantification elsewhere, the most appropriate source of information for the\nassessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has been a similar\ndecision by the US authorities, namely the US Decision Memorandum of 10\nSeptember 2010 on Certain Seamless Carbon and Alloy Steel Standard, Line, and\nPressure Pipe (Page No 19) (Federal Register Vol. 75, No. 182, page 57444 / 21\nSeptember 2010)..\n(338)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished with regard to this scheme during the IP for all non-cooperating\ncompanies is set at 0,01% which is the rate for a similar scheme as established\nin the US decision referred to in the preceding recital.\n3.3.7.4.\u00a0 Programmes to rebate\nanti-dumping legal fees\n(a)              \nNo cooperation by the GOC\n(339)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint referred to\nvarious investigations carried out by the US authorities[80] and the Commission (Coated\nFine Paper proceeding) which found countervailable several provincial\nprogrammes under which 40% of the legal fees for a company's participation in\nanti-dumping proceeding was refunded by the local financial bureau. As the GOC\ndecided not to reply to questions on this programme, merely stating that the\nsampled exporters had not benefited from it, the Commission bases its findings\non the evidence available on the file according to Article 28 of the basic\nRegulation. \n(b)              \nLegal basis\n(340)\u00a0\u00a0 According to the complaint\nand the Commission decision in Coated Fine Paper (recital 193), the\nlegal basis of this programme is the following:\n\u2013                        \nRules for the Implementation of the Support\nPolicy for the Anti-dumping, Anti-subsidy, Safeguard investigation respondent\n(c)              \nEligibility\n(341)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme is available\nfor companies involved in the anti-dumping investigations and working in\ncompliance with the instructions of the Ministry of Commerce and provincial\nauthorities. \n(d)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(342)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme constitutes a\nsubsidy as it provides financial contribution in the form of a direct transfer\nof funds in the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(i) of the basic Regulation in order\nto cover legal fees in anti-dumping proceedings and confers a benefit within\nthe meaning of Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation. This subsidy is specific\nunder Article 4(2)(a) and (c) of the basic Regulation because it is restricted\nto certain enterprises that are subject to foreign anti-dumping proceedings.\nFurthermore, this programme is also specific within the terms of Article 4(3)\nof the basic Regulation given that it is limited to certain enterprises registered\nin the designated geographical regions governed by the relevant provincial authorities\nimplementing this programme. \n(e)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(343)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. In the absence of\ninformation for the assessment of this benefit and since this programme has\nalready been examined in a previous anti-subsidy proceeding by the Union\ninstitutions, the most appropriate source of information for the assessment of\nthe benefit to the exporting producers has been the assessment made for this\nprogramme in the Coated Fine Paper proceeding, duly adjusted if needed\nas mentioned in recital (252) above.\n(344)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsubsidy rate thus established for all non-cooperating companies is set at 0,01%\non the basis of Coated Fine Paper findings[81].\n3.3.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Purchase\nof goods by the Government for higher than adequate remuneration\n(345)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint contained\nevidence that the GOC purchased through SOEs steel products manufactured by OCS\nproducers. The complaint referred to the GOC purchases of a number of steel\noutputs, including colour-coated sheet, hot-rolled sheet coils, cold-rolled\nsheet, medium plates, galvanised sheet, and many others. The complaint showed\nthat the price for the purchase of these goods by SOEs was set by reference to\ndifferent elements and/or benchmarks, and that there were price caps or\nadjustments depending on the different goods and on whether the transaction\nconcerned related parties.\n(346)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC replied by reference\nto its general arguments concerning SOEs that it has not been demonstrated that\npurchasers SOEs of these steel products were public bodies within the meaning\nof the WTO SCM Agreement and that it was impossible for the GOC to collect\ntransaction-specific data with regard to unknown entities. The GOC also stated\nthat the complaint did not refer to any purchase of goods involving the sampled\nexporters. The Commission refers to its conclusions on purchasers of OCS and\nother steel products being SOEs (recitals (49) - (73) above) and to the request\nto the GOC to provide information also concerning non-sampled exporters (see\nrecitals (34) and (35) above). Given the lack of further information provided\nby the GOC on this programme, the Commission bases its findings on the\ninformation available on file according to Article 28 of the basic Regulation.\n(347)\u00a0\u00a0 To the extent that prices\nare above market prices and a benefit is conferred by the State on OCS\nproducers through its purchasers SOEs, this programme is countervailable\naccording to Article 3(1)(a)(iii) and Article 6(d) of the basic Regulation. It\nalso needs to be considered that the complaint allegation that there is no\nreliable private price in the market because of the predominance of the public\nsector in the steel market has been confirmed by the investigation as SOEs have\na predominant share in the steel market in China at least with regard to\nhot-rolled steel and cold-rolled steel (see recitals (76) to (79)). This\nsubsidy is also specific under Article 4(2) of the basic Regulation as it is\nrestricted only to selected entities participated by the State in the steel\nsector. However, the complexity of these transactions and of the underlying\ncontracts coupled with the lack of the necessary details on the record did not\nenable the Commission to come to a firm conclusion on this programme. Therefore\nthe Commission has decided not to assess this programme further.\n3.3.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other regional programmes\n(a)              \nNon-cooperation by the GOC\n(348)\u00a0\u00a0 The Government of China\nreplied that as none of the sampled producers was located in the areas of\napplication of the regional programmes included in this section, the\ninformation requested by the Commission was irrelevant for the investigation.\nGiven the relevance of this information for the investigation (see recitals (34)\n- (35) above), in the absence of a reply by the GOC the Commission is basing\nits decision on all the regional programmes in this section on the facts\navailable on file in accordance with Article 28 of the basic Regulation.\n3.3.9.1.\u00a0 Subsidies provided in the Tianjin\nBinhai New Area and the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area\n(a)              \nLegal basis\n(349)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis of the\nAccelerated Depreciation scheme is the Circular of the Ministry of Finance and\nthe State Administration of Taxation concerning the Related Preferential\nPolicies of Enterprise Income Tax for Supporting the Development and Openness\nof Binhai New Area of Tianjin.\n(b)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(350)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint alleged that\nthe programme aims to promote the construction of science-technology\ninfrastructure in the Tianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA) and the Tianjin Economic\nand Technological Development Area (TETDA) and build a science-technology\nrenovation system and service abilities. According to the complaint, financial\nbenefits under this programme were granted under the Science and Technology\nFund and under the Accelerated Depreciation Programme. These benefits would be\nlimited to enterprises established in the TBNA Administrative Committee's\njurisdiction, including companies producing/exporting the product concerned.\nThe complaint referred to the decision by the US authorities in the\ncountervailing proceeding concerning certain seamless carbon and alloy steel\nstandard, line, and pressure pipe from the People's Republic of China, which\nfound this programme countervailable[82].\n(351)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of\ncooperation by the GOC, the Commission bases its decision on this programme on\nthe best information available in accordance with Article 28 of the basic\nRegulation contained in the complaint and in the mentioned decision by the US\nauthorities.\n(352)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme confers a\nnon-recurring benefit to the recipient companies in the form of grants under\nthe Science and Technology Fund in the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(i) of the\nbasic Regulation (direct transfer of funds) and in the form of revenue forgone\nunder Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation as concerns the Accelerated\nDepreciation Programme.\n(353)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidies under the\nScience and Technology Fund and under the Accelerated Depreciation Programme\nare specific within the meaning of Article 4(3) of the basic Regulation as they\nare limited to certain enterprises located within designated geographical\nregions (i.e. the TBNA and/or the TETDA).\n(c)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(354)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. In the absence of precise\nquantification elsewhere, the most appropriate source of information for the\nassessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has been a comparable decision\nby the US authorities, namely the US Decision Memorandum of 10 September 2010\non Certain Seamless Carbon and Alloy Steel Standard, Line, and Pressure Pipe\n(Pages Nos 20 and 21) (Federal Register Vol. 75, No. 182, page 57444 / 21\nSeptember 2010). With regard to investigations conducted by the US authorities,\nit is noted that the methodology used for calculating the amount of benefit\nfrom tax and grant programmes is substantially the same as that employed by the\nEU[83].\n(355)\u00a0\u00a0 The total subsidy rate thus\nestablished during the IP for all non-cooperating companies is set at 0,61%\nwhich corresponds to the accumulated rate for the schemes concerned as\nestablished in the decision referred to in the preceding recital.\n3.3.9.2.\u00a0 Programmes related to the\nNortheast Region\nThe Northeast Revitalization Programme\n(a)              \nLegal basis\n(356)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis is the\nCircular of the Ministry of Finance and State Tax Administration on Printing\nand Distributing the Regulations on Relevant Issues with respect to Expansion\nof VAT Deduction Scope in the Northeast Areas of 14 September 2004. \n(b)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(357)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant affirmed\nthat the GOC established the Northeast Revitalisation Programme in 2003 to\nrevive the old industrial base of Dalian City and the three Northeast Provinces\nof Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang, which is the traditional centre of China's\nsteel industry. According to the complaint, the GOC has created a special bank,\nthe Northeast Revitalisation Bank (NRB) under the control of the State Council\nwith a mandate to finance the support for the revitalisation of Northeast old\nheavy industrial hub.\n(358)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint also referred\nto subsidies provided under this programme by the Export-Import Bank of China\n(\u201cExIm Bank\u201d) through its Dalian branch for a total amount of RMB 5 billion in\nexport credits and other \"low-cost credit\" worth RMB 150 million in\nsavings for local enterprises since November 2003. The complaint also reported\nthat loans were also extended to non-creditworthy enterprises to enhance the\ncompetitiveness of ailing SOEs, which enjoyed a disproportionate access to\nfinancial resources despite having the highest share of non-performing loans in\nthe country.\n(359)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe absence of cooperation by the GOC, the Commission bases its decision on\nthis programme on the information contained in the complaint and in the US\nDecision Memorandum of 17 November 2008 on Circular Welded Carbon Quality Steel\nLine Pipe (Line Pipe) (Pages 21 and 22) (Federal Register Vol. 73, No. 227,\npage 70961 / 24 November 2008), duly adjusted if needed as mentioned in recital\n(252) above.\n(360)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme confers an\nadvantage to the recipient companies in the form of: (i) grants as export\ninterest subsidies; (ii) VAT refunds for purchase of fixed assets.\n(361)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to (i) export\ninterest subsidies, the provision of interest subsidies constitutes a subsidy\nin the form of grant within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(i) of the basic\nRegulation. The US decision refers to this programme as the \"Foreign Trade\nDevelopment Fund\" rather than the \"Northeast Revitalisation\nProgramme\", as also mentioned in the complaint. This programme is managed\nby the Liaoning provincial authorities (namely the Liaoning Provincial Bureau\nof Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the Liaoning Department of\nFinance). Eligible projects include those undertaken by exporting enterprises\ninter alia to improve the competitiveness of their export base and to explore\ninternational markets. Because these grants are contingent upon export performance,\nthis programme is specific according to Article 4(4)(a) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(362)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to (ii) VAT\nrefunds, for the purchase of fixed assets, they constitute a subsidy in the\nform of revenue forgone by the State according to Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the\nbasic Regulation. This programme provides that VAT taxpayers of certain\nindustries may deduct VAT for purchases of fixed assets from the VAT for sales\nof finished goods. This VAT deduction is limited to firms located in the\nnortheast region and is therefore regionally specific within the meaning of\nArticle 4(3) of the basic Regulation.\n(c)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(363)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. In the absence of precise\nquantification elsewhere, the most appropriate source of information for the\nassessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has been a comparable\ndecision (based on similarity in the nature of the programme) by the US\nauthorities.\n(364)\u00a0\u00a0 The total subsidy rate thus\nestablished for the Northeast Revitalization Programme during the IP for all\nnon-cooperating companies is set at 0,18% which corresponds to the accumulated\nrate for the grants and VAT refunds received under the Foreign Trade\nDevelopment Fund Program as established in the US Decision Memorandum of 17\nNovember 2008 on Circular Welded Carbon Quality Steel Line Pipe (Line Pipe)\n(Pages 21 and 22) (Federal Register Vol. 73, No. 227, page 70961 / 24 November\n2008). With regard to investigations conducted by the US authorities, it is\nnoted that the methodology used for calculating the amount of benefit from similar\nprogrammes is substantially the same as that employed by the EU[84].\nExport interest subsidies\n(a)              \nLegal basis\n(365)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis is the\nProvisional Administration Measures on High Tech Products and Equipment\nManufacturing Products Export Financial interest Assistance of Liaoning\nProvince, established on 16 December 2004.\n(b)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(366)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint alleged that\nthis programme provides assistance to companies to expand the export of\nhigh-tech products and supports the development of enterprises located in the Liaoning\nProvince. The programme is managed by the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Foreign\nTrade and Economic Cooperation, the Liaoning Department of Finance, and the\nEconomic Commission of Liaoning province. The US authorities have found this\nprogramme countervailable in the above-mentioned decision concerning Line\nPipe (see recital (359). \n(367)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme confers a\nbenefit in the form of direct transfer of funds from the GOC used to pay\ninterest on bank loans within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(i) of the basic\nRegulation. Export loans means short-term loans obtained by enterprises that\nproduce high-tech products and equipment manufacturing products in the province\nfrom banks and non-bank financial institutions due to the shortage of necessary\nfunds for production and operation between products export declaration and receipt\nof payment. Eligible enterprises must have an annual export value above $ 1\nmillion and have exported products falling in the scope of the \"China\nHigh-Tech Product Export Catalogue\" or the scope of equipment\nmanufacturing products. This programme is therefore specific under Article 4(2)\nof the basic Regulation because it is limited to enterprises fulfilling these\ncriteria. This programme is also contingent upon export performance according\nto Article 4(4)(a) of the basic Regulation. The programme is also regionally\nspecific within the terms of Article 4(3) as it is limited to enterprises\nlocated within the designated geographical region in the Northeast of China.\n(c)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(368)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. In the absence of precise\nquantification elsewhere, the most appropriate source of information for the\nassessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has been a comparable\ndecision (based on similarity in the nature of the programme) by the US\nauthorities.\n(369)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished during the IP for all non-cooperating companies is set at 0,43%\nwhich corresponds to the rate for the export interest subsidies scheme as\nestablished in the US Decision Memorandum of 17 November 2008 on Circular\nWelded Carbon Quality Steel Line Pipe (Line Pipe) (Page No 23) (Federal\nRegister Vol. 73, No. 227, page 70961 / 24 November 2008). With regard to\ninvestigations conducted by the US authorities, it is noted that the\nmethodology used for calculating the amount of benefit from similar programmes\nis substantially the same as that employed by the EU[85].\nExport loans\n(a)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(370)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint refers to the\nprevious programme of export interest subsidies, which is eligible only in\nconnection with outstanding \"export loans\". The US authorities have\nfound also this programme countervailable in the decision concerning Line Pipe.\n(371)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis is the\n\"Provisional Administration Measures on High Tech Products and Equipment\nManufacturing Products Export Financial interest Assistance of Liaoning\nProvince\", established on 16 December 2004.\n(372)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme constitutes a\nbenefit in the form of direct transfer of funds from the GOC in the meaning of\nArticle 3(1)(a)(i) of the basic Regulation. The subsidy confers a benefit under\nArticle 3(2) and 6(b) of the basic Regulation equal to the difference between\nwhat the recipients paid, and the amount they would have paid for a comparable\ncommercial loan in the absence of the programme. These loans are provided by\nthe government through its policy banks and its SOCBs (see analysis in recitals\n(157) - (180) above). These export loans are specific under Article 4(4)(a) of\nthe basic Regulation because they are contingent upon export performance and\nalso under Article 4(3) as they are limited to enterprises located within a\ndesignated geographical region in China.\n(b)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(373)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. In the absence of precise\nquantification elsewhere, the most appropriate source of information for the\nassessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has been a comparable\ndecision (based on similarity in the nature of the programme) by the US\nauthorities.\n(374)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished during the IP for all non-cooperating companies is set at 1,05%\nwhich corresponds to arithmetical average of the rates for the export loans\nscheme as established in the US Decision Memorandum of 17 November 2008 on\nCircular Welded Carbon Quality Steel Line Pipe (Line Pipe) (Page No 23)\n(Federal Register Vol. 73, No. 227, page 70961 / 24 November 2008). With regard\nto investigations conducted by the US authorities, it is noted that the\nmethodology used for calculating the amount of benefit from similar programmes\nis substantially the same as that employed by the EU[86].\nLiaoning Province Grants- Five Point One\nLine Programme\n(a)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(375)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint states that\nthe \"Five Points, One Line Coastal Belt\" programme was introduced on\n21 January 2006 by the Liaoning Provincial Government. The Liaoning government\nprovides subsidies for certain enterprises located in the area. The first\npriority is given to enterprises set up in the five key areas as export\nmanufacture bases. The preferential treatment include a number of benefits,\nincluding a reduced income tax rate of 15% for enterprises certified as\n\"high-tech\" enterprises; income tax exemption for 'domestically\ninvested' high-tech enterprises; priority to receive interest subsidies;\neconomic management privileges; and exemptions from government fees. According\nto the complaint the China Development Bank (CDB), a state-owned policy bank,\nhas provided preferential loans under this programme.\n(376)\u00a0\u00a0 The US authorities have\nfound this programme countervailable in the above-mentioned decision concerning\nLine Pipe.\n(377)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis of this\nprogramme is the \"Opinion of Liaoning Provincial Encouraging the Expansion\nof Opening-Up in Coastal Key Developing Areas.\" The Liaoning Development\nand reform Commission and the Liaoning Finance Bureau manage the interest\nsubsidies, and the Huludao Beigang Industrial Park, Industry, and Commerce\nAuthority administer the fee exemptions provided under this programme.\n(378)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme provides\nfinancial advantages in the form of direct transfer of funds from the GOC in\nthe terms of Article 3(1)(a)(i) of the basic Regulation and/or revenue forgone\nor not collected in the terms of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation.\nThese subsidies constitute a benefit under Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation\nequal to the amount of the grant and/or to the tax/fee exemptions. These\nsubsidies are specific within the terms of Article 4(3) of the basic Regulation\nas they are limited to certain enterprises located within the designated\njurisdiction of the Liaoning Provincial authority. The first priority for the\ngranting of these subsidies is given to enterprises set up in the five key\nareas as export manufacture bases, and therefore they are also specific\naccording to Article 4(4)(a) of the basic regulation insofar as they are\ncontingent upon export performance.\n(b)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(379)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. In the absence of precise\nquantification elsewhere, the most appropriate source of information for the\nassessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has been a comparable\ndecision (based on similarity in the nature of the programme) by the US\nauthorities.\n(380)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished during the IP for all non-cooperating companies is set at 0,30%\nwhich corresponds to the rate established for this scheme in the US Decision\nMemorandum of 17 November 2008 on Circular Welded Carbon Quality Steel Line\nPipe (Line Pipe) (Page No 23) (Federal Register Vol. 73, No. 227, page 70961 /\n24 November 2008). With regard to investigations conducted by the US authorities,\nit is noted that the methodology used for calculating the amount of benefit\nfrom grant programmes is substantially the same as that employed by the EU[87].\n3.3.9.3.\u00a0 Grants under the Science and\ntechnology programme of Jiangsu Province\n(a)              \nLegal basis\n(381)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis of this\nprogramme is the Administrative Measures on Jiangsu Sci-Tech Public Service\nPlatform (Sukeji (2006) No 102; Sucaijiao (2006) No 22).\n(b)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(382)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint states that\nthis programme provides, among others, grants to certain enterprises. The\nGovernment of China stated in its questionnaire reply that no sampled company\nused or benefited under this programme. The Commission refers to its arguments\nthat the GOC was expected to provide complete replies also to questions\nconcerning non-sampled companies (recitals (34) - (35) above). Furthermore, the\nCommission notes that the complaint lists as potential beneficiaries both\ncompanies that were sampled and other non-sampled OCS producers located in the\nrelevant area of application. The Commission therefore bases its findings on\nthe facts available on record in accordance with Article 28 of the basic\nRegulation, and in particular the information contained in the complaint and\nthe findings by the US authorities that have countervailed this programme in\nthe decision concerning Pre-Stressed Concrete Steel Wire Strand from the\nPeople's Republic of China.[88]\n(383)\u00a0\u00a0 The financial advantages\ngranted in the form of grants provide a contribution within the meaning of\nArticle 3(1)(a)(i) of the basic Regulation. These subsidies are specific within\nthe terms of Article 4(2)(c) of the basic Regulation because, there seem to be no\nobjective criteria or conditions governing the eligibility for the benefits\nfrom this scheme (as provided for in Article 4(2)(b) of the basic Regulation )\nand, on the basis of the facts available, discretion does not seem to be\nexercised by the Jiangsu Department of Science and Technology is an objective\nmanner.\n(c)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(384)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. In the absence of precise\nquantification elsewhere, the most appropriate source of information for the\nassessment of the benefit to the exporting producers has been a comparable\ndecision (based on similarity in the nature of the programme) by the US\nauthorities.\n(385)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished during the IP for all non-cooperating companies is set at 0,01%\nwhich corresponds to the rate established for this scheme in the US Decision\nMemorandum of 14 May 2010 on Pre-Stressed Concrete Steel Wire Strand (Page No\n35) (Federal Register Vol. 75, No. 98, page 28557 / 21 May 2010). With regard\nto investigations conducted by the US authorities, it is noted that the\nmethodology used for calculating the amount of benefit from grant programmes is\nsubstantially the same as that employed by the EU[89].\n3.3.9.4.\u00a0 Grants under the Science and\nTechnology programme of Hebei Province\n(a)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(386)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint refers to two\ngrants provided under the Science and Technology programme of Hebei province to\nan OCS producer in 2009 under this programme for an amount of RMB 700.000 and\nRMB 2.080.000. The Government of China stated in its questionnaire reply that\nnone of the sampled company was established in Hebei and therefore the\nrequested information was irrelevant for the investigation. The Commission\nrefers to its arguments that the GOC should have provided complete replies also\nto questions concerning non-sampled companies (recitals (34) - (35) above). The\nCommission findings are therefore based on the facts available on record (in\nthis case the complaint) in accordance with Article 28 of the basic Regulation.\n(387)\u00a0\u00a0 The financial advantages\nprovided under this programme in the form of grants constitute subsidies given\nthat they provide a financial contribution in the terms of Article 3(1)(a)(i)\nof the basic Regulation. They constitute a benefit under Article 3(2) of the\nbasic Regulation equal to the amount of the grants. These subsidies are\nspecific according to Article 4(3) of the basic Regulation as they are provided\nonly for companies located in the Hebei province.\n(b)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(388)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. In the absence of other information\nfor the assessment of this benefit the Commission based its findings on\ninformation contained in the complaint. In accordance with Article 7(2) of the\nbasic Regulation, the subsidy amount so calculated has been allocated over the\ntotal turnover of the recipients during the IP as appropriate denominator,\nbecause the subsidy is not contingent upon export performance and was not\ngranted by reference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported or\ntransported.\n(389)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus established\nfor all non-cooperating companies is negligible (less than 0,01%).\n3.3.10.\u00a0\u00a0 Ad hoc subsidies\n(a)              \nFindings of the investigation\n(390)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint listed a\nnumber of ad hoc subsidies allegedly granted to certain OCS producers, both\nSOEs and private companies. These subsidies were either grants or other tax\nexemptions or reductions inter alia in order to finance particular projects or\nassets. They were granted in the context of the general strategic policy to\nupgrade the steel industry.\n(391)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission asked the GOC\nto provide information on these ad hoc subsidies. The GOC replied that the\nallegations in the complaint were based on quotations from the annual reports\nand it seemed that none of them concerned sampled companies. Therefore, the GOC\nconcluded that it was not necessary to address transaction-specific allegations\nconcerning non-sampled companies and provinces. Furthermore, the GOC restated\none of its general comments that the mere listing of certain transactions as\n'subsidies' in a company's annual report cannot be taken as evidence sufficient\nto launch an investigation on them as it \"does not constitute\nsufficient prima facie evidence according to Article 11.2 of the WTO SCM\nAgreement\".\n(392)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission refers to its\narguments explaining why the GOC was required to submit information also with\nregard to the subsidy allegations concerning the non-sampled companies\n(recitals (34) - (35) above). The Commission based its findings on these ad hoc\nsubsidies on the facts available on file in accordance with Article 28 of the\nbasic Regulation.\n(393)\u00a0\u00a0 The ad hoc subsidies listed\nin the complaint constitute a subsidy in the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(i) of\nthe basic Regulation in the form of a direct transfer of funds with regard to\nthe grants and similar transfers of resources, and in the meaning of Article\n3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation in the form of revenue forgone for the\nvarious exemptions or reductions of taxes and/or fees at central, provincial,\nor municipal level otherwise due. The Commission notes that the annual reports\nof the various OCS producers themselves refer to these financial contributions\nas 'subsidies'. On the face of it, a number of these subsidies appear to be\nspecific in law or in fact, within the terms of Article 4(2) of the basic\nRegulation because, in the absence of cooperation from the GOC, they are deemed\nto be granted to a limited number of steel companies in the encouraged steel\nsector, and/or because of the manner in which discretion of the granting\nauthorities has been exercised for their granting. Furthermore, some of these\nsubsidies appear also specific pursuant to Article 4(3) of the basic Regulation\nsince their access was limited to certain enterprises located in designated\ngeographical regions in the territory of a certain province.\n(b)              \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(394)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has carefully\nstudied the information available on the record concerning each of these ad hoc\nsubsidies for the various producers of OCS. The Commission found that some of\nthese subsidies are non-trade distortive and/or confer relatively small amounts\nto OCS producers. By contrast, there are also a number of specific subsidies\nthat appear to confer significant amounts of subsidies to the OCS producers. In\nview of this and of the information present on file, the Commission considers\nit appropriate to calculate the applicable countervailing duty by reference to\nthe simple average resulting from the grants and the tax programmes\ncountervailed in this proceeding despite the non-cooperation by the GOC and the\nrelevant OCS producers.\n(395)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate thus\nestablished for all non-cooperating companies is set at 0,5%.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments\nof parties after definitive disclosure\n(396)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC, one sampled exporting\nproducer (Zhejiang Huadong) and the complainant submitted comments on\ndefinitive disclosure.\n3.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of GOC on\ndefinitive disclosure\n(397)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the numerous and\nvery detailed arguments submitted by the GOC and that fact that it would be\nimpracticable (also due to the presence of some confidential information) to\ninclude all of them in this regulation, the Commission has bilaterally\nexplained in writing to the GOC all the legal and factual elements underlining\nthe rejection of these claims.\n3.4.1.1.\u00a0 Procedural issues\n(398)\u00a0\u00a0 In a number of its arguments\non the initiation of the investigation, the GOC seemed to consider the GOES panel\nreport[90] to be controlling in interpreting certain provisions of the SCM\nAgreement and the EU Basic Regulation. For instance, the GOC talks about doubts\nbeing \"removed\" by the GOES panel[91]. While\nthe Commission took note of the findings of the panel in this and does not\ndisagree with a number of its conclusions, these findings do not amend the\nrelevant Treaty or legislative language, notably Articles 11.2 and 11.3 of the\nWTO Subsidies Agreement or Articles 9(2) and 9(3) of the basic CVD Regulation which\nare relevant and binding for the Commission in all AS proceedings.\n(399)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that the Commission is in breach of Article 11.2 of the SCM Agreement\n(ASCM) because it initiated this investigation on the basis of a complaint\nwhich did not contain any evidence of the \"existence, degree and effect of\nany (/each) alleged subsidy\" and therefore the Commission had violated its\nobligation under Article 11.3 to review the accuracy and the adequacy of the\nevidence. \nThis claim had to be rejected. The GOC's reference to \"existence, degree\nand effect\" of the subsidy is a quote from Article 11.1 of the ASCM and\ndescribes the purpose of an investigation. In Commission's view it is\nunrelated to Article 11.2 of ASCM, which requires that the complainant shall\nprovide \"sufficient evidence of the existence of a subsidy and, if\npossible, its amount\" and the complaint shall include \"such\ninformation as is \"reasonably available\" to the complainant.\nThe Commission has analysed the evidence submitted by the complainant, which\nwas substantial, as it appears clearly from the version open for inspection by\ninterested parties of the complaint. The Commission services only proposed the\ninitiation of an investigation after having duly analysed the accuracy and\nadequacy of the evidence which they consider sufficient prima facie.\n(400)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC suggested that each element (financial contribution, benefit and\nspecificity) of each subsidy scheme has to be determined individually. The\nCommission agrees with the GOC that subsidy allegations have to be examined\nindividually. However, it is not the case that the evidence presented with\nregard to each element of each subsidy programme has to be examined in\nisolation. For instance, evidence of the existence of specificity for one\nprogramme could be highly relevant for the determination of specificity with\nregard to another programme, inter alia, depending on how much\ninformation is publicly available on the programmes in question, as well as the\nextent to which the programmes are closely connected and depend upon the same\nlegislation.\n(401)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC argued that there\nmust be evidence of the (above de minimis) amount of subsidy during the\nIP for each programme and that there must be sufficient evidence of current\nsubsidization for each subsidy, not of \"potential\" or\n\"likely\" benefits. On this point, the Commission does not agree with\nthe GOC, since there is no requirement in the basic Regulation or WTO SCM\nAgreement to show that subsidies for a particular programme are above de\nminimis. There is no dispute that a subsidy must confer a benefit during\nthe IP in order to be countervailed and that the complainants should endeavour\nto produce such evidence. However, Article 11.2 of ASCM requires\n\"sufficient evidence\" of subsidization on the basis of information\n\"reasonably available\" to the complainant. Since much information on\nsubsidy benefits (e.g. tax exemptions, grants, provision of goods) is not publicly\navailable, it is often impossible for complainants to establish with certainty\nthat the subsidy has conferred a benefit to producers of the product concerned.\nIn such situations, the complainant is required to provide the best available\nevidence showing that, for example, producers of the product concerned are eligible\nfor the subsidy and that the programme is still in force or providing\nbenefits. The level of evidence required will depend on the facts of the case\nin question and on how much information is reasonably available to the\ncomplainant.\n(402)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nNotice of Initiation is in violation of Article 22.2 (iii) of the ASCM, arguing\nthat it cannot be considered that the simple repetition of the names assigned\nto the various programs constitutes a \"description\" thereof. The\nCommission considers that subsidy practices to be investigated have been\nadequately described in the Notice of Initiation by specifying the schemes\nconcerned and therefore the Notice does not violate Article 22.2(iii) of ASCM.\n(403)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC argued that the\nCommission has wrongly initiated on a number of subsidy programmes because it\nhas looked at the complaint \"holistically\" or \"in its\ntotality\" rather than examining each programme; GOC also stated that the findings\nof other investigating authorities on various programmes are not by themselves\nsufficient evidence for initiation. As explained above (recital (400), the\nCommission services have examined each programme. The extent, to which findings\nof other authorities on a particular programme can constitute sufficient\nevidence for initiation, is a case by case issue and depends to some extent on\nwhat other information is reasonably available to the complainant.\n(404)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC (quoting a US\nsubmission in the GOES case[92])\nclaimed that the \"encouraged\" status of OCS producers in government\nplanning documents may have been used in \"blanket fashion\" to show\nspecificity. This does not represent reality. The legislation classifying OCS\nproducers as \"encouraged\"[93] (and\nthe consequences which flow from this) is not (as GOC submits) \"general\ninformation about government policy, with no direct connection to the programme\nat issue\". Given that it explicitly limits access to programmes to certain\nenterprises (or gives preferential benefits), such legislation obviously has a\nvery direct connection to the programme in question.\n(405)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that there\nmust be evidence of a current benefit from a subsidy programme and that the\nfact that programmes were countervailed in other cases is insufficient, as such\nfindings relate to a different IP. There is no dispute that a subsidy must\nconfer a benefit during the IP in order to be countervailed and that the\ncomplainants should endeavour to produce such evidence. However, for the purposes\nof initiation, evidence of use of a programme in a reasonably recent period can\nbe highly relevant, for instance if there is no publicly available information\nthat the programme has been terminated or modified. The reference of the GOES\npanel[94] by GOC (to Paragraph 7.72 of the panel report) is inconclusive,\nbecause this refers to situations where it is \"clear\" that there is\nno present subsidization, which is not the case here.\n(406)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that there must be evidence that some producers of the product\nconcerned have actually received a benefit from a programme, in order for\ninitiation to take place. This claim could not be accepted. There is no\nrequirement in the basic Regulation nor it is a requirement of Article 11.2 of\nthe ASCM, which requires \"sufficient evidence of the existence of a\nsubsidy\u2026\", or explicit evidence of actual utilisation by certain\nproducers. Since much information on subsidy benefits (e.g. tax exemptions,\ngrants, provision of goods) is not publicly available, it is often impossible\nfor complainants to establish with certainty that the subsidy has conferred a\nbenefit to producers of the product concerned. In such situations, the\ncomplainant is required to provide the best available evidence showing that,\nfor example, producers of the product concerned are eligible for the\nsubsidy and that the programme is still in force or providing benefits. The\nlevel of evidence required will depend on the facts of the case in question and\non how much information is reasonably available to the complainant. Imposing\nsuch a requirement on complainants would effectively favour non-transparent\nsystems over more transparent ones granting the same type of subsidy.\n(407)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC argued that the Commission did not provide a \"reasonable period\"\nfor the GOC to submit the necessary information under Article 12.7 of the SCM\nAgreement. The GOC also claimed that the Commission did not grant to the GOC \"ample\nopportunity\" to present in writing all relevant evidence concerning the\ninvestigation in accordance with Article 12.1 of the SCM Agreement. These\narguments must be rejected as the Commission granted a reasonable period and\nample opportunity for the GOC to submit the relevant information in accordance\nwith the relevant provisions of the WTO and of the basic Regulation. The\nCommission notes that it granted exceptionally generous extensions to the\ndeadline for the original questionnaire reply, bringing the total period for\nthe reply from 37 days to almost 2 months. Considering also the deficiency\nprocess, the GOC had more than 3 months since the initiation to provide the\nrequested information. The GOC was also offered the opportunity to provide\nmissing information until the time of the verification visit. The Commission\nalso notes that 'reasonable period' must be seen in the procedural context\nwhereby the Commission is mandated by the basic anti-subsidy Regulation to\nconclude the investigation within a period of 13 months. Granting even longer\ndeadlines as requested by the GOC would inevitably have negatively affected the\npossibility for the Commission to proceed expeditiously in order to comply with\nthe relevant legal deadlines.\n(408)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also referred to its\nrequest for assistance to the Commission in preparing the questionnaire reply,\nwhich in the GOC view was denied by the Commission. This does not correspond to\nreality because the GOC request for assistance was so broad and open-ended\n(i.e. it covered each question in the questionnaire and the appendices)\nthat the Commission was only able to offer the GOC assistance with respect to\nthe specific problems the GOC was encountering in the replies, rather\nthan the individual questions. The GOC decided not to take up this offer for\nassistance further. The Commission also notes that Article 12.11 ASCM states\nthat the assistance requested must be \"practicable\", which is not the\ncase with respect to broad, open-ended requests imposing an impossibly high\nburden on the investigating authority, particular when the questionnaire is\nself-explanatory. The Commission notes that the GOC is highly experienced in\nanti-subsidy investigation and uses the services of outside lawyers. \n(409)\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to the subsidy\nprogrammes contained in the complaint that were not used by the sample\nexporters, the GOC argued that it would be unable to provide the requested\ninformation on all these programmes in the time allotted by the Commission\nbecause of the fragmentation of the steel industry. The GOC also claimed that\nit did not understand from the Commission until late in the proceeding the\npotential consequences from the failure to provide the requested information on\nthese programmes given that they concerned non-sampled companies. The\nCommission at the outset notes an inconsistency in the position of the GOC, as\nits claim that it did not have sufficient time to provide replies in the time\nallotted appears to conflict with its deliberate choice of not replying to all\nthe programmes not used by the sampled exporters because it allegedly did not\nunderstand the purpose of the Commission's request and the consequences for the\nrefusal to provide the requested information. In any event, as specified above\n(recital (407)) the Commission granted several deadline extensions to the GOC\nin order to enable it to submit the requested information concerning on all of\nthe programmes. Therefore the total time allotted (i.e. more than 3 months\nconsidering the deficiency process) was more than sufficient to provide the\nrequested information. The GOC itself explicitly acknowledges in its comments\nthat it is true that it took this position that it should not have been\nrequired to submit the information on these other programmes, and this is also\nshown by the fact that it did not even try to submit a partial or incomplete\nreply to show its willingness to cooperate but simply did not submit any\ninformation at all in this respect.\n(410)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission also cannot\naccept the GOC argument that it did not understand the consequences for failure\nto provide the requested information on the programmes not used by the sampled\nexporters. As a matter of fact, the Commission clarified these consequences in\nseveral instances since the beginning of the proceeding. More specifically, the\nconsequences for non-cooperation are explicitly indicated with reference to the\nrelevant provisions of the basic Regulation in the Notice of Initiation and in\nthe cover page of the questionnaire. The Commission also replied extensively on\nthe purpose of sampling and on the need for the GOC to provide the requested\ninformation given the high level of non-cooperation and the possible\nexaminations of the requests for individual treatment in its letters of 19\nMarch, 11 April, 4 May (deficiency letter), 7 June (pre-verification visit\nletter), and 14 August 2012. Therefore, the GOC could not possibly have been\nunaware or have misunderstood the consequences of its lack of cooperation on\nthese programmes not used by the sampled exporting producers. Fundamentally,\nthe GOC appears to have ignored that, as the grantor of the alleged\nsubsidy schemes, it was required to cooperate and provide information with\nrespect to all subsidy schemes alleged to be available for the product under\ninvestigation.\n(411)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also made a number\nof arguments with regard to the verification process and the verification visit\nitself. The GOC objected that from the Commission\u2019s pre-verification letter it\ncould not discern the extent of the verification of the relevant information\nand complains about an alleged refusal by the Commission to provide a more\nspecific outline for the verification. The GOC added that it was entitled at a\nminimum to some \"narrowing down\" of the possible scope of the\nverification (e.g. by means of an advance written list of all questions that\nthe Commission officials would ask)[95] which\nin the GOC view could not have been exhaustive given short duration of the\nvisit. With respect to this latter argument, the Commission rejects the GOC\nargument as there is no legal basis in either the WTO ASCM or the EU basic\nanti-subsidy Regulation granting a purported right to this narrowing-down of\nthe scope of the visit. Nor is there any ruling by the WTO even suggesting that\nsuch an entitlement would have to be interpreted as to exist.\u00a0\u00a0 \nWith regard to the other GOC arguments, the\nCommission notes that it sent a detailed pre-verification letter on 7 June 2012\nclearly indicating (i) a proposed schedule previously agreed informally with\nthe GOC, (ii) the purpose of the verification visit, (iii) the scope, content\nand object of the visit, and (iv) the possible resort to facts available for\nthe programmes not used by the sampled exporters (see above). In order to limit\nthe need for the presence of the relevant GOC officials, it also indicated on\nwhich day each programme would be addressed. The Commission went even further\nthan that in order to accommodate the requests for further details on the\nverification visits by the GOC in the spirit of full cooperation, as it met the\nrepresentatives of the GOC at a very short notice to provide the requested\nclarifications on the details of the verification visits. The Commission then\nfollowed-up in writing to this meeting by answering further requests for\nclarifications by the GOC in a number of emails exchanged with the GOC.\nTherefore the Commission did everything it possibly could to ensure a\nsuccessful verification visit, but nevertheless the GOC seems to have ignored\nall these efforts. \n3.4.1.2.\u00a0 Provision of HRS and CRS for\nless than adequate remuneration\n(412)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC claimed that the\nCommission should have made a \u201cthreshold\u201d determination of the existence of a\npublic body before requesting transaction-specific information in Appendix B to\nthe GOC questionnaire. This claim could not be accepted as it would be\nimpractical to separate the investigation into two stages in this way, as the\nCommission would have to make two separate requests for information and carry\nout two separate verification visits to China. In addition to the\nresource implications, this would in practice make it virtually impossible to\ncomplete the investigation within the deadlines. In any event, the totality of\nthe evidence (including the transaction-specific data on prices and quantities)\nmay be relevant to the public body determination.\n(413)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC claimed that its failure\nto provide responses to Appendix B intended for the SOEs supplying HRS and CRS\nto the OCS producers should not lead to the application of Article 28 of the\nBasic regulation and the fact that the Commission applied facts available is in\nbreach it Article 12.7 of the ASCM agreement. GOC further claimed that the\nCommission required that the Appendix B be completed by many companies\nirrelevant to the investigation. This claim must be rejected. The Commission\nconstructed Appendix B in a way to verify the allegations in the complaint and\ndid so in line with the findings of WTO Appellate Body in DS379 which set out\ncertain guidelines for the determination of public body. The claim of the GOC\nthat \"it is not only SOEs to which appendix B pertained\" does not\nrepresent reality. It is true that initially the Commission asked all producers\nof HRS/CRS to fill in Appendix B, but following the GOC reply to the\nquestionnaire the Commission, in order to facilitate the work of the GOC in\nreplying to Appendix B, scaled down the request only to SOEs concerned[96]. Despite this effort from the Commission the GOC and the SOEs\nconcerned did not reply to the Appendix B although it is clear (notably from\nthe complaint) that SOEs providing HRS/CRS to the exporting producers of OCS\nare concerned by this investigation.\n(414)\u00a0\u00a0 Taking the above into\naccount the Commission had no alternative but to apply Article 28 (1) of the\nbasic Regulation and did so fully in compliance with Article 12.7 of the ASCM.\n(415)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that the facts available used by the Commission do not support the\nconclusion that the cited steel industry \u201cguidelines\u201d are legally binding. The\nmain steel industry planning document on the basis of which the Commission\nbased its findings concerning the existence of a public body is the Order No.\n35 of the NDRC \u2013 Policies of the Development of Iron and Steel Industry. The\nCommission asked a direct question concerning the legal status of orders of the\nNDRC and it was confirmed that orders in Chinese legislation are legally\nbinding as they fall into the one of the four categories of law in China.\nTherefore this claim is in contradiction with the relevant information on the\nfile.\n(416)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nmarket distortion found by the Commission in the steel sector is irrelevant for\nthe public body determination of the HRS/CRS producers and that the public body\ndetermination should have been made specifically to the entities supplying\nHRS/CRS to the two sampled groups of exporting producers and not only to all\nSOEs producing HRS/CRS in China in general. According to the GOC, if the\nCommission does not have information on these entities, it cannot make a\ndetermination; otherwise, it would be drawing an impermissible adverse\ninference. The Commission does not agree with this claim. The existence of the\nmarket distortion is a relevant, although not determining, factor in the\nanalysis. The \"public body \"finding of the Commission in the context\nof this proceeding concerns all the HRS/CRS producers which are fully or partly\nstate-owned, because it was made on the basis of evidence relating to broad\npolicy and industry-wide factors and was not a company-specific determination .\nThe state-owned entities supplying HRS/CRS to the two sampled exporting\nproducers clearly fall within the scope of the public body finding and\ntherefore it was not considered necessary to do make a specific determination\nlimited to them. In any event, the GOC provided no information which may serve\nfor such a company-specific determination in response to the Commission\u2019s\nquestionnaire.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe GOC argument that the Commission cannot make a determination in the absence\nof \"actual facts\" on the specific SOEs concerned would mean that the\nGOC would actually benefit from non-cooperation (as it had refused to supply\nthe \"facts\") and would thus obtain a \"more favourable\"\nresult than if it had cooperated, which is the opposite to an adverse inference.\n(417)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC objected that it was\nnotified by the Commission of the \"entrustment and direction\"\nanalyses only at the stage of final disclosure and therefore its rights of\ndefence were breached. However, the Commission could not know that it would\ncome to this conclusion at the earlier stage of the investigation. This finding\nis a result of all the information and data collected throughout the proceeding\nand was disclosed as soon as the final determination was made, i.e. at the time\nwhen the definitive disclosure was made. The complaint alleged subsidies\nrelated to the government provision of goods by SOEs. The investigation showed\nthat the government policy in question, which initially concerned SOEs, also\napplied to private entities, leading to a conclusion of entrustment or\ndirection by government.\n(418)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nfacts discussed by the Commission in no way justify the conclusion that any\nprivate body in the steel sector is entrusted and directed by the state to\nprovide the subsidies countervailed. This claim had to be rejected. In its\nanalyses concerning entrustment and direction the Commission referred to number\nof government plans and policy documents and cited sections from these\ndocuments which show a direct link between the government and the conduct of\nthe private steel companies and supported this finding by examples of actions\nby these private operators.\n(419)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that the Commission failed to distinguish between the consequences\nof government action and the intention of government action when doing the\nentrustment and direction analysis. This claim is also rejected. The Commission\nestablished the existence of a government policy to support the steel industry\nand to provide HRS/CRS through public bodies (SOEs) at below-market prices. It\nwas further established that this policy (by means of the predominance of SOEs\nand the dissuasion of exports of HRS/CRS) effectively forced private producers\nto supply the domestic OCS industry at the same below-market prices charged by\nSOEs. Indeed, there is evidence that the prices of private suppliers are\nexplicitly linked to those of SOEs. Therefore,\nthe Commission established that the one of the aims of the policy was to\ndirect and entrust private bodies to follow the same practices as the SOEs. This\nis a classic case of the government, by itself and through SOEs,\n\"exercising its authority\" over private suppliers. The policy has all\nthe required elements for entrustment and direction i.e. a \"government\naction\", \"addressed to a particular party\", \"the objective\nof which is a particular task or duty.\" As\nan illustration of government intentions, certain provisions of the Order No 35\npenalise the companies which do not act in line with policies described\ntherein. This shows that the GOC has an intention to lead the whole steel\nindustry in a certain direction and that should there be companies which do not\nfollow this intention there will be consequence for them.\n(420)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also claimed that\nthe Commission did not establish that the GOC has a policy to provide HRS and\nCRS to the OCS sector and that the Commission did not draw a conclusion to that\neffect. This claim had to be rejected. As shown in the analysis in recitals (49)\n- (72) above, the SOEs providing HRS/CRS to the OCS producers are public\nbodies, the extended arm of the GOC and it is clear that they provide HRS/CRS\nto the OCS exporting producers. It was also established that the prices of\nthese inputs do not reflect the market values. Therefore it is concluded that\nthrough these SOEs the GOC exercises a policy of provision of cheap HRS and CRS.\n(421)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC claimed that the\nCommission has erroneously concluded that there is pervasive government control\nof the steel sector generally and that the steel industry complies with certain\nguidelines, but it has not concluded that the provision of steel to the OCS\nsector at below market prices is a goal of that policy. This claim had to be\nrejected. As explained in recital (419) above, the Commission has found that\nthe government policy involves an intention to direct private suppliers to\nfollow the below-market provision practices of SOEs.\n(422)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC claimed that the\nCommission did not make a finding that there is a specific intent by the GOC to\nprovide actual financial contribution at issue in the case of provision of HRS\nand CRS as prescribed by the AB report in US \u2013Countervailing Duty\nInvestigation on DRAMS from Korea[97]. This claim had to be rejected. The\ngovernmental actions in question are based on a government policy intended to\ndirect private suppliers to follow the below-market provision practices of\nSOEs. This is not a \u201cconsequence\u201d or \u201cby product\u201d of government intervention;\nit is the purpose of it. It is clear that in this case private suppliers of\nHRS/CRS are not exercising \"free choice\" in the market because the\nmarket is distorted by the predominance of SOEs and the export of HRS/CRS is\ndiscouraged.\n(423)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claims that the\nCommission made no findings on the actual private bodies which supplied HRS/CRS\nto the sampled companies. This claim had to be rejected. As in the case of\npublic bodies, the Commission made a sector-wide determination of entrustment\nand direction which applies to all private suppliers. Since the government\npolicy in question applies to all such entities, there is no need to make a\ncompany-specific determination.\n(424)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission rejected the GOC's evidence concerning the proportion of Chinese\nproduction of HRS and CRS which comes from SOEs. The table provided by the GOC\nin this respect cannot be considered evidence. The GOC refused to provide\nsource data before and during the verification for this table and therefore it\ncannot be considered to be reliable information. For this reason the Commission\nused information from the World Steel Capacity Book, which is generally\naccepted by the world steel industry.\n(425)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission did not explain why the world market prices of HRS and CRS are the\nmost appropriate benchmark and referred to the AB ruling in the US-Softwood\nLumber IV that the out-of-country benchmark \"must relate or refer to, to\nbe connected with, the prevailing market conditions in the country of provision\nand must reflect price, quality, availability, marketability, transportation\nand other conditions for purchase or sale\". GOC also claims that the\n\"government predominance\" cannot lead to relaxation of this\njurisprudence, because if it were the option to use an out-of-country benchmark\nwould not be available at all. GOC claim that the Commission has not complied\nwith the requirements of Article 14 of the ASCM. The Commission disagrees with\nthis claim. The prevailing market conditions in China are distorted as found by\nthe Commission and explained in recitals (49) - (97) above. Since steel is\nproduced worldwide by similar processes and is traded worldwide, the most\nreasonable external benchmark is world price, since should China be in a normal\nnon-distorted market situation, it is likely that the prices would align with\nthe world prices. GOC provided very little information on the steel market in China\neven though it was specifically requested by the Commission. Also China did not\npropose any other benchmark except the in-country benchmark which was not\nsuitable because of market distortions found.\u00a0\u00a0 \nGOC claimed that the Commission did not base the specificity finding in respect\nto the provision of HRS/CRS for less than adequate remuneration on anything\nother than the tautological statement made by the complainants in the complaint\nand this is not sufficient to fulfil the requirements of the ASCM. This claim\nhad to be rejected. Both HRS and CRS are used as inputs only by a limited\nnumber of companies, since companies in many sectors will have no use for these\nproducts. The GOC itself in its reply to the questionnaire confirmed that the HRS\nand CRS are used only by limited number of industries. The GOC did not dispute\nthis fact in the comments to definitive disclosure. Therefore it is confirmed that\nthis subsidy is specific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(c) of the basic\nRegulation which is a reproduction of Article 2.1.(c) of the ASCM.\n3.4.1.3.\u00a0 Preferential Loans and\nInterest Rates to the OCS industry\n(426)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that the banks are not required to follow the industrial\nguidelines, do not have individual business decisions dictated to them by the\ngovernment, and the banking sector is not predominated by the government. This\nclaim cannot be accepted. Articles 24 and 25 of the Order No 35 limit the\nprovision of loans only to those companies which comply with national\ndevelopment policies for the iron and steel industry, therefore the claim of\nthe GOC are not required to follow the industrial policies is in contradiction\nto this evidence. Clearly, these provisions restrict which companies the banks\ncan finance and which not. Also the claim that the banking sector is not\ndominated by the Government must be disregarded. In this respect it is noted\nthat the GOC provided only very limited information on the ownership structure\nin the banking sector, claiming it does not possess such information, although\naccording to Article 24 of the Commercial Banking Law all banks are obliged to\nreport such information to the China Banking Regulatory Commission, a state\nagency authorised by the State Council. The other information on the files\ncited in this regulation led to the conclusion that the banking sector in China\nis indeed dominated by the government (see recitals (166)-(169) above). In\naddition to the sources referred to in this regulation, the IMF Country Report\nNo 11/321 on China from November 2011 states that the state is also directly\nand indirectly involved in the financial sector and recommends the\nre-orientation in the role and responsibilities of the government in the\nfinancial sector away from using the banking system to carry out broad\ngovernment policy goals and to allow lending decisions to be based on\ncommercial goals[98] [99].\n(427)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that its\nfailure to comply with the demands of Appendix A to the GOC questionnaire could\nnot trigger a valid resort to facts available, because the Commission should\nnot have held the GOC responsible to provide internal, sensitive,\ntransaction-specific data concerning banks many of which were not in any way\nowned by the government. As explained in the recital (426) above the GOC had\naccess at least to some of the requested information but refused to provide any\nanswers to questions in Appendix A. In this respect it is also noted that since\nthe GOC refused to provide any ownership data the Commission, in the case of\nmany banks, did not know which banks are and which are not state-owned.\n(428)\u00a0\u00a0 In relation to certain\nCirculars of the PBOC the GOC claims that the publicly available summaries of\nthe contents of the relevant circulars together with the testimonies of the\nPBOC officials are sufficient to replace the actual Circulars of the PBOC and\nno facts available should be applied due to the GOC's failure to provide these.\nThe GOC also claimed that the Commission has rejected information provided in\ngood faith, i.e. the testimony of the PBOC official combined with the abstract\nof the circulars at issue and referred to the Article 28 of the Basic\nRegulation which says that only the information which is false or misleading\nmay be disregarded. In addition GOC claimed that the Commission did not base\nits findings on actual facts available or the the information provided, but\nrather made it incumbent upon the GOC to prove that the state of affairs\nexamined during the Coated Fine Paper case was no longer current. In this case,\naccording to the GOC, the Coated Fine Paper findings do not even contradict the\ninformation provided by the GOC, since these were based on information pertaining\nto a different time period altogether.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nConcerning the extracts provided from the PBOC and website and the testimony of\nthe PBOC official, these could not have been verified without the source\ndocuments, i.e. the Circulars themselves. The Commission fails to understand\nwhy on the one hand the GOC considers these to be confidential internal\ndocumentation and on the other the summary of the contents is allegedly\npublished on the website of PBOC. The Coated Fine Paper findings are highly\nrelevant to the present case. The fact that the information pertained to a\ndifferent time period is of limited relevance, as the facts on the record\n(including the complaint) demonstrate that the practices in question have not\nchanged since then. As regards GOC\u2019s allegation that the Commission is\nreversing the burden of proof, it is noted that the Coated Fine Paper findings\nare part of the totality of the evidence taken into account but that the GOC is\nnot required to \u201cdisprove\u201d them. Co-operation in such investigations is two-way\nprocess and all parties may offer evidence or arguments to rebut other evidence\non the record.\n(429)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC argues that the\nCommission has not found that the GOC benchmark rates reflect a non-commercial\ndistortion (thereby conceding that the Chinese market interest rates generally\nreflect adequate remuneration) and that the fact that there is only a lower\nlimit on the interest rates for commercial loans works to the detriment of the\nexporting producers making use of such loans rather than benefit. Without the\nPBOC-imposed floor, those rates may well have been considerably lower. This\nargument is misplaced. The fact that the GOC (PBOC) sets the benchmark rates\narbitrarily points to non-commercial behaviour at the first place. This is also\nconfirmed by the IMF Country Report No 11/321[100] on China\nfrom November 2011 which refers to interest regulation.\n(430)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission failed to assess the creditworthiness of the actual parties\ninvestigated as it did in the Coated Fine Paper case. In reply, the\ncreditworthiness of the sampled exporting producers was not assessed as it is\nin any event influenced by the industrial policies and by state support and\nintervention. As it was found that the financial system in China is distorted\nthis would be a pointless exercise. There was no such creditworthiness\nassessment in Coated Fine Paper case.\n(431)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also objects the BB\nrating determination because it alleges to be \"purely punitive\" and\n\"in any event the Commission's reasons for this selection have not been\ndisclosed in a manner capable of scrutiny.\" For the GOC, if the Commission\nfinds that the Chinese benchmark plus the BB risk premium would be that rate,\nthen it must explain its reasoning in that regard and on a producer and loan\nspecific basis. This claim had to be rejected. Given the distortions and the\nlack of proper creditworthiness or risk assessment of the OCS producers by the lending\nbanks the Commission could not have taken the credit rating (if they had any at\nall) of the individual exporting producers at its face value. The BB rating is\nin this case not unfavourable for the exporting producers because it is the\nbest non-investment rating on the market.\n3.4.1.4.\u00a0 Provision of LURs for less\nthan adequate remuneration\n(432)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission recognised that the GOC's claims that the LURs are provided with\nreference to competition are such that they would obviate the need for an\nexternal benchmark. GOC also claimed that throughout its explanation of why the\nGOC claims were rejected the Commission focuses solely on the GOC evidence\nrather than the facts actually available. The GOC requests that the Commission\ndisclose the actual factual basis it has determined that the prices set by the\nlocal authorities were arbitrary, i.e. that they did not refer or relate to the\nsupply and demand for industrial land.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe GOC's understanding of this issue is not correct. The Commission did not find\nthat that the LURs are provided with reference to competition. The Commission found\nthat out of the 13 LUR transactions only 6 were to be subject to bidding\nor auction process. With regard to these 6 the evidence submitted in this\nrespect showed that the tenders were not competitive as there was only one\noffer/bid and the price was set by the authorities. The Commission did not\nunderstand the GOC's requests for the facts available used in respect to the\nlack of a market for LUR to be disclosed when no facts available were used to\nreject GOC claims in this matter and the analysis was done on the basis of\ninformation submitted by the GOC and exporting producers in this respect. The\nfactual basis for the determination that the prices are arbitrarily set is\nreferred to in recitals (114) - (116) above, i.e. information on actual\ntransactions submitted by the sampled exporting producers, Urban Land\nEvaluation System and Order No 35.\n(433)\u00a0\u00a0 According to the GOC the\nCommission did not determine specificity under Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the\nASCM, nor did it clearly substantiate its determinations of specificity on the\nbasis of positive evidence, as required by Article 2.4 of the ASCM . In\naddition, it did not substantiate the need to base the benefit amount on an\nout-of-country benchmark nor did it construct the benchmark selected in the\nmanner consistent with Article 14 (d) of the ASCM. These claims had to be\nrejected. The basis for Commission's specificity findings is the fact that all\ncompanies which do not comply with industrial policies set by the state are\nexcluded from the provision of LUR, prices are often arbitrarily set by the authorities\nand government practices are unclear and non-transparent The need for the\nout-of-country benchmark was explained and justified in paragraphs (109), (118)\nand (120)-(121) above. As it was found that the LUR market in China is\ndistorted it was not possible to apply in-country benchmark as proposed by the\nGOC. The Commission does not agree with the claim that the benchmark was\nconstructed in a manner inconsistent with Article 14(d) of the ASCM. The Taiwan\nbenchmark is considered a best proxy available to the Commission and is\nconsistent with the recommendations of the AB in DS 379.\n(434)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claims that it\nsuggested that any possible benchmark should be in-country and be based on the\nprices that \"not favoured\" Chinese industries were paying; according\nto GOC, this is precisely because there is no distinction in the first place,\nand that therefore the subsidy amount would rightly be zero. The\nCommission does not agree with this claim and in any event the GOC did not\nprovide any information for the \"non-favoured\" industries LUR prices\nwhich could, in theory, be used for the benchmark construction.\n(435)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC also claims that the\ncomplainant provided no indication or evidence that LURs were granted in\nparticular to any subset of limited enterprises and the EU has not made the\ncrucial finding that the provision of LURs is explicitly limited to\ncertain/encouraged enterprises. The Commission has made the finding that\nthe provision of LUR is limited to companies which comply with the industrial\npolicies set by the GOC in the Order No 35 of the NDRC (recital (116) above).\n(436)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that the Commission did not perform a rigorous examination in order\nto find a benchmark that refers or relates to the situation in China and that\nthe Commission did not do its best to identify a benchmark that approximates\nthe market conditions that would prevail in the absence of the distortion, or\nif it did it has not explained how this is so. This claim had to be rejected. The\nCommission indeed looked in detail in the various indicators and compared Taiwan\nand PRC as a whole as well as individual Chinese provinces concerned. After\nsuch analyses the Commission considers Taiwan[101] as an\nappropriate benchmark because of the totality of the information on the file i.e. (i) the level of economic development and economic structure\nprevailing in Taiwan and the relevant Chinese provinces and city[102] where the co-operating exporting producers are established, (ii)\nthe physical proximity of these two Chinese provinces with Taiwan, (iii) the\nhigh degree of infrastructure that both Taiwan and these two Chinese provinces\nhave, (iv) the strong economic ties and cross border trade between Taiwan and\nthe PRC, (v) the similar density of population in the Chinese provinces\nconcerned and in Taiwan, (vi) the similarity between the type of land and\ntransactions used for constructing the relevant benchmark in Taiwan with those\nin the PRC and (vii) the common demographic, linguistic and cultural\ncharacteristics in both Taiwan and the PRC. Furthermore, Jiangsu and Zhejiang\nprovinces together with Chongqing City are considered top manufacturing\nprovinces in the PRC. Although the GDP per capita of Taiwan and the Chinese\nprovinces and Chongqing City is not identical, the GDP of these Chinese\nprovinces and Chongqing City has grown rapidly in recent years i.e. they are\ncatching up with Taiwan.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIn addition, recent data suggest that the both PRC as a whole, the two\nprovinces and Chongqing City have much higher GDP growth rate than Taiwan[103], i.e. they are catching up very fast. However, it is important to\nnote that the exact comparison made between the GDP of a non-market economy\n(the PRC) and the GDP of a well-established market economy (Taiwan) is not a\ndecisive fact because it is normal for a non-market economy to lag behind a\nfunctioning market economy in terms of GDP. In addition, many other factors\ne.g. planning rules, environmental policy may affect the supply and demand of\nindustrial land. The real issue is what would be the \u2018prevailing market conditions\u2019\nwith regard to LUR in the PRC if it was a functioning market economy and on the\nbasis of all evidence they would be very similar to those of Taiwan.\n(437)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC also claims that the\nCommission in its calculation used depreciation period of 50 years while not\nall of the relevant land use right contracts were based on the 50 years terms.\nThis was not correct. All the LUR, the provision of which was countervailed\nin this investigation, were based on the 50 years terms.\n3.4.1.5.\u00a0 Programme consisting of\nprovision of electricity for less than adequate remuneration\n(438)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC claimed that the\nconclusion concerning specificity is \"wholly artificial\" on the\ngrounds that the range of economic activity paying the non-penalised rate\nencompasses the vast majority of the Chinese economy. The GOC also questioned\nthe Commission's finding on \u2018regional\u2019 specificity and in particular the\nconclusion that this subsidy is only available in the geographical areas where\nthe exporting producer is located. According to the GOC the penalty applies\nacross the board in all geographical areas in which all exporting producers are\nlocated and therefore there is no regional specificity. This claims had to be\nrejected. The Commission notes that the GOC seems to base its comments\nexclusively on the differential pricing system for the categories of\n\u2018encouraged\u2019, \u2018restricted\u2019, \u2018prohibited\u2019, and \u2018allowed\u2019 enterprises according\nto decision No. 40. However, the Commission based its findings on the special\nelectricity pricing system available in the broader Chongqing municipality area\nwhere one of the sampled cooperating exporters has a production plant. This\nexporter benefits from a lower electricity rate specifically applying only to a\nsub-set of companies belonging to certain sectors (namely ferroalloy electronic\nfurnace and fertilizer companies) within the same category of large industrial\nusers. Therefore, the Commission has concluded that the lower electricity rate\nonly applying to this very restricted sub-set of companies belonging only to\nthose specific eligible sectors is de jure specific.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nWith regard to \u2018regional\u2019 specificity, recital (149) does not refer to any\npenalty system as the GOC indicates in its comments. This paragraph clarifies\nthat this beneficial electricity rate applying to the restricted sub-set of\ncompanies including the producer of the product concerned is limited to a\ndesignated geographical area (i.e. the broader Chongqing municipality) which is\npart of the China\u2019s Vast Western Region encouraged according to the law referred\nto in the same recital and further explained in recital (233) above. As further\nstated in recital (149), this legislation refers to electricity pricing as one\nof the tools to achieve the main policy objective to foster the development of\nthis region. The Commission finding that this subsidy is also regionally\nspecific is hereby confirmed.\n(439)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC questioned the\nconclusions in recital (146) above concerning specificity on the basis of the\ndifferential pricing system between the categories of \u2018encouraged\u2019,\n\u2018restricted\u2019, \u2018prohibited\u2019, and \u2018allowed\u2019 enterprises. The GOC explains again\nthat the difference in electricity price paid between the specifically\ndiscouraged project and everyone else operates as a penalty, or surcharge, to\ndiscourage specific projects rather than a \"discount\" paid to\nencouraged projects. The GOC concludes that the Commission must make a finding\nof what remuneration would be considered adequate and in this case the\nCommission has assumed that the penalty price would be adequate remuneration.\nThis claim had to be rejected. As explained at length above, the Commission\u2019s\nfinding of financial contribution refers to the lower electricity rate that\nthis company is entitled to as part of the restricted sub-set of companies\nwithin the larger industrial user category. The GOC arguments are therefore not\nrelevant with respect to the findings by the Commission.\n3.4.1.6.\u00a0 Other income and tax\nprogrammes not used by the sampled producers countervailed for the purposes of\nthe \"residual rate\"\n(440)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC argued that the\nCommission had not applied consistently the relevant WTO rules concerning\nsampling contained in the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement (i.e. Articles 6.10, 9.2\nand 9.3), because the purpose of sampling would be to limit the scope of the investigation.\nThis argument was linked to Article 19.4 WTO ASCM, which limits the amount of\ncountervailing duty to the amount of subsidy \"found to exist\". The\nGOC concluded that if the Commission did not consider the extent of\nsubsidisation sufficiently captured by the sample selected, the solution would\nhave been to sample more companies. In the first place, the Commission\nnotes that the analogy between sampling in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy\ninvestigations has certain limits, because unlike anti-dumping investigations\nin CVD investigations there is no general rule that each exporter receives an\nindividual duty and so-called 'aggregate' cases are explicitly permitted.\nMoreover, unlike in anti-dumping cases, the government is a required\nparticipant and respondent in a CVD case and the government is therefore\nimplicitly included in the scope of any \"sample\" for the purposes of\na CVD determination. In other words, the government' actions as the grantor of\nthe alleged subsidisation, always fall under the scope of the CVD\ninvestigation, regardless of the use of a sample of exporting producers.\n(441)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the GOC comment\nthat the recourse is to \"sample more companies\", the Commission notes\nthat this is exactly what it did in this case. Further to the withdrawal of\ncooperation by one of the exporters that had originally agreed to cooperate,\nthe Commission decided to include another exporter in the sample. However,\nshortly after this company was informed of its inclusion in the sample, it\nnotified to the Commission that it no longer intended to cooperate in the\ninvestigation. The Commission was consequently forced to limit the sample to\nthe two remaining exporters originally sampled that had not withdrawn\ncooperation in order to avoid any further delay that would put in jeopardy the\nexpeditious completion of the investigation within the prescribed legal\ndeadlines. The Commission notes that this unsuccessful attempt undermined\nsolely by the exporters' behaviour shows precisely that this GOC claim is\nwithout merit in that does not address the problem of companies which do not\ncome forward for sampling in the first place or which withdraw if selected for\nsampling.\n(442)\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to the\napplication of facts available, the GOC referred to Article 12.7 ASCM and\nquoted WTO jurisprudence holding that facts on the record can only be used to\nreplace missing information, and that non-cooperation does not justify\ndeterminations devoid of factual foundations. The Commission does not\nunderstand the logic of this claim, given that in its determination it has used\nthe facts on the record as allowed under the WTO provision and the basic\nRegulation in full compliance with the relevant WTO jurisprudence. As the GOC\nhas also recognised, the findings in Coated Fine Paper and in the various\nUS DOC decisions constitute the best facts available to the Commission\nand are used precisely to replace the information gaps caused by the GOC lack\nof cooperation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe GOC also questioned the use of these facts as they would not reflect a\npresent subsidization and are also not specifically linked to the product\nconcerned. The Commission notes in this respect that most of these subsidy\nprogrammes concern non-recurring subsidies (e.g. grants, tax advantages linked\nto investment in assets) which are normally amortised over several years and\ntherefore their benefits continue well in the future and thus even beyond the\nIP in this case. Where recurring subsidies are involved, there is no evidence\nthat these programmes have changed since the investigation in question. As for\nthe link between these programmes and the product concerned, the Commission\nrecalls that all of these programmes cover the steel sector (they are not\nproduct-specific), or apply in the region where the OCS exporters have located\ntheir factories. In the absence of evidence to the contrary in the file, the\nCommission has decided that it is reasonable to conclude that the benefits of\nthese programmes still reflect the best proxy for present subsidization for\nproducers of the product concerned. It is stressed that the GOC had ample\nopportunity to submit evidence to the contrary on all these programmes but it\ndeliberately decided not to submit it and as a result the Commission has to\nresort to the facts available on record as prescribed by the basic Regulation\nand the WTO ASCM.\n3.4.1.7.\u00a0 Equity programmes\n(443)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that all\nthese programmes (unpaid dividends, debt-for equity swaps and equity infusions)\nwere not initiated in accordance with requirements with Articles 11.2 and 11.3\nof the ASCM.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThis claim had to be refused. As already explained in the section concerning\nthe reply to the GOC's comments on initiation (recitals (399) - (406) above)\nthe Commission services have analysed the evidence submitted by the\ncomplainant, which was substantial, as it appears clearly from the version open\nfor inspection by interested parties of the complaint. The Commission services\nonly proposed the initiation of an investigation on specific schemes after\nhaving duly analysed the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence which they\nconsider sufficient on a prima facie basis.\n(444)\u00a0\u00a0 In the view of the GOC the\nequity programmes are unique ad-hoc subsidies, to the extent they exist, in\nthat that they apply only to one particular recipient and not pursuant to any\nparticular legislation and since \"the Commission knows for a fact that the\ncompanies subject to the residual duty not only did not receive, but could not\nhave received given their ad-hoc nature\" these subsidies, they should not\nbe countervailed. In addition the GOC claimed that to the extent that facts\navailable determinations are made, they must be based on actual facts. For this\nreason the countervailing of ad hoc subsidies to companies other than those\nactually alleged to have received them is a violation of Article 12.7 of the\nASCM.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIt is noted that the GOC did not reply to a single question in the\nquestionnaire or in the deficiency letter concerning these schemes. Therefore\nthe statement of the GOC that \"the Commission knows for a fact that the companies\nsubject to the residual duty not only did not receive, but could not have\nreceived given their ad-hoc nature\" these subsidies, does not represent\nreality. To the contrary, the complaint listed several companies benefiting\nfrom these equity schemes and did not allege this list to be exhaustive. Since\nthe GOC did not provide any information on the nature or eligibility of these\nschemes the Commission has no other option but to apply facts available.\n3.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of Zhejiang Huadong\n\n3.4.2.1.\u00a0 Provision of LURs for less\nthan adequate remuneration\n(445)\u00a0\u00a0 Zhejiang Huadong claimed\nthat it provided the Commission with all relevant legislations governing the\nmechanics and value-setting of sales of LURs in China and referred to the Provisions\non the Assignment of State-Owned Construction LUR through bid invitation,\nauction and quotation to demonstrate that there is a well-functioning real\nestate market in China, where quotes and prices paid are made public. It\nfurther claimed that the real estate market that exists today in China, and the\nexhaustive official statistics on LUR prices available, form the best evidence\nfor assessing the price of the LURs at the time this exporting producer bought\nthem.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThis claim had to be rejected. The Commission explains the findings in respect\nto Zhejiang Huadong's LURs in recital (115) above. These findings were not\ndisputed in its comments to definitive disclosure. Evidence at hand shows that\nthe LUR market in China is distorted as the tenders investigated on-the-spot by\nthe Commission were not competitive and the prices were arbitrarily set by the\nauthorities. The factual basis for the determination that the prices are\narbitrarily set is referred to in recitals (114) - (116) above, i.e.\ninformation on actual transactions submitted by the sampled exporting\nproducers, Urban Land Evaluation System and Order of the NDRC No 35.\n(446)\u00a0\u00a0 Zhejiang Huadong claimed\nthat according to Article 14(d) of the WTO SCM Agreement adequate benchmark prices\nshould relate or refer to prevailing market conditions in the country of\nprovision in the first instance or in the absence of such conditions, any\nout-of-country benchmark should be adjusted appropriately so as to avoid the\ncountervailing of comparative advantages. It further claimed that on the basis\nof paragraph 15(b) of the China \u2013 WTO Accession Protocol, when prevailing terms\nand conditions in China are not available as appropriate benchmarks, the\nimporting WTO Member should adjust such prevailing terms and conditions, where\npracticable, before considering the use of terms and conditions prevailing\noutside China. Whilst the Commission agrees with much of the legal theory\nbehind this claim, it also concluded that there is no functioning market for\nland in China and for this reason external benchmark for land prices was used.\nThe need for an out-of-country benchmark was explained and justified in\nrecitals (109), (118) and (120)-(121) above. As it was found that the LUR\nmarket in China is distorted it was not possible to apply an in-country benchmark\nas suggested by the Zhejiang Huadong and there is no basis on which to adjust\nsuch an benchmark. In addition, from the information submitted in relation to\nthe benchmark suggested by the Zhejiang Huadong (Xiaoshan of Zhejiang Province)\nit is unclear and not verifiable whether the price information suggested is\nlimited to allegedly \"non-favoured\" industries' LUR prices.\n(447)\u00a0\u00a0 Zhejiang Huadong claimed\nthat the choice of Taiwan as a benchmark is not reasonable and objective for\nthe following reasons: 1) Zhejiang Province was not a developed-high GDP region\nsimilar to Taiwan at the time the LURs were bought; 2) the Commission's\nselection of actual land prices in Taiwan was based on offers for sale of\nindustrial land and not on the basis of actual prices for leasehold for\nindustrial use which is similar to LUR assigned to Zhejiang Huadong.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThis claim has to be rejected. With regard to 1) as stated above in recital (436)\nthe Commission looked in detail in the various indicators and compared Taiwan\nand the PRC as a whole as well as individual Chinese provinces concerned. After\nsuch analyses the Commission considers Taiwan as an appropriate benchmark consistent\nwith the basic Regulation and the WTO rules. With regard to 2) it is noted that\nthe Commission had used the best information which was reasonably available to\nit.\n(448)\u00a0\u00a0 Zhejiang Huadong pointed to\nan arithmetical mistake in the calculation of the inflation rates used in the\nadjustment for inflation of the benchmark. The Commission took this claim into\naccount and revised the calculation concerned.\n(449)\u00a0\u00a0 Zhejiang Huadong claimed\nthat there is no specificity in its acquisition of LURs\nsince all companies in China are treated the same way under the legislation. Zhejiang\nHuadong claimed also that the Commission did not adequately address the\nspecificity issue and that there was no reasoning in the definitive\ndisclosure regarding the grounds on which the price paid by Zhejiang Huadong\nresults in a benefit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThis claim had to be rejected. The basis for the Commission's specificity\nfindings is the fact that all companies which do not comply with industrial\npolicies set by the state are excluded from the provision of LUR, prices are\noften arbitrarily set by the authorities and government practices are unclear\nand non-transparent The Commission has made the finding that the provision of\nLUR is limited to companies which comply with the industrial policies set by\nthe GOC in the Order No 35 of the NDRC (recital (116) above).\n3.4.2.2.\u00a0 Provision of CRS for less\nthan adequate remuneration\n(450)\u00a0\u00a0 Zhejiang Huadong claimed\nthat for the sake of reasonability and objectiveness and for reasons of\nconsistency the Commission should have retrieved steel price data from the same\ndata source (i.e. Steel Business Bulletin (SBB) for all the regions represented\nin the benchmark basket when constructing the benchmark. It claimed also that\nSBB provides a variety of markets for CRS prices other than those selected by\nthe Commission and suggested to add Mexico and Argentina as these countries\nrepresent the emerging market of steel in the American continent. This claim had\nto be rejected as in its construction of the benchmark the Commission used\nprice data that reflect the actual market situation in each country or region\nas accurately as possible. As for the prices of Europe (the majority of which\nare EU countries) the Commission considered that it had more detailed pricing\ndata available from MEPS. If it had possessed MEPS data for the other countries\nselected, it would have used them. Concerning the inclusion of prices in Mexico\nand Argentina, it is noted that these are relatively small markets in\ncomparison with China as well as with the other countries/regions in the\nbenchmark basket used by the Commission.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe Commission revised its subsidy margin calculation for this scheme following\na correction to the constructed benchmark prices for HRS and CRS. The\ncorrection concerned the steel prices for Brazil used in the benchmark\nconstruction which erroneously included taxes in the calculations disclosed to\nparties.\n(451)\u00a0\u00a0 Zhejiang Huadong also\nclaimed that the Commission's conclusion on\nspecificity is unsubstantiated (no positive evidence) and unfounded, hence the alleged subsidy by provision of CRS for LTAR is not\ncountervailable. Zhejiang Huadong submitted that the benefit, if exists, of\nprovision of HRS and CRS for LTAR is not limited to certain enterprises or\nsectors, but universally conferred to all potential buyers and consumers from\nall economic sectors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThis claim had to be rejected. GOC made the same\ncomment and the Commission addresses it in recital (415) above. The\n\"potential\" buyers are by definition limited to certain enterprises.\n3.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of the complainant\n3.4.3.1.\u00a0 Provision of water and\nelectricity for less than adequate remuneration\n(452)\u00a0\u00a0 Complainant claimed that,\nbecause of the distortions and state influence in the Chinese water and\nelectricity markets, the Commission should have used international benchmarks\nand calculate the benefits for these schemes in accordance with Article\n6(d)(ii) of the basic Regulation. \nThis claim had to be rejected. In this particular case, the evidence on the\nrecord did not enable the Commission to find that water and electricity\nmarkets are distorted to an extent which would justify recourse to an\nout-of-country benchmark.\n3.4.3.2.\u00a0 Certain Tax programmes\nconcerning Foreign invested enterprises (FIEs)\n(453)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant claimed that\nthe Commission should have quantified the amount of subsidy for two tax\nprogrammes related to FIEs, i.e. Income tax credit for the purchase of\ndomestically produced equipment and Two free, Three half-tax exemption for the\nproductive FIEs, given the lack of cooperation from the GOC and the fact that\nGOC should have provided evidence that no benefits for these programmes were\ngranted to OCS producers in the IP.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThis claim had to be rejected. As already explained in recitals 282 above, for\nthe purpose of reducing the administrative burden for all the parties concerned\nand taking in consideration the particular situation in relation to the pending\ntermination of these schemes, the Commission has decided not to countervail\nthem.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amount of countervailable\nsubsidies\n(454)\u00a0\u00a0 The amounts of\ncountervailable subsidies in accordance with the provisions of the basic Regulation,\nexpressed ad valorem, for the investigated companies are set out in the table\nbelow:\n Exporting producer || DEFINITIVE SUBSIDY MARGIN \n HUADONG GROUP || 23,8% \n PANHUA GROUP || 29,7% \n UNION STEEL CHINA || 26,8% \n COOPERATING COMPANIES NOT SAMPLED || 26,8% \n ALL OTHER COMPANIES || 44,7% \n(455)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n15(3) of the basic Regulation, the total subsidy margin for the cooperating\ncompanies not included in the sample is calculated on the basis of the total\nweighted average subsidy margin established for the cooperating companies in\nthe sample, i.e. 26,8%.\n(456)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to all other\nexporters in the People's Republic of China, the Commission first established\nthe level of cooperation. The comparison between Eurostat import data and the\nvolume of exports to the Union of the product concerned reported for the\ninvestigation period by the cooperating companies shows that cooperation of\nexporting producers in the People's Republic of China was low, namely 58%.\nGiven this low level of cooperation, the total subsidy rate for all\nnon-cooperating companies is set at the level of the total of the subsidy rates\nas established for all non-cooperating companies for all schemes investigated,\ni.e. 44,7%. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 INJURY\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union production and Union\nindustry\n(457)\u00a0\u00a0 All\navailable information concerning Union producers, including information\nprovided in the complaint, data collected from Union producers before and after\nthe initiation of the investigation, and the verified questionnaire responses\nof the sampled Union producers, was used in order to establish the total Union\nproduction for the period considered.\n(458)\u00a0\u00a0 During the IP, OCS was\nmanufactured by 22 producers in the Union. On the basis referred to in the\nprevious recital, the total Union production was estimated to be around 4 018\n310 tonnes during the IP. The Union producers accounting for the total Union\nproduction constitute the Union industry within the meaning of Article 9(1) of\nthe basic Regulation and will be hereafter referred to as the \u2018Union industry\u2019.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Determination of the\nrelevant Union market\n(459)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nwas found during the investigation that a substantial part of the sampled Union\nproducers' production was destined for captive use, i.e. often simply\ntransferred (without invoice) and/or delivered at transfer prices within the\nsame company or group of companies for further downstream processing.\n(460)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to establish\nwhether or not the Union industry suffered injury and to determine consumption\nand the various economic indicators related to the situation of the Union\nindustry, it was examined whether and to what extent the subsequent use of the\nUnion industry\u2019s production of the like product had to be taken into account in\nthe analysis. \n(461)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to provide as\ncomplete a picture as possible of the situation of the Union industry, data\nhave been obtained and analysed for the entire OCS activity and it was\nsubsequently determined whether the production was destined for captive use or\nfor the free market.\n(462)\u00a0\u00a0 For sales volume and sales\nprices on the Union market and market share, it was found that a meaningful\nanalysis and evaluation of these indicators had to focus on the situation\nprevailing on the free market. \n(463)\u00a0\u00a0 However the other economic\nindicators could only reasonably be examined by referring to the whole\nactivity, thereby including captive use and sales. Production, capacity,\ncapacity utilisation, investments, stocks, employment, productivity, wages and\nability to raise capital depend upon the whole activity, whether the production\nis captive or sold on the free market.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union consumption\n(464)\u00a0\u00a0 The like product is sold by\nthe Union industry to unrelated customers as well as sold/transferred to\nrelated companies for further downstream processing, e.g. in steel service\ncentres.\n(465)\u00a0\u00a0 In calculating the apparent\nUnion consumption of OCS, the institutions added the volume of total imports of\nOCS into the Union as reported by Eurostat and the volume of sales and captive\nuse of the like product in the Union produced by the Union industry as reported\nin the complaint and as verified during the verification visits for the sampled\nUnion producers.\n(466)\u00a0\u00a0 Eurostat import data is\nhowever based on full CN codes, and it is clear that for a part of these CN\ncodes the import is not the product concerned. \n(467)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, the total\nUnion consumption developed as follows: \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Consumption (in tonnes) || 5 197 716 || 3 879 380 || 4 548 528 || 4 811 310 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 75 || 88 || 93 \n(468)\u00a0\u00a0 Total consumption on the EU\nmarket shrunk by 7% over the period considered. Between 2008 and 2009 there was\na decrease of about 25% mainly as a result of the global negative effects of\nthe economic crisis, especially on the construction industry. After that the\nconsumption started to recover and increased in total by 24% from 2009 to the\nIP but it was still below the initial level of 2008.\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from the country\nconcerned and market share\n(469)\u00a0\u00a0 Imports\ninto the Union from the PRC developed as follows during the period considered:\n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Volume of imports from the PRC (tonnes) || 472 988 || 150 497 || 464 582 || 702 452 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 32 || 98 || 149 \n Market share || 9.1% || 3.9% || 10.2% || 14.6% \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 43 || 112 || 160 \nSource: Eurostat\n(470)\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the fall in\nconsumption, the volume of imports from the PRC increased significantly by 49%\nover the period considered. Due to the negative effects of the economic crisis,\nthe volume of imports from the PRC sharply decreased in 2009. However, the\nimports from the PRC started to recover at an extremely fast pace, so that the\nincrease from 2009 to the IP was a staggering 367%.\n(471)\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly, the market share\nheld by those imports increased by 60% over the period considered. Although it\ndropped from 2008 to 2009 by more than half, it showed an impressive increasing\ntrend from 2009 to the IP and rose by 275%.\n4.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prices of imports and price\nundercutting\n Imports from the PRC || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Average price in EUR/tonne || 875 || 728 || 768 || 801 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 83 || 88 || 91 \nSource: Eurostat\n(472)\u00a0\u00a0 The average import price\nfrom the PRC decreased by 9% during the period considered. Between 2008 and\n2009, it decreased significantly by 17%, then it increased by five percentage\npoints between 2009 and 2010 and by further three percentage points in the IP. \n(473)\u00a0\u00a0 The import prices from the\nPRC consistently remained below the sales prices of the Union industry during\nthe whole period considered. As highlighted in the table above, while in 2009\nduring the height of the economic crisis, even the price cut of 17% could not\nhelp the Chinese imports to keep the market share in a situation of suddenly\nshrinking consumption and significant market slowdown, continuous undercutting\nin the subsequent years explains the steady impressive increase in the market\nshare held by the imports from the PRC between 2009 and the IP. \n(474)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to determine price\nundercutting during the IP, the weighted average sales prices per product type\nof the sampled Union producers charged to unrelated customers on the Union\nmarket, adjusted to an ex-works level, were compared to the corresponding\nweighted average prices per product type of the imports from the cooperating\nChinese producers to the first independent customer on the Union market,\nestablished on a CIF basis, with appropriate adjustments for post-importation\ncosts.\n(475)\u00a0\u00a0 The post importation costs\nreferred to in the recital above were calculated based on verified data from\ntwo unrelated importers of the product concerned.\n(476)\u00a0\u00a0 The price comparison was\nmade on a type-by-type basis for transactions at the same level of trade, duly\nadjusted where necessary, and after deduction of rebates and discounts.

After an\ninitial increase in market share in 2009, the Union industry saw its share\ndecrease in 2010 and the IP with the result that its share of the market was 5\npercentage points less in the IP than in 2009. This occurred against the\nbackground of an increase of more than 24% in consumption from 2009 to the end\nof the IP.

Captive use was reported\nby companies where the downstream production was taking place in the same legal\nentity, however, captive sales were the sales to other related legal entities\nwith an invoice. Furthermore, the pricing method in both captive use and sales\nto related parties was similar, i.e. a fair value (\"cost plus\"\nmethod) of the product was charged to both the related companies as well as to\ninternal downstream production units of the sampled companies.\n(494)\u00a0\u00a0 The average value per tonne\nremained stable during the period considered and was 3% lower than the sales\nprice to unrelated customers in the IP of the sampled Union producers.

The internal demand of the downstream\nproduction depended on the chance to sell the downstream products on the free\nmarket which was not affected by subsidised imports of OCS. Thus, it can be\nconcluded that the shrinking volumes and market share during the period\nconsidered were due to competition from subsidised imports from the PRC.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Data relating to the\nsampled Union producers \n5.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Average unit sales prices in\nthe Union and cost of production \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Unit price in EU to unrelated customers (EUR/tonne) || 1 023 || 805 || 911 || 994 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 79 || 89 || 97 \n Unit cost of production (EUR/tonne) || 925 || 884 || 893 || 978 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 95 || 97 || 106 \nSource: Verified\nquestionnaire replies of the sampled producers\n(496)\u00a0\u00a0 The average sales prices of\nthe sampled Union producers to unrelated customers in the EU decreased by 3%\nover the period considered.

At the same time, the Union industry sales volume\ndecreased overall by 12% and its market share dropped from 56.8% in 2008 to\n53.9% in the IP. Although consumption recovered by 24%, from 2009 to the IP,\nafter the year of economic crisis affecting demand, the Union industry market\nshare was decreasing.

Known factors other than\nthe subsidised imports, which could at the same time have injured the Union\nindustry, were examined to ensure that any injury caused by those other factors\nwas not attributed to the subsidised imports.\n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of the subsidised\nimports\n(512)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat the Union consumption decreased by 7% over the period considered, while\nthe volume of subsidised imports from the PRC increased by about 49%, their\nmarket share also increased by 60% from 9.1% in 2008 to 14.6% in the IP. At the\nsame time, the sales volume of the Union industry to unrelated parties\ndecreased by 12% and market share of those sales dropped by 2.9% from 56.8% in\n2008 to 53.9% in the IP.\n(513)\u00a0\u00a0 While the imports from the\nPRC were also affected by the economic crisis and dropped by 68% from 2008 to\n2009, they recovered from 2009 to the IP at a very fast pace increasing by 367%\nat the end of the IP, even though Union consumption only increased by 24%\nduring this period. By lowering the unit price by 9% compared to 2008 and\nundercutting the Union industry by up to 20.2% during the IP, Chinese imports\nincreased their market share from 2008 to the IP by 60% up to 14.6%.\n(514)\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time, from 2008\nto the IP the Union producers' sales volumes to unrelated parties overall\ndropped by 12%. At the time of market recovery, from 2009 to the IP, the Union\nindustry could raise their sales volumes to unrelated parties by only 13% but\nlost a market share of 8% thus benefiting to a limited extent from the\nincreased consumption. Chinese imports benefited most from the recovering\nconsumption leaving other market players far behind.\n(515)\u00a0\u00a0 The average import prices\nfrom the PRC dropped by 9% over the period considered. Although on a rising\ntrend after the sharp drop in 2009, from 2009 to the IP, they\nremained constantly below the levels charged by the Union industry. The unit\nprice to unrelated customers in the EU decreased by only 3%, showing some\nresistance to price pressure exerted by the Chinese imports. However, these\nprices were obviously sustained at a cost of lower sales volumes and decreased\nprofitability on those sales as profitability dropped by 61% from 6.7% in 2008\nto 2.6% in the IP.\n(516)\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the above, it is\nconcluded that the surge of subsidised imports from the PRC at prices\nconstantly undercutting those of the Union industry have had a determining role\nin the material injury suffered by the Union industry, which has prevented the\nUnion industry to fully benefit from the recovering Union consumption. \n6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect\nof other factors\n6.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from third countries\n Country ||   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n South Korea || Volume (tonnes) || 228 123 || 226 568 || 173 935 || 237 164 \n   || Index (2008=100) || 100 || 99 || 76 || 104 \n   || Market share (%) || 4.4% || 5.8% || 3.8% || 4.9% \n   || Index (2008=100) || 100 || 133 || 87 || 112 \n   || Av. price || 901 || 727 || 846 || 903 \n   || Index (2008=100) || 100 || 81 || 94 || 100 \n India || Volume (tonnes) || 159 999 || 149 138 || 155 384 || 141 391 \n   || Index (2008=100) || 100 || 93 || 97 || 88 \n   || Market share (%) || 3.1% || 3.8% || 3.4% || 2.9% \n   || Index (2008=100) || 100 || 125 || 111 || 95 \n   || Av. price || 932 || 667 || 773 || 824 \n   || Index (2008=100) || 100 || 72 || 83 || 88 \n Other countries || Volume (tonnes) || 249 151 || 158 461 || 124 319 || 167 007 \n   || Index (2008=100) || 100 || 64 || 50 || 67 \n   || Market share (%) || 4.8% || 4.1% || 2.7% || 3.5% \n   || Index (2008=100) || 100 || 85 || 57 || 72 \n   || Av. price || 951 || 809 || 924 || 955 \n   || Index (2008=100) || 100 || 85 || 97 || 100 \n Total of all third countries except the PRC || Volume (tonnes) || 637 274 || 534 167 || 453 637 || 545 562 \n   || Index (2008=100) || 100 || 84 || 71 || 86 \n   || Market share (%) || 12.3% || 13.8% || 10.0% || 11.3% \n   || Index (2008=100) || 100 || 112 || 81 || 92 \n   || Av. price || 929 || 735 || 842 || 898 \n   || Index (2008=100) || 100 || 79 || 91 || 97 \nSource: Eurostat\n(517)\u00a0\u00a0 While imports from the PRC\nconstituted 56% of all imports in the EU during the IP, other important sources\nof imports were from the Republic of India ('India') (11%) and South Korea\n(19%). Unlike imports from the PRC, imports from India, although their average\nprice dropped sharply by 12%, overall decreased by 12% over the period\nconsidered and lost market share by 5%. Imports from South Korea increased by\nonly 4% with the average price remaining on the same level as in 2008.

Firstly, is the\nCommission received no evidence that the imports from other sources were\nunfairly traded. Secondly, in contrast to the Chinese imports, the overall\nprice level from main sources of other imports was more stable over the whole\nperiod considered, and thus shows that the Union industry can successfully\ncompete in the market segments with those imports. Thirdly, the imports from\nother countries have generally declined over the period considered and still\nremain at a low level, both overall and for main exporting countries\nindividually. Moreover, the dropping market share of other imports confirms\nthat those imports could not have caused injury to the Union industry. \n6.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export performance of the\nUnion industry\n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Exports, Eurostat (tonnes) || 669 790 || 612 204 || 580 477 || 605 760 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 91 || 87 || 90 \n Average price (EUR/tonne) || 1 068 || 937 || 995 || 1 092 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 88 || 93 || 102 \n Exports by sampled Union producers || 53 542 || 46 516 || 48 102 || 46 228 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 87 || 90 || 86 \n Average selling price (EUR/tonne) || 1 086 || 826 || 984 || 1 132 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 76 || 91 || 104 \nSource: Eurostat and verified\nquestionnaire replies\n(520)\u00a0\u00a0 The total exports of OCS by\nthe Union industry to third countries according to Eurostat decreased by 10%\nover the period considered. However, the average price has been relatively high\nand increased by 2% over the period considered. Exports represented 15% of the\ntotal EU production and as such helped the Union industry to achieve economies\nof scales and reduce overall costs of production. Hence, it can be concluded\nthat the export activity of the Union industry could not be a potential cause\nof the material injury. \n(521)\u00a0\u00a0 This general picture is\nmirrored by the situation in exports to unrelated customers in third countries\nby the sampled Union producers. They decreased by 14% over the period\nconsidered, however, the export price per unit has been constantly higher (on\naverage by 2 to 14% depending on year) than the price in the EU. \n6.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from the PRC by the\ncomplainants\n(522)\u00a0\u00a0 During the investigation and\nfollowing the final disclosure, it was claimed that the complainants (through\ntheir related companies) were engaged in importing the product concerned from\nthe PRC themselves and that those imports allegedly constituted 20 to 40% of\nthe total imports from the PRC. However, no evidence was provided to support\nthis allegation. Having investigated these allegations, by examining the\nverified data from the sampled Union producers, it was found that they imported\nonly about 10 000 tonnes during the IP, which was largely in line with the data\nin the complaint. About a similar volume, not disclosed in accordance with\nArticle 29 of the basic Regulation, was found to be imported by related\ncompanies of the sampled Union producers. These imports together accounted for\nonly about 2-3% of total imports from the PRC. Consequently, it cannot be\nconcluded that the complainants were importing from the PRC in such quantities\nand in such a pattern as to put in question their own status as Union producers\naccording to Article 9(1)(a) of the basic Regulation, or to cause injury to\nthemselves. Therefore, the argument is rejected.\n6.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Captive use and captive\nsales\n(523)\u00a0\u00a0 It has been alleged by some\ninterested parties that the injury to the Union industry was caused from its\nengagement in the downstream business of producing construction materials (e.g.\nsandwich panels, trapezoidal sheets etc.) either directly or through related\ncompanies within the groups. Specifically, it was claimed that the Union\nindustry made OCS available to its own downstream business at lower prices than\nto unrelated companies, thus \"subsidising\" them within the group and\nenabling them to undercut their competitors in the downstream segment.\n(524)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nshown above, the average value of captive use and captive sales per tonne was\nonly 3% lower than the sales price to unrelated customers in the IP. The\ninvestigation showed that the captive use and captive sales were most likely\nthemselves indirectly affected by the unfair competition from subsidised\nimports. Should there have been any advantage for the downstream\nbusiness as alleged, it would have been reflected in the comparison between\ncaptive sales prices and unrelated sales prices. Therefore, this argument is\nrejected.\n(525)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure CISA again claimed that the Union industry was making OCS available\nto its related downstream businesses at a \"subsidised\" price, thereby\nundercutting their competitors in the downstream segment. However, no evidence\nwas provided to change the Commission's conclusion in recital (524), i.e. that\nthe price difference between related and unrelated sales was small (2%) and\nthat this was not a case of self-inflicted injury.\n(526)\u00a0\u00a0 CISA also challenged the\ndata on the cost of production of OCS and, in extension, the price of OCS to\nrelated parties. Given the sales price of hot-dipped galvanised coils, a raw\nmaterial in the manufacture of OCS, they allege that the cost of production of\nOCS in the investigation period could not exceed 900 EUR/tonne.\n(527)\u00a0\u00a0 Firstly, it was not clear to\nwhich extend all costs such as SG&A and finance costs were included in the\ntotal cost to which CISA was refering to. Secondly, The Commission verified the\ncost of production of OCS in all of the sampled Union producers and is\nsatisfied that the full cost of production included raw materials, processing,\ncoating, SG&A, finance costs etc.\n(528)\u00a0\u00a0 CISA then claimed that the\nsale of OCS to related parties is made at a loss and is therefore a cause of\ninjury to the Union industry. This is based on a comparison of the total cost\nof production (978 EUR/tonne) versus the average price of related sale (965\nEUR/tonne).\n(529)\u00a0\u00a0 Whereas it is correct that a\nsimple mathematical comparison would suggest that related sales were made at a\nloss, this would assume that the Union industry would incur the same level of\nSG&A and other sales overheads on their captive sales as on their unrelated\nones. As stated in recital (493), sales to related parties were made on a 'cost\nplus' basis and therefore the Union Industry was recovering their costs on\nthese sales.\n6.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic crisis\n(530)\u00a0\u00a0 The economic crisis and its\neffect on the construction business at least partially explain the contraction\nof demand and price pressure during the period considered. As mentioned above,\nin 2009 the consumption shrunk by 25%. However, as of 2010, the market started\nrecovering and, between 2009 and the end of the IP, consumption increased by\n24%.\n(531)\u00a0\u00a0 However, the injury and\ncausality analysis has separated the market breakdown of 2009 and the\nsubsequent recovery from 2009 to the IP. It has been clearly demonstrated in\nthe injury and causality analysis that the imports from the PRC took full\nadvantage of the recovering consumption and in addition constantly undercut the\nUnion industry's prices, and thus turning the possibility of equal chance to\nall players to recover from the drop, into a continuous battle for survival.\n(532)\u00a0\u00a0 After the deadline for\ncomments to the final disclosure an interested party noted the announced\nclosure of a plant in Belgium, and that force majeure was causing difficulties\nto normal production and shipment from other facilities in Belgium. The\ninterested party alleged that this shows the lack of security of supply of OCS\nin the EU and was a reason to allow importers and users to freely source their\nOCS from the EU and from China.\n(533)\u00a0\u00a0 These arguments are\nrejected. Given that capacity utilisation in the EU is low, the issue is not\none of problem of supply as the Union industry has adequate available capacity.\nIn any case the facilities being closed in Belgium did not manufacture OCS.\nSecurity of supply is of course important, but the proposed duties in this case\nare not designed to stop supply of OCS from China, merely to prevent that\nsupply being dumped onto the EU market.\n6.3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Structural overcapacity\n(534)\u00a0\u00a0 It has been claimed by some\ninterested parties that the cause of injury to the Union industry, which mostly\nare vertically integrated steel producers, has not been the imports from the\nPRC but that it was due to structural problems of the EU steel industry such as\novercapacity. It was also argued that the consolidation of the steel industry\nthat took place before the period considered had led to overcapacity and that\nany injury suffered was a consequence of too many production facilities.\n(535)\u00a0\u00a0 It is the case that\nproduction of the OCS is capital intensive and the industry has relatively high\nfixed costs. The consolidation of the steel industry - that took place before\nthe start of the period considered \u2013 however did not result in overcapacity.\nAfter a small increase in installed capacity in 2009, the industry slightly\ndecreased its capacity in 2010 and again in the IP. Installed capacity during\nthe IP was lower than total Union consumption and if demand in the IP had\nrecovered to the level of 2008 and the Union industry had been able to take\nadvantage of that increased demand, capacity utilisation would have been around\n74%.\n(536)\u00a0\u00a0 The negative effect of\novercapacity can only be attributed to a minimal extent to the EU producers of\nOCS. First, the investigation showed that the Union industry has obviously been\ntaking steps to sustain its efficiency, as productivity increased by 6% for the\nwhole industry. Second, continued investment in the production lines and\nflexibility in their use for producing other products helped to achieve\neconomies of scale and reduced fixed costs. Thus, with capacity utilisation of\nthe sampled companies going down by 18% over the period considered, the average\ncosts of production increased by only 6%, and that including the increase of\nraw material costs. Thus, it cannot be concluded that the overcapacity would\nbreak the causal link. This argument is therefore rejected.\n6.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on causation\n(537)\u00a0\u00a0 It has been demonstrated\nthat there was a substantial increase in the volume and market share of the\nsubsidised imports originating in the PRC in the period considered, especially\nfrom 2009 to the IP. It was also found that these imports were constantly\nundercutting the prices charged by the Union industry on the Union market and\nin particular during the IP.\n(538)\u00a0\u00a0 This increase in volume and\nmarket share of the low priced subsidised imports from the PRC coincided with\nthe negative development in the economic situation of the Union industry. This\nsituation worsened in the IP, when, despite recovering consumption, the Union\nindustry was unable to regain its lost market share and profitability. Other\nfinancial indicators such as return on investments stagnated at the level of\n2010, and employment reached its lowest level.\n(539)\u00a0\u00a0 The examination of the other\nknown factors which could have caused injury to the Union industry revealed\nthat these factors are not such as to break the causal link established between\nthe subsidised imports from the PRC and the injury suffered by the Union\nindustry.\n(540)\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the above analysis,\nwhich has properly distinguished and separated the effects of all known factors\non the situation of the Union industry from the injurious effects of the\nsubsidised exports, it was concluded that the subsidised imports from the PRC\nhave caused material injury to the Union industry within the meaning of Article\n8(6) of the basic Regulation.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UNION INTEREST\n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(541)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n31 of the basic Regulation, the institutions examined whether, despite the\nabove findings, compelling reasons existed for concluding that it is not in the\nUnion interest to adopt countervailing measures. The analysis of the Union\ninterest was based on an appreciation of all the various interests involved,\nincluding those of the Union industry, importers, and users of the product\nconcerned.\n7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of Union industry\n(542)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry as a\nwhole is composed of 22 known producers representing all of the Union OCS\nproduction. The producers are located in different Member States of the Union,\nemploying directly over 5 400 people in relation to the like product.\n(543)\u00a0\u00a0 None of the producers\nopposed the initiation of the investigation. As shown above in the\nmacroeconomic indicators, the whole EU industry experienced a deterioration of\ntheir situation and was negatively affected by the subsidised imports.\n(544)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry has\nsuffered material injury caused by the subsidised imports from the PRC. All\ninjury indicators showed a negative trend during the period considered. In\nparticular, injury indicators related to the financial performance of the Union\nproducers, such as profitability and return on investments, were seriously\naffected. In the absence of measures, a further deterioration in the Union\nindustry\u2019s economic situation appears very likely.\n(545)\u00a0\u00a0 It is expected that the\nimposition of countervailing duties will restore fair trade conditions on the\nUnion market, allowing the Union industry to align the prices of OCS to reflect\nthe costs of the various components and the market conditions. It can also be\nexpected that the imposition of countervailing measures would enable the Union\nindustry to regain at least part of the market share lost during the period\nconsidered, with a positive impact on its profitability and overall financial\nsituation.\n(546)\u00a0\u00a0 Should measures not be\nimposed, further losses in market share could be expected and the Union\nindustry's profitability would deteriorate. This would be unsustainable in the\nmedium to long-term. It is also likely that some individual producers would\nhave to close down their production facilities, as they have been lossmaking\nover the period considered. In view of the losses incurred and the high level\nof investment in production made at the beginning of the period considered, it\ncan be expected that most Union producers would be unable to recover their\ninvestments, should measures not be imposed.\n(547)\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore concluded\nthat the imposition of countervailing duties would be in the interest of the\nUnion industry. \n7.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of users and\nimporters\n(548)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned above in\nrecital (14) five importers came forward but only two replied to the\nquestionnaire. Out of about 100 users listed in the complaint, 19 came forward\nexpressing interest in the proceeding. Subsequently, ten companies provided\nquestionnaire replies.\n(549)\u00a0\u00a0 The most active users and\nimporters have made joint written submissions and several hearings were held in\nthe course of the investigation. Their main arguments regarding imposition of\nmeasures are analysed below.\n(550)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, comments were received from importers and other interested parties.\nHowever, no new elements other than the ones below were provided.\n7.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competition on the EU market\n(551)\u00a0\u00a0 Users and importers alleged\nthat the EU market of OCS was not sufficiently competitive and that imports\nfrom the PRC were necessary to give more bargaining power to companies\nimporting and using OCS. They also suggested that the Union industry was\nengaged in oligopolistic arrangements to control the market. The Union\nproducers were competing on the same markets and often selling to the same\ncustomers, or to the construction companies of each other. Considering that no\nevidence beyond anecdotal complaints about difficulties in price negotiations\nwas provided and that apart from the five groups of complaining Union\nproducers, 11 other producers of OCS operate in the EU, among which some are\nvery large, and that there is a variety of other import sources, these claims\nwere rejected.\n7.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shortage of supply\n(552)\u00a0\u00a0 Users and importers also\nalleged that imposition of measures on Chinese imports would create a shortage\nof OCS on the EU market. However, considering the wide variety of supply\nsources described above, as well as the free production capacity of the Union\nindustry, it is not considered likely that such shortage could take place.\nTherefore, the argument is rejected.\n7.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the interests\nof users and importers\n(553)\u00a0\u00a0 The ten cooperating users\nrepresented 7% of total imports from the PRC during the IP. The investigation\nshowed that all users maintain various sources of supply. On average, purchases\nfrom the PRC constituted around 15% of their total purchases of the OCS\nproducts; moreover, the largest volumes were found to be sourced from the EU\nproducers (73%) and 12% were imported from other third countries. Indeed, as\nthe product concerned is highly standardised, the importance of customer\nbinding is rather relative, and both users and importers can quite easily change\nthe sources of supply as far as the product quality is concerned.\n(554)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat all cooperating users, except one, were profitable in the sector which\nuses the product concerned and their profitability during the IP ranged from 1%\nto 13%, depending on the company. The profitability of those companies did not\nsignificantly depend on imports of the product concerned from the PRC.\n(555)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of\nquestionnaire replies from the users, the likely effect of the proposed\nmeasures was estimated. Thus, even assuming the unlikely worst-case scenario\nfor cooperating users, i.e. that no price increase could be passed on and they\nwould be bound to import from the PRC in the same volumes as in the IP, the\nimpact of the duty level on their cost of production would be an increase\nbetween 1 to 5% and a decrease by 1 to 2.8 percentage points in profitability\nfor most of the imports and by about 4 percentage points for importing under\nresidual duty. However, the more likely scenario is an impact significantly\nless than this. Imports from the PRC represent a rather small part of the\nusers' business and it can be expected that the cost increase from the\ncountervailing measures will be relatively easily passed on. Furthermore, given\nthat in addition to the many EU producers alternative significant import\nsources, not subject to measures, are available e.g. India and South Korea, it\nis expected that prices in the market, following the imposition of measures\nwill take into account these factors as well. \n(556)\u00a0\u00a0 The two cooperating\nimporters represented around 6% of total imports from the PRC during the IP,\nthe exact amount could not disclosed in accordance with Article 29 of the basic\nRegulation. Similarly as for the users, the importers also maintained different\nsources of supply besides the PRC. Furthermore, it was established that the\nprofitability of the importers would be possibly more affected by the measures\nthan that of the users, if they were to maintain the importing pattern\npracticed during the IP. However, in practice importers as traders tend to be\neven more flexible than users, and they would most likely be first to turn to\nthe alternative sources of supply. \n(557)\u00a0\u00a0 Part of the benefit from\nChinese imports on the user and importer side is effectively drawn from and\nmade possible by the unfair price discrimination practiced by the Chinese\nexporters, and not from a natural competitive advantage. Thus, reinstating the\nlevel playing field on the EU market by correcting the trade distortion coming\nfrom subsidised imports, will actually enable the OCS market to return to\nhealthy, market-economy-driven dynamics and price development, while at the\nsame time not disadvantaging other players (users, producers, end-consumers)\nwho are not immediately able to benefit from subsidised imports.\n7.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on Union\ninterest\n(558)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, it is\nconcluded that based on the information available concerning the Union\ninterest, there are no compelling reasons against the imposition of measures on\nimports of the product concerned originating in the PRC.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DEFINITIVE COUNTERVAILING\nMEASURES\n8.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injury elimination level\n(559)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\nreached with regard to subsidisation, injury, causation and Union interest,\ncountervailing measures should be imposed in order to prevent further injury\nbeing caused to the Union industry by the subsidised imports.\n(560)\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of\ndetermining the level of these measures, account was taken of the subsidy\nmargins found and the amount of duty necessary to eliminate the injury\nsustained by the Union industry. \n(561)\u00a0\u00a0 When calculating the amount\nof duty necessary to remove the effects of the injurious subsidisation, it was\nconsidered that any measures should allow the Union industry to cover its costs\nof production and to obtain a profit before tax that could be reasonably\nachieved by an industry of this type in the sector under normal conditions of\ncompetition, i.e. in the absence of subsidised imports, on sales of the like\nproduct in the Union. It is considered that the profit that could be achieved\nin the absence of subsidised imports should be based on the year 2008 when\nChinese imports were less present on the Union market. It is thus considered\nthat a profit margin of 6.7% of turnover could be regarded as an appropriate\nminimum which the Union industry could have expected to obtain in the absence\nof injurious subsidisation. \n(562)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, a\nnon-injurious price was calculated for the Union industry for the like product.\nThe non-injurious price was obtained by adding the above-mentioned profit\nmargin of 6.7% to the cost of production.\n(563)\u00a0\u00a0 The necessary price increase\nwas then determined on the basis of a comparison of the weighted average import\nprice of the cooperating exporting producers in the PRC, duly adjusted for\nimportation costs and customs duties with the non-injurious price of the Union\nindustry on the Union market during the IP. Any difference resulting from this\ncomparison was then expressed as a percentage of the average CIF import value\nof the compared types.\n(564)\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure\ninterested parties challenged the use of 6,7% as the target profit of the Union\nindustry and the description of 2008 as a representative year for\nprofitability. However, their argument that the profit made by the Union\nindustry in 2008 was affected by the financial crisis, making 2008 an\nexceptional year, would seem to point to an argument that the profit realised\nin 2008 is lower than the industry would expect in a normal year. This argument\nis rejected as no evidence as to what the profit of the Union industry would\nhave been in 2008 in the absence of the financial crisis was provided.\n(565)\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties also\npointed to the fact that import volumes from the PRC were at their lowest in\n2009 rather than in 2008. However, given that the Union industry was not\nprofitable in 2009, it is impossible to use 2009 data to set a target profit\nfor the Union industry.\n(566)\u00a0\u00a0 CISA have further alleged\nthat the profit to unrelated customers in 2008 cannot be used as the target\nprofit because that year shows the largest price difference between related and\nunrelated sales. This argument was rejected, as this price difference is not\nrelevant to the calculation of the profit of sales to unrelated customers. \n(567)\u00a0\u00a0 CISA then proposed that the\ntarget profit for sales of OCS to unrelated parties in the Union be based on\nthe average overall profit for the multinational corporation ArcelorMittal for\nthe years 2010 and 2011. This was rejected as a reliable source for the profit\non OCS in the Union in the absence of dumped imports, because taking the profit\nof the entire worldwide ArcelorMittal group is clearly not representative of\nprofit on sales of OCS in the Union.\n(568)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nchallenged the Commission's methodology for the calculation of the underselling\nmargin. However, this challenge was based on the erroneous assumption that the\nCommission had calculated the underselling margin by removing the average\nprofit of the Union industry in the IP (2.6%) from the market price to get to\nthe 'break-even point' (i.e. a price that would result in zero profit) and then\nadding the target profit onto this 'break-even point'.\n(569)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission calculated\nthe underselling margin by adding the target profit to the cost of production\nof each product type. The methodology suggested by this interested party is\nflawed, because the average profit of 2.6% was not automatically achieved on\neach sale of each model by all companies from which the data was used.\n(570)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party also\nchallenged the Commission's injury calculations. Given that that party did not\nhave full access to the data used by the Commission to calculate the injury\nmargin, it attempted to calculate it on its own, based on its understanding of the\nprice difference on the market between aluminium zinc coated and zinc coated\nsubstrate, which it had calculated at USD 50 per MT. This 'recalculation',\nbased on incomplete data, resulted in a lower injury margin than that which the\nCommission had calculated and disclosed.\n(571)\u00a0\u00a0 Their arguments were\nrejected because the analysis of the full data from both the exporting\nproducers and the Union industry, the alleged price difference could not be\nfound. Consequently, it should be underlined that the data which the interested\nparty was using was incomplete and thus could not be relied upon to reproduce\nthe Commission's injury calculations.\n8.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive measures\n(572)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\nreached with regard to subsidisation, injury, causation and Union interest, and\nin accordance with Article 15 of the basic Regulation, a definitive\ncountervailing duty should be imposed on imports of OCS originating in the PRC\nat the level of the lower of the subsidy or injury margins found, in accordance\nwith the lesser duty rule. In this case, the duty rate should accordingly be\nset at the level of the subsidy margins found. On the basis of the above, the\nrates at which such duties will be imposed are set as follows: \n Company Name || Subsidy margin || Injury margin || Countervailing duty \n Zhangjiagang Panhua Steel Strip Co., Ltd.; Chongqing Wanda Steel Strip Co., Ltd.; Zhangjiagang Free Trade Zone Jiaxinda International Trade Co., Ltd. || 29,7% || 55,8% || 29,7% \n Zhejiang Huadong Light Steel Building Material Co. Ltd.; Hangzhou P.R.P.T. Metal Material Co., Ltd. || 23,8% || 29,7% || 23,8% \n Union Steel China || 26,8% || 13,7% || 13,7% \n Other cooperating companies || 26,8% || 43,0% || 26,8% \n Residual duty || 44,7% || 58,3% || 44,7% \n(573)\u00a0\u00a0 The individual company\ncountervailing duty rates specified in this Regulation were established on the\nbasis of the findings of the present investigation. Therefore, they reflect the\nsituation found during that investigation with respect to these companies.\nThese duty rates (as opposed to the countrywide duty applicable to \u2018all other\ncompanies\u2019) are thus exclusively applicable to imports of products originating\nin the country concerned and produced by the companies and thus by the specific\nlegal entities mentioned.
