Today, only a few Member States rely on the Regulation\nin order to justify payments of compensation.\nThe Regulation was adopted before the rail\nmarket was liberalised and when rail transport in Europe was developing\nprimarily within national borders, with integrated companies both operating\nrail services and managing rail infrastructure. In the context of this\nmonopolistic market, the objective of the Regulation at the time was to put railway\nundertakings and undertakings active in other transport modes on an equal\ncompetitive footing. \nSince the 1990s, a series of legislative\nmeasures (known as the railway packages) has been adopted at European level\nwith a view to reviving rail transport by gradually creating a single railway\narea integrated at a European level. These legal acts have opened up the rail\nfreight and international rail passenger markets to competition and have\nestablished, by way of Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 21 November 2012 establishing a single European railway area\n(recast)[1],\ncertain fundamental principles which include that railway undertakings shall be\nmanaged according to principles that apply to commercial companies, that entities\nresponsible for the allocation of capacity and charging for rail infrastructure\nshall be separate from entities which operate rail services (separation of\nessential functions) and that there shall be a separation of accounts (to\nprevent cross-subsidisation), that any railway undertaking licensed in\naccordance with EU criteria should have access to railway infrastructure on\nfair, non-discriminatory terms, and that infrastructure managers may benefit\nfrom State financing. \nRegulation (EEC) No 1192/69 is inconsistent\nand incompatible with legislative measures currently in force for a number of\nreasons. \ni) Since railway undertakings must be\nmanaged according to principles that apply to commercial companies, no State\ncompensation for insurance, pensions, or other operating expenditures is\npermissible (except in the case of compensation for the provision of public\nservices). Not only is this principle established broadly under Treaty State\naid rules, but it is more specifically set out in the Guidelines on State aid\nfor railway undertakings (2008/C 184/07).\nii) The enumerated list of railway\nundertakings eligible for compensation under the Regulation and the classification\nin the Regulation of types of compensation that can be paid to railway\nundertakings presuppose an integration of infrastructure management into the\nactivities of railway undertakings which is inconsistent with the principles of\nseparation of essential functions and separation of accounts. \niii) Regulation 1192/69 makes only 36\nrailway undertakings eligible for compensation. The Regulation may have made\nsense when incumbent railway undertakings competed exclusively with other modes\nof transport and not with other railway undertakings, however, in the context\nof a liberalised market where railway undertakings compete directly with the\ntraditional monopolies, it is not appropriate to discriminate between different\nundertakings. If financial conditions differ for railway undertakings (as a\nconsequence of the Regulation) new entrants are not ensured non-discriminatory\naccess conditions. For example, new entrants may have difficulties to attract\npersonnel from incumbent railway undertakings since the latter may be able to\noffer more favourable pension conditions through subsidies received under the\nRegulation.\nPayments of compensation under Class IV of\nthe Regulation (the costs of level crossing facilities) are costs associated\nwith the functions of an infrastructure manager who, under Article 8 of Directive\n2012/34/EU, may benefit from State financing. Thus while compensation payments under\nClass IV of the Regulation would be compatible with existing legislation, Class\nIV of the Regulation is also redundant.\nTherefore, the proposed initiative to\nrepeal the Regulation will eliminate inconsistencies in the EU legal order and\nwill contribute to simplification by eliminating a legal act which is now\nobsolete.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation\nThe Commission requested information from\nMember States about application of the Regulation in May 2010 and in June 2011.\nResponses revealed that between 2007 and 2010 a majority of Member States had\nnot received applications from railway undertakings and had not made payments\nof compensation under the Regulation. A majority of Member States indicated\nthey saw no ongoing need for the Regulation and some explicitly expressed their\nsupport for repeal or their opinion that the Regulation is obsolete or out of\ndate. Some Member States were in favour of maintaining relevant classes in the\nRegulation, however given that compensation payments under all classes except\nClass IV are incompatible with other legislation, this is an option that cannot\nbe pursued. Other Member States were indifferent or expressed no opinion on the\nongoing need for the Regulation. Only three Member States (Belgium, Germany and\nIreland) declared that they used the Regulation as a legal basis for payments\nof compensation during the period 2008-2010.\nCompensation payments in\n2010 (estimated or actual) under Regulation 1192/69 as reported by MS (\u20ac\nmillions)\n   || Class I Loss or injury at work || Class III Pensions || Class IV Level Crossings || Total \n Belgium || (0.322) || - || - || (0.322) \n Germany || - || - || 72.8 || 72.8 \n Ireland || - || 24.1 || 4.2 || 28.3 \n Total || (0.322) || 24.1 || 77.0 || 100.8 \nThe Commission was also recently informed\nby Poland of compensation payments to PKP PLK (under Class IV) for the year\n2012 in the order of \u20ac7.9 million. \nOnly three classes of compensation are\napplied by Member States today (I, III and IV). Certain classes of compensation\nunder the Regulation are no longer in force (V through VIII). None of the\nremaining classes of compensation (II and IX through XV) are applied. \nExcept in the case of compensation for the\nprovision of public services, payment by the State to railway undertakings of\ncompensation is incompatible with the principles of management of railway\nundertakings according to principles that apply to commercial companies and EU\nrules on State aid, separation of accounts, and non-discriminatory access to\nrailway infrastructure. Class IV of the Regulation is redundant given that\ncompensation payments by the State for the functions of infrastructure managers\ncan already be made under Directive 2012/34/EU. Reducing the number of classes\nin the Regulation to those which are in line with existing legislation would\nhave the same effect as the repeal option \u2013 eliminating incompatible classes\nyet leaving the possibility for Member States to provide the infrastructure\nmanager with financing consistent with its functions, including costs\nassociated with level crossing facilities. \n2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impacts of the repeal\nOn the basis of the data provided by Member\nStates, it can be concluded that the impact of a repeal of the Regulation would\nbe very minimal.\nClass I \nBetween 2008 and 2010, Belgium received\napplications from SNCB Holding under Class I (payments which railway\nundertakings are obliged to make but which for the rest of the economy are\nborne by the State, including payments in respect of loss or injury resulting\nfrom accidents at work). In 2010, a negative compensation balance of \u20ac0.323\nmillion was calculated under the Regulation, to be paid back by SNCB Holding to\nthe Belgian State. \nThe impact of a repeal of Regulation\n1192/69 would be negligible as regards Class I compensation payments. SNCB\nwould have to join the existing private accident insurance system and Belgium\nhas indicated that it is considering this option. Any costs associated with\nswitching systems would be more than offset by the elimination of\nadministrative burdens associated with the annual receipt of applications and\ncalculations of compensation under the Regulation. \nClass III \nBetween 2008 and 2010, Ireland made\npayments to CIE under Class III (payments in respect of retirement and other\npensions borne by railway undertakings on terms different from those applicable\nto other transport undertakings). In 2010, Class III compensation to CIE\namounted to \u20ac24.1 million. \nThe impact of a repeal of Regulation\n1192/69 would be minimal as regards Class III compensation payments. Pension\npayments to CIE related to labour costs associated with infrastructure\nmanagement can be justified by Article 8 of Directive 2012/34/EU as financing\nfor functions of an infrastructure manager. Pension payments to CIE related to\nlabour costs associated with public service obligations, can be justified as\ncompensation for the discharge of public service obligations defined in\naccordance with Regulation 1370/2007 and be exempted from the State aid\nnotification requirement. (Currently 100% of all rail passenger operations are\nunder public service obligation). Pension payments to CIE for labour costs\nassociated with rail operations that do not fall under public service\nobligations (in other words, freight services) would be subject to State aid\nnotification. Freight activities are estimated to represent around 5.2% of\nCIE's rail operation activities \u2013 this translates roughly to 3.4% of its\nemployees. Thus, less than \u20ac1 million of pension related payments to CIE are\nassociated with rail freight activities. Only these payments to CIE (and\npayments to CIE related to rail passenger operations not under PSO \u2013 of which\nthere currently are none) would be subject to State aid notification rules. \nClass IV\nIreland, Germany and Poland have made\npayments under Class IV (costs of level crossing facilities). In 2010 Ireland made\npayments to CIE of \u20ac 4.2 million under Class IV. Estimated payments under Class\nIV from Germany to DB Netz AG and Usedomer B\u00e4derbahn GmbH were in the order of\n\u20ac72.8 million for 2010, of which less than 0.5% went to Usedomer B\u00e4derbahn. For\nthe year 2012 Poland will make compensation payments under Class IV to PKP PLK\nin the order of \u20ac 7.9 million. \nThe impact of a repeal of Regulation\n1192/69 would be negligible as regards Class IV compensation payments. Payments\nto CIE, DB Netz and PKP PLK would be covered by Article 8 of Directive 2012/34/EU\nas financing for functions of an infrastructure manager. These payments can\ncontinue to be made after a repeal of the Regulation and the administrative\nformalities related to application of the Regulation, such as handling annual\napplications for normalisation from undertakings, assessing financial burden or\nbenefit, determining the amount of compensation, adequately preparing decisions\ntaken in pursuance of the provisions of the Regulation and officially publishing\nthose decisions, would be eliminated. Payments to Usedomer B\u00e4derbahn, which are\nminimal, would be subject to State aid notification rules. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe proposal consists of a repeal of\nRegulation (EEC) No 1192/69. \n2013/0013 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nrepealing Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 of\nthe Council on common rules for the normalisation of the accounts of railway\nundertakings\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 91 and 109\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[2],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[3],\n\nActing in accordance with a ordinary legislative\nprocedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)              \nRegulation (EEC) No 1192/69 allows Member States\nto compensate 36 enumerated railway undertakings for the payment of obligations\nwhich undertakings of other transport modes do not have to support. Correct\napplication of the rules for normalisation results in Member States being\nexempted from State aid notification obligations.\n(2)              \nA series of legislative measures has been\nadopted at European level, opening up the rail freight and international rail\npassenger markets to competition and establishing, by way of Directive 2012/34/EU\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012\nestablishing a single European railway area (recast), certain fundamental\nprinciples which include that railway undertakings shall be managed according\nto principles that apply to commercial companies, that entities responsible for\nthe allocation of capacity and charging for rail infrastructure shall be\nseparate from entities which operate rail services and that there shall be a\nseparation of accounts, that any railway undertaking licensed in accordance\nwith EU criteria should have access to railway infrastructure on fair,\nnon-discriminatory terms, and that infrastructure managers may benefit from\nState financing. \n(3)              \nRegulation (EEC) No 1192/69 is inconsistent and\nincompatible with legislative measures currently in force. In particular, in\nthe context of a liberalised market where railway undertakings compete directly\nwith the enumerated railway undertakings, it is no longer appropriate to\ndiscriminate between these two groups of different undertakings. \n(4)              \nAs a consequence, it is appropriate to repeal\nRegulation (EEC) No 1192/69 to eliminate inconsistencies in the EU legal order\nand this will contribute to simplification by eliminating a legal act which is\nnow obsolete.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EEC) No 1192/69 is repealed.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\nthe day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, \nFor the European Parliament\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\nThe President\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 343, 14.12.2012, p. 32.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
