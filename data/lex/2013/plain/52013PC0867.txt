Its aim is to ensure\nthat international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not\nthreaten their survival. It covers about 35 000 species, which are listed in\nthree Appendices, according to the degree of protection they need. All import,\nexport, re-export and introduction from the sea of species covered by the\nConvention has to be authorized through a licensing system. \nThe initial text of the Convention foresaw\nthat CITES membership would be limited to States only. At the second\nextraordinary meeting of the Conference of the CITES Parties in Gaborone, Botswana, on 30 April 1983, an amendment to the Convention was agreed. It\nconsists of the addition of five paragraphs (numbered from 2 to 6 below) to\nArticle XXI as follows:\n1.     \nThe present Convention shall be open\nindefinitely for accession. Instruments of accession shall be deposited with\nthe Depositary Government\n2.     \nThis Convention shall be open for\naccession by regional economic integration organizations constituted by\nsovereign States which have competence in respect of the negotiation,\nconclusion and implementation of international agreements in matters\ntransferred to them by their Member States and covered by this Convention.\n3.     \nIn their instruments of accession, such\norganization shall declare the extent of their competence with respect to the\nmatters governed by the Convention. These organizations shall also inform the\nDepositary Government of any substantial modification in the extent of their\ncompetence. Notifications by regional economic integration organizations\nconcerning their competence with respect to matters governed by this Convention\nand modifications thereto shall be distributed to the Parties by the Depositary\nGovernment.\n4.     \nIn matters within their competence, such\nregional economic integration organizations shall exercise the rights and\nfulfil the obligations which this Convention attributes to their Member States,\nwhich are Parties to the Convention. In such cases the Member States of the\norganizations shall not be entitled to exercise such rights individually.\n5.     \nIn the fields of their competence,\nregional economic integration organizations shall exercise their right to vote\nwith a number of votes equal to the number of their Member States which are\nParties to the Convention. Such organizations shall not exercise their right to\nvote if their Member States exercise theirs, and vice versa.\n6.     \nAny reference to \"Party\" in the\nsense used in Article 1(h) of this Convention, to\n\"State\"/\"States\" or to \"State Party\"/State\nParties\" to the Convention shall be construed as including a reference to\nany regional economic integration organization having competence in respect of\nthe negotiation, conclusion and application of international agreements in\nmatters covered by this Convention.\nThis amendment (\u201cthe Gaborone amendment\u201d)\nentered into force on 29 November 2013, after its ratification by two-thirds of the 80 countries that were Parties at the time of\nadoption of the amendment. The European Union has been to date an observer to\nCITES and the entry into force of the Gaborone amendment now allows the\nEuropean Union to become a Party to CITES. \nThe matters covered by CITES relate to areas\n(protection of the environment, trade, internal market, customs) which are\nsubject to Union law. CITES provisions have been implemented in a harmonized manner\nat EU level since 1984 and are now regulated through Council Regulation (EC) No\n338/97 and various Commission Regulations (Commission Regulation (EC) No\n865/2006, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 792/2012 and Commission\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 578/2013).\nThe accession of the European Union to CITES\nis a logical and necessary step to ensure that the European Union is fully able\nto pursue its objectives under its environmental policy. \nThe proposal for the Council Decision aims at\napproving the accession of the European Union to CITES and at calling upon the President of the Council to designate the person empowered to\nproceed, on behalf of the European Union, to the deposit of the instrument of\naccession as provided for in Article XXI (1) of the Convention and of the\ndeclaration of competence provided for in Article XXI (3).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot relevant.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nCITES, like other Multilateral\nEnvironmental Agreements (MEAs) administered by UNEP, is financed through\nassessed contributions paid by all Parties and that are based on the UN Scale\nof Assessment adopted every three years by the General Assembly.\nIt is expected that for CITES as for other\nglobal MEAs, the CoP will decide that, following the accession of the European\nUnion to CITES, the EU should pay 2.5% of the total amount of the CITES Trust\nfund annually. \nThe next CoP will only meet in 2016 but the\nEU will be expected to make a contribution in 2014 and 2015 (approximately EUR\n112 000, 2.5% of the total amount of the CITES Trust fund for 2015), in line\nwith the practice that Parties should contribute as soon as they accede. \n2013/0418 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the Accession of the European Union to\nthe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and\nFlora (CITES)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192 and Article 207,\nin conjunction with Article 218(6)(a), thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\nEuropean Parliament,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Convention on\nInternational Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to\nwhich 178 countries, including all Member States, are a party, is a major\ninternational instrument aiming at protecting endangered\nspecies of fauna and flora through controls on international trade in specimens\nof those species.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Gaborone Amendment to\nCITES, adopted by a special Conference of the Parties in\nGaborone, Botswana, in 1983, modified Article XXI of\nthe Convention so that access to the Convention, previously limited to States,\nwas opened to regional economic integration organizations constituted by\nsovereign States which have competence in respect of the negotiation,\nconclusion and implementation of international agreements in matters\ntransferred to them by their Member States and covered by this Convention. The Gaborone amendment to CITES entered into force on 29 November 2013.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nmatters covered by CITES relate to the protection of the environment and trade.\nThese are areas in which the Union is competent for the negotiation, conclusion\nand implementation of international agreements. The provisions of CITES have\nbeen implemented uniformly in all Member States since 1 January 1984. They are\nnow regulated through Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97[1] and Commission\nRegulation (EC) No 865/2006[2].\n\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accession to CITES by the\nEuropean Union will enable it to play a full role in the work of the Convention\nand will legally bind the European Union and all its Member States to implement\nand enforce the Convention. It will create formal responsibilities for the\nEuropean Union so as to make the European Union as a Party accountable to other\nParties for its implementation of the Convention.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union should\ntherefore accede to the CITES Convention,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe accession of the European Union to the Convention on International Trade in\nEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is hereby\napproved on behalf of the Union. \nThe text of the Convention is attached to\nthis Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe President of the Council shall\ndesignate the person empowered to proceed, on behalf of the European Union, to the\ndeposit of the instrument of accession provided for in Article XXI (1) of the\nConvention, in order to express the consent of the European Union to be bound\nby the Convention. At the same time, the designated person shall deposit the\ndeclaration set out in the Annex to this Decision, in accordance with Article\nXXI (3) of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild\nFauna and Flora.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall enter into force on .[3]\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FRAMEWORK OF THE\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Title of the proposal/initiative \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Policy\narea(s) concerned in the ABM/ABB structure\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nature\nof the proposal/initiative \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objective(s)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds\nfor the proposal/initiative \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration\nand financial impact \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management\nmode(s) envisaged \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring\nand reporting rules \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management\nand control system \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures\nto prevent fraud and irregularities \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL\nIMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s)\nof the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimated\nimpact on expenditure \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.2.1.
