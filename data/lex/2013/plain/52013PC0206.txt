Although the product scope\nand the final duty rates have been amended, the provisional findings were\nconfirmed.\nIt is therefore proposed that the Council\nadopt the attached proposal for a Regulation which should be published no later\nthan 14 May 2013.\nLegal basis\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30\nNovember 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members\nof the European Community.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and\nadministrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional\nand local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and\nproportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason:\nOther means would not be adequate because the\nbasic Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\nUnion budget.\n2013/0109 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty\nand collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of ceramic\ntableware and kitchenware originating in the People's Republic of China\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[1],\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Article 9 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\nthe European Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) after having consulted the Advisory\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, by\nRegulation (EU) No 1072/2012[2]\n(\u2018the provisional Regulation\u2019), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on\nimports of ceramic tableware and kitchenware originating in the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (\u2018PRC\u2019 or \u2018the country concerned\u2019).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proceeding was\ninitiated on 16 February 2012[3]\nfollowing a complaint lodged on behalf of Union producers (\u2018the complainants\u2019),\nrepresenting more than 30% of the total Union production of ceramic tableware\nand kitchenware. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As set out in recital (22)\nof the provisional Regulation, the investigation of dumping and injury covered\nthe period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011 (\u2018the investigation period\u2019\nor \u2018IP\u2019). The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury\ncovered the period from 1 January 2008 to the end of the IP (\u2018the period\nconsidered\u2019).\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent procedure\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent to the disclosure\nof the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was decided\nto impose a provisional anti-dumping duty (\u2018provisional disclosure\u2019), several\ninterested parties made written submissions making known their views on the\nprovisional findings. The parties who so requested were granted an opportunity\nto be heard. Two importers and one exporting producer requested and were\nafforded hearings in the presence of the Hearing Officer of the\nDirectorate-General for Trade.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission continued\nto seek and verify all information it deemed necessary for its definitive\nfindings. The oral and written comments submitted by the interested parties\nwere considered and, where appropriate, the provisional findings were modified\naccordingly.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, as explained\nin recital (55) below, a verification visit was carried out at a Thai producer,\nthe purpose of which was to investigate the suitability of Thailand as an appropriate analogue country. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently all parties\nwere informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which\nit was intended to recommend the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty\non imports of ceramic tableware and kitchenware originating in the PRC and the\ndefinitive collection of the amounts secured by way of provisional duty ('the\nfinal disclosure'). All parties were granted a period within which they could\nmake comments on the final disclosure. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce for\nImport and Export of Light Industrial Products and Arts-crafts (\u2018CCCLA\u2019) and a\ngroup of importers requested and were granted hearings in the presence of the\nHearing Officer of the Directorate-General for Trade. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comments submitted by\nthe interested parties were considered and taken into account where\nappropriate.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sampling\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following provisional\ndisclosure several interested parties challenged the sample of exporting\nproducers from the PRC arguing that the sample is not representative, as it is based\nonly on the largest exported volumes and thus failed to take into account other\nfactors characterising the diversity and fragmentation of the ceramic industry\nin the PRC.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\nfollows from Article 17(1) of the basic Regulation that the selection of\ncompanies to be included in the sample may be limited to the largest\nrepresentative volume of exports that can reasonably be investigated within the\ntime available. In view of the fragmentation of the industry it was considered\nthat a selection based on export volumes would allow a representative sample\nthat could be investigated within the time available. In this respect it should\nnevertheless be noted that the companies selected are located in three\ndifferent regions in China\nand have significant production of the product concerned of different types of ceramic\nmaterial, e.g. porcelain and stoneware as well as production of a wide variety\nof product types. Therefore, this claim cannot be accepted.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer\nclaimed that the use of different methodologies for selecting the sample for\nthe EU industry and importers as compared to the sampling of exporting\nproducers amount to discrimination and that the same criteria should have been\nused. The use of different methodologies is discriminatory against the\nexporting producers and a breach of equal treatment.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The selection of a sample\nof exporting producers serves only to investigate the existence of dumping of\nthe product concerned from the PRC. In this regard, it is essential to cover\nthe maximum volume of imports of the product concerned in the investigation\nperiod. On the other hand, the sample of Union producers was selected for the\npurpose of determining whether the Union industry was suffering material injury\nof the basis of numerous different indicators. Concerning importers, the\ninformation collected is largely used in the Union interest assessment. It\nfollows that for importers and the Union producers, it is important to collect\ninformation from a range of companies active in, for example, different product\nsegments. As the underlying rationale for selecting companies to be included in\nthe samples is different for, on the one hand, Union producers and importers\nand, on the other hand, exporting producers, they are not in a similar\nsituation. Therefore, neither the principle of non-discrimination nor equal\ntreatment requires the use of an identical methodology for selecting the\nrespective samples. It follows that this claim is wholly unwarranted and is\ntherefore rejected. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, one exporting\nproducer maintained its request, as referred to in recital (8) of the\nprovisional Regulation, that it should have been included in the sample. The\ncompany has however not put forward any new arguments that would justify its\ninclusion in the sample. Therefore, and taking into account the findings in recital\n(10) above, the conclusions in recital (9) of the provisional Regulation are\nhereby confirmed.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same non-sampled\nexporting producer claimed that it was not afforded sufficient time to submit\nits comments on the final disclosure and that, in addition, the disclosure was\ninsufficient since it did not disclose, e.g. figures for allowances,\nsales prices, adjustments, etc. Therefore, its rights of defence have not been\nrespected. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article 20(5)\nof the basic Regulation an interested party should be afforded a time period of\nat least 10 days to submit comments on the final disclosure. The exporting\nproducer in question received the final disclosure by way of electronic mail on\n25 February 2013 and was given until 8 March 2013, i.e. 11 days, to\nsubmit comments. The disclosure document was in addition also sent by\nregistered mail the following day. It follows that the party concerned was\ngiven sufficient time to submit comments and this claim must therefore be\nrejected. In this respect it is also noted that the party\u2019s comments were\nprovided within the given deadline and that no request for an extension of the\ndeadline was made. Moreover, having due regard to its obligation to protect\nconfidential information, the Commission disclosed all essential facts and\nconsiderations on the basis of which it intended to propose the imposition of\ndefinitive measures. More particularly, the respect for the rights of defence\ndoes not require that company specific sale figures or allowances made in respect\nof companies included in the sample, used to establish individual dumping\nmargins must be communicated to a party for which no individual margin is\ncalculated. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from the above\nthat the claim that the rights of defence were not respected is unfounded and\nis therefore rejected.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE\nPRODUCT\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As set out in recitals (24)\nand recitals (56) to (57) of the provisional Regulation, the product concerned as\nprovisionally defined is ceramic\ntableware and kitchenware, excluding ceramic knives ('the product concerned'),\ncurrently falling within CN codes ex 6911 10 00, ex 6912 00 10, ex 6912 00 30,\nex 6912 00 50 and ex 6912 00 90 and originating in the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina. \n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Claims\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following provisional\ndisclosure, no parties contested that ceramic (kitchen) knives were\nfundamentally different from other kinds of ceramic table and kitchenware due\nto differences in physical characteristics, production processes and end-uses. All\ncomments by parties having been analysed, the claim to exclude ceramic knives\nfrom the product scope of this investigation is definitively accepted. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After publication of\nprovisional measures, several parties claimed that certain ceramic condiment\nand spice mills and their ceramic grinding parts, should be excluded from the\nproduct scope.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This claim is based on the\nallegation that, in view of their specificities, such mills and other types of\nceramic tableware and kitchenware could not be considered as forming one single\nproduct. Those mills have a ceramic material mainly made of alumina for the grinding\nplate which is not used for \u2019standard\u2019 tableware such as cups and plates and for\nwhich firing is done at higher temperatures. Their degree of inter-changeability\nwith the main categories of the product under investigation would be limited.\nThis would also apply to ceramic grinding mechanisms without any housing which\nare normally declared under the above-mentioned codes. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat the ceramic element in these grinders normally represented a minor part of\nthe mill. Moreover, the investigation showed that mills with a ceramic grinding\nplate, including their ceramic grinding parts, did not have the same basic\nphysical characteristics and basic uses as ceramic tableware and kitchenware. The\nshape, strength and design of the ceramic grinding parts are different from ceramic\ntableware and kitchenware.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some\nparties submitted that the mills in question should be excluded from the\nproduct scope on the basis that they have the same physical characteristics,\nindustry design and end-use as mills with grinding mechanisms made of metal and\nthat when included in certain sets of mills they are normally classified under\ntariff heading 8210. They also claimed that the ceramic elements in these\ninstances generally represent normally up to 2% of the value of the product. Nevertheless,\ngiven the numerous classification possibilities of mills and sets of mills, the\ninvestigation could not retain these arguments to determine whether ceramic\nmills should be excluded from the product scope of the investigation.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties backed\ntheir claim that the mills in question should be excluded from the product\nscope on the basis that it would be necessary to use ceramic grinding plates,\nrather than metal, in certain mills, namely salt mills, as salt corrodes metal\ngrinders. However, the investigation showed that salt mills do not necessarily use\nceramic grinding mechanisms.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthe basis of the considerations in the recitals above, the investigation\nconcluded that condiment and spice mills with ceramic grinding elements are\nfundamentally different from other kinds of ceramic table and kitchenware due\nto the differences in basic physical characteristics and uses of the ceramic\nmaterial used for the working parts. Therefore, the claim to exclude them,\nincluding stand-alone ceramic grinding mechanisms and their parts, from the\nproduct scope of this investigation is accepted. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After publication of\nprovisional measures, some parties claimed that ceramic knife sharpeners should\nbe excluded from the product scope because of differences in the production\nprocesses, end-use and the fact that these items are not aimed at retaining\nfoodstuff due to their specific design and physical characteristics. The\ninvestigation confirmed these points. The claim to exclude them from the\nproduct scope of this investigation is therefore granted.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the same vein it was\nalso investigated whether ceramic peelers should be excluded from the product\nscope. Indeed, the investigation confirmed that ceramic peelers, also, are\nfundamentally different from other kinds of ceramic table and kitchenware due\nto the differences in the design and physical characteristics (shape and\nstrength) of the ceramic material used for the working parts, their production\nprocesses and end-use. Ceramic peelers should, therefore, also be excluded from\nthe product scope of this investigation.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After publication of\nprovisional measures, a party also claimed that pizza-stones made of cordierite\nceramic should be excluded from the product scope because of their different\nphysical properties (shape and hardness), industrial design and use. Cordierite\nceramic is a type of alumina magnesia silicate with specific properties, namely\nan excellent thermal shock resistance. The investigation confirmed that\npizza-stones made of cordierite ceramic have the same physical properties\n(shape and hardness), industrial design and use as bricks for furnaces or ovens.\nConsequently, they are different from other ceramic tableware and kitchenware. Following\nfinal disclosure, the complainants pointed at the similarity of pizza-stones\nmade of cordierite ceramic as compared to the other products covered by the\nproceeding. However, they could not demonstrate that pizza-stones made of\ncordierite ceramic have the same basic physical characteristics and end uses. The\nclaim to exclude them from the product scope of this investigation is therefore\ngranted. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After publication of\nprovisional measures, a Dutch association claimed that ceramic tableware and\nkitchenware to be used as promotional products should be excluded from the\nproduct scope on the basis that they are not sold to be used as tableware or\nkitchenware, that they are an important economical driver for the retail sector,\nthat they are highly appreciated by consumers and that only producers in the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China could offer the quantities needed within a short\nperiod. The claim to exclude ceramic tableware and kitchenware to be used as\npromotional products from the product scope of this investigation cannot\nhowever be granted because their physical characteristics, production processes\nand end-use are the same as those of other kinds of ceramic tableware and\nkitchenware.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provisional measures having\nbeen published and again after final disclosure, a German importer and\nwholesaler and a Chinese co-operating exporting producer claimed that specially\ncoated stoneware wares of a kind for sublimation printing and for which the\ncoating of sublimation is removable through mechanical scratching should be\nexcluded from the product scope on the basis that they are semi-finished\nproducts for which the photofinishing is carried out in the Union via specific\nchannels, the different consumer perception, the fact that the sublimation\ncoating exceeds the value of the uncoated ceramic items and the inexistency of\nUnion producers of this kind of product. The investigation revealed that the\nproduct is visibly identical to other non-sublimated tableware and, therefore,\nit is difficult to distinguish, if at all. The investigation further showed\nthat these products have normally the same end-use as other types of ceramic\ntableware. It was also found that several Union producers do manufacture these\nproducts and that Union-made and imported products are in direct competition.\nIn view of the above, the claim to exclude specially coated stoneware wares\nof a kind for sublimation printing is rejected. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the publication of\nprovisional measures and again after final disclosure, the importer that had\nclaimed the exclusion of underglaze figurative hand-painted tableware from the\nproduct scope alleged that the Commission's provisional analysis in this\nrespect was flawed because it ignored the existence of market segments, the differences\nin quality between the different types of tableware, the luxury and more\nfragile nature of underglaze figurative hand-painted tableware and the limited\ninterchangeability as a consequence of the associated consumer perception. It\nalso alleged that underglaze figurative hand-painted tableware may be even used\nfor decoration.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the claims\nconcerning the differences in quality between the different types of tableware\nand the luxury and more fragile nature of underglaze figurative hand-painted\ntableware, these characteristics are not specific to underglaze figurative\nhand-painted tableware. Moreover, as regards the limited interchangeability as\na consequence of associated consumer perception, no new argument was raised\nthat would change the conclusion in recital (45) of the provisional Regulation\nthat the average consumer does not make a difference between underglaze\nfigurative hand-painted tableware and other types of ceramic tableware.\nFinally, the Commission had analysed the existence of market segments in recitals\n(157) to (158) of the provisional Regulation. These arguments could not\ntherefore reverse the conclusions in recital (45) of the provisional\nRegulation.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The claim raised in recital\n(50) of the provisional Regulation was further elaborated after the imposition\nof provisional measures. These claims were reiterated after definitive\ndisclosure. The importer with production in China claimed that\nkitchenware/tableware products that are entirely glazed and/or enamelled on\n100% of their surface with the exception of the base or a part thereof and\nwhere 100% of the glazed/enamelled surface is coloured with a non-white colour\nshould be excluded from the product scope. The claim was duly analysed and the\ninvestigation has shown that the physical characteristics, production processes\nand end-uses of these products are the same as those of other glazed and/or\nenamelled products of ceramic tableware and kitchenware. Therefore, the claim is\ndefinitively rejected.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CCCLA insisted that fine\nbone china should be excluded from the product scope of the investigation on\nthe basis that it is a fragile luxury product with a low mechanical strength and\nit also contested that it is chip resistant. Yet it is noted that CCCLA itself\nhad previously submitted that fine bone china had a high mechanical strength\nand was chip resistant. These contradictory statements clearly undermined the\nCCCLA claims. In any event, the arguments raised do not change the conclusions\nsummarized in recital (28) of the provisional Regulation. Therefore, the claim\nfor the exclusion of fine bone china from the product scope is therefore\ndefinitively rejected.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same party reiterated\nthat durable porcelain should be excluded from the product scope of the\ninvestigation. It claimed that the statement that it does not have uncontested\nfeatures was not true, that it was very robust due to a clay aluminium content\nof over 24% and then contested the Union manufacturing capacity for this product.\nHowever, the different submissions on durable porcelain are contradictory as\nregards for instance the raw materials share and its alumina powder content. Moreover,\nit was not contested that durable porcelain was also manufactured in the Union\nand that producers in the PRC made durable porcelain which was in direct\ncompetition with Union produced durable porcelain as well as with other\nproducts covered by the investigation. The claim to exclude durable porcelain\nis therefore definitively rejected.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All types of ceramic\ntableware and kitchenware can be regarded as different types of the same\nproduct. Therefore, the claim made after provisional and again after final\ndisclosure that the investigation covers a large range of like products and\nthat, as a result, it would be necessary to conduct separate standing, dumping,\ninjury, causation and Union interest analyses for each product segment, is\nfound to be unfounded. One party that claimed that the product scope was too\nbroad brought forward a comparison of products with different levels of\ndecoration, but its statements as regards end-use (for the garden and children\nin one case, for decoration in the other case) are disputable because there is\nno clear-cut and can rather be seen as a confirmation of the point made in\nrecital (55) of the provisional Regulation. It should also be noted that an\nimporter with production in the People\u2019s Republic of China submitted that over\n99% of the ceramic tableware and kitchenware products sold in the Union were predominantly or exclusively white. Some parties contested recital (58) of the\nprovisional Regulation on the basis that in the framework of the investigation\nthe institutions did not carry out any test of whether certain merchandise was not\nsuitable for free trade in the Union. However, this fact does not undermine the\nconclusion in recital (63) of the provisional Regulation.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, the\nproduct scope is definitively defined as ceramic tableware and kitchenware,\nexcluding ceramic knives, ceramic condiment or spice mills and their ceramic\ngrinding parts, ceramic peelers, ceramic knife sharpeners and cordierite\nceramic pizza-stones of a kind used for baking pizza or bread, originating in\nthe People's Republic of China, currently falling within CN codes ex 6911 10\n00, ex 6912 00 10, ex 6912 00 30, ex 6912 00 50 and ex 6912 00 90.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\ncomments regarding the product concerned and the like product, all other\ndeterminations in recitals (24) to (63) of the provisional Regulation are\nhereby confirmed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DUMPING\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market Economy Treatment\n(MET)\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following provisional\ndisclosure one exporting producer, one Union producer and one importer claimed\nthat the MET determination was made out of time, i.e. after the three-month\nperiod laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation and that the\ninvestigation therefore should be terminated without imposition of any\nanti-dumping measures. This claim in relation to the MET determination had\nalready been made at the provisional stage and was rejected by the Commission\nin recitals (72) and (73) of the provisional Regulation. After final disclosure\nfive more exporting producers put forward a similar claim. In support of the\nclaim they relied on the Court of Justice's judgments in the Brosmann\nand Aokang Shoes cases[4].\n\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First, it is recalled that\nthe Brosmann and Aokang cases are not pertinent for the\nassessment of the legality of the MET analysis in the investigation at hand\nsince those cases, contrary to this investigation, relate to situations where\nthe MET assessments were not conducted at all.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, Brosmann\nand Aokang cases are not relevant for the assessment of the legality of\nthe investigation at hand, in the light of the fact that the basic Regulation\nhas meanwhile been amended[5].\nArticle 2(7) of the basic Regulation, as amended, provides that the Commission\nshall only make MET determinations in respect of companies included in a sample\npursuant to Article 17 of the basic Regulation and that it shall make such a\ndetermination within seven months of, but in any event not later than eight\nmonths after the initiation of the investigation, is applicable to all new and\npending investigations as from 15 December 2012, including therefore the\npresent one.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any event, the\ninterpretation of the standing case law that there was no infringement per\nse of the right to a MET determination notwithstanding the fact that\nthe three month time limit was not respected, must be upheld. Therefore, the\nconclusion in recital (73) of the provisional Regulation is maintained. \n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the large number of\nMET claims received and the need at that time to carry out numerous\nverification visits to examine those claims, the MET determination was not made\nwithin seven months. However the determinations were made within eight months\nfrom the date of the initiation as required by the basic Regulation, as amended\nby Regulation 1168/2012. The allegation that any right in this respect was\nremoved with retroactive effect is not justified as explained above.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, the\nclaim that the anti-dumping investigation, due to a failure to make a MET\ndetermination within three months, should be terminated without imposition of\nany anti-dumping measures, is rejected. \n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, one\nnon-sampled exporting producer that failed to demonstrate that it has one clear\nset of accounting records that were independently audited in line with\ninternational accounting standards and thus had its MET request rejected, maintained\nthe claim that the alleged accounting errors, if any, on the basis of which its\nrequest was refused, were not material and that, therefore, the decision to\nrefuse MET was disproportionate and in breach of the principle of\nproportionality. Following final disclosure this exporting producer maintained\nits claim but did not put forward any new arguments.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The arguments concerning\nthe severity of the accounting records are essentially identical to those made\nduring the MET investigation and were rebutted by the Commission prior to the\nMET determination. Nevertheless, with regard to the argument that the refusal\nto grant MET breaches the principle of proportionality it should be recalled\nthat the MET criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation are\ncumulative and, unless they are all fulfilled, MET cannot legally be granted.\nIn addition, since the burden of proof is on the company requesting MET and the\ncompany failed to demonstrate that it had one clear set of accounts, the only\noption available to the Commission was to refuse MET. Therefore, the decision\nto refuse MET cannot be considered to be in breach of the principle of\nproportionality. In any event, pursuant to Article 2(7)(d) of the basic\nRegulation, as amended by Regulation 1168/2012[6],\nwhen the Commission has limited its examination by the use of sampling, a\ndetermination on MET shall be limited to the parties included in the sample.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individual Treatment (IT)\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that\nalthough sixteen exporting producers requested IT, only the claims received\nfrom the sampled companies were examined pursuant to Article 9(6) of the basic\nRegulation and were, subsequently, accepted. Of the remaining eleven exporting\nproducers, seven requested individual examination.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n9(5) and 9(6) of the basic Regulation, individual duties shall be applied to\nimports from any exporter or producer which will be granted individual\nexamination, as provided for in Article 17(3) of the basic Regulation.\nAccordingly, the four companies that requested IT but not individual\nexamination could not be granted an individual duty. \n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer\nclaimed that it had submitted all information required within given deadlines\nand should therefore have had its IT claim examined and an individual margin\nestablished in accordance with the Court of Justice ruling in the Brosmann\ncase[7].\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This claim cannot be\naccepted. As the company in question was not included in the sample its claim\nfor IT could only be assessed in the context of an individual examination,\nshould one be carried out pursuant to Article 17(3) of the basic Regulation. \n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther comments on IT, recitals (79) to (81) of the provisional Regulation are\nhereby confirmed. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individual Examination (IE)\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Claims for individual\nexamination pursuant to Article 17(3) of the basic Regulation were submitted by\nseven exporting producers, comprising ten legal entities. As explained in\nrecitals (82) and (83) of the provisional Regulation, no decisions were taken\nin respect of these requests at the stage of provisional measures.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 21 December 2012 the\nexporting producers were informed that their requests for individual\nexaminations could not be accepted as they would be unduly burdensome and would\nprevent completion of the investigation in due. \n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer\nclaimed that, pursuant to Article 17(3) of the basic Regulation, an individual\nexamination is a statutory right and that the Commission's refusal to\nindividually examine it is unjustified, since neither the number of companies\nnor the examination required would, in view of the Commission's resources, be\nunduly burdensome or prevent the completion of the investigation in due time.\nFollowing final disclosure this claim was repeated but no further arguments\nwere put forward.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The decision whether or not\nto accept individual examinations is taken on a case by case basis, taking into\naccount the number of claims submitted and the time available to assess these\nclaims. In this case, it should be recalled that the Commission was legally\nobliged to carry out MET examinations at sixteen legal entities in the PRC,\nincluding companies not selected in the sample. Considering the time\nconstraints imposed by legal procedural deadlines no individual examinations could\ntherefore be carried out prior to the provisional findings. In view of the\nlimited time available thereafter and considering the number of claims\nsubmitted and the limited resources available by the services responsible for\nanti-dumping investigations in the Commission, it was concluded that it would\nbe unduly burdensome to carry out individual examinations in this case. \n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal Value\n3.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of analogue country\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe imposition of provisional measures, the selection of an appropriate\nanalogue country was further examined. In this context, a verification visit\nwas carried out at the premises of the Thai exporting producer that had\nsubmitted a questionnaire reply, as mentioned in recital (87) of the provisional\nRegulation. After having examined and verified the information received from\nthe cooperating producer in Thailand it was however concluded that the Thai producer could not provide\ndata at a sufficient level of detail regarding the types of products sold on\nthe domestic market. Therefore, it was considered that Brazil should be retained as the most appropriate analogue country.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless, the\ninformation obtained from Thailand served to support some of the findings made\nin Brazil, notably the level of price difference between branded and\nnon-branded products (see recital (91) below).\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure one industry association came forward and contested the choice of Brazil as an appropriate analogue country. It essentially argued that the only reason to\nchoose Brazil appears to be based on the fact that no other country was\nappropriate. This claim cannot be accepted. It follows clearly from the\nrecitals (84) to (88) of the provisional Regulation that Brazil was considered as an appropriate analogue country based on the factual domestic\nmarket situation. The fact that the Commission after provisional measures\ncontinued to examine also other potential analogue countries does not lead to\nthe conclusion that Brazil is not an appropriate choice. \n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above and in\nthe absence of any other comments on substance on the choice of Brazil as the appropriate analogue country, recitals (84) to (88) of the provisional\nRegulation are confirmed. \n3.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Determination of normal\nvalue \n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe provisional disclosure several interested parties claimed that the\ndetermination of normal value was flawed in so far as it was allegedly not\nestablished for the sales of like products in Brazil and, therefore, led to\ndistorted and unfair results, particularly in respect of stoneware products and\nother product types that were not produced and sold in the analogue country.\nSome exporting producers also argued that the methodology for establishing the\nconstructed normal value, referred to in recital (94) of the provisional\nRegulation, was not properly disclosed.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comments received after\nthe provisional disclosure show that the methodology used to determine the\nnormal value was not fully clear to some interested parties, In order to address\nthese comments, it is further explained that the methodology for determining\nthe normal value has been the following.\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that all requests for\nMET are denied normal value for all sampled exporting producers from the PRC\nwas established on the basis of information received from the producer in the\nanalogue country, pursuant to Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naccordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, the Commission first\nexamined whether the sales of the like product in Brazil to independent customers were\nrepresentative. The sales of the Brazilian cooperating producer of the like\nproduct were found to be sold in representative quantities on the Brazilian\ndomestic market compared to the product concerned exported to the Union by the exporting producers included in the sample. In this respect it is recalled\nthat according to Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation, \"like\nproduct\" means a product that is identical, i.e. alike in all\naspects, to the product under consideration or, in the absence of such a\nproduct, another product which, although not alike in all aspects, has\ncharacteristics closely resembling those of the product under consideration. \n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission subsequently\nexamined whether these sales could be considered as having been made in the\nordinary course of trade pursuant to Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation. This\nwas done by establishing the proportion of profitable sales to independent\ncustomers. The sales transactions were considered profitable where the unit\nprice was equal to, or above, the cost of production. The cost of production of\nthe cooperating Brazilian producer was therefore determined.\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This examination\ndemonstrated that for all product types more than 80% by volume of sales on the\ndomestic market were above cost and that the weighted average sales price of\nall types was equal to, or above, the unit cost of production. \n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, normal value,\nby product type, was calculated as the weighted average of the actual domestic\nprices of all sales, irrespective of whether those sales were profitable or\nnot. It follows that, contrary to what was indicated in recital (94) of the\nprovisional Regulation, no constructed normal value has been established for\nnon-profitable sales. \n3.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export price \n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments regarding export prices, recital (95) of the provisional Regulation is\nhereby confirmed.\n3.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison \n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nprovisional disclosure several interested parties claimed that, generally, the\nmethodology used for the comparison of normal value and export price was flawed\nas it did not compare like products and that the basis on which adjustments\nwere made was not sufficiently explained. More particularly, one exporting\nproducer claimed that for stoneware products, which were not produced and sold\nby the analogue producer, the Commission should have compared the export price\nwith the domestic price for earthenware, duly adjusted, rather than\nconstructing a normal value. Moreover, several exporting producers argued that\nfor several other product types, which were produced and sold by exporting\nproducers, a comparison between the export price and an average price per kg\nfor a generic product type sold in Brazil based solely on the type of ceramic\nmaterial used has inevitably lead to a comparison between products that are not\nlike and thus to a flawed result. In addition, one exporting producer claimed that the branding adjustment\nunder Article 2(10)(k) was underestimated while another exporting producer claimed\nthat the level of that adjustment was not based on any reliable or\nsubstantiated data and is therefore not justified. The same exporting producer\nalso argued that its export prices should be adjusted for differences in\nquantities sold at different levels of trade. Finally, several interested\nparties claimed that the methodology used for adjustments for differences in\nphysical characteristics are not well founded and it is unclear on which data these\nadjustments were made. \n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nview of the comments received the methodology used for price comparison and\nadjustments for the purpose of price comparability pursuant to Article 2(10) of\nthe basic Regulation have been revised. Most notably, for products that at the\nprovisional stage were compared on the basis of the average price per kg for a\ngeneric product based solely on the ceramic material used, the comparison has\nbeen made with the closest resembling product (see recital (77) below),which\nallowed for a more accurate and fair price comparison.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The normal value and export price were compared on an\nex-works basis. The dumping margins were established by comparing the\nindividual ex-works price of the sampled exporters to the domestic sales price\nof the analogue producer of the like product. Some export transactions\nconcerned, however, atypical product types, like serviette rings, knife rests\nor teapot stands, for which it was not possible to ensure a fair comparison.\nTherefore, also taking into account that these transactions were negligible as\nthey overall only accounted for less than 0.5% of export volumes, they were\nexcluded. \n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of ensuring\na fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowances\nin the form of adjustments was made for differences affecting price and price\ncomparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.\nAdjustments were made, where appropriate, in respect of differences in physical\ncharacteristics, level of trade and for other factors affecting price\ncomparability, notably branding. \n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First, it was examined\nwhether an adjustment under Article 2(10)(a) of the basic Regulation for\ndifferences in physical characteristics was warranted. \n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\ncases where the normal value was determined on the basis of the closest resembling\nproduct (see recital (68) above), an adjustment was made for differences in the\nphysical characteristics in order to ensure a fair price comparability between\nthe like products. \n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With\nregard to stoneware products, the export price was compared to the domestic\nsales price of the closest resembling product produced and sold in the analogue\ncountry, i.e. the sales price of products made of earthenware instead of\nstoneware but identical in all other aspect, as adjusted upwards by 5%, to\nreflect the price difference between stoneware and earthenware. \n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer\nclaims that both the production costs and the retail price for earthenware\nproducts is higher than for stoneware products. Accordingly, the export price\nfor its stoneware products should have been adjusted downwards rather than upwards.\nIn support of this claim the exporting producer relies essentially on its own\nestimates of the production costs of earthenware and stoneware, respectively,\nand an extract from a price list indicating retail prices of earthenware and\nstoneware products. \n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This information, which was\nprovided very late in the proceedings, and only after the final disclosure,\nstands in stark contrast to the information that has been provided to the\nCommission throughout the investigation from other interested parties, i.e.\nthe complainant, the Union industry and the producer in the analogue country\nAll these parties have indicated that stoneware products are of a higher\nquality, i.e. more durable, than earthenware products and are more expensive to\nmanufacture as stoneware is basically high-fired clay and earthenware low-fired\nclay. Accordingly, stoneware can generally be sold at a higher price. This information\nis further corroborated by publicly available market information. \n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should further be noted\nthat the exporting producer in question does not produce earthenware itself and\nhas thus only provided an estimate of the production costs thereof. In\naddition, the submitted price list does not demonstrate conclusively that\nearthenware products are generally more expensive than stoneware products. Therefore,\nthe evidence provided is not such as to demonstrate that the adjustment made\nfor a fair price comparison between the normal value and the export price of stoneware\nproducts is flawed and the claim is accordingly rejected. \n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrespect of other product types for which the comparison at provisional stage\nwas based on the average price per kg and the ceramic material only, the\nCommission has further analysed the product types concerned and compared the\nexport price with the closest resembling product type produced and sold in the\nanalogue country. Where only one minor physical characteristic differed, e.g.\ntype of glazing or decoration, while all other basic characteristics of the\nproduct type were identical, the sales price of the closest resembling type was\nadjusted by the actual price difference found for the difference in physical\ncharacteristic. For other product types, where more than one physical characteristic\ndiffered, the export price was compared to the average sales price of the\nclosest resembling product. For these product types, the closest resembling\nproduct shared several or all of the following basic physical characteristics;\nceramic material, type of ware, basic shape, decoration and glazing. \n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two sampled exporting\nproducers claimed that, similar to the adjustments made in cases where only one\nminor physical characteristic was different, an adjustment should also be made\nwhere more than one physical characteristic of the closest resembling product\nwas different. \n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that in\ncases where only one minor physical characteristic differed the sales price of\nthe closest resembling product was adjusted to take into account the actual\nprice difference found for the difference in question while, on the other hand,\nwhere more than one physical characteristic was different the comparison was\nmade on the basis of the average sales price of the product with identical\nphysical characteristics. Therefore, in the latter case, no price adjustment\nwas required for any physical difference between the like products as they\nshared the same basic physical characteristics. Accordingly, this claim cannot\nbe accepted.\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the exporting producers\nmentioned above also claimed additional adjustments for differences in physical\ncharacteristics with regard to weight and whiteness of the product concerned.\nIt claimed that it uses raw material of a low standard and that, therefore, the\ncost and price of its products are lower than for the like product produced in\nthe analogue country. Its export price should therefore be adjusted with a\nreasonable amount. In this respect it is first recalled that the company was\nnot granted market economy status and that its costs of production have thus\nnot been verified. In addition, the claim that its products are about 5%\nheavier than standard products was not accompanied by any verifiable or\nsupporting documents and therefore found to be unsubstantiated. Regarding the\nwhiteness, as this exporting producer admitted in its submission that its\nproducts are of normal whiteness, it failed to explain why any adjustment\nshould be warranted in this respect. Therefore, these claims are rejected.\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another exporting producer\nclaimed that the Commission had failed to compare some of its export sales with\nthe normal value of the appropriate closest resembling product. These exports\nconcerned sales of decorated products via an unrelated trader, which had,\nallegedly, provided the decoration (decal) free of charge. As a consequence,\nthe export price did not include the cost for decoration and should therefore\nhave been compared with the normal value determined for undecorated products\nor, in the alternative, an average normal value of decorated and undecorated\ngoods.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that the\ncost of production is not a relevant factor for the price comparability, which\nis based solely on a comparison between the normal value and the export price\nfor like products. It is also clear from the information provided that the\nexported products in question were indeed decorated although the exporting\nproducer did allegedly not bear the full costs associated with the added value\nthat can be assigned to the decoration. However, this is not a factor that can\njustify a price adjustment for differences in physical characteristics with the\nlike product in the analogue country. In any event, considering the late stage\nof the proceeding at which this claim was made, the data submitted in support\nof the claim cannot be verified. Accordingly, the claim is hereby rejected.\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the wide variety\nof possible combinations of ceramic tableware sets produced and sold in the PRC\nand in Brazil, respectively, it was for the purpose of achieving a fair price\ncomparability considered necessary to group different sets together based on\nthe number and type of items combined in a set. The average domestic sales\nprice in the analogue country for the different combinations of sets thus\ngrouped together was compared with the export price for set combinations\nfalling within those groups.\n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer\nclaimed that due to the wide variety of possible product combinations making up\na set, the grouping methodology does not allow for a fair price comparison, as\nit fails to take into account the characteristics of each piece making up a\nset. Therefore, this exporting producer claimed that sets should be excluded\nfrom the dumping margin calculation. \n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that the\ndumping calculations for sets are based on a comparison of the average price\nper kg and not on a piece by piece basis. It is therefore not necessary to\nestablish the exact combination of different pieces in each set for a fair\nprice comparison with regard to sets. The grouping methodology used takes into\naccount the basic characteristics of different set combinations in so far as\nthe sets are identified as e.g. coffee and/or tea sets, dinner sets or\nother sets and also the number of pieces combined. In these circumstances, it\nis considered that a fair comparison has been made in regard to sets in the\nsense of Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. It follows that this claim\ncannot be accepted. \n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\nas described in recital (99) of the provisional Regulation, the investigation\nestablished that Chinese exporting producers generally qualify their product in\nup to five different grades ranging from A to E with significant price\ndifferences. The vast majority of exports to the Union consist however of A-grade, B-grade or C-grade or a combination\nthereof. This grading is however not universal or based on any general\nindustry-wide standard but is rather company specific and allows for price\ndifferentiation. On the other hand, the analogue country producer only sells\nthe equivalent of A-grade on the domestic Brazilian market and price\ncomparability was therefore found to be affected. Accordingly, the export price\nwas adjusted upwards to Chinese A-grade level in order to be comparable with\nthe product sold by the analogue producer on the Brazilian market. This level\nof this adjustment was individually established for each of the sampled\ncompanies, where appropriate and based on the actual and verified price\ndifference between the different grades. \n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final disclosure\none sampled exporting producer came forward and claimed that parts of its\nexport sales that were sold via an unrelated trader consisted of a combination\nof A-grade and B-grade and should therefore also be adjusted to the price level\nof A-grade. It claimed that the price difference amounted to 25% and provided\ncopies of invoices and price quotations as supporting evidence. \n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, this information\nwas not provided either during the investigation, including the verification\nvisit, or after the disclosure of the Commission\u2019s provisional findings. On the\ncontrary, this producer has throughout the investigation indicated that it only\nexported A-grade products. No full price list was provided, despite being\nrequested to do so in the questionnaire, to quantify the alleged price\ndifference between the different grades, only a limited number of price\nquotations. Under such circumstances and considering the very late stage in the\nproceedings at which the information was submitted the reliability thereof is\nquestionable and cannot in any event be verified. Accordingly, the claim is\nrejected.\n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Second, as described in\nrecital (98) of the provisional Regulation it was examined whether a level of\ntrade adjustment under Article 2(10)(d) of the basic Regulation was warranted. It\nwas found that the export price is at a different level of trade from the\nnormal value as Chinese exports were essentially made at wholesale level\nwhereas the domestic sales in the analogue country were also made at a retail\nlevel. The investigation further established that on both markets the different\ndistribution channels affected the price level, thus affecting fair price\ncomparability between export price and normal value. Accordingly, in order to\nmake a fair comparison between the export price and the normal value, the latter\nwas established on a per product type basis and adjusted for each level of\ntrade by using the price differences found between the different levels of\ntrade in the analogue country. It is recalled that, where appropriate, a\nfurther level of trade adjustment was made in the provisional Regulation on the\nbasis of the price difference found in respect of quantities sold at each level\nof trade (recital (98) of the provisional Regulation). This further adjustment\nwas deemed justified as the investigation, at the provisional stage, had indicated\nthat while the majority of Chinese export sales were made in large quantities,\nthe majority of domestic sales were made in smaller quantities resulting in\nprice differences on the same level of trade. However, further investigation\nand a more detailed analysis of the domestic sales transactions in the analogue\ncountry have, contrary to the provisional findings, demonstrated that the ratio\nof small and large quantities sold by the analogue producer is similar to that\nof the Chinese exporting producers. Accordingly, this adjustment is no longer\nconsidered appropriate or justified. \n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Third,\nas described in recital (100) of the provisional Regulation the investigation\nestablished that the Brazilian producer only sells branded products on the\nBrazilian market whereas Chinese exporting producers do not export branded\nproducts but rather private label products or generic ceramic tableware and\nkitchenware. Branded products are normally perceived by customers to be\nproducts signifying a certain prestige, assured quality and design thus\ncommanding a higher market price whereas generic and/or private label products,\nwhilst having the same physical and technical characteristics, are usually sold\nat considerably lower price levels. While the additional value of a branded\nvalue cannot generally be exactly quantified in the abstract as it varies from\nbrand to brand and depends on many different factors, such as customer\nperception, brand recognition, and other non-quantifiable factors, the\nBrazilian producer has, in this particular case, confirmed that its branded\nproducts can be sold at significantly higher prices on the Brazilian market\nthan other non-branded products. Furthermore, a report concerning the Brazilian\nmarket for tableware and kitchenware products confirmed that Brazilian\ncustomers are extremely brand-orientated and that the Brazilian analogue\ncountry producer is a long established and very well-known producer. In view of\nthese elements, a downward adjustment of 40% of the domestic sales price was\nmade to the normal value pursuant to Article 2(10)(k) of the basic Regulation. \n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With\nregard to the above mentioned adjustment it is recalled that two exporting\nproducers have questioned both the basis on which the adjustment was made as\nwell as the level of the adjustment (see recital (67) above). It is however\nuncontested that a branded product commands a higher sales price than an\nidentical non-branded product and that the price comparability is thus\naffected. Moreover, in addition to the information provided by the producer in\nthe analogue country, actual and verified price data from a cooperating\nproducer in Thailand, as\nwell as information received from one Union producer after the provisional\ndisclosure, have confirmed that the level of adjustment is appropriate. In\nparticular, the market situation in Thailand was found to be comparable with\nthe Brazilian market as also in Thailand, only a few well known and\nlong-established brands exist. Therefore, these claims cannot be accepted. \n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe final disclosure no exporting producers maintained their objection to this\nadjustment while the association of complainants claimed that the branding\nadjustment is too high, in particular with regard to non-porcelain products. In\nsupport of this claim the complainant referred to price lists and information\nprovided by some Union producers.\n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the information\nsubmitted confirms the Commission\u2019s findings that the added value of a brand on\nany given market is company/brand-specific, the information provided is not\nsuch as to put into question the level of adjustment that was determined for\nthe branded products sold by the analogue producer on the domestic Brazilian\nmarket as the information provided only concerned the Union market. In view of\nthe large number of Union producers, the diversity of the Union market with its\nregional differences, also as regards brand orientation, and the high market\nshare of Chinese imports, the situation of the Union market is quite different\nto the Brazilian one. Therefore, and in light of the considerations in recitals\n(90) and (91) above, this claim cannot be accepted.\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\ndescribed in recital (101) of the provisional Regulation, further adjustments were made, where\nappropriate, in respect of transport, insurance, handling and ancillary costs,\npacking, credit, bank charges and commissions in all cases where they were\ndemonstrated to affect price comparability.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margins\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments,\nthe methodology used for calculating the dumping margins, as set out in\nrecitals (102) to (105) of the provisional Regulation, is herewith confirmed. \n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, the Commission were informed that some trading companies, which do\nnot produce the product concerned, had erroneously been named in Annex I to the\nprovisional Regulation and hence subject to the dumping duty established for\ncooperating exporting producers. The Commission informed these companies of its\nintention to have them removed from Annex I and granted them the opportunity to\nprovide comments. After having examined the comments received, several trading\ncompanies have been removed from Annex 1. Where appropriate, they have been\nreplaced with the related cooperating exporting producer.\n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\nadjustments made to the normal value and to the export price as set out in\nrecitals (67) \u2013 (94) above, and in the absence of any further comments, the\ndefinitive dumping margins, expressed as a percentage of the CIF Union frontier\nprice, duty unpaid, are as follows: \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Company || Duty \n Hunan Hualian China Industry Co., Ltd; Hunan Hualian Ebillion Industry Co., Ltd; Hunan Liling Hongguanyao China Industry Co., Ltd; Hunan Hualian Yuxiang China Industry Co., Ltd || 18,3% \n Guangxi Sanhuan Enterprise Group Holding Co., Ltd || 13,1% \n CHL Porcelain Industries Ltd || 23,4% \n Shandong Zibo Niceton-Marck Huaguang Ceramics Limited; Zibo Huatong Ceramics Co., Ltd; Shandong Silver Phoenix Co., Ltd; Niceton Ceramics (Linyi) Co., Ltd; Linyi Jingshi Ceramics Co., Ltd; Linyi Silver Phoenix Ceramics Co., Ltd; Linyi Chunguang Ceramics Co., Ltd: Linyi Zefeng Ceramics Co., Ltd || 17,6% \n Guangxi Province Beiliu City Laotian Ceramics Co., Ltd || 22,9% \n Non-sampled cooperating exporting producers || 17,9% \n All other companies || 36,1% \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 INJURY\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Period considered\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure,\nseveral interested party reiterated that the period considered should have\nstarted in 2009 instead of 2008 as the economic crisis would have started in\n2008 and the trend between 2009 and 2011 would be clear. As regards this claim,\nit is noted that 2009 does not represent a more appropriate year as the start\nof the period considered in view of the fact that the effects of the economic\ncrisis were fully felt in that year, resulting in a significant drop of\nconsumption as compared to 2008. The claim is therefore definitively rejected. \n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union production and Union\nindustry\n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a joint submission several importers questioned the\ncalculation method of the Union production figure given in recital (108) of the\nprovisional Regulation. Several interested parties repeated these comments\nafter final disclosure. In particular, they considered that the standing\nrequirement would not have been met by the complainants as the available\nPRODCOM statistics would suggest a much higher level of EU production of the\nlike product than the 240 200 tonne figure mentioned in the said recital, as a\nresult of which the complainants would represent less than 25% of EU production\nof the like product. These parties had calculated\nan EU production figure of 313 187 tonnes during the IP and they arrived at\nthis figure by using full PRODCOM data for porcelain ceramic tableware and\nkitchenware and making an 20% downwards adjustment for non porcelain ceramic\ntableware and kitchenware, by analogy to the methodology applied by the\ncomplainant and in the investigation for establishing import volumes.\n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect it should\nfirstly be noted that, in the framework of the statutory analysis of an\nanti-dumping complaint and in accordance with Article 5(4) of the basic\nRegulation, the Commission services carried out a thorough standing examination\nbefore initiation. The Commission analysed the data in the complaint and\ncontacted all known Union producers and asked them to also provide data on\nproduction as well as their position with regards the complaint and to assist\nthe Commission in the identification of other potential producers, if any.\nAssociations of producers provided information on production as well.\n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 In respect\nof this claim it is further noted that the data source and methodology for the\nUnion production figure used for each of the years of the period considered was\nalso explained in recital (107) of the provisional Regulation, i.e. in line\nwith what had been done at complaint stage it is based on data provided by the\nEuropean and national associations, cross-checked with data provided by\nindividual producers and also with other statistical sources (in particular, PRODCOM).\n\n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 As explained by the\ncomplainants during the investigation, the data provided by the European\nassociation had, as concerns porcelain products, been based on PRODCOM data for\nporcelain tableware and kitchenware as the PRODCOM code for this product\nmatched with the porcelain products covered by this investigation. As concerns\nnon-porcelain products, PRODCOM could not be used at it covered many more\nmanufactured products than the non-porcelain products covered by this\ninvestigation. Therefore, for these products, the national associations had\ncollected the relevant data based on their in-depth knowledge of their\nrespective markets and this information had been cross-checked by the European\nassociation before providing the total figures to the Commission. Those figures\nwere updated during the investigation. Moreover, a list of all known producers\nwas contained in the non-confidential file and the Commission\u2019s attention was\nonly drawn to the existence of an additional three producers in Romania. The disparity between the PRODCOM statistics and the 240 200 figure derives from\nthe fact that the product scope of this investigation does not match with the PRODCOM\nstatistical data codes as concerns non-porcelain products, i.e. it is much\nnarrower. In the case of EUROSTAT import statistics, this\ndifference could indeed be accounted for by making a 20% downward adjustment, but\nthis was not appropriate in the case of the EU production figures reported in\nthe PRODCOM database. In particular the PRODCOM figures of two Member States would\nappear to be grossly overstated if one applied the same methodology. \n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the methodology\nused by the parties concerned and referred to in recital (99) above is flawed.\nMoreover, no evidence was provided that the production as reported by any of\nthe EU Member States, including the two Member States referred to above, and\nincluded in the non-confidential file would be understated. It should also be\nnoted that for some Member States the data provided by the European association\nand used in this investigation was significantly higher than if adjusted\nPRODCOM data had been used. In view of the above, there is no reason to doubt the\nproduction figures reported in this investigation and the result of the\nexamination of standing.\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther comments, recitals (107) and (108) of the provisional Regulation are\nhereby confirmed.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union consumption\n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 In a joint submission\nseveral importers contested the Union consumption figures provided in recital\n(110) of the provisional Regulation. This claim was based on the erroneous use\nof PRODCOM statistical data for Union production and sales, as explained under\npoint 4.2 above and is therefore dismissed.\n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 However,\nwhilst checking again the Eurostat import statistics, it was found that they\nhad been updated since the imposition of provisional measures which had\nresulted in some minor changes. Therefore, for the sake of completeness, on the\nbasis of these updated Eurostat import statistics and submissions regarding\nUnion industry sales on the Union market, the Union consumption developed as\nfollows:\nTable 1\n Volume (tonnes) || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Union consumption || 826 897 || 687 587 || 750 828 || 727 411 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 83 || 91 || 88 \n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any further\ncomments, recitals (109) and (111) to (112) of the provisional Regulation are\nhereby confirmed.\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from the country\nconcerned\n4.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume, price and market\nshare of dumped imports from the country concerned\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 In a joint submission several\nimporters contested the figures provided in recital (113) of the provisional\nRegulation. This claim was based on the erroneous use of PRODCOM statistical\ndata and is therefore dismissed. \n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthe basis of the updated Eurostat import statistics (see recital (106) above),\nthe volume, market share and average prices of imports of the product concerned\ndeveloped as set out below:\nTable 2\n Imports from the PRC || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Volume of imports (tonnes) || 535 593 || 449 325 || 516 624 || 486 170 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 84 || 96 || 91 \n Market share || 64,8 % || 65,3 % || 68,8 % || 66,8% \n Average import price (EUR/tonne) || 1 274 || 1 307 || 1 473 || 1 498 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 103 || 116 || 118 \n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nupdated volumes, values and trends are almost identical to those analysed in\nthe provisional Regulation. The market share of Chinese imports increased from\n64,8% in 2008 to 66,8% in the IP. The import price increased by almost 18%\nduring the period considered, from 1 274 EUR/tonne to 1 498 EUR/tonne. \n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 One\nparty alleged a complete lack of correlation between the prices and volumes of\nChinese imports. In this respect, in accordance with Article 3(3) of the basic\nRegulation consideration shall be given to whether there has been a significant\nincrease in dumped imports, either in absolute terms or relative to production\nor consumption in the Union.\nWith regard to the effect of the dumped imports on prices, consideration shall\nbe given to whether there has been significant price undercutting by the dumped\nimports as compared with the price of a like product of the Union industry, or\nwhether the effect of such imports is otherwise to depress prices to a\nsignificant degree or prevent price increases, which would otherwise have\noccurred, to a significant degree. No one or more of these factors can\nnecessarily give decisive guidance. \n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 Within\nthe above context, the following should be noted. Firstly, at the time when the\nUnion consumption recovered (2009-2010), there was a significant price increase\nof Chinese imports \u2013 which would suggest that there is a correlation. But more\nimportantly, the development of Chinese prices during the period considered\nshould be assessed in the context of the very significant price difference\nwhich already existed in 2008 and which is illustrated by the average Chinese\nimports prices (table 2) and the average EU sales prices (table 9) reported in\nthe provisional Regulation. These high price differences are confirmed by the\nhigh levels of undercutting during the IP. The price increase, consequently,\ndid not prevent Chinese imports from gaining market share over the period\nconsidered. Indeed, these imports continued to exert a severe pressure on\nprices of EU industry which went down by 12% over the period considered. This\ncomment, therefore, cannot be accepted. \n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the evolution of\nimport price (increasing) and import volume (decreasing) from 2008 to 2011 and\nthen 2012 brought forward by one sampled group of Chinese exporting producers, the\nobserved trend of increasing average import prices cannot undermine the finding\nof injurious dumping during the IP. As concerns the development of Chinese\nimport volumes, and as already highlighted in recital (114) of the provisional\nRegulation and again in recital (109) above, the market share indicator shows\nan increase in market share of Chinese imports by 2 percentage points. Moreover,\nand as explained in more detail in recitals (116) and (117) of the provisional\nRegulation and in recital (111) above, there was important price undercutting\nby the Chinese imports.\n4.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Price undercutting\n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 Following provisional\ndisclosure, several interested parties requested more details on the price\nundercutting calculations than those already provided in recital (116) of the\nprovisional Regulation. Insofar as the sensitive nature of this information and\nthe fact that the EU producers had been granted anonymity would allow it, additional\ninformation was provided.\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 By\nanalogy to the decision made after the imposition of provisional measures to\nexclude from the export listings some \u201catypical\u201d products for the purpose of\ncalculating dumping (see recital (69) above), these products were also excluded\nfrom the export listings used for the injury calculations. This change had only\na minor effect on the undercutting margins, which remained therefore in the\nsame range as mentioned in recital (117) of the provisional Regulation.\n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther comments, recitals (113) to (117) of the provisional Regulation are\nhereby confirmed.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Situation of the Union\nindustry\n4.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General\n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties stated that\nthe fact that several injury factors improved between 2009 or 2010 and the IP\ndemonstrates that the Union industry is developing positively. However, it\nshould be noted that this analysis is incomplete and that it disregards the\nevolution of those factors during the whole period considered. The explanations\ngiven in recital (23) of the provisional Regulation are also to be taken into consideration\nin this respect. \n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 Upon request by an\ninterested party, it is confirmed that the macroeconomic indicators were\nassessed at the level of the whole Union industry, while the microeconomic ones\nwere analysed at the level of the sampled Union producers, which included\nnon-complaining companies.\n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 CCCLA submitted that the\nmicro- and macro-economic indicators presented in the provisional Regulation\nwere not representative as the total production in the Union would be much\nhigher than the figures used in this investigation. However, in view of the\nanalysis and conclusions reached under point 4.2 above, this argument is\nrejected.\n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther comments, recitals (118) to (121) of the provisional Regulation are\nhereby confirmed.\n4.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Macroeconomic indicators\n4.5.2.1.\u00a0 Production, production\ncapacity and capacity utilisation\n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in section 4.1\nabove, several importers contested the production figures provided in recital\n(122) of the provisional Regulation. However, these figures have been\ncross-checked and are confirmed.\n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther comments, recitals (122) to (124) of the provisional Regulation are\nhereby confirmed.\n4.5.2.2.\u00a0 Sales volumes and market\nshare\n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 The update in Table 2 has no\nimpact on Tables 4 and 5 of the provisional Regulation.\n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of relevant\ncomments regarding sales volumes and market share, recitals (125) and (126) of\nthe provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n4.5.2.3.\u00a0 Employment and productivity\n(125)\u00a0\u00a0 In a joint submission\nseveral importers contested the employment and productivity figures provided in\nrecitals (127) and (128) of the provisional Regulation, alleging that they were\nnot in line with the picture depicted by certain Eurostat statistics[8]. \n(126)\u00a0\u00a0 However, the figures for both\nindicators were cross-checked and deemed accurate. The figures brought forward\nby the parties were too broad and not related to the production of the like\nproduct. In the absence of any further comments regarding employment and\nproductivity, recitals (127) to (128) of the provisional Regulation are hereby\nconfirmed.\n4.5.2.4.\u00a0 Magnitude of the dumping\nmargin\n(127)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments regarding the magnitude of the dumping margin, recital (129) of the\nprovisional Regulation is hereby confirmed.\n4.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Microeconomic indicators\n4.5.3.1.\u00a0 Stocks\n(128)\u00a0\u00a0 In a joint submission\nseveral importers contested the stock figures provided in recital (130) of the\nprovisional Regulation and their relevance as compared to publicly available\ndata regarding certain Union producers. They also disagreed with the statement\nthat the Union industry basically works on orders. \n(129)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards working on\norders, the investigation confirmed that that was indeed the case for sampled\nUnion producers and that is a normal practice in the sector. Moreover, the stock\nfigures provided in the provisional Regulation concerned the verified stock\nfigure from the sampled Union producers which is considered the most reliable\nfigure.\n(130)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure the\nabove comments were reiterated, however, no new arguments were brought forward.\nIn the absence of any further comments regarding stocks, recital (130) of the\nprovisional Regulation is hereby confirmed.\n4.5.3.2.\u00a0 Sales prices\n(131)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments regarding the sales prices figures as given in the provisional Regulation,\nrecital (131) of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed.\n4.5.3.3.\u00a0 Profitability, cash flow,\ninvestments, return on investment, ability to raise capital and wages\n(132)\u00a0\u00a0 After\ndisclosure, a clerical error was discovered in the calculation of the net\nprofit of the Union industry and the return on investment (ROI). This error was\ncorrected and the revised figures are as follows:\nTable 3\n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Net profit of Union sales to unrelated customers (% of net sales turnover) || 3,8% || 2,8% || -0,5% || 3,2% \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 74 || -13 || 84 \n ROI (net profit in % of net book value of investments) || 16,4% || 6,3% || -6,8% || 20,5% \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 38 || -41 || 125 \n(133)\u00a0\u00a0 The above correction does\nnot materially affect the provisional findings as regards these two indicators.\nHowever, the weighted average profit level of the sampled producers was, during\nthe period considered, slightly lower as provisionally established as it went\ndown from 3,8% to 3,2% (instead of from 4,2% to 3,5%). Return on investment largely\nfollowed the trend observed for profit, but, as also pointed at by several\ninterested parties after final disclosure, over the period considered it developed\noverall positively instead of negatively. \n(134)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party questioned\nthe fragile state of the Union industry at the beginning of the period\nconsidered, as mentioned in recital (134) of the provisional Regulation. This\nparty claimed that only injury caused by dumping may be taken into account and\nthat no dumping has been established for any period other than 2011. However,\nthe reference to the state of the Union industry in that recital was only made\nin order to analyse whether the profit achieved in the beginning of the period\nconsidered could be taken into account as representing the profit that the\nindustry would normally achieve \u2013 quod non.\n(135)\u00a0\u00a0 Several\nparties questioned the benchmark profit level referred to in recital (135) of\nthe provisional Regulation and/or proposed other (lower) benchmarks.\n(136)\u00a0\u00a0 A group of Chinese exporting producers stated that the\nprofit level during the IP was a good profitability rate. However, this claim\nwas not substantiated. Another party also stated that the profit levels\ndisplayed in the provisional Regulation could be deemed normal levels and this\nparty based itself on the publicly available profit data of a German producer between\n1999 and 2007. Yet another interested party stated that the IP profit level\ndisplayed in the provisional Regulation could be deemed \u201cnormal\u201d on the basis\non the conclusions of a study by the Commission[9] which\nincluded profit data of a German producer between 2004 and 2007. Similar claims were received after final disclosure.\n(137)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it is\nrecalled that the provisional Regulation concluded that the profit achieved in\nthe beginning of the period considered cannot be considered as a normal profit\nas the Union industry was then, already, in a fragile state as explained in\nrecital (134) of the provisional Regulation. In addition, it was found that the\npublicly available 1999-2007 profit data of a German producer referred to above\nconcerned not only manufacturing activities of ceramic tableware and\nkitchenware, but also other important segments. As concerns the Commission\nstudy referred to in recital (136) above, in the light of the scope, the aim\nand the time of that study, this was found not to be a pertinent basis for the\ndetermination of profitability. For instance, in relation to the product\nconcerned it only referred to the profit situation of one company. Finally, all\nthree submissions referred to in recital (136), which are contradicted by the submission\nmentioned in recital (141) below, are not sufficiently substantiated. It is\ntherefore confirmed that the profit rate of 3,2% observed during the IP could\nnot be deemed acceptable for this product. \n(138)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the profit levels of the home interior design, furniture and/or food of\nthe Swedish retailing sectors should be used as a benchmark. However, given,\ninter alia, the disparity in the investment levels for the manufacturing and\nthe retailing sectors concerned, this claim should be rejected.\n(139)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, a\nparty submitted that to consider the 6% profit as found reasonable in the\nfootwear investigation also a normal profit level in the current case was not\nappropriate as it had been established in 2006, when the economic circumstances\nwere much more favourable than in 2013. This argument cannot be accepted. First\nof all, the party refers to economic circumstances in general and not to the\nspecific situation on the tableware market. It is true that the consumption\ndropped significantly in 2009 but it has recovered since to a considerable\nextent. More importantly, the development of consumption should not be\nseen in isolation. Given the high volume of dumped imports (market share of\n66,8%), the level of dumping (dumping margins ranging from 13,1% to 36,1%) and\nthe level of undercutting (ranging from 26,5% to 47,6%), the competitive\nsituation on the Union market would have been very different in case imports\nhad been made at non-dumped prices. This argument should therefore be dismissed.\n\n(140)\u00a0\u00a0 Some other parties suggested\nthe benchmark used in another anti-dumping investigation, i.e. the\ninvestigation concerning ceramic tiles[10].\nAfter final disclosure, similar comments were received. However it is noted\nthat ceramic tiles, contrary to leather footwear and tableware, cannot be\nconsidered a consumer product in the same way. For instance, the rate at which\nhouseholds buy or replace ceramic tableware items and the way it is marketed\nand, eventually, sold to the consumers is closer to leather footwear than to\nceramic tiles. The claim to use the target profit also applied in the ceramic\ntiles investigation is therefore dismissed.\n(141)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainants stated that the benchmark profit level\nshould be rather in excess of 10% because the manufacturing of table- and\nkitchenware products is a capital intensive activity which in addition requires\na high degree of new investment and innovation. Although it is confirmed that\nindeed the industry concerned is capital intensive and that it requires a\ncontinuous need for investment, the information submitted to substantiate this\nclaim could not change the benchmark provisionally used. The investigation could\nnot conclude that that benchmark would be the most appropriate for all Union producers.\n(142)\u00a0\u00a0 A\ngroup of importers contested the profitability figures in the provisional\nRegulation and calculated, based on the cost of production figures, EU sales\nprice and volume figures and the export sales prices figures in the provisional\nRegulation, profitability and reached the conclusion that the EU industry actually\nmade a profit of 6% during the IP. However, this computation was erroneous as\nit combined data from different sources (the sampled Union producers, the Union\nindustry as a whole and Eurostat).\n(143)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther relevant comments, recitals (132) to (137) of the provisional\nRegulation are hereby confirmed.\n4.5.3.4.\u00a0 Cost of production\n(144)\u00a0\u00a0 In a joint submission,\nseveral importers deemed that the cost of production figures in recital (138)\nof the provisional Regulation did not follow the labour and energy cost\nevolution shown in Eurostat. The parties highlighted that labour costs increased\nin EU27. Equally, the evolution of the cost of energy in the Union would not\nsupport a decrease in the cost of production. \n(145)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect it is noted\nthat the labour and energy cost provided by the parties was too broad.\nMoreover, the fact that the Union industry managed to decrease the cost of\nproduction during a period where the general trend was the opposite\ndemonstrates the extraordinary effort made by the Union industry to cut costs\nand remain competitive.\n(146)\u00a0\u00a0 The cost of production figures\nprovided in the provisional Regulation represent the verified cost of production\nfor sampled Union producers. In the absence of any further comments, recital\n(138) of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed.\n4.5.3.5.\u00a0 Conclusion on injury\n(147)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties contested\nthe conclusion on injury put forward in the provisional Regulation on the basis\nthat several injury indicators improved in the very last part of the period\nconsidered. However, this issue cannot undermine the fact that most injury indicators\ndeteriorated during the period considered. This deterioration of injury\nindicators can be observed for most macro-economic indicators, such as production\nvolume, capacity, sales to unrelated customers, employment as well as for the\ninjury indicators related to the financial performance of the Union industry\nsuch as profitability and investments. \n(148)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\ncomments, recitals (139) to (143) of the provisional Regulation are hereby\nconfirmed.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CAUSATION\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\n(149)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any comments\nto recital (144) of the provisional Regulation, that recital is hereby\nconfirmed.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of the dumped\nimports\n(150)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties contested\nthe conclusion stated in recital (148) of the provisional Regulation. However,\neven though some of the percentages that were highlighted in recitals (145) and\n(147) of the provisional Regulation have been slightly revised as explained\nabove, this does not alter the facts and conclusions contained in recitals\n(145) to (148) of the provisional Regulation.\n(151)\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, given the development\nof the market share of the Chinese dumped imports, it is clear that there is no\ncontradiction between recital (147) of the provisional Regulation, in\nparticular as regards the statement that the decrease in sales prices of the\nUnion industry on the Union market and its profitability can be attributed to\nthe price depression caused onto the Union market by dumped imports from China\nand the Union industry\u2019s market share movements, as alleged by one party. \n(152)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the fact that\nprices of imports from the PRC increased over the period considered, as pointed\nout by several parties, does not undermine the finding of undercutting and injurious\ndumping during the IP.\n(153)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\ncomments as regards the effect of the dumped imports, recitals (145) to (148)\nof the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of other factors\n5.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from third countries\nother than the country concerned\n(154)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital (106)\nabove, following the imposition of provisional measures, the Eurostat data\nconcerning imports had been updated. Whilst cross-checking these new data with\nthe previous data contained in the provisional Regulation, a clerical error in\nthe computation of the import figures from Thailand and Turkey was detected. This has been corrected and, consequently, the definitive figures concerning\nthe imports of the like product from third countries, based on Eurostat data, are\nas follows: \nTable 4\n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Volume of imports from all other third countries (tonnes) || 100 972 || 81 464 || 81 595 || 89 146 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 81 || 81 || 88 \n Market share || 12,2% || 11,8% || 10,9% || 12,3% \n Average import price (EUR/tonne) || 2 378 || 2 354 || 2 590 || 2 519 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 99 || 109 || 106 \n Volume of imports from Turkey (tonnes) || 26 978 || 25 303 || 25 485 || 29 336 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 94 || 94 || 109 \n Market share || 3,3% || 3,7% || 3,4% || 4% \n Average import price (EUR/tonne) || 2 776 || 2 649 || 2 802 || 2 855 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 95 || 101 || 103 \n Volume of imports from Thailand (tonnes) || 25 916 || 20 660 || 20 600 || 25 213 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 80 || 79 || 97 \n Market share || 3,1% || 3% || 2,7% || 3,5% \n Average import price (EUR/tonne) || 1 246 || 1 183 || 1 403 || 1 356 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 95 || 113 || 109 \n(155)\u00a0\u00a0 The imports from third\ncountries decreased by 12% over the period considered, while the market share\nof these imports remained rather stable.\n(156)\u00a0\u00a0 It should be noted that\naverage import prices from other third countries increased by 6% during the\nperiod considered, remaining consistently higher than the average selling price\nof Chinese export sales (by 68% during the IP).\n(157)\u00a0\u00a0 Before the publication of\nthe provisional Regulation, CCCLA observed that imports from Turkey would have increased\nby 8% between 2010 and 2011, the import prices from Turkey being allegedly only\naround 20% higher than import prices from China. Then several parties contested\nthe conclusion of the provisional Regulation as regards Turkish imports. \n(158)\u00a0\u00a0 Bearing in mind that there\nwas a material manifest error in the reporting of Turkish imports in the\nprovisional Regulation and the updated data as displayed above, nothing suggests\nthat Turkish imports, given their prices and their market share, can break the\ncausal link between Chinese exports of the product concerned and the injury\nsuffered by the Union industry. It should also be noted that the non-inclusion\nof imports originating in Turkey in the complaint cannot be described as\ndiscriminatory as, at initiation stage, sufficient evidence of dumping, injury\nand causal link was not present as far as imports from Turkey were concerned.\n(159)\u00a0\u00a0 The market share of imports\nfrom Thailand was never more than 3,5% during the investigation period. \n(160)\u00a0\u00a0 For the above reasons, it is\nconcluded that imports from other third countries did not materially affect the\nsituation of the Union industry to the extent breaking the casual link between\nthe dumped imports from PRC and the injury suffered by the Union industry.\n5.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market segments\n(161)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any new\ncomments as regards market segments, recitals (156) to (158) of the provisional\nRegulation are hereby confirmed.\n5.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumption and demand\n(162)\u00a0\u00a0 A party suggested that injury\ncould be attributed to a long term reduction in demand for Union produced\nproducts. Yet the investigation did not confirm such trend, as already\nexplained in recital (112) of the provisional Regulation. \n(163)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther comments as regards consumption and demand, recitals (159) to (166) of\nthe provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n5.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exports by Union industry\n(164)\u00a0\u00a0 A party pointed out that average\nEU export prices were lower than the average sales prices on the Union market\nduring the period considered. This could have affected the ability of the Union\nindustry to make new investments or hire new staff. A similar argument was\nreiterated after definitive disclosure. However, as already mentioned in\nrecital (169) of the provisional Regulation, most of the injury indicators\ncannot be affected by the performance on the export sales. Moreover, it could\nalso be argued that these sales were a way of compensating, partly, the injury\nsuffered on the Union market. Further, as the average prices have been\ncalculated by dividing the total value of the sales of the like product by the\ntotal volume of such sales, a different product mix of the sales on the EU\nmarket as compared to the export sales can also result in significant\ndifferences in average sales values overall. Finally, these export sales\nrepresented less than 37% of the EU industry's overall sales volumes, i.e. the\ndominant market for the Union industry was still, by far and large, the Union\nhome market. The argument that these export sales injured the Union industry to\nthe extent breaking a causal link between the imports from PRC and injury\nsuffered by EU industry is therefore rejected.\n(165)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any new comments\nas regards the exports by the Union industry, recitals (167) to (170) of the\nprovisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n5.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Elimination of the import\nquotas \n(166)\u00a0\u00a0 Following provisional\nmeasures, another party suggested that the elimination of import quotas would\nhave had an impact on Union producers during the period considered. However, no\nnew facts were brought forward that could alter the conclusion in recital (173)\nof the provisional Regulation.\n(167)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any new substantiated\ncomments as regards the elimination of import quotas, recitals (171) to (173)\nof the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n5.3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anti-competitive practices\non the Union market\n(168)\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent to the imposition\nof provisional measures, several parties insisted that the cartel investigation\nlaunched by the German authorities referred to in recital (175) of the provisional\nRegulation or the cartel fine referred to in the same recital had not duly been\ntaken into account. Concerning these claims, the following can be said further\nto what is already stated in recitals (174) and (175) of the provisional\nRegulation.\n(169)\u00a0\u00a0 The German cartel\ninvestigation, which investigates alleged price fixing from July 2005 to\nFebruary 2008, is still on-going. As the EU producers have been granted\nconfidentiality and in view of the fact that the final results of the German\non-going investigation have not publicly been released yet, it is not possible\nto comment on the details of the analysis carried out. However it can be\nconfirmed that none of the sampled Union producers is subject to this on-going\ninvestigation. The investigation also concluded that the micro-economic\nindicators have not been affected by the investigated practices and the\nmacro-economic indicators only to a very limited extent, if any.\n(170)\u00a0\u00a0 As concerns the cartel\nfindings concerning bathroom fixtures and fittings, it is recalled that this\nprice fixing cartel was found active between 1992 and 2004 and that only one of\nthe fined producers is also active in the tableware and kitchenware sector. The\ndata provided by this producer in the framework of standing and injury are not\ninfluenced by the cartel practices as only the data concerning the tableware\nand kitchenware section of this producer have been used and not its\nconsolidated data. Therefore, also the fine relating to this cartel has not\naffected the data provided by this producer. It is further recalled that the\nprice fixing period was well before the period considered. Since the Union\nproducers\u2019 identities are confidential, it cannot be disclosed whether or not\nthis company is included in the sample. However, should a sampled Union\nproducer have recorded in its accounts any items (e.g. a cartel fine)\ndistorting its injury picture for the purpose of this investigation, the\ninvestigating authority would have isolated them in order for the relevant\ninjury factors not to be distorted. \n(171)\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, the\nallegations concerning the impact of the above-mentioned cartel investigations\non the injury and causation analysis are hereby rejected. \n(172)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nmentioned that there would be illegal price arrangements and market allocations\nbetween Union producers, however it did not provide any evidence for this\nallegation and the claim is therefore rejected.\n(173)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any new\ncomments concerning anti-competitive practices on the Union market, recitals\n(174) to (176) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n5.3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production methods\n(174)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any new\ncomments concerning production methods, recitals (177) to (178) of the\nprovisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n(175)\u00a0\u00a0 An importer repeated similar\nclaims after definitive disclosure, arguing about the difference in production\nmethods used by Union producers as compared to more artisanal methods of\nChinese factories. However, no substantive argument was brought forward that\ncould alter the conclusion reached in recital (178) of the provisional\nRegulation and the claim is therefore definitively rejected.\n5.3.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Second-hand markets\n(176)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any new\ncomments as regards second-hand markets, recitals (179) to (180) of the\nprovisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n5.3.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic crisis\n(177)\u00a0\u00a0 A party stated that recital (183)\nof the provisional Regulation provides a wrong analysis of the situation during\nthe economic recovery period between 2010 and 2011 and that the impact of the\neconomic crisis was underestimated. These comments were repeated after final\ndisclosure. However, the claims were unsubstantiated. It must also be stressed\nthat the recital cited stated that dumped imports from China intensified the effect of the economic downturn. As regards the impact of the economic\ncrisis, recital (184) of the provisional Regulation is clear about the fact\nthat the economic crisis may have contributed to the Union\u2019s industry poor\nperformance, even though it could not break the causal link between the dumped\nimports and the injurious situation of that industry suffered during the IP.\n(178)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any new\ncomments regarding the economic crisis, recitals (181) to (184) of the\nprovisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n5.3.10.\u00a0\u00a0 Other factors\n(179)\u00a0\u00a0 In a joint submission, several\nimporters alleged that the drop in employment was a normal development in the\nconsumer goods industry. However, this claim was not substantiated. Moreover, even\nif such trend would be normal in this sector, it could not break the causal\nlink between the dumped imports from the PRC and the significant jobs losses in\nthe sector. This claim is, therefore, rejected.\n(180)\u00a0\u00a0 A party claimed that the remaining\nstructural deficits of the Union industry in conjunction with existing\novercapacity as shown in Table 3 of the provisional Regulation could break the\ncausal link between dumped imports from the PRC and injury suffered by Union\nmanufacturers. As regards this argument, although the Union industry was\nalready in a fragile state in the beginning of the period considered and had\ngone through a restructuration, the investigation confirmed that it was competitive\nand properly coping with demand from all markets. As to Table 3 of the\nprovisional Regulation, the drop in production must be seen in conjunction with\nthe pressure stemming from the high volume of low-priced imports from the PRC,\nas exports by the Union industry remained stable. Therefore, the claim could\nnot be accepted.\n(181)\u00a0\u00a0 A party considered that the Commission\nhad failed to consider the cumulative effect of each of the other injurious\nfactors. This claim was also raised by several parties after definitive\ndisclosure. However, given the results of the investigation in relation to the\nvarious other factors invoked, it is not conceivable that their cumulative\neffect could have broken the causal link. Indeed, for most of the other factors\nraised, their impact was small, if any.\n(182)\u00a0\u00a0 A party considered that the\ninvestigating authority had failed to distinguish between co-occurrence and\ncausality. Yet the supporting information provided was far from being\nconclusive in this respect and the claim is therefore rejected.\n(183)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any new\ncomments as regards other factors, recitals (185) to (190) of the provisional\nRegulation are hereby confirmed.\n5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on causation\n(184)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any new\ncomments, recital (191) of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UNION INTEREST\n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(185)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments to recital (192) of the provisional Regulation, that recital is hereby\nconfirmed.\n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the Union\nindustry\n(186)\u00a0\u00a0 A Polish non-complainant\nproducer welcomed the measures, whereas a UK non-complainant manufacturer with\nimporting interests of the product concerned opposed them. The second party\ndeems that duties would have a negative effect on those producers that\ncomplement their product range with imports from the PRC and have adapted to\nglobalisation via a business model where high value-added work is done in the Union. In addition customers would be less inclined to purchase their products because they\nwould not offer a full range of products anymore.\n(187)\u00a0\u00a0 As far as the claim of the\nsecond party is concerned, the situation of that company was examined. It was\nfound that Chinese imports of tableware constituted a minor part of their total\nimports. The company claimed however, without further specifying it, that these\nimports were important for them. The company did not give any figures about\ntheir own production. According to the financial statements, the company had in\n2011 a pre-tax profit on total turnover of more than 10%, most of it achieved\non non-EU markets (no figure was provided for the product concerned). On this\nbasis, it is not expected that the imposition of measures endangers the\nviability of this company. As far as the claim that many other companies would\nalso encounter difficulties as a result of the measures, no specific evidence\nwas provided. Moreover, according to the replies received during the pre-initiation\nstanding phase and submissions received subsequently, there is no indication\nthat there is a significant number companies is in such a situation. \n(188)\u00a0\u00a0 The impact of duties on the\nmanufacturing activities of the Union industry would be positive. In fact, since\nthe recent imposition of provisional anti-dumping duties, several positive\ndevelopments in this respect have been reported. \n(189)\u00a0\u00a0 The above-mentioned positive\ndevelopments confirm the complainants\u2019 statement that Union production could be\nsubstantially increased at very short notice by using plants, machinery and\nworkforce already available, whereas larger increases would be feasible in the\nlonger run. Redressing unfair price practices in the market therefore benefits\nthem since a new pricing level would makes it more attractive to manufacture\nmore products in the Union, be it in large or small orders, special designs or\nmainstream unbranded products. It results in the creation of new jobs involving\nskills of different kinds and relevant idle workforce can be put back to work. \n(190)\u00a0\u00a0 As to the impossibility of\noffering a full range of products, this statement cannot be upheld because\nconsumers require ever-changing ranges of products and the existence of several\nsupply sources.\n(191)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any others\ncomments as regards the interest of the Union industry, recitals (193) to (198)\nof the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of unrelated\nimporters\n(192)\u00a0\u00a0 The two largest importers in\nthe sample contested their level of co-operation as regards full profitability\ndata and the margin between purchase and resale prices to unrelated customers,\nwhereas one of them questioned having denied access to its accounts and argued\nthat nothing would have changed if access would have been given. The parties\nclaimed that their size and business model did not allow them to provide data\nas detailed as requested. At definitive stage, it is confirmed that one of them\ndenied again access to its importer\u2019s accounts and that both, despite having\nendeavoured to do so, did not manage to provide full and usable profitability\ndata and information about the margin between purchase and resale prices to\nunrelated customers in such a way that it could be used by the institutions in\nthe analysis of the situation of unrelated importers. The limited information\nprovided by both companies on their purchase and resale prices, be it overall\ninconclusive, was fully in line, however, with the general mark-up information\nobtained and summarized in recital (202) of the provisional Regulation.\n(193)\u00a0\u00a0 In recital (203) of the\nprovisional Regulation, interested parties had been invited to submit\nadditional, comprehensive and verifiable data to further analyse the impact of\nmeasures on the supply chain. \n(194)\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent to provisional\nmeasures, new replies to the importers questionnaire were sent by two unrelated\nimporters. Also submissions on Union interest were received from other\nnon-sampled importers, an association of European and International Commerce\n(Foreign Trade Association), a Swedish association of importers, wholesalers\nand retailers (Svensk Handel), CCCLA and a Union producer with importing interests.\nNone of the submissions contained conclusive data as to the impact of measures\non the supply chain.\n(195)\u00a0\u00a0 A party claimed that the\ndownstream employment figure affected by the duties was understated in view of\nthe fact that Eurostat statistics show that overall distributive trade\nenterprises employ more people (33 million) than manufacturing companies (31\nmillion). However, the figures provided related to the importing and\nmanufacturing business in general and could not be used for the purpose of this\ninvestigation.\n(196)\u00a0\u00a0 In a joint submission,\nseveral importers claimed that the five sampled importers employed more than 10\n000 jobs relating to the product concerned and not 350 as mentioned in recital\n(200) of the provisional Regulation. The figures have been checked again. It\nshould be underlined that within the analysis of the interests of importers, the\nnumber of jobs relating to the importation and resale of the product concerned,\nincluding supporting functions, is taken into account. The employment related\nto other products or origins, or relating to activities like wholesaling or\nretailing should, obviously, not be included in such number. It is recalled\nthat, earlier in the proceeding, a group of 14 importers had estimated the relevant\nnumber of jobs involved at importers\u2019 level, overall, at 7 000. That figure\nseems to be in the right order of magnitude based on an extrapolation of the\nsituation of the sampled importers to the extent that their figures could be\nused.\n(197)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties complained\nabout the high gross margin figure contained in recital (202) of the\nprovisional Regulation, alleging it would be misleading. However, the\ninvestigation has shown that the vast majority of the importers which replied\nto the importers' sampling questions reported a gross margin between purchase\nand resale price ranging between 50% and 200% and the sampled importers were in\na similar situation. Moreover, following provisional disclosure, the\ncomplainants submitted several examples supporting the information given by the\npublication referred to in recital (202) of the provisional Regulation, i.e.\nconfirming the import price \u2013 retail price ratio of the product concerned. \n(198)\u00a0\u00a0 A UK manufacturer with\nimporting interests explained that those margins are needed to cover certain\ncosts incurred in the Union. No data was provided which would have allowed for\na calculation of those margins on the basis of turnover.\n(199)\u00a0\u00a0 As from only three of the sampled\nimporters usable profit data on the importing activities relating to the\nproduct concerned could be obtained and verified and these three importers represented\nonly some 3% of the imports of the product concerned, the weighted average profit\nfigure concerned was not considered conclusive and had, therefore, not been\nmentioned in the provisional Regulation. However, it should be noted that this\nweighted average profit was healthy (between 6% and 10% - range given for\nconfidentiality reasons). \n(200)\u00a0\u00a0 An importer claimed that\nthere is not enough production of coloured stoneware in the Union and that it had\nno alternative but importing from the PRC. The same claim was made after\ndisclosure. Yet the investigation established that coloured stoneware can be\nprocured from several sources, including Union producers. Moreover, Union\nproducers have the production capacity to sell more on the Union market. \n(201)\u00a0\u00a0 The information collected in\nthe course of the investigation did not allow a proper quantification as to\nwhat extent importers would be able to pass on purchase price increases as a\nresult of the proposed duty levels. However, should imports from the PRC be\nsubject to a definitive anti-dumping duty and given the information about the\ngross and net margins, there is nothing to suggest that the viability of\nimporters' business is endangered. An importer also suggested that large market\noperators and importers whose core business is not ceramic tableware and\nkitchenware would not be negatively affected. \n(202)\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore concluded\nthat the imposition of measures at the proposed levels does not have a\nsignificantly adverse impact on the situation of unrelated importers of the\nproduct concerned as a whole.\n(203)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nadditional new comments as regards the interest of unrelated importers,\nrecitals (199) to (211) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n6.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of other economic\nsectors\n(204)\u00a0\u00a0 Further to the invitation\ncontained in recital (203) of the provisional Regulation, on the day of the\npublication of provisional measures the Commission contacted directly relevant retailers\nand associations of retailers, importers with possible retailing activity and also\ndesigners that were known to the Commission and invited them to fill in\nrelevant questionnaires. Some recipients that had initially claimed to be\nretailers replied that they were not concerned by the investigation because\nthey were not active in the business. The Commission eventually received seven\nnew replies to the retailers\u2019 questionnaire. These seven retailers accounted\nfor 1% of imports from the PRC during the IP. Most of these replies were\ndeficient in many respects but they were nevertheless analysed as far as\npossible. No replies were received to the designers\u2019 questionnaire. \n(205)\u00a0\u00a0 The information thus\nobtained did not, in substance, provide any new evidence on the interest of\nother economic sectors that could contest the conclusion reached in recital (217)\nof the provisional Regulation.\n(206)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the publication of\nprovisional measures, submissions on Union interest as regards other economic\nsectors were received from both sampled and non-sampled importers (including a\nPolish importer active in the promotional items sector), an association of\nEuropean and International Commerce (Foreign Trade Association), a Swedish\nassociation of importers, wholesalers and retailers (Svensk Handel), several\nretailers, CCCLA and eight coffee roasting companies (seven of them located in\nItaly, one with its headquarter in Austria).\n(207)\u00a0\u00a0 Coffee roasting companies\nclaimed that due to the very small number of Union producers serving their\nmarket (maximum 5), most of which would be importing from the PRC either\ndirectly or through sister companies, and the very large number of coffee\nroasters (1 500 \u2013 3 000), measures at the level proposed at provisional stage\ncould impede them from sourcing the exactly same items in the future. This\nclaim cannot be accepted. First, the definitive measures are lower than\nprovisional measures. Second, the investigation revealed that Union producers were\nin a position to further deploy their production potential and further serve\nthe coffee roasting industry, should the injury caused by dumped imports from the\nPRC be removed. Given the large number of Union producers, it is very likely\nthat the number of Union producers that could take in orders from coffee\nroasting companies would be more than five.\n(208)\u00a0\u00a0 The coffee roasting\ncompanies argued that anti-dumping measures would damage their exports because\nof a loss of competitiveness and a possible retaliation by the Chinese\nauthorities. However, there is no evidence to indicate that the level of\nmeasures imposed would entail such loss of competitiveness, also bearing in\nmind that other WTO members have anti-dumping measures affecting this kind of\nproduct. The retaliatory action allegation was also found to be unsubstantiated.\n(209)\u00a0\u00a0 The coffee roasting\ncompanies stated that the anti-dumping measures would unavoidably lead to a\ngeneral reduction in their business, to a decrease of their sales, to a general\nincrease of the coffee price in the HORECA (hotels, restaurants and catering) sector\nand to a decrease in the quality of the products and services. All this would, allegedly,\nput at risk a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs. However, bearing\nin mind what the core business of the coffee roasting companies is and the\nconclusions as regards the effects of measures on the supply chain, these\nallegations cannot be upheld. It is also noted that providing the total number\nof jobs linked to the worldwide operations of a coffee roasting company cannot\nbe deemed an appropriate calculation basis for the number of jobs that would be\nat risk because of the imposition of anti-dumping measures.\n(210)\u00a0\u00a0 Two retailers claimed that there\nis not enough production of new bone china and bone china in the Union and that\nthey had no alternative but importing from the PRC. The same claim was made by\nan association of importers after disclosure. Firstly and in general it should\nbe noted that anti-dumping measures aim at restoring fair trade and not at\nblocking imports. In this case, the level of measures cannot be considered\nprohibitive. Secondly, the investigation established that these products can be\nprocured from several sources, including Union producers. Finally, Union\nproducers have the production capacity to sell more on the Union market and\ncould further exploit their potential, should anti-dumping measures be\ndefinitively imposed. \n(211)\u00a0\u00a0 One retailer claimed that\nmeasures would have a negative impact on certain objects serving the tourist\nmarket. Yet, no substantive information could support that claim. Also the\nweight of the objects in question in the sector is limited.\n(212)\u00a0\u00a0 An importer and wholesaler\nalleged that the imposition of measures would lead to a vertical consolidation\nof the market by some large players. However, given the current number of\nplayers, this would be unlikely in the short-to-medium term.\n(213)\u00a0\u00a0 Further to the issues\nalready dealt with in the provisional Regulation, it is noted that several\nparties found that the interest of smaller companies, such as retailers,\ndistributors and businesses dealing with promotional items, had not been sufficiently\ntaken into consideration. This claim was reiterated after definitive disclosure\nby several parties. It must be recognised that, overall, micro and small\nbusinesses could be more vulnerable to any price increase as a result of\nanti-dumping duties. However there is no evidence that the level of measures\nimposed will have a significant negative effect on the other economic actors\nthat qualify as SMEs. The claim is therefore definitively rejected.\n(214)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nadditional comments as regards the interest of other economic sectors, recitals\n(212) to (217) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n6.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of consumers\n(households)\n(215)\u00a0\u00a0 Despite having been contacted\nby the Commission, no parties directly representing the interests of end-buyers\nsuch as associations of consumers made any representations.\n(216)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties contested\nthe conclusion of recital (222) of the provisional Regulation as regards higher\nprices. Similar claims were made after definitive disclosure. \n(217)\u00a0\u00a0 In the unlikely event that\nthe duty is fully passed onto consumers and, assuming that import levels and\nprices remain the same, the anti-dumping duties would mean a yearly extra cost per\nhousehold of less than 1 Euro. Such calculation is based on the IP import\nvolumes and values, the proposed level of the duties and the number of\nhouseholds in the Union.\n(218)\u00a0\u00a0 Such effect cannot be deemed\nenough to outweigh the positive impact on the Union industry derived from limiting\nthe injury caused by dumped imports from the PRC. \n(219)\u00a0\u00a0 A party alleged that as a\nconsequence of measures there would be a shortage of cheaper tableware. This\nclaim was reiterated after definitive disclosure. Yet this claim cannot be\nupheld because, as stated in recital (157) of the provisional Regulation, the\nUnion industry serves all markets (including cheaper tableware).\n(220)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nadditional comments as regards the interest of consumers (households), recitals\n(218) to (226) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n6.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on Union\ninterest \n(221)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, the\nassessment in the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed.\n(222)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, recitals (227) to\n(229) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES\n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injury elimination level\n(223)\u00a0\u00a0 It was claimed that the\nprofit margin used to calculate the amount of duty necessary to remove the\neffects of the injurious dumping was too high. This claim was rejected as\nexplained in section 4.5.3.3 above. \n(224)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties questioned\nthe target profit used for the calculation of the injury margin. These comments\nare addressed in recitals (135) to (142) above. On the basis of the analysis of\nthose comments it is concluded that the target profit of 6% should be\nmaintained.\n(225)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\ncomments concerning the injury elimination level, the methodology described in\nrecitals (230) to (234) of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed.\n7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive measures\n(226)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\nreached with regard to dumping, injury, causation and Union interest, and in\naccordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, definitive anti-dumping\nmeasures should be imposed on imports of the product concerned at the level of\nthe lower of the dumping and the injury margins, in accordance with the lesser\nduty rule. Accordingly, all duty rates should be set at the level of the\ndumping margins.\n(227)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsmall adjustment referred to in recitals (115) and (132) above resulted in\nslightly revised underselling margins as reflected in the injury margins listed\nbelow. The proposed definitive anti-dumping duties are the following:\n Company || Dumping margin || Injury margin || Definitive duty rate \n Hunan Hualian China Industry Co., Ltd; Hunan Hualian Ebillion Industry Co., Ltd; Hunan Liling Hongguanyao China Industry Co., Ltd and Hunan Hualian Yuxiang China Industry Co., Ltd || 18,3% || 44,8% || 18,3% \n Guangxi Sanhuan Enterprise Group Holding Co., Ltd || 13,1% || 92,6% || 13,1% \n CHL Porcelain Industries Ltd || 23,4% || 110,1% || 23,4% \n Shandong Zibo Niceton-Marck Huaguang Ceramics Limited; Zibo Huatong Ceramics Co., Ltd; Shandong Silver Phoenix Co., Ltd; Niceton Ceramics (Linyi) Co., Ltd; Linyi Jingshi Ceramics Co., Ltd; Linyi Silver Phoenix Ceramics Co., Ltd; Linyi Chunguang Ceramics Co., Ltd, and Linyi Zefeng Ceramics Co., Ltd || 17,6% || 79,1% || 17,6% \n Guangxi Province Beiliu City Laotian Ceramics Co., Ltd || 22,9% || 45,7% || 22,9% \n All other co-operating exporting producers || 17,9% || 79,0% || 17,9% \n All other companies || 36,1% || 110,1% || 36,1% \n(228)\u00a0\u00a0 The individual company\nanti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation were established on the\nbasis of the findings of the present investigation. Therefore, they reflect the\nsituation found during that investigation in respect to these companies. These\nduty rates (as opposed to the country-wide duty applicable to \u2018all other\ncompanies\u2019) are thus exclusively applicable to imports of the products\noriginating in the PRC and produced by the companies and thus by the specific\nlegal entities mentioned. Imports of the product concerned manufactured by any\nother company not specifically mentioned in the operative part of this\nRegulation with its name, including entities related to those specifically\nmentioned, cannot benefit from these rates and shall be subject to the duty\nrate applicable to \u2018all other companies\u2019.\n(229)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to minimise the\nrisks of circumvention due to the high difference in the duty rates, it is\nconsidered that special measures are needed in this case to ensure the proper\napplication of the anti-dumping duties. These special measures include the\npresentation to the Customs authorities of the Member States of a valid\ncommercial invoice, which shall conform to the requirements set out in the\nAnnex II to this Regulation. Imports not accompanied by such an invoice shall\nbe made subject to the residual anti-dumping duty applicable to all other\nexporters.\n(230)\u00a0\u00a0 Should the exports by one of\nthe companies benefiting from lower individual duty rates increase\nsignificantly in volume after the imposition of the measures concerned, such an\nincrease in volume could be considered as constituting in itself a change in\nthe pattern of trade due to the imposition of measures within the meaning of\nArticle 13(1) of the basic Regulation. In such circumstances and provided the\nconditions are met an anti-circumvention investigation may be initiated. This\ninvestigation may, inter alia, examine the need for the removal of individual\nduty rates and the consequent imposition of a country-wide duty.\n(231)\u00a0\u00a0 Any claim requesting the\napplication of an individual anti-dumping duty rate (e.g. following a change in\nthe name of the entity or following the setting up of new production or sales\nentities) should be addressed to the Commission[11] forthwith with all relevant\ninformation, in particular any modification in the company\u2019s activities linked\nto production, domestic and export sales associated with, for instance, that\nname change or that change in the production and sales entities. If\nappropriate, this Regulation will then be amended accordingly by updating the\nlist of companies benefiting from individual anti-dumping duty rates.\n(232)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a proper\nenforcement of the anti- dumping duty, the country-wide duty level should not\nonly apply to the non-cooperating exporting producers but also to those\nproducers which did not have any exports to the Union during the IP.\n(233)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure equal\ntreatment between any new exporters and the cooperating companies not included\nin the sample, mentioned in Annex I to this Regulation, provision should be\nmade for the weighted average duty imposed on the latter companies to be\napplied to any new exporters which would otherwise be entitled to a review\npursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation.\n(234)\u00a0\u00a0 All\nparties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of\nwhich it was intended to recommend the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping\nduty on imports of ceramic tableware and kitchenware originating in the PRC and the definitive\ncollection of the amounts secured by way of the provisional duty (final\ndisclosure). All parties were granted a period within which they could make\ncomments on the final disclosure. \n(235)\u00a0\u00a0 The oral and written\ncomments submitted by the interested parties were considered and taken into\naccount where appropriate.\n7.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive collection of\nprovisional anti-dumping duties\n(236)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the magnitude of\nthe dumping margins found and given the level of the injury caused to the Union\nindustry, it is considered necessary that the amounts secured by way of the\nprovisional anti-dumping duty, imposed by the provisional Regulation, be\ndefinitively collected to the extent of the amount of the definitive duties\nimposed,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1. A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby\nimposed on imports of ceramic tableware and kitchenware, excluding ceramic\nknives, ceramic condiment or spice mills and their ceramic grinding parts, ceramic\npeelers, ceramic knife sharpeners and cordierite ceramic pizza-stones of a kind\nused for baking pizza or bread, currently falling within CN codes ex 6911 10\n00, ex 6912 00 10, ex 6912 00 30, ex 6912 00 50 and ex 6912 00 90 (TARIC codes\n6911 10 00 90, 6912 00 10 11, 6912 00 10 91, 6912 00 30 10, 6912 00 50 10 and\n6912 00 90 10) and originating in the People's Republic of China.\n2.
