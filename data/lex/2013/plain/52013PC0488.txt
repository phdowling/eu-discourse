At the end of the\nnegotiations a new Protocol was initialled on 10 May 2012. The new protocol\ncovers a period of two years as from 1 January 2013.\nSpecifically, the Protocol provides for\nfishing opportunities for 34 surface longliners of a tonnage greater than 100\nGT and for 22 surface longliners of a tonnage less than 100 GT.\nPart of the longliners\u2019 catches consists of sharks which, in\nterms of fisheries, are associated with tuna and similar species and are\ncovered by measures adopted by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC).\nBased on the latest opinions and\nrecommendations of the Scientific Committee of the IOTC, and taking into\naccount the vulnerability to fishing pressure of the shark species concerned,\nthe Parties find it appropriate to limit the catches of these species in the\nMadagascar fishing zone to a level below, or equal to, the level of recent\nyears.\nAt the most recent meeting of the Joint\nCommittee set up under the Fisheries Agreement, the Parties thus agreed to set\nthe level of authorised shark catches by EU longliners at a maximum of 200\ntonnes annually for two years as from 1 January 2013, thereby freezing the\nfishing pressure on the basis of track records for the EU fleet, as validated\nfor the 2007-11 period by scientific institutes in the EU.\nThe method for allocating fishing\nopportunities among the Member States thus needs to be defined.\nThe Commission proposes, on this basis,\nthat the Council adopt the Regulation below.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Member States were consulted in the\nframework of the Council Working Party on Fisheries, and at technical meetings\nboth ahead of and in parallel to the Joint Committee meeting. The consultations\nled to the conclusion that tighter restrictions should be applied to shark\ncatches, inter alia by setting a catch limit in accordance with the\nmeasures adopted by the IOTC. \n2013/0228 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Council Regulation (EU) No\n1258/2012 of 28 November 2012 on the allocation of the fishing opportunities\nunder the Protocol agreed between the European Union and the Republic of\nMadagascar setting out fishing opportunities and the financial contribution\nprovided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the two parties\ncurrently in force\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3)\nthereof,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EU) No\n1258/2012 of 28 November 2012 on the allocation of the fishing opportunities\nunder the Protocol agreed between the European Union and the Republic of\nMadagascar setting out fishing opportunities and the financial contribution\nprovided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the two parties\ncurrently in force,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\nOn 15 November 2007, the Council adopted\nRegulation (EC) No 31/2008 on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership\nAgreement between the European Community and the Republic of Madagascar\n(hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Partnership Agreement\u2019). \nA new Protocol to the Partnership Agreement\nwas initialled on 10 May 2012 (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018new Protocol\u2019).\nThe new Protocol grants EU vessels fishing opportunities in waters in which\nMadagascar exercises its sovereignty or jurisdiction with regard to fishing. \nOn 28 November 2012 the Council adopted\nDecision No 826/2012/EU[2]\non the signing and provisional application of the new Protocol. \nAt a meeting held on 26 September 2012, the\nJoint Committee set up under Article 9 of the Partnership Agreement examined\nthe issue of sharks caught in association with fisheries managed by the Indian\nOcean Tuna Commission (IOTC). IOTC Resolution 05/05 deals with the management\nand conservation of such sharks, and fishing them is authorised within the\nframework of this Agreement.\nAt the Joint Committee meeting the Parties\nagreed, on the basis of track records for the period 2007-11 of longliners\nauthorised to fish under the previous protocol to the Partnership Agreement, as\nvalidated by the relevant scientific institutes, that it would be appropriate\nto limit shark catches by these vessels to a maximum of 200 tonnes annually for\ntwo years as from 1 January 2013, thereby freezing the fishing pressure on\nthese shark stocks in line with the recommendation issued by the IOTC\nScientific Committee.\nThe method for allocating shark catches\namong the Member States should be defined for the period of application of the\nProtocol currently in force by amending Council Regulation (EU) No 1258/2012 of\n28 November 2012. \nThe Member States whose vessels are\nauthorised to fish under this Regulation should have the possibility to\nexchange all or part of the fishing opportunities allocated to them with\nrespect to sharks. \nGiven that the Protocol entered into force\non a provisional basis on 1 January 2013, this Regulation should apply\nretroactively from that date,\nHAS ADOPTED\nTHIS REGULATION: \nArticle 1\n1. The following paragraph 1a shall be added in Article 1 of\nRegulation (EU) No 1258/2012: \n\u20181a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fishing opportunities for\nsharks caught in association with fisheries managed by the Indian Ocean Tuna\nCommission (IOTC) in the context of surface longline fishing are hereby set at\n200 tonnes per year, to be allocated among the Member States as follows:\n || Member State || tonnes \n || Spain || 166 \n || Portugal || 27 \n || France || 7 \n || Total || 200 \n\u2019\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\nthe day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European\nUnion. \nIt shall apply with effect from 1 January\n2013.\nThis Regulation\nshall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adopted by the General Affairs Council on 24 April\n2012. \n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 361, 31.12.2012, p. 11.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
