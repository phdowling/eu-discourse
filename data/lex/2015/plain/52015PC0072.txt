The Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin tuna\r\nentered into force on 20 May 1994. \nThe CCSBT Extended Commission was created\r\nin April 2001 to allow fishing entities other than states to participate in the\r\nworks of the CCSBT. Currently the CCSBT Extended Commission includes all\r\nmembers of the CCSBT plus fishing entities. In practice the CCSBT adopts the\r\ndecisions taken by the Extended Commission without further discussion. \nThe European Union has been a Cooperating\r\nNon-Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission since 2006. Cooperating Non-Members\r\nparticipate fully in the activities of the CCSBT but are not entitled to vote.\r\nThe status of Cooperating Non-Member requires adherence to the management and\r\nconservation measures of the CCSBT.\nThe EU fleet does not target SBF. Catches\r\nof SBF in its area of distribution by the EU fleet result from limited\r\nby-catches of long-line fisheries targeting tuna and tuna like species mostly\r\nin the Convention area of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC). \nSince 2006 the EU has been allocated a\r\nquota of 10 tonnes of SBF per year for by-catch in CCSBT. Conversely, the 2014\r\nFishing Opportunities Regulation[1]\u00a0\r\nprohibits the targeting of SBF and explicitly mentions that the allocated EU\r\nquota of 10 tonnes is to be used exclusively for the counting of by-catch.\nThe CCSBT Convention is only open to\r\nStates, excluding therefore Regional Economic Integration Organisations (REIOs)\r\nlike the EU. On 1 December 2009 the Council authorised the European Commission\r\nto seek, on behalf of the European Union, an amendment to the rules of CCSBT in\r\norder for the European Union to become a Contracting Party.[2]\nAfter several years of discussions, the\r\nCCSBT amended the Resolution governing the Extended Commission during its 20th\r\nmeeting in October 2013 to allow REIOs willing to do so to become a Member of\r\nthe Extended Commission (until then the only status allowed for REIOs was that\r\nof Cooperating Non-Member) through Exchange of Letters in which the applicant\r\nshall give the CCSBT its firm commitment to respect the terms of the Convention\r\nand comply with decisions of the CCSBT Extended Commission.\nUpon completion of this procedure the EU\r\nwould be entitled to membership and vote in the CCSBT Extended Commission and\r\nExtended Scientific Committee. \nThe main interest in the CCSBT for the EU\r\nlies in the similarities between the management of Southern Bluefin Tuna\r\n(CCSBT) and Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (ICCAT) and the wish to ensure coherence in\r\nthe management of these stocks. \nThe Commission therefore recommends such\r\ncourse of action in order to continue promoting consistency in the Union's\r\nconservation approach across oceans and reinforcing its commitment to the\r\nlong-term conservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources globally.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot relevant.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposal seeks to authorise the\r\nExchange of Letters between the EU and the CCSBT in order for the EU to become\r\na full Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission from its current status of\r\nCooperating Non-Member. The European Union has been a Cooperating Non-Member of\r\nthe CCSBT Extended Commission since 2006.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nAnnual

This is necessary to ensure the\r\nvote of the EU in the proceedings of CCSBT whose main goals are to promote the\r\nlong-term conservation and sustainable use of Southern Bluefin Tuna through\r\ncooperation among the Contracting Parties.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nThe main interest in the CCSBT for the EU lies in the similarities\r\nbetween the management of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) and Atlantic Bluefin\r\nTuna (ICCAT) and the wish to ensure coherence in the management of these\r\nstocks.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe EU, represented by the Commission, plays an active role in six\r\ntuna organisations and 11 non-tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations\r\n(RFMOs). RFMOs are international organisations formed by countries with fishing\r\ninterests in an area. Some of them manage all the fish stocks found in a\r\nspecific area, while others focus on particular highly-migratory species,\r\nnotably tuna, throughout vast geographical areas. The organisations are open\r\nboth to countries in the region (\u201ccoastal states\u201d) and countries with interests\r\nin the fisheries concerned. \nWhile some RFMOs have a purely advisory role, most have management\r\npowers to set catch and fishing effort limits, technical measures, and control\r\nobligations. \nLessons learnt from the past indicate that the EU should direct its\r\nefforts at tackling the main difficulties preventing RFMOs from delivering on\r\ntheir mandates, by directing its actions along the following policy lines:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The functioning of RFMOs should be enhanced through\r\nsystematically conducted performance reviews, in line with the appropriate UN\r\nResolutions; \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 More reliable scientific data and advice should be\r\navailable to RFMOs through increasing the EU's investment in data collection,\r\napplied research, scientific knowledge and in RFMOs' scientific activities\r\nwhile encouraging other RFMO Members to do the same. The EU should also promote\r\na wider scope of scientific advice, notably through an implementation of the\r\nprecautionary and ecosystem approaches and complementing them with the tools of\r\nsocio-economic analysis;\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To remedy the current situation of poor compliance of some\r\nMembers with RFMOs' conservation and management measures, the EU should promote\r\nthe following:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A periodic review of the compliance records of each\r\nindividual Party in the respective RFMOs;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Identification of reasons for the lack of compliance (e.g.\r\nlack of capacity in developing countries) and addressing them in an\r\nappropriate, focused manner;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development and implementation of transparent and\r\nnon-discriminatory sanctions in cases of clear lack of compliance or political\r\nengagement by Parties. This process could be accompanied by incentives to\r\nreward \"complying\" and \"transparent\" actors (flag States or\r\nfleets).\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overcapacity is an issue to be addressed both on a\r\nmultilateral level (the EU launching an initiative together with its main\r\npartners) and RFMO level. The EU should advocate tackling overcapacity through\r\na review of the best available scientific advice on sustainable levels of catch\r\nand consideration of measures to address it.
