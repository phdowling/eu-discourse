By letter dated 17\r\nFebruary 2015, the Commission notified Denmark that it had all the information\r\nnecessary to consider the request. \nGeneral context\nIn order to simplify VAT collection and\r\ncombat tax evasion, Denmark requested in 2011 an individual derogation which\r\nwould allow the introduction of a flat-rate scheme for the private use of light\r\ngoods vehicles with a maximum authorised weight of up to three tonnes which\r\nhave been registered solely for business use. The derogation request was\r\napproved by Council Implementing Decision 2012/447/EU of 24 July 2012[1], and expired on 31\r\nDecember 2014. \nWithout any such derogating measure the\r\nDanish legislation implies that any private use of such a vehicle registered\r\nsolely for business purposes would have as a consequence that the taxable\r\nperson loses in full the right of deduction of the VAT on the purchase cost of\r\nthe vehicle. Denmark makes use of a standstill provision under Article 176 of\r\nthe VAT Directive regarding the deduction of VAT on the purchase and running\r\ncosts of light goods vehicles with a maximum authorised weight of up to three\r\ntonnes. If a business registers such a light goods vehicle as being solely for\r\nbusiness purposes, it will be authorised to deduct in full the VAT on the\r\npurchase of the vehicle as well as the running costs. However, a business which\r\nregisters a light goods vehicle as being both for business and personal use is\r\nnot authorised to deduct the VAT on the purchase cost, but can deduct in full\r\nthe VAT on the running costs of the vehicle. \nThe Danish system as described above can be\r\ncomplicated and costly to administer, both for the taxable person and for the\r\ntax administration. Denmark has therefore requested to apply a simplified\r\nprocedure as previously granted by Council Implementing Decision 2012/447/EU.\r\nAccording to the Danish authorities, the simplified procedure has worked very\r\nwell the last years and they find good reasons to continue with such a procedure.\r\nAs the request for an extension of the measure was first received by the\r\nCommission after the expiration of the previously granted derogation measure,\r\nthis proposal cannot extend the previous measure with retroactive effect. \nThe flat-rate system could be used by a\r\ntaxable person for up to twenty days per calendar year for a cost of DKK 40 per\r\nday. The amount of DKK 40 per day would cover only VAT and has been determined\r\nby the Danish Government on the basis of an analysis of national statistics. A\r\nsimilar payment, under separate national legislation, would be required to\r\ncover income tax on the disposal of a company car, and a surcharge to the\r\ncirculation tax. Should the taxable person use the vehicle for more than twenty\r\ndays during a calendar year, the standstill rules would apply, and the taxable\r\nperson would lose in full the right of deduction of the purchase costs of the\r\nvehicle. \nThe Danish authorities have developed an\r\nelectronic system whereby taxable persons can pay the daily flat-rate online. The\r\nauthorities consider the system to simplify the accounting obligations for the\r\ntaxable persons as well as the tax authorities' duty to collect and charge the\r\ntax.\nThe simplified procedure is optional. The\r\ntaxable person would therefore still be able to register their light goods\r\nvehicle for both business and private use if that suits their circumstances. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThere was no need for consultation or\r\nexternal expertise. The derogation would only have a negligible effect on the\r\noverall amount of tax revenue collected at the stage of final consumption,\r\nwhereas it has benefits for businesses using light goods vehicles for both\r\nprivate and professional use and simplifies tax collection.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe Decision authorises Denmark to\r\nintroduce a special measure derogating from the VAT Directive as regards the\r\naccounting of the VAT on the private use of certain vehicles. \nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive.\nSubsidiarity principle\nConsidering the provision of the VAT\r\nDirective on which the proposal is based, the proposal falls under the\r\nexclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does\r\nnot apply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons. \nThe Decision concerns an authorisation\r\ngranted to a Member State upon its own request and does not constitute any\r\nobligation. \nGiven the limited scope of the derogation,\r\nthe special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued, i.e. to simplify VAT\r\nobligations and VAT collection, as well as combatting tax evasion. \nChoice of instruments\nUnder Article 395 of the VAT Directive,\r\nderogation from the common VAT rules is only possible on the authority of the\r\nCouncil acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission. Moreover, a\r\nCouncil Decision is the most suitable instrument since it can be addressed to\r\nindividual Member States. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal will have no adverse impact on\r\nthe Union's own resources accruing from VAT.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nThe proposal is limited in time. \n2015/0074 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nauthorising Denmark to introduce a special\r\nmeasure derogating from Article 75 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive\r\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax[2], and in particular\r\nArticle 395(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter registered with\r\nthe Commission on 13 January 2015, Denmark requested authorisation to apply a\r\nmeasure derogating from the provisions of Council Directive 2006/112/EC\r\ngoverning the right to deduct input VAT.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission informed\r\nthe other Member States of the request made by Denmark by letters dated 13 and\r\n14 February 2015. By letter dated 17 February 2015, the Commission notified\r\nDenmark that it had all the information that it considered necessary to\r\nconsider the request.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without a derogation\r\nmeasure as requested, the legislation in Denmark implies that if a light goods\r\nvehicle with a maximum authorised weight of up to three tonnes is registered\r\nwith the Danish authorities as being used for business purposes only, the\r\ntaxable person is authorised to deduct, in full, the input VAT on the purchase\r\nand running costs of the vehicle. If such a vehicle is subsequently used for\r\nprivate purposes, the taxable person loses the right to deduct the VAT incurred\r\non the purchase cost of the vehicle. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To mitigate the\r\nconsequences of this regime, Denmark has requested authorisation to apply a\r\nspecial measure derogating from Article 75 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC as\r\npreviously granted by Council Implementing Decision 2012/447/EU[3], which expired 31\r\nDecember 2014. The measure allows taxable persons, who have registered a\r\nvehicle as being for business purposes only, to use the vehicle for\r\nnon-business purposes, and to calculate the taxable amount of the deemed supply\r\npursuant to Article 75 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on a daily flat-rate\r\nbasis, rather than lose their right to deduct the VAT incurred on the purchase\r\ncost of the vehicle. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The simplified calculation\r\nmethod would, however, be limited to twenty days of non-business use for each\r\ncalendar year, and the flat-rate amount of VAT to be paid is fixed at DKK 40\r\nfor each day of non-business use. This amount has been determined by the Danish\r\nGovernment on the basis of an analysis of national statistics.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This measure, which is to\r\napply to light goods vehicles with a maximum authorised weight of up to three\r\ntonnes, would simplify the VAT obligations of taxable persons who make\r\noccasional non-business use of a vehicle registered for business purposes.\r\nHowever, it would remain possible for a taxable person to choose to register a\r\nlight goods vehicle as being for both business and private use. In doing so,\r\nthe taxable person would lose the right to deduct the VAT on the purchase of\r\nthe vehicle but would not be required to pay a daily charge for any private\r\nuse.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allowing a measure which\r\nensures that a taxable person who makes occasional non-business use of a\r\nvehicle registered for business purposes is not deprived of the full right to\r\ndeduct the input VAT on that vehicle would be consistent with the general rules\r\non deduction as laid down by Council Directive 2006/112/EC. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The authorisation should\r\nbe valid for a limited period and should therefore expire on 31 December 2017. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the event Denmark\r\nrequests a further extension of the derogating measure beyond 2017, a report\r\nshall be submitted to the Commission together with the extension request no\r\nlater than 31 March 2017.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is considered that the\r\nderogation would only have a negligible effect on the overall amount of tax\r\nrevenue collected at the stage of final consumption and will have no adverse\r\nimpact on the Union's own resources accruing from VAT.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nBy derogation from Article 75 of Council\r\nDirective 2006/112/EC, where a taxable person uses for private purposes, or\r\nthose of his staff, or more generally for purposes other than those of his\r\nbusiness, a light goods vehicle which has been registered as being solely for\r\nbusiness use, Denmark is authorised to determine the taxable amount by\r\nreference to a flat-rate for each day of such use.\nThe flat-rate per day as referred to in the\r\nfirst paragraph shall be DKK 40. \nArticle 2\nThe measure referred to in Article 1 shall\r\nonly apply to light goods vehicles with a maximum authorised total weight of\r\nthree tonnes. \nThis measure shall not apply where the\r\nprivate use exceeds 20 days per calendar year.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall take effect on the day\r\nof its notification.\nThis Decision shall expire on 31 December\r\n2017.\nAny request for the extension of the\r\nmeasure provided for in this Decision shall be submitted to the Commission by\r\n31 March 2017.\nSuch a request shall be accompanied by a\r\nreport which includes a review of the measure applied on the basis of this\r\nDecision. \nArticle 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom\r\nof Denmark.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 202, 28.07.2012, p. 24.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 202, 28.07.2012, p. 24\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
