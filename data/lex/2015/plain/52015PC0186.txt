Justification for the envisaged adaptation is as follows.\n\n\nArticle 17 of Directive 2006/66/EC (as amended by Directive 2013/56/EU) obliges Member States to ensure that each producer is registered and that registration shall be subject to the same procedural requirements in accordance with Annex IV to Directive 2006/66/EC.\n\n\n1) The legal situation in Liechtenstein\n\n\nBy virtue of the Customs Union Treaty\n2\n of 1923 (Zollvertrag), which entered into force on 1 January 1924, Liechtenstein is part of the Swiss Customs Territory. According to Article 4 of the Treaty, Swiss customs legislation, as well as any other Swiss Federal legislation the application of which is necessary for the proper functioning of the Customs Union, is applicable in Liechtenstein. \n\n\nThe Customs Union Treaty is the only legal basis permitting the Swiss Customs Authorities to apply Swiss customs legislation in Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein does not have its own laws or regulations in this field. Also, from a technical customs matter viewpoint as well as for the Foreign Trade Statistics, Liechtenstein is generally considered as Swiss territory due to the Customs Union and therefore does not usually appear as a separate country for Customs procedures in an international context. All laws, regulations, administrative agreements, etc. of the Customs Union, which via Switzerland are also applicable in Liechtenstein, are listed in Annexes and published in the Liechtenstein Law Gazette (Liechtensteinisches Landesgesetzblatt) in order to ensure legal security for Liechtenstein\u2019s economic operators. The Annexes are continuously updated as soon as changes in corresponding Swiss laws and regulations occur.\n\n\nAs a consequence, the Swiss Chemicals Act of 15 December 2000, ChemA, (Chemikaliengesetz vom 15. Dezember 2000) and the Swiss Chemical Risk Reduction Ordinance of 18 May 2005, ORRChem, (Chemikalien-Risiko-Reduktionsverordnung vom 18. Mai 2005, ChemRRV) apply equally in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Annex 2.15 ORRChem lays down specific rules concerning batteries, e.g. the bring-back and take-back obligation, the prepaid disposal fee and reporting obligation of manufacturers of batteries. The Swiss rules regarding batteries are equivalent to the European provisions. Amendments to Directive 2006/66/EC are emulated as is the case with the provisions laid down in Directive 2013/56/EU. Because of the applicability of the ORRChem in Liechtenstein, the enforcement with regard to Liechtenstein is partially within the exclusive competence of the Swiss authorities or the organisations appointed by the Swiss authorities (cf. Annex 2.15 No 6 ORRChem). The organisation appointed by the Swiss authorities operating in the field of the disposal of batteries levies is INOBAT (Interessenorganisation Batterieentsorgung).\n\n\nThe present Swiss reporting obligation foresees that manufacturers of batteries must report to INOBAT, in accordance with its requirements, the quantity of batteries, indicating in particular the types of batteries and the pollutant content (cf. Annex 2.15 No 6.3 ORRChem). The requirements of the registration form of INOBAT are almost identical to the requirements according to Annex IV of Directive 2006/66/EC (as amended by Directive 2013/56/EU). Provided for by statute, manufacturers of appliances which incorporate batteries have the possibility to choose between INOBAT or third parties that have assumed liability for the fee and the reporting obligation. Those third parties are bound by a contract to INOBAT. Companies which do not fulfill their obligation to register and report are required by INOBAT to register on the basis of data delivered by the Customs Authorities. The Swiss system simplifies the registration, reporting and the collection of fees, guaranteeing at the same time a complete registration of all manufacturers.\u00a0\n\n\n2) The economic relevance of batteries and accumulators falling within the scope of application of Directive 2006/66/EC in Liechtenstein\n\n\nAccording to Article 2 of Directive 2006/66/EC, the Directive applies to all types of batteries and accumulators, regardless of their shape, volume, weight, material composition or use (with certain exceptions foreseen in Article 2(2)). \n\n\nAs a very small country with a territory of 160 km\u00b2 and approximately 37,000 inhabitants, no companies producing batteries are reportedly established in Liechtenstein. Due to the smallness of the country and the relative size of the national market, there does not seem to be any economic interest for manufacturers to produce batteries and accumulators in Liechtenstein. \n\n\nUntil now, only a few companies (16 in total) located in Liechtenstein import batteries. As the Swiss registration obligation is applicable in Liechtenstein, these companies have been registered in the Swiss registration system. \n\n\nTherefore, installing its own registration system would reportedly generate a disproportionate burden for Liechtenstein and its few importers of batteries, in particular considering the marginal and purely formal deviation of the Swiss and the European registration form.\n\n\nAgainst this background, considering the specific legal and factual situation as described above, Liechtenstein is applying for an adaptation to Directive 2013/56/EU, amending Directive 2006/66/EC. The adaptation, as proposed by the EEA EFTA States, provides that Article 17 of Directive 2006/66/EC, as amended, does not apply to Liechtenstein.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\n\nArticle 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 concerning arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement provides that the Council establishes the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf on such Decisions, on a proposal from the Commission. \n\n\nThe Commission submits the Draft Decision of the EEA Joint Committee for adoption by the Council as the Union\u2019s position. The Commission would hope to be able to present it in the EEA Joint Committee at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\n2015/0097 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union,\nin the EEA Joint Committee concerning an amendment to Annex II (Technical regulations, standards, testing and certification) to the EEA Agreement\n(Batteries and Accumulators)\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) and Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 of 28 November 1994 concerning arrangements for implementing the Agreement on the European Economic Area\n3\n, and in particular Article 1(3) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Agreement on the European Economic Area\n4\n ('the EEA Agreement') entered into force on 1 January 1994.\n\n\n(2)Pursuant to Article 98 of the EEA Agreement, the EEA Joint Committee may decide to amend, inter alia, Annex II on Technical regulations, standards, testing and certification to the EEA Agreement ('Annex II').\n\n\n(3)Directive 2013/56/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n5\n\u00a0is to be incorporated into the EEA Agreement.\n\n\n(4)Directive 2013/56/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council repeals Commission Decision 2009/603/EC\n6\n, which is incorporated into the EEA Agreement and which is consequently repealed under the EEA Agreement.\n\n\n(5)Given the specific legal and factual situation in Liechtenstein, Article 17 of Directive 2006/66/EC, as amended by Directive 2013/56/EU, is not to apply to Liechtenstein.\n\n\n(6)Annex II to the EEA Agreement should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n\n(7)The position of the Union within the EEA Joint Committee should be based on the attached draft Decision,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n\n\nThe position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, within the EEA Joint Committee on the proposed amendment to Annex II to the EEA\u00a0Agreement, on Technical regulations, standards, testing and certification, shall be based on the draft decision of the EEA\u00a0Joint Committee attached to this\u00a0Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nDirective 2013/56/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20\u00a0November 2013 amending Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators as regards the placing on the market of portable batteries and accumulators containing cadmium intended for use in cordless power tools, and of button cells with low mercury content, and repealing Commission Decision 2009/603/EC, OJ L 329, 10.12.2013, p. 5.\n\n\n\n(2)\nCustoms Union Treaty of 29 March 1923 between Switzerland and Liechtenstein (Zollvertrag, ZV;
