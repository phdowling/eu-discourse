MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nReasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nThe Convention on the simplification of formalities in trade in goods and the Convention on a common transit procedure were concluded on 20 May 1987 between the European Community and the EFTA countries. \n\n\nThe Communication of 2001 from the European Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on a Strategy to prepare the candidate countries for accession to the 1987 EC-EFTA Conventions on a common transit procedure and on the simplification of formalities in trade in goods, followed by the Communication of 2010 from the European Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on a Strategy to prepare certain neighbouring countries for the accession to both Conventions and by the Council Conclusions of 14 April 2011 confirming the approach adopted in the two Communications foresee support for a number of countries in their efforts to join the Conventions. \n\n\nThe purpose of this decision is to adopt the common EU position on the draft Decision No \u2026/2015 of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on the simplification of formalities in trade in goods and on the draft Decision No \u2026/2015 of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit to invite the Republic of Serbia to accede to the Conventions.\n\n\nConsistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThere are no existing provisions in the area of the proposal.\n\n\nConsistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the strategy to promote EU competitiveness and economic growth.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\nLegal basis\n\n\nThe Conventions establish measures facilitating the movement of goods between the European Union, the Republic of Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Kingdom of Norway, the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Turkey.\n\n\nThe Republic of Serbia wished to accede to the Conventions after having satisfied the legal, structural and information technology requirements, which are preconditions for accession.\n\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article 11(3) of the Convention on the simplifications of formalities in trade in goods and with the provisions of  Article 15(3) of the Convention on a common transit procedure, the EU-EFTA Joint Committees shall by decision invite a third country within the meaning of, respectively, Article 1(2) and Article 3(1)(c), to accede to the Conventions in accordance with the procedure set out in, respectively, Article 11a and Article 15a.\n\n\nThe EU-EFTA Joint Committees launch such invitations where the country proves that it is in a position to conform to the detailed rules for the application of provisions of the Conventions. \n\n\nMandated by the EU-EFTA common transit and the simplification of formalities in trade in goods working group, an evaluation mission covering mainly the adaptation of the national customs legislation of the Republic of Serbia, the creation of the structures necessary to manage the procedure and the implementation of the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) allowing for the application of the common transit procedure established that the conditions of invitations were met.\n\n\nProportionality\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n\nThe form of proposed action is the only one possible.\n\n\nThe form of proposed action does not involve any financing cost.\n\n\nChoice of the instrument\n\n\nProposed instruments: Decision.\n\n\nThere is no other adequate instrument.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nStakeholder consultations\n\n\nConsultation with approval on the draft Decision No \u2026/2015 of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on the simplification of formalities in trade in goods and on the draft Decision No \u2026/2015 of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit to invite the Republic of Serbia to accede to the Conventions were carried out with the Member States within the Customs Code Committee \u2013 Customs Status and Transit Section and with Contracting Parties to the Conventions within the EU-EFTA Working Groups on \"Common Transit\" and \"the Simplification of Formalities in Trade in Goods\". \n\n\nSummary of responses and how they have been taken into account:\n\n\nFavourable opinion.\n\n\nCollection and use of expertise\n\n\nThere was no need for external expertise.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\n\nThe accession to the Conventions is part of the pre-accession strategy of the Republic of Serbia to the European Union. It will lead to an alignment to the \"aquis communautaire\" in the transit area. The introduction of common transit in the Republic of Serbia as an alternative to the TIR procedure will bring further facilitation of transit, reduction of costs and a possible increase in trade.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal has no implication for the EU budget.\n\n\n\n2015/0186 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\n\n\non the position to be taken by
