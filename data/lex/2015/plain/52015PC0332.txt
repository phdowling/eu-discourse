The product-specific rules are based on a Harmonised System (HS) 2002 of classification of goods which is now outdated.\n\n\nChile and the European Union have agreed to update the product-specific rules by aligning them to the HS 2012, this being the most up-to-date classification. The aim is to ensure that the product-specific rules remain unchanged for those products that have been reclassified within the HS 2012. In cases where products move to a different chapter or heading the product-specific rules move with those products if the rules in the new chapter or heading are different from that of the old chapter or heading.\n\n\nThere are some minor precisions made to the product-specific rules in Chapter 72 relating to iron and steel. The rules applicable at the level of headings are not precise enough for determining the originating status of the products and, therefore, product-specific rules have been introduced at the level of the subheading.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nArticle 207(4) first subparagraph in conjunction with Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\n\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe proposal does not go beyond what is necessary or appropriate to achieve the expected objectives.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nNot relevant. This proposal introduces amendments to a previous text.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThere was no need for external expertise.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\n\nThis proposal introduces amendments to an existing bilateral trade agreement. There are no other options to be considered.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union budget.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\nNone\n\n\n2015/0146 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union within the EU-Chile Association Committee relating to Appendix II to Annex III to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part, concerning the product specific rules\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Association Council set up by Article 3 to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part, (EU-Chile Association Agreement) is established to examine and adopt proposals from the Parties for the improvement of the EU-Chile Association Agreement. To help it fulfil its duties the Association Council is assisted by the Association Committee, which has been given the power to adopt decisions.\n\n\n(2)A Special Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin has been set up by the Association Council to assist it in its duties. The Special Committee, which met on 4 November 2014 in Santiago, Chile, agreed to recommend an amendment to Appendix II of Annex III to the EU-Chile Association Agreement concerning productspecific rules.\n\n\n(3)Every five years the Harmonised System (HS) for the classification of goods is updated, the last such update being 2012. The product-specific rules in the EU-Chile Association Agreement are now based on an outdated version of the HS 2002 and should be updated to reflect the HS 2012 so that importers and exporters know for all goods classified according to latest HS the corresponding product-specific rules.\n\n\n(4)The product-specific rules should remain unchanged for those products that have been reclassified within the HS 2012. In cases where products move to a different chapter or heading the product-specific rules should move with those products when the rules in the new chapter or heading are different from that of the old chapter or heading.\n\n\n(5)The product-specific rules for a number of products of Chapter 72 of the Harmonized System relating to iron and steel have been amended to accurately reflect the rules that should be applicable at the level of subheadings.\n\n\n(6)The position of the Union within the EU-Chile Association Committee should be based on the attached draft decision,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position to be adopted by the Union within the Association Committee relating to Appendix II to Annex III to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part, shall be based on the attached draft decision of the Association Committee.\n\n\nMinor changes to the draft decision of the Association Committee may be agreed to by the representatives of the Union in the Association Committee without further decision of the Council.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision of the Association Committee shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 13.7.2015\nCOM(2015) 332 final\nANNEX\nAttachment\nto the\nproposal for a Council Decision\n\non the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union within the EU-Chile Association Committee relating to Appendix II of Annex III to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part, concerning the product specific rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft\n\n\nDECISION No \u2026 OF THE EU-CHILE ASSOCIATION COMMITTEE\n\n\nof\n\n\namending Appendix II of Annex III to the Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Chile concerning product specific rules\n\n\n\nTHE ASSOCIATION COMMITTEE,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Union and the Republic of Chile, and in particular Article 38 of Annex III;\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amendments were introduced as from 1 January 2007 and 1 January 2012 into the Nomenclature governed by the Convention on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonised System).\n\n\n(2) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the amendments to the Harmonised System were not intended to change the rules of origin, they do not make substantive changes to the Agreement.\n\n\n(3) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to reflect those amendments in the Agreement, Appendix II to Annex III needs to be amended.\n\n\n(4)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the number of the amendments to be made in Appendix II to Annex III, clarity requires it to be replaced in its entirety. \n\n\n(5) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It has been recognised necessary to amend the rules of origin for a number of products of Chapter 72 of the Harmonized System to reflect developments in the technological process of production of steel.\n\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nAppendix II to Annex III containing the list of working or processing required to be carried out on non-originating materials in order that the product manufactured can obtain originating status is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force ninety (90) days after the day of the last notification on which the Parties communicate the completion of the necessary domestic legal procedures.\n\n\nDone at\u2026\n\n\nFor the Association Committee\n\n\n\n\nThe President\n\n\nAnnex\n\n\nAppendix II\n\n\nLIST OF WORKING OR PROCESSING REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON NON-ORIGINATING MATERIALS IN ORDER FOR THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED TO OBTAIN ORIGINATING STATUS\n\n\n\n\n\nHS heading\n\n\n\n\nDescription of product\n\n\n\n\nWorking or processing, carried out on non-originating materials, which confers originating status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n\n\n\nLive animals\n\n\n\n\nAll the animals of Chapter 1 shall be wholly obtained\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\n\n\nMeat and edible meat offal\n\n\n\n\nManufacture in which all the materials of Chapters 1 and 2 used are wholly obtained\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\n\n\nFish and crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates\n\n\n\n\nManufacture in which all the materials of Chapter 3 used are wholly obtained\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nex Chapter 4\n\n\n\n\nDairy produce;
