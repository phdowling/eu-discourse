The EU and Palestine[2] signed the Convention\r\non 15 June 2011 and 18 September 2013 respectively.\nThe EU and Palestine deposited their\r\ninstrument of acceptance with the depositary of the Convention on 26 March 2012\r\nand 27 May 2014 respectively. As a consequence, in application of its Article\r\n10(3), the Convention entered into force in relation to the EU and Palestine on 1 May 2012 and on 1 July 2014 respectively.\nArticle 6 of the Convention provides that\r\neach Contracting Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the\r\nConvention is effectively applied. To that effect, the Joint Committee\r\nestablished by the Euro-Mediterranean Interim\r\nAssociation Agreement on trade and cooperation between the European Community,\r\nof the one part, and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) for the\r\nbenefit of the Palestinian Authority of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, of\r\nthe other part[3], should adopt a Decision replacing Protocol 3 concerning the\r\ndefinition of the concept of 'originating products' and methods of\r\nadministrative cooperation by a new Protocol which, with regard to the rules of\r\norigin, refers to the Convention. The position to be taken by the EU within the\r\nJoint Committee should be established by the Council.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe EU Member States were informed on the\r\ndraft Council Decision in the Customs Code Committee's Origin Section of 13 May\r\n2013. The Contracting Parties to the Convention were last consulted at the\r\nmeeting of the Pan-Euro-Med working group of 22 and 23 October 2014.\nNo recourse to external expertise has been\r\nnecessary. Furthermore, it has not been necessary to conduct an impact\r\nassessment, since the proposed amendments are technical in nature and do not\r\naffect the substance of the protocol on rules of origin currently in effect.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the Council Decision is\r\nthe first subparagraph of Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article\r\n218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union.
