The granting of a waiver to allow\r\nthe United States to extend and expand the scope of the existing waiver granting\r\npreferential tariff treatment to the eligible products originating in\r\nbeneficiary Central American and Caribbean countries and territorities\r\ndesignated pursuant to the provisions of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery\r\nAct as lastly amended falls under this provision as the decision is taken in a\r\nbody set up by an international agreement (the WTO General Council or\r\nMinisterial Conference) affecting the rights and obligations of the EU. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nThe Commission will be authorised to take a\r\nposition on behalf of the EU to support the United States\u2019 request for a WTO waiver\r\nto extend and expand the scope of the existing waiver\r\nto the extent necessary to permit the United States to provide duty-free\r\ntreatment to eligible products originating in beneficiary Central American and\r\nCaribbean countries and territories from 1 January 2015 until 31\r\nDecember 2019. \nThe United States justifies its request with the exceptional circumstances of the economic situation in\r\nthe Caribbean Basin countries. The objective of the amended CBERA is to assist\r\nthe trade and economic development and recovery of these countries by\r\nencouraging the expansion of their productive capacity in response to more\r\nliberal access and to new trading opportunities. \nAccording to the United States, the duty-free treatment provided under CBERA should not prejudice the interests of\r\nother Members not benefiting from such treatment, and it is expected that the\r\nextension of such duty-free treatment will not cause a significant diversion of\r\n  United States imports of products eligible under CBERA originating in Members\r\nwho are not beneficiary countries.\nThe waiver request would be the fourth extension\r\nof the preferential tariff-treatment, currently valid until 31 December 2014. The United States was granted a waiver of obligations under\r\nparagraph 1 of Article I on 15 February 1985, for the period from 1 January\r\n1984 through 30 September 1995. On 15 November 1995 the US was granted a\r\nrenewal of the waiver in respect of paragraph 1 of Article I of the GATT 1994\r\nthrough 30 September 2005, and again on 29 May 2009 through 31 December 2014,\r\nto the extent necessary for the United States to provide duty-free treatment\r\nfor imports of eligible products originating in beneficiary countries\r\ndesignated pursuant to the provisions of the CBERA.\nFor the EU, the waiver request does not\r\npose economic concerns since the duty-free treatment does not have an impact on\r\nthe EU trade with the beneficiaries countries. \n2015/0023 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be taken by\r\nthe European Union within the General Council of the World Trade Organization\r\non the United States' request for a WTO waiver to extend and expand the scope\r\nof the US Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article\r\n207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\r\nCommission, \nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to paragraph 3 of\r\nArticle IX of the WTO Agreement, the United States submitted a request to\r\nextend the existing waiver through 31 December 2019 and expand the scope of the\r\nexisting waiver of its obligations under paragraph 1 of Article I of the\r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994), to the extent\r\nnecessary to permit the United States to provide duty-free treatment to\r\neligible products originating in beneficiary Central American and Caribbean\r\ncountries and territories (\"beneficiary countries\") designated\r\npursuant to the provisions of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of\r\n1983, as amended by the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Expansion Act of 1990\r\nand by the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, the Haitian\r\nHemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006, the\r\nHaitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008,\r\nand the Haitian Economic Lift Program Act of 2010 (collectively, \"CBERA as\r\namended\").\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The United States was granted a waiver of obligations under paragraph 1 of Article I on 15 February\r\n1985, for the period from 1 January 1984 through 30 September 1995.
