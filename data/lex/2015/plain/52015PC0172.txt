Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement should therefore be amended.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nArticle 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 concerning arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement provides that the Council establishes the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf on such Decisions, on a proposal from the Commission. \n\n\nThe Commission submits the Draft Decision of the EEA Joint Committee for adoption by the Council as the Union\u2019s position. The Commission would hope to be able to present it in the EEA Joint Committee at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\n2015/0089 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union,\nin the EEA Joint Committee concerning an amendment to Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement, on cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms\n(EaSI)\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 46(d), 149, 153(2)(a), third paragraph of Article 175 and Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 of 28 November 1994 concerning arrangements for implementing the Agreement on the European Economic Area\n3\n, and in particular Article 1(3) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Agreement on the European Economic Area\n4\n ('the EEA Agreement') entered into force on 1 January 1994.\n\n\n(2)Pursuant to Article 98 of the EEA Agreement, the EEA Joint Committee may decide to amend, inter alia, Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement.\n\n\n(3)Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement contains provisions and arrangements concerning cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms.\n\n\n(4)Regulation (EU) No 1296/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n5\n was incorporated into the EEA Agreement by Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No 151/2014 of 27 June 2014\n6\n.\n\n\n(5)The limited participation of Norway in the Programme should be extended to the Progress axis.\n\n\n(6)Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement should therefore be amended in order to allow for this extended cooperation to take place from 1 January 2015,\n\n\n(7)The position of the Union within the EEA Joint Committee should therefore be based on the attached draft Decision,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, within the EEA Joint Committee on the proposed amendment to Protocol 31 to the EEA\u00a0Agreement, on cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms, shall be based on the draft Decision of the EEA\u00a0Joint Committee attached to this\u00a0Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 238.\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ L ...\n\n\n\n(3)\nOJ L 305, 30.11.1994, p. 6. \n\n\n\n(4)\nOJ L 1, 3.1.1994, p. 3. \n\n\n\n(5)\nRegulation (EU) No 1296/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on a European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (\u201cEaSI\u201d) and amending Decision No 283/2010/EU establishing a European Progress Microfinance Facility for employment and social inclusion, OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 238. \n\n\n\n(6)\nOJ L ...\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
