"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 27.5.2015\nCOM(2015) 237 final\n2015/0122(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\namending Implementing Decision 2013/463/EU on approving the macroeconomic adjustment programme for Cyprus \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\nOn 25 June 2012 Cyprus submitted a request for financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). On 25 April 2013 the Council decided (Council Decision 2013/236/EU) that Cyprus shall rigorously implement a macroeconomic adjustment programme, which shall address the specific risks emanating from Cyprus for the financial stability of the euro area and shall aim to rapidly re-establish a sound and sustainable economic and financial situation in Cyprus. Following the entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, Council Decision 2013/236/EU was replaced by Implementing Decision 2013/463/EU. \n\n\nOn 24 April 2013 the ESM Board of Governors decided to grant, in principle, stability support to Cyprus and approved the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality (hereinafter referred to as the \"MoU\") and its signing by the Commission on behalf of the ESM. On 8 May 2013 the ESM Board of Directors approved the financial assistance facility agreement. The 3-year programme covers the period from mid-2013 to 31 March 2016.\n\n\nThe macroeconomic adjustment programme aims at restoring financial market confidence, re-establishing sound macroeconomic balances and enabling the economy to return to sustainable growth. To achieve these goals, the programme builds on three pillars. The first pillar is a financial sector strategy based on restructuring and downsizing of its financial institutions and strengthening its supervision, with efforts to address capital and liquidity shortfalls. The second pillar is an ambitious fiscal consolidation strategy, building on the consolidation efforts initiated in 2012, in particular through measures to reduce current primary expenditure, enhance government revenues, improve the functioning of the public sector and maintain fiscal consolidation in the medium-term. The aim is to correct the excessive general government deficit and put the gross public debt-to-GDP ratio on a firm downward path in the medium-term. The authorities are committed to reducing the deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2016. The good implementation of Structural and other EU Funds, as well as EU policy initiatives aimed at enhancing jobs and growth should be preserved. This will contribute to the long-term growth path for Cyprus. The third pillar consists of an ambitious structural reform agenda, with a view to supporting competitiveness and sustainable and balanced growth, in line with country-specific recommendations addressed to Cyprus in 2012, and allowing for the unwinding of macroeconomic imbalances. Recalling the Council Recommendation of 22 April 2013 on establishing a Youth Guarantee\n1\n, opportunities for young people and their employability prospects should be enhanced. \n\n\nIn line with Article 1(2) of Implementing Decision 2013/463/EU, the Commission, in liaison with the ECB, and, where appropriate, with the IMF, has conducted the sixth review to assess the progress on the implementation of the agreed measures as well as their effectiveness and economic and social impact. As a result an update of the MoU was agreed at services level in the areas of financial sector reform, fiscal policy and structural reforms. For the financial sector, following the complete liberalisation of the external restrictive measures on 6 April 2015, the authorities commited to continue to closely monitor the liquidity situation of the banking sector. In addition, the revised MoU requires additional measures to address the corporate and household indebtedness and further strengthen the framework for long-term sustainable private debt restructuring, including targets for restructuring non-performing loans and a strategic default study. Furthermore, measures are requested to reform pension and insurance supervision. With regards to the new insolvency and foreclosure framework, the revised MoU requires the authorities to monitor, on a continuous basis, the implementation and performance of the framework and ensure that it supports its objectives and principles and to adopt amendments if needed. It also includes two prior actions, namely the submission of a legal proposal enabling the sale of loans, and of a legal proposal ensuring that issued title deeds are transferred to property buyers without delay, while safeguarding against abuse. \n\n\nWith regard to fiscal policy, in order to reflect the fiscal performance in the first quarter of 2015, the primary balance target for 2015 should be revised up to a surplus of at least EUR 264 million (1.5% of GDP) and the primary surplus target for 2016-2018 should be readjusted, also to remain in line with the adjustment path prescribed by the Stability and Growth Pact. In the area of fiscal-structural and structural reforms, the revised MoU now foresees the implementation of a National Health System (NHS) by 2017. On revenue administration and tax compliance, the MoU foresees the operationalisation of the new integrated tax agency by setting up a single registration process and approving a new tax procedure code. On the public administration reform, the revised MoU requires, following the horizontal review, the adoption in 2015 of a reform plan that adresses the wage setting mechanism, introduces a new appraisal and promotion system, and enhances  staff mobility. On the social welfare reform, the revised MoU provides for the presentation of a single view of benefits, on which basis the monitoring unit will finalise an assessment report of the welfare system reform. It also requires the authorities to submit proposals for the consolidation of disability and student benefits. On the housing market regulation, further requirements are included to accelerate the issuance of title deeds. In the area of tourism, a study will be prepared as an input to the national tourism stategy as part of the Action Plan for Growth. In the area of energy, the authorities will choose the preferred option for the gas and electricity regulatory regime and market organisation in line with the developments regarding the unbundling of the Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC). \n\n\nThe proposed decision will ensure full consistency between the European Union's multilateral surveillance framework established by the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the policy conditionality underpinning the economic adjustment programme. Notably, Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 provides for consistency in reporting and monitoring obligations. \n\n\n2015/0122 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\n\n\namending Implementing Decision 2013/463/EU on approving the macroeconomic adjustment programme for Cyprus \n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, \n\n\nHaving regard to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the euro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability\n2\n, and in particular Article 7(2) and (5) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 applies to Member States already in receipt of financial assistance, including those from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), at the time of its entry into force.\n\n\n(2)Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 sets the rules for the approval of macroeconomic adjustment programme for Member States in receipt of financial assistance, which need to be consistent with the provisions of the Treaty establishing the ESM. \n\n\n(3)Upon a request of 25 June 2012 by Cyprus for financial assistance from the ESM, the Council decided on 25 April 2013 by Decision 2013/236/EU\n3\n that Cyprus was to rigorously implement a macroeconomic adjustment programme.\n\n\n\n\n(4)On 24 April 2013 the ESM Board of Governors decided to grant, in principle, stability support to Cyprus and approved the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality and its signing by the Commission on behalf of the ESM.\n\n\n(5)Following the entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, the macroeconomic adjustment programme was adopted in the form of a Council Implementing Decision\n4\n. For reasons of legal clarity and certainty, the programme was readopted on the basis of Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013. The substance of the programme remained identical to the one approved by Council Decision 2013/236/EU, but also incorporated the results of the review carried out in accordance with Article 1(2) of Decision 2013/236/EU. At the same time, Council Decision 2013/236/EU was repealed.\n\n\n(6)Council Implementing Decision 2013/463/EU was already amended by Decision 2014/169/EU and Decision 2014/919/EU. In light of the latest developments, it should be amended again.\n\n\n(7)In accordance with Article 1(2) of Council Implementing Decision 2013/463/EU, the Commission, in liaison with the ECB and the IMF, has conducted the sitxh review to assess the progress on the implementation of the agreed measures as well as their effectiveness and economic and social impact.

A Member State subject to a macroeconomic adjustment programme experiencing insufficient administrative capacity may  seek technical assistance from the Commission, which may constitute, for that purpose, groups of experts.\n\n\n(9)The Cypriot authorities should seek the view, in accordance with current national rules and practises, of social partners and civil society organisations in the preparation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the macroeconomic adjustment programme,\n\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nArticle 2 of Implementing Decision 2013/463/EU is amended as follows: \n\n\n(1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 5 is replaced by the following :\n\n\n'5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a view to restoring the soundness of its financial sector, Cyprus shall continue to implement the restructuring of the banking and cooperative credit institution sectors, continue to strengthen supervision and regulation also taking into account the role of the SSM, and undertake a reform of the debt restructuring framework while safeguarding financial stability.\n\n\nThe programme shall provide for the following measures and outcomes:\n\n\n(a) ensuring that the liquidity situation of the banking sector shall be closely monitored only for as long as is strictly necessary to mitigate serious risks for the stability of the financial system.
