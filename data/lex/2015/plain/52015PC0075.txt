On that day, on\r\nthe orders of the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, General Antonio\r\nIndjai, a group of mutinous soldiers arrested Chief of Staff Jos\u00e9 Zamora Induta\r\nand the Prime Minister of Guinea-Bissau, Carlos Gomes Junior.\nThis mutiny and the subsequent appointment\r\nof its main instigators to high-ranking posts in the military hierarchy were\r\nconsidered a clear and serious breach of the essential elements referred to in\r\nArticle 9 of the Cotonou Agreement (specifically, respect for democratic\r\nprinciples) and as a case of special urgency within the meaning of its Article\r\n96 (2)(b) thereof. Consequently, a letter was sent to the Guinea-Bissau\r\nauthorities on 2 February 2011 inviting them to enter into consultations.\nAt the first consultation, which took place\r\nin Brussels on 29 March 2011, Guinea-Bissau undertook to:\n\u00b7                        \r\nconduct and conclude judicial investigations and\r\nproceedings, that are fully independent and carried out under appropriate\r\nlogistical and security conditions, relating to the assassinations in March and\r\nJune 2009;\n\u00b7                        \r\neffectively implement the security sector reform\r\nstrategy adopted by the national parliament and the legislative package drawn\r\nup with the support of the EU\u2019s common security and defence policy (CSDP)\r\nmission;\n\u00b7                        \r\nrenew the military hierarchy to ensure the\r\nappointment to senior command of persons not involved in unconstitutional or\r\nillegal conduct or acts of violence, in conformity with the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations in the roadmap for security sector reform drawn up by the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (Ecowas);\n\u00b7                        \r\napprove and assist an experts\u2019 mission to\r\nsupport security sector reform and the protection of political figures, to be\r\ncarried out with the support of Ecowas, the Community of Portuguese-Speaking\r\nCountries (CPLP) and/or other partners;\n\u00b7                        \r\nprepare, adopt and effectively implement\r\nnational operational plans to implement security sector reform and combat drug\r\ntrafficking;\n\u00b7                        \r\nimprove the administrative and financial\r\nmanagement of civilian and military employees, and measures to combat money\r\nlaundering.\nWith Council Decision 2011/492/EU of 18\r\nJuly 2011, the European Union decided to adopt appropriate measures to ensure\r\nthe honouring of these undertakings, including a schedule of mutual commitments\r\nleading to the gradual resumption of EU cooperation.\nOn 12 April 2012, after the first round of\r\nthe presidential elections held following the death in January of President\r\nMalam Bacai Sanh\u00e9, members of the armed forces staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in which\r\nthe acting President and the Prime Minister were arrested.\nIn the absence of progress on the\r\nimplementation of the undertakings laid down in Council Decision 2011/492/EU,\r\nthe appropriate measures were extended until 19 July 2013 by Council Decision\r\n2012/387/EU of 16 July 2012 and, subsequently, until 19 July 2014 by Council\r\nDecision 2013/385/EU of 15 July 2013.\nLegislative and presidential elections were\r\nheld on 13 April and 18 May 2014, judged by all international observers,\r\nincluding an EU electoral observation mission, as free and credible. Council\r\nDecision 2014/467/EU of 14 July then extended the validity of Decision\r\n2011/492/EU, but suspended the application of the appropriate measures therein\r\nto enable the EU to engage with and provide direct support to the\r\ndemocratically elected authorities in their efforts to consolidate democratic\r\ninstitutions, reconcile society, and promote socioeconomic development in\r\nGuinea-Bissau.\nAs part of the six-monthly review of\r\nappropriate measures under Article 96 provided for in council Decision\r\n2011/492/EU, a joint monitoring mission from the European External Action\r\nService and Commission services took place from 13 to 15 January 2015 in order\r\nto assess the extent to which the essential elements (democratic principles,\r\nrule of law, human rights, good governance) laid down in Article 9 of the\r\nCotonou Agreement were being respected and to measure the progress made by\r\nGuinea-Bissau in implementing its undertakings with a view to lifting the\r\nArticle 96 measures.\nOn the basis of the findings of the joint\r\nmonitoring mission and the recommendations of the resident and non-resident EU\r\nHeads of Mission to Guinea-Bissau, and taking into account the holding of\r\ncredible elections, the restoration of the constitutional order, the\r\nestablishment of an inclusive government committed to implementing the reform\r\nnecessary for the development and stability of the country, and the encouraging\r\nprogress made on implementing the Article 96 commitments, it appears\r\npolitically appropriate to lift the Article 96 appropriate measures laid down in\r\nCouncil Decision 2011/492/EU.\nThe full resumption of the EU\u2019s cooperation\r\nwith Guinea-Bissau will send a strong political message in support of the newly\r\nelected authorities, enabling the EU to fully engage in supporting the\r\ncountry\u2019s reform programme and development agenda and contribute to the\r\ninternational community\u2019s ongoing efforts to bring about a return to\r\nconstitutional order and reduce the risk of Guinea-Bissau\u2019s democratic\r\ninstitutions being further weakened.\nConclusion\nIn view of the above, the Council is\r\nrequested to adopt the attached draft proposal for a Council Decision repealing\r\nDecision 2011/492/EU concerning the conclusion of consultations with the\r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.\n2015/0039 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nrepealing Decision 2011/492/EU concerning\r\nthe conclusion of consultations with the Republic of Guinea-Bissau under\r\nArticle 96 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to the Partnership Agreement\r\nbetween the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (\u201cACP\u201d) Group of\r\nStates of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States of the\r\nother part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000[2]\r\n(the \u2018ACP-EU Partnership Agreement\u2019), as amended[3],\r\nand in particular Article 96 thereof,\nHaving regard to the internal agreement\r\nbetween the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting\r\nwithin the Council, on measures to be taken and procedures to be followed for\r\nthe implementation of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement[4], and in particular\r\nArticle 3 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision\r\n2011/492/EU[5],\r\nconsultations with the Republic of Guinea-Bissau under Article 96 of the ACP-EU\r\nPartnership Agreement were concluded and appropriate measures, as specified in\r\nthe Annex to that Decision, were taken.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those measures were\r\nextended until 19 July 2013 by Council Decision 2012/387/EU[6] and, subsequently,\r\nuntil 19 July 2014 by Council Decision 2013/385/EU[7].

The country turned a corner when it held\r\npeaceful and credible general elections in April and May 2014, establishing\r\ndemocratically elected authorities, including an inclusive government that we\r\nbelieve is committed to rebuilding the country, strengthening its democratic\r\ninstitutions and moving towards socio-political stability and economic\r\ndevelopment.\nIn view of the restoration of constitutional order and the progress\r\nmade towards Guinea\u2011Bissau\u2019s commitments under Article 96 of the Cotonou\r\nAgreement, as well as your undertaking to pursue their implementation by\r\ncarrying out the necessary reforms and taking appropriate action, it is our\r\npleasure to inform you that the measures which since 2011 have restricted the\r\nscope of EU development cooperation with Guinea-Bissau have been repealed. We\r\nare therefore fully resuming our cooperation with your country.\nSince Guinea-Bissau still faces many political and socio-economic\r\nchallenges, we would like to encourage you to stay united and continue your\r\nefforts to strengthen democratic institutions, genuinely reform the security\r\nsector, strengthen the rule of law, combat corruption, impunity and drug\r\ntrafficking, and promote sustainable development. The EU stands by you and\r\nsupports all efforts undertaken in this direction.\nIndeed, the lifting of the appropriate measures under Article 96 of\r\nthe Cotonou Agreement enables us to assist you in the organisation of the Round\r\nTable on Guinea\u2011Bissau on 25 March 2015 in Brussels and to fully\r\ncontribute to its success.\nMoreover, we will continue the consultation and preparation phase of\r\nthe 11th European Development Fund with your government with a view to signing\r\nas soon as possible the National Indicative Programme that will support you in\r\nthe implementation of your ambitious reform programme.\nFinally, we look forward not only to a full re-engagement with\r\nGuinea-Bissau through development, but also to a strengthening of our political\r\ndialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.\nYours faithfully,\n   For the Council || For the Commission \n F. MOGHERINI High Representative || N. MIMICA Commissioner \n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
