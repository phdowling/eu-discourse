Ukraine is\r\nan important country both within the European Neighbourhood Policy and the\r\nEastern Partnership. The EU signed a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement\r\n(PCA) with Ukraine in 1998 that outlines the framework of cooperation in all\r\nkey areas of reform and continues to be the legal basis of EU-Ukraine\r\nrelations. Relations were further reinforced in November 2009 when the Cabinet\r\nof Ministers of Ukraine adopted the EU-Ukraine Association Agenda, which was\r\nupdated in 2011 (endorsed by the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council in June 2013).\r\nOn 21 March and 27 June 2014, the EU and Ukraine signed an Association\r\nAgreement, which will establish a deep political association and economic\r\nintegration between the EU and Ukraine. It covers a wide range of areas such as\r\njustice, trade and sectorial cooperation including energy, transport and\r\nenvironment and sets out detailed commitments and timelines that are demanding\r\nfor both parties.\nThe Ukrainian economy is experiencing a\r\ndeep recession that is the result of long-standing macroeconomic imbalances and\r\nstructural problems. The situation was aggravated by the eruption of an armed\r\nconflict in the East that had a heavy toll on the economy through sizable\r\nlosses of productive capacity and reduced confidence. Following mass public\r\nprotests, former President Viktor Yanukovych left power and a reform-minded\r\ngovernment was appointed in Ukraine in February 2014. It embarked on an\r\nambitious macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform programme that aimed\r\nto change the country\u2019s unviable economic model and pave the way for long-term,\r\nsustainable growth. This programme was underpinned by a USD 17 billion\r\nfinancial assistance programme by the IMF and significant support from other\r\ninternational donors. \nFollowing the political change in February\r\n2014, Ukraine held free and democratic presidential and parliamentary elections\r\n(on 25 May and 26 October, respectively). Furthermore, important steps were\r\ntaken by Ukrainian authorities in 2014 to fight corruption and strengthen the\r\nrule of law. In December 2014, the newly formed government presented an\r\nambitious Action Plan outlining the reform agenda of the coalition government. It\r\nis envisaged to be followed up in early 2015 by a comprehensive National Reform\r\nStrategy setting out economic, political, judicial and administrative reform\r\nmeasures for 2015-17 that are necessary to ensure medium-term macroeconomic\r\nstability, as well as the implementation of the EU-Ukraine Association\r\nAgreement. \nThe reform efforts of the authorities\r\nhave been seriously complicated, however, by the armed conflict in the East,\r\ngrowing trade restrictions from Russia, and the escalation of a natural gas\r\ndispute between the two countries. As a result, the economic recession in\r\nUkraine has become more severe than initially expected by international donors.\r\nThe crisis is expected to be a prolonged one, as Ukraine is heading for another\r\nyear of a contraction in 2015. The loss of export proceeds due to the conflict\r\nin the East and the confidence crisis led to a sharp depreciation of the local\r\ncurrency and a depletion of international reserves. In the current situation,\r\nUkraine does not have access to international debt markets and is not expected\r\nto regain it in the short term. A significant additional external financing gap\r\nhas therefore emerged.\nAgainst this background, additional\r\nofficial financial assistance is required to address Ukraine\u2019s short-term\r\nbalance of payments needs, including the replenishment of international\r\nreserves, and to support the reform programme of the authorities, in particular\r\nthe restructuring of the energy and banking sectors. Last but not least, this\r\nsupport is required to shore up investor confidence, which is essential for\r\nbringing Ukraine\u2019s economy eventually back to a sustainable growth path.\nThe Ukrainian authorities requested MFA\r\nfrom the EU of EUR 2 billion on 9 September 2014. The request for MFA was\r\nreiterated in a further letter on 15 December 2014. Taking into consideration\r\nthese requests and the economic situation in Ukraine, in particular the\r\nemergence of significant additional external financing needs, the European\r\nCommission is submitting to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal\r\nto grant MFA to Ukraine of maximum EUR 1.8 billion in the form of medium-term\r\nloans. \nThe objective of the proposed MFA is to help\r\nUkraine cover part of its residual additional external financing needs in 2015\r\nand early 2016 in the context of the on-going IMF programme. These additional needs are estimated by the IMF at USD 15 billion.\r\nThe EU\u2019s assistance would also reduce the economy\u2019s short-term balance of\r\npayments and fiscal vulnerabilities, while supporting the government\u2019s\r\nadjustment and reform programmes through an appropriate package of accompanying\r\npolicy measures to be agreed with the Ukrainian authorities in a Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding (MoU).\nIn this context, the Commission considers\r\nthat the political and economic pre-conditions for a MFA operation of the\r\nproposed amount and nature are satisfied.\n\u00b7                    \r\nGeneral context\nUkraine is experiencing a deep recession\r\nthat is the result of long-standing economic and structural problems. The\r\nsituation is aggravated by the armed conflict in the eastern part of the\r\ncountry that not only destroyed part of Ukraine\u2019s productive capacity but also\r\nhad significant confidence impact for households and businesses. In recent\r\nmonths, the implementation of much-needed stabilisation policies, aimed at\r\nreducing imbalances and safeguarding fiscal and external sustainability, have\r\nfurther weighed on short-term economic prospects. As a result, GDP is\r\nexpected to contract by around 7% in real terms in 2014.\nDespite the sharp economic contraction and\r\nthe conservative central bank policies, inflationary pressures remain high,\r\nreflecting the currency weakening and an adjustment of administered prices (in\r\nparticular of utility tariffs). CPI inflation accelerated to 21.8% year-on-year\r\nin November and is expected to pick up further in the near future as the effect\r\nof the currency depreciation fully kicks in. The hryvnia has lost close to\r\n50% of its value against the USD since its floatation in February, well\r\nabove initial expectations. The weakening was particularly strong in August and\r\nSeptember, forcing the central bank to introduce a number of administrative\r\nmeasures and currency controls, in addition to undertaking some foreign\r\nexchange market interventions, which succeeded in bringing temporary stability\r\nto the exchange rate ahead of the October parliamentary elections. At the same\r\ntime, these measures impacted negatively on business activity and led to a fast\r\ndepletion of the already low international reserves. Following a slight\r\nrelaxation of the administrative controls, the currency has depreciated\r\nstrongly as from November.\nWeak economic activity, coupled with higher\r\ninterest outlays on foreign currency denominated debt in light of strong\r\ncurrency depreciation, as well as and sizable losses in tax collection capacity\r\nin the eastern parts of the country, led to widening of the budget deficit\r\nin 2014 despite a number of austerity measures introduced by the authorities[1]. According to recent\r\nforecasts of the Ministry of Finance, the government fiscal deficit will rise\r\nto 5.3% of GDP for 2014 as a whole. \nA major additional drag on public finances\r\nin 2014 came from the ailing oil and gas company Naftogaz. This company\r\ntraditionally runs sizable operational deficits due to the administrative cap\r\non natural gas prices for households and municipal utility companies, which\r\nforces Naftogaz to sell at below-cost rates and general operational \u00a0inefficiency.\r\nIn 2014, the company\u2019s activities were negatively affected by the strong\r\ndepreciation of the hryvnia and the need for coverage of gas arrears to Russia\r\n(including ones accumulated in 2013). As a result, the state had to inject UAH\r\n103bn into Naftogaz by November, an amount representing 6.8% of projected GDP.\r\nThus, the overall fiscal deficit run by Ukraine in 2014, which includes the\r\ndeficit of Naftogaz, is projected at nearly 12% of GDP, up from 6.7% in\r\n2013 and compared to 8.5% forecast by the IMF in April 2014. \nThe widening budget deficit and the sharp\r\ndepreciation of the local currency, coupled with a significant economic\r\ncontraction, led to a sharp deterioration of Ukraine\u2019s public debt metrics.\r\nAt the end of October 2014, the general government public debt amounted to 63%\r\nof the projected GDP for the year, an increase of almost 23 percentage points\r\nfrom the year end-2013 debt of 40.2% of GDP. \nOn the external side, the depreciation of\r\nthe hryvnia, coupled with weak domestic demand, has contributed to a significant\r\nadjustment of the current account. The deficit is expected to narrow to\r\naround 4% of the GDP in 2014 from 9.0% in 2013, although this is primarily due\r\nto strong import compression[2].\r\nHowever, this was accompanied by sizeable private-sector financial outflows\r\ndue to dwindling confidence in an environment of high geopolitical\r\nuncertainty[3].\r\nThe official financing extended as from May 2014 was insufficient to offset the\r\ncapital flight. Overall, Ukraine received around USD 9 billion in gross\r\nofficial financing in May-December, a large part of which was used to cover\r\nmaturing debt (see IMF support and other donor assistance up to 2014). \nIn the context of a deepening economic\r\nrecession and a confidence crisis, the sizable official financial assistance\r\nprovided to Ukraine in 2014 was insufficient to stop the continuous drain on\r\nreserves. In the first eleven months of the year, reserves halved from\r\ntheir end-2013 level to only USD 10 billion. A further significant drop is\r\nexpected in December as a result of payments for gas (including arrears to\r\nRussia). As a result, Ukraine\u2019s gross international reserves are now expected\r\nto drop to USD 7 billion at the end of 2014, or around one month of projected\r\n2015 imports of goods and services.\nOn 30 April 2014, the IMF approved a\r\ntwo-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) for Ukraine amounting to SDR 10.976\r\n(USD 17 billion, or 800% of the country\u2019s quota). The IMF\u2019s financial\r\nassistance has been complemented by significant support from other official and\r\nbilateral assistance (EU, US, Japan, Canada). Other international financial institutions such as the World Bank,\r\nthe EBRD and the EIB have also significantly scaled up their activity to\r\nsupport Ukraine\u2019s economic transition.\nHowever, in view of the\r\ndeeper-than-expected economic recession and the strong capital outflows due to\r\nthe confidence crises, Ukraine is facing significant additional external\r\nfinancing needs in 2015 and in early 2016. These needs arise mainly from the\r\nneed to replenish the very low level of international reserves and sizable\r\nprivate capital outflows. These additional financing needs are estimated at USD\r\n15 billion. The proposed MFA would cover 16.7% of the total additional\r\nfinancing gap.\u00a0 \n\u00b7                    \r\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nMFA has been provided to Ukraine under\r\nthree separate decisions:\n\u00b7      Council Decision of 12 July 2002 providing supplementary\r\nmacro-financial assistance to Ukraine (2002/639/EC)[4]\n\u00b7      Decision No 388 /2010/EU of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil of 7 July 2010 providing macro-financial assistance to Ukraine[5] \n\u00b7      Council Decision of 14 April 2014 providing macro-financial\r\nassistance to Ukraine (2014/215/EU)[6]\n\u00b7                    \r\nConsistency with the other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThe proposed MFA is consistent with the\r\nEU\u2019s commitment to support Ukraine\u2019s immediate economic and political\r\ntransition. It is consistent with the principles governing the use of the\r\ninstrument of MFA, including its exceptional character, political\r\npreconditions, complementarity, conditionality and financial discipline.\nThe proposed MFA is in line with the\r\nobjectives of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). It contributes to\r\nsupport the European Union\u2019s objectives of economic stability and economic\r\ndevelopment in Ukraine and, more broadly, in the eastern European\r\nneighbourhood. By helping the authorities\u2019 efforts to establish a stable\r\nmacroeconomic framework and implement an ambitious structural reform programme,\r\nthe proposed assistance helps improve the effectiveness of other EU financial\r\nassistance to the country, including budgetary support operations The proposed\r\nMFA also complements the assistance provided by other multilateral and\r\nbilateral donors in the context of the IMF-sponsored economic programme.\nThe EU MFA would complement the total EUR\r\n1.565 billion in grants that can be mobilised under the European Neighbourhood\r\nInstrument, the Neighbourhood Investment Facility, the Instrument contributing\r\nto Stability and Peace and the EU budget line for the Common Foreign and\r\nSecurity Policy over 2014-2020, whereby EUR 370 million have already been\r\ncommitted in 2014. By supporting the adoption by the Ukrainian authorities of\r\nan appropriate framework for short-term macroeconomic policy and structural\r\nreforms, the EU\u2019s MFA would enhance the added value of the overall EU\r\ninvolvement increasing the effectiveness of the EU\u2019s intervention including\r\nthrough other financial instruments, such as the State\r\nBuilding Contract and other budget support operations. \nUkraine has important economic ties to the\r\nEU. The EU is among Ukraine\u2019s most important commercial partners and accounts\r\nfor about one third of its external trade. In 2013, the value of Ukrainian\r\nimports from the EU was EUR 23.9 billion while the value of its exports was EUR\r\n18.8 billion. Ukraine also has a high dependence on the EU in terms of FDI and\r\nother financial flows. On 27 June 2014, Ukraine and the EU agreed to the future\r\nestablishment of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). This will\r\nsupport a further increase in bilateral trade in goods and services and\r\ngradually bring Ukraine's trade-related rules and standards in line with those\r\nof the EU.\nUkraine\u2019s transition is very difficult and\r\nthe risk of economic collapse remains. At the same time, the new government has\r\npublicly committed to taking significant steps towards political and economic\r\nreforms, with the aim of tackling corruption and strengthening institutions and\r\nmechanisms, based on the rule of law. The country is also developing an\r\neconomic reform programme aimed at laying the ground for a sustainable growth\r\nmodel. Progress in respect of these objectives and the reform programme will be\r\nof the utmost importance to underpin a successful transition.\n2.\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u00b7                    \r\nConsultation of interested parties\nMFA is provided as an integral part of the\r\ninternational support for the economic stabilisation of Ukraine. In the\r\npreparation of this proposal for MFA, the Commission services have consulted\r\nwith the International Monetary Fund and other international partners, which\r\nare putting in place sizeable financing programmes. The Commission has also\r\nbeen in regular contact with the Ukrainian authorities.\n\u00b7                    \r\nCollection and use of expertise\nAn Operational Assessment verifying the\r\nquality and reliability of Ukraine's public financial circuits and\r\nadministrative procedures was carried out by the Commission with the assistance\r\nof external experts, with the final report prepared in August 2014.\n\u00b7                    \r\nImpact assessment\nThe MFA and the economic adjustment and\r\nreform programme attached to it will help alleviate Ukraine\u2019s short-term\r\nfinancing needs while supporting policy measures aimed at strengthening\r\nmedium-term balance of payments and fiscal sustainability and raising sustainable\r\ngrowth. It will notably support reform efforts in the following areas: public\r\nfinance management and anti-corruption; tax administration; reforms in the\r\nenergy sector, including strengthening the social safety net to ensure targeted\r\ncushioning of the ongoing withdrawal of retail energy price subsidies;\r\nfinancial sector reforms; and measures to improve the business environment.\n3.\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7                    \r\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe European Union shall make MFA available\r\nto Ukraine for a total maximum amount of EUR 1.8 billion, provided in the form\r\nof medium term loans. The assistance will contribute to cover Ukraine\u2019s\r\nresidual external financing needs in 2015-16, as identified by the Commission\r\nbased on the estimates of the IMF. \nThe assistance is planned to be disbursed\r\nin three loan instalments. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected\r\nto take place in the middle of 2015. The second instalment could be disbursed\r\nin the fourth quarter of 2015. The third and last instalment could be made\r\navailable towards the end of the first quarter of 2016. The assistance will be\r\nmanaged by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and\r\nother irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable.\r\n\nThe Commission and the Ukrainian\r\nauthorities would agree on a Memorandum of Understanding setting out the structural\r\nreform measures associated with the proposed MFA operation, including aspects\r\nof timing and sequencing. These measures will support the authorities\u2019 reform\r\nagenda, including relevant elements of the aforementioned forthcoming National\r\nReform Strategy for 2015-17, and the implementation of the EU-Ukraine\r\nAssociation Agreement, as well as complementing the programmes agreed with the\r\nIMF, the World Bank and other multilateral and bilateral donors. As is normally\r\nthe case with MFA, the disbursements would inter alia be conditional on\r\nsatisfactory reviews under the IMF programme and the continued drawing by\r\nUkraine on IMF funds.\nThe European Commission will seek consensus\r\nwith the Ukrainian authorities on the expected National Reform Strategy, so as\r\nto facilitate smooth implementation also of the conditionality to be agreed in\r\nthe Memorandum of Understanding for the proposed MFA operation. These policy\r\nconditions should address some of the fundamental weaknesses accumulated over\r\nthe years by the Ukrainian economy. Possible areas of conditionality could in\r\nprinciple include: public finance management and anti-corruption; tax\r\nadministration; reforms in the energy sector; financial sector reforms; and\r\nmeasures to improve the business environment.\nThe decision to disburse the full MFA in\r\nthe form of loans is justified by Ukraine's level of development (as measured\r\nby its per-capita income). It is also consistent with the treatment given to\r\nUkraine by the World Bank and the IMF. \n\u00b7                    \r\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis for this proposal is\r\nArticle 212 of the TFEU. \n\u00b7                    \r\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe subsidiarity principle is respected as the\r\nobjectives of restoring short-term macroeconomic stability in Ukraine cannot be\r\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States alone and can therefore be better\r\nachieved by the European Union. The main reasons are the budgetary constraints\r\nfaced at the national level and the need for strong donor coordination in order\r\nto maximise the scale and effectivenes of the assistance. \n\u00b7                    \r\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle: it confines itself to the minimum required in order\r\nto achieve the objectives of short-term macro economic stability and does not\r\ngo beyond what is necessary for that purpose. \nAs identified by the Commission based on\r\nthe estimates of the IMF in the context of the stand-by arrangement, the amount\r\nof the assistance corresponds to around 16.7% of the estimated additional financing\r\ngap for the period 2015\u2013Q1 2016. This significant commitment is justified by:\r\nthe political importance of Ukraine for the stability in the European\r\nNeighbourhood; the political integration of the country with the EU as reflected\r\nby the Association Agreement between the two sides that provisionally entered\r\ninto force on 1 November 2014; as well as the exceptionally challenging\r\nsituation and correspondingly large financing needs that this EU neighbour is\r\ncurrently facing.\n\u00b7                    \r\nChoice of instruments\nProject finance or technical assistance\r\nwould not be suitable or sufficient to addressmacroeconomic objectives. The key\r\nvalue added of the MFA in comparison to other EU instruments would be to\r\nalleviate the external financial constraint in a swift manner and to help\r\ncreate a stable macroeconomic framework, including by promoting a sustainable\r\nbalance of payments and budgetary situation, and an appropriate framework for\r\nstructural reforms. By helping to put in place an appropriate overall framework\r\nfor macroeconomic and structural policies, MFA can increase the effectiveness\r\nof the actions financed in Ukraine under other, more narrowly focused EU\r\nfinancial instruments. \n4.\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe planned assistance would be provided in\r\nthe form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing operation that\r\nthe Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the\r\nassistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts\r\ndisbursed into the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget\r\nline 01 03 06 (\u201cProvisioning of the Guarantee Fund\u201d). Assuming that the first\r\nand second loan disbursements will be made in 2015 for a total amount of EUR 1,200\r\nmillion and the third loan disbursement in 2016 for the amount of EUR 600\r\nmillion, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the\r\nprovisioning will take place in the budgets for 2017 (for EUR 108 million) and\r\n2018 (EUR 54 million). On the basis of the currently available information on\r\nthe expected overall provisioning needs of the Guarantee Fund, this additional\r\nbudgetary impact will be partly financed by a reallocation in the indicative\r\nfinancial programming for 2017 and 2018 from macro-financial assistance grants\r\n(budget line 01 03 02) and partly by using the unallocated margin for\r\ncommitments under Heading 4 in the Multi-Annual Financial Framework. The\r\nindicative breakdown of this financing is as follows:\nEUR\r\nmillion\n   || 2017 || 2018 \n Additional expenditure: ||   ||   \n Provisioning of the Guarantee Fund as a result of the proposal (see the legislative financial statement) || 108 || 54 \n Sources of financing: ||   ||   \n Macro-financial assistance (grants) 01.0302 Margin under Heading 4 || -50 -58 || -40 -14 \n5.\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n\u00b7                    \r\nReview/revision/sunset clause\nThe proposal includes a sunset clause. The\r\nproposed MFA would be made available for two and a half years, starting from\r\nthe first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding.\n2015/0005 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nproviding macro-financial assistance to\r\nUkraine\nTHE\r\nEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to\r\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\r\n212 thereof,\nHaving regard to\r\nthe proposal from the European Commission[7],\r\n\nAfter transmission\r\nof the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nActing in\r\naccordance with the ordinary legislative procedure[8],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Relations between the\r\nEuropean Union and Ukraine are developing within the framework of the European\r\nNeighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership. An Association\r\nAgreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community\r\nand their Member States, on the one part, and Ukraine, on the other part (\u2018the\r\nAssociation Agreement\u2019), including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area\r\n(DCFTA), was negotiated from 2007 to 2011 and was initialled in 2012. The\r\nAssociation Agreement was signed by Ukraine and the Union on 21 March and 27 June\r\n2014. Since 1 November 2014 important parts of the Association Agreement have\r\nbeen provisionally applied in the areas of the respect for\r\nhuman rights, fundamental freedoms and rule of law, political dialogue and\r\nreform, justice, freedom and security, economic and financial cooperation. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the\r\nreinstatement of the Ukrainian constitution of 2004, presidential as well as\r\nparliamentary elections were successfully held on 25 May 2014 and 26 October\r\n2014, respectively. Following the formation on 2 December 2014 of a new\r\ngovernment reflecting the outcome of the parliamentary elections, Ukraine has\r\nreconfirmed its commitment to political and economic reforms in line with the\r\nframework provided by the Association Agreement and presented an Action Plan outlining\r\nthe intended reforms. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The violation of Ukraine's\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity and the resulting military conflict have\r\nhad damaging effects on Ukraine's already precarious economic and financial\r\nstability. Ukraine is facing a difficult balance of\r\npayments and liquidity position linked to receding confidence and concomitant\r\ncapital flight, as well as a worsening\r\nfiscal situation as a result of the direct budgetary cost of the conflict, a\r\ndeeper than expected recession and the loss of fiscal revenues from the areas\r\ncontrolled by the separatists. At the same time,\r\npre-existing structural weaknesses and budgetary and external-financial\r\nvulnerabilities have also contributed to the deterioration of the economic\r\nsituation.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this context, Ukraine\u2019s\r\nexternal financing needs are substantially larger than initially identified,\r\nrequiring additional financial assistance by international creditors and\r\ndonors. In its most recent programme review mission, the International Monetary\r\nFund (IMF) has identified a significant financing need over and above the\r\nfunding committed so far by the international community, which includes Union\r\nmacro-financial assistance under Council Decision 2002/639/EC[9], Decision No 388/2010/EU\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[10]\r\nand Council Decision 2014/215/EU[11].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union has, on various\r\noccasions, declared its commitment to support the new Ukrainian authorities in\r\ntheir aims to stabilise the situation and pursue the course of reforms. The\r\nUnion has also declared its readiness fully to support efforts of the\r\ninternational community and international financial institutions, especially\r\nthe IMF, with regard to an international assistance package designed to address\r\nthe urgent needs of Ukraine, conditional on Ukraine's clear commitment to\r\nreforms. Financial support from the Union to Ukraine is consistent with the\r\nUnion\u2019s policy as set out in the ENP and in the Eastern Partnership. In its conclusions\r\nof 18 December 2014, the European Council states that, following the Commission\u2019s\r\nsecond disbursement in December 2014 of EUR 500 million in macro-financial\r\nassistance, the Union and its Member States stand ready to further facilitate\r\nand support Ukraine\u2019s reform process, together with other donors and in line\r\nwith IMF conditionality.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union\u2019s\r\nmacro-financial assistance should be an exceptional financial instrument of\r\nuntied and undesignated balance-of-payments support, which aims at addressing\r\nthe beneficiary\u2019s immediate external financing needs and should underpin the\r\nimplementation of a policy programme containing strong immediate adjustment and\r\nstructural reform measures designed to improve the balance-of-payments position\r\nin the short term.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 30 April 2014, the\r\nUkrainian authorities and the IMF agreed on a two-year Stand-By-Arrangement of\r\nSpecial Drawing Rights (SDR) 10.976 billion (about USD 17.01 billion, 800\r\npercent of quota) in support of Ukraine\u2019s economic adjustment and reform\r\nprogramme. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 5 March 2014, in view\r\nof the drastically worsening balance-of-payments situation in Ukraine, the\r\nCommission announced a support package, which was endorsed by the extraordinary\r\nEuropean Council on 6 March 2014. That package includes financial assistance in\r\nthe amount of EUR 11 billion for the period 2014-2020, including up to EUR\r\n1.565 billion in grants for the same period mobilised under the European\r\nNeighbourhood Instrument, the Neighbourhood Investment Facility, the Instrument\r\ncontributing to Stability and Peace and the budget of the Common Foreign and\r\nSecurity Policy, as well as Union macro-financial assistance of up to EUR 1.61\r\nbillion for 2014-15.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 9 September 2014, in\r\nview of the worsening economic situation and outlook, Ukraine requested further\r\nmacro-financial assistance from the Union. This request was reiterated in\r\nanother letter on 15 December 2014.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that Ukraine is a country\r\ncovered by the ENP, it should be considered to be eligible to receive the\r\nUnion's macro-financial assistance.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that there is still a\r\nsignificant residual external financing gap in Ukraine's balance of payments\r\nover and above the resources provided by IMF and other multilateral\r\ninstitutions, the Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to Ukraine\r\n(\"the Union's macro-financial assistance\") is, under the current\r\nexceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to\r\nUkraine's request to support economic stabilisation in conjunction with the IMF\r\nprogramme. The Union's macro-financial assistance would support the economic\r\nstabilisation and the structural reform agenda of Ukraine, supplementing\r\nresources made available under the IMF's financial arrangement.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should aim to support the restoration of a sustainable external\r\nfinancing situation for Ukraine, thereby supporting its economic and social\r\ndevelopment in line with the Association Agreement.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The determination of the\r\namount of the Union's macro-financial assistance is based on a complete\r\nquantitative assessment of Ukraine's residual external financing needs, and\r\ntakes into account its capacity to finance itself with its own resources, in\r\nparticular the international reserves at its disposal. The Union's\r\nmacro-financial assistance should complement the programmes and resources\r\nprovided by the IMF and the World Bank. The determination of the amount of the\r\nassistance also takes into account expected financial contributions from\r\nmultilateral donors and the need to ensure fair burden sharing between the\r\nUnion and other donors, as well as the pre-existing deployment of the Union's\r\nother external financing instruments in Ukraine and the added value of the\r\noverall Union involvement. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\r\nensure that the Union's macro-financial assistance is legally and substantially\r\nin line with the key principles, objectives and measures taken within the\r\ndifferent areas of external action and other relevant Union policies.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should support the Union's external policy towards Ukraine.\r\nCommission services and the European External Action Service should work\r\nclosely together throughout the macro-financial assistance operation in order\r\nto coordinate, and to ensure the consistency of, Union external policy.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should support Ukraine's commitment to values shared with the Union,\r\nincluding democracy, the rule of law, good governance, respect for human\r\nrights, sustainable development and poverty reduction, as well as its\r\ncommitment to the principles of open, rule-based and fair trade.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A pre-condition for\r\ngranting the Union's macro-financial assistance should be that Ukraine respects\r\neffective democratic mechanisms \u2013 including a multi-party parliamentary system \u2013\r\nand the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. In addition, the\r\nspecific objectives of the Union's macro-financial assistance should strengthen\r\nthe efficiency, transparency and accountability of the public finance\r\nmanagement systems in Ukraine and to promote structural reforms aimed at\r\nsupporting sustainable and inclusive growth, employment creation and fiscal\r\nconsolidation. Both fulfilment of the preconditions and the achievement of\r\nthose objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission and the\r\nEuropean External Action Service.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\r\nUnion\u2019s financial interests linked to the Union\u2019s macro-financial assistance\r\nare protected efficiently, Ukraine should take appropriate measures relating to\r\nthe prevention of, and fight against, fraud, corruption and any other irregularities\r\nlinked to the assistance. In addition, provision should be made for the\r\nCommission to carry out checks and for the Court of Auditors to carry out\r\naudits.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Release of the Union's\r\nmacro-financial assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the European\r\nParliament and the Council (as budgetary authority). \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amounts of the\r\nprovision required for macro-financial assistance should be consistent with the\r\nbudgetary appropriations provided for in the multi-annual financial framework.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should be managed by the Commission. In order to ensure that the\r\nEuropean Parliament and the Council are able to follow the implementation of\r\nthis Decision, the Commission should regularly inform them of developments relating\r\nto the assistance and provide them with relevant documents.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should\r\nbe conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance\r\nwith Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[12].\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should be subject to economic policy conditions, to be laid down in\r\na Memorandum of Understanding. In order to ensure uniform conditions of\r\nimplementation and for reasons of efficiency, the Commission should be\r\nempowered to negotiate such conditions with the Ukrainian authorities under the\r\nsupervision of the committee of representatives of the Member States in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. Under that Regulation, the\r\nadvisory procedure should, as a general rule, apply in all cases other than as\r\nprovided for in that Regulation. Considering the potentially important impact\r\nof assistance of more than EUR 90 million, it is appropriate that the\r\nexamination procedure be used for operations above that threshold. Considering\r\nthe amount of the Union's macro-financial assistance to Ukraine, the\r\nexamination procedure should apply to the adoption of the Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding, and to any reduction, suspension or cancellation of the\r\nassistance,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union shall make macro-financial\r\nassistance available to Ukraine (\"the Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance\") of a maximum amount of EUR 1.8 billion, with a view to\r\nsupporting Ukraine's economic stabilisation and a substantive reform agenda.\r\nThe assistance shall contribute to covering Ukraine's balance of payments needs\r\nas identified in the IMF programme. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The full amount of the\r\nUnion's macro-financial assistance shall be provided to Ukraine in the form of\r\nloans.

The\r\nassistance will help the country overcome the economic and social hardships\r\nendured as a result of the domestic and regional unrest. It will promote\r\nstructural reforms aimed at raising sustainable economic growth and improving\r\npublic finance management. \n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and impact \nThe authorities\r\nwill be required to report on a set of indicators to the Commission services on\r\na regular basis and provide a comprehensive report on the compliance with the\r\nagreed policy conditions ahead of the disbursement of the assistance. \nThe Commission\r\nservices will continue to monitor public finance management, following the\r\noperational assessment of the financial circuits and administrative procedures\r\nin Ukraine that was carried out in 2014, in preparation of earlier MFA\r\noperations. The EU Delegation in Ukraine will also provide regular reporting on\r\nissues relevant for the monitoring of the assistance. The Commission services\r\nwill remain in close contact with the IMF and the World Bank to benefit from\r\ntheir insights from their on-going activities in Ukraine. \nAn annual report\r\nto the Council and European Parliament is foreseen in the proposed legislative\r\ndecision, comprising an assessment of the implementation of this operation. An\r\nindependent ex-post evaluation of the assistance will be carried out within two\r\nyears after the expiry of the implementation period.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in the short or\r\nlong term \nThe disbursement\r\nof the assistance will be conditional upon a satisfactory track record in the\r\nimplementation of the future financing arrangement between Ukraine and the IMF. In addition, the Commission shall agree with the Ukrainian authorities\r\non specific policy conditions, listed in a Memorandum of Understanding.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU involvement\nBy helping the\r\ncountry overcome the economic shock caused by the domestic and regional unrest,\r\nthe proposed MFA will contribute to promoting macroeconomic stability and\r\neconomic reforms in the country. By complementing the resources made available\r\nby the international financial institutions, the EU and other donors, it will\r\ncontribute to the overall effectiveness of the package of financial support\r\nagreed by the international donor community in the aftermath of the crisis. \nThe proposed\r\nprogramme will also contribute to strengthening the government's reform\r\ncommitment. This result will be achieved, inter alia, through appropriate\r\nconditionality for the disbursement of the assistance. In a larger context, the\r\nprogramme will signal to the other countries in the region that the EU is ready\r\nto support countries embarking on a clear path towards political reforms in\r\ntimes of economic difficulties.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from similar experiences\r\nin the past\nSince 2004, a\r\ntotal of fifteen ex-post evaluations have been carried out on macro-financial\r\nassistance operations. These evaluations conclude that MFA operations do\r\ncontribute, albeit sometimes modestly and indirectly, to the improvement of the\r\nexternal sustainability, the macroeconomic stability and the achievement of\r\nstructural reforms in the recipient country. In most cases, MFA operations had\r\na positive effect on the balance of payments of the beneficiary country and\r\nhelped to relax their budgetary constraints. They also led to a somewhat higher\r\neconomic growth.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible synergy with other\r\nrelevant instruments\nThe EU is among\r\nthe major donors of Ukraine. The EU intends to make\r\navailable up to EUR 1.565 billion in grants for the period 2014-2020 under its\r\nregular cooperation, in support of Ukraine's political and economic reforms.\nThe key value\r\nadded of the MFA in comparison to other EU instruments would be its rapid implementation\r\nto alleviate Ukraine's immediate external financial constraints, but also help\r\ncreate a stable macroeconomic framework, including by promoting a sustainable\r\nbalance-of-payments and budgetary situation, and an appropriate framework for\r\nstructural reforms. MFA does not provide a regular financial support nor is\r\nmeant to support the economic and social development of the recipient\r\ncountries. The MFA is to be discontinued as soon as the country's external\r\nfinancial situation has been brought back onto a sustainable path. \nMFA would also\r\nbe complementary to interventions envisaged by the international financial\r\ninstitutions, in particular the adjustment and reform programme supported by\r\nthe IMF and the Development Policy Loans of the World Bank.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial impact \nX Proposal/initiative\r\nof limited duration \nX\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect for 2.5 years from the entry into\r\nforce of the Memorandum of Understanding, as stated in Article (1.4) of the\r\nDecision \nX\u00a0 Financial impact from 2015 to 2018 \n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) envisaged[21] \nX Centralised\r\ndirect management by the Commission \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting rules \nThis assistance\r\nis of macroeconomic nature and its design is consistent with the IMF-supported\r\neconomic programme. The monitoring of the action by the Commission services\r\nwill take place on the basis of progress in the implementation of the IMF\r\narrangement and specific reform measures to be agreed with the Ukrainian\r\nauthorities in a Memorandum of Understanding (see also point 1.4.4).\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control system \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThere are\r\nfiduciary, policy and political risks related to the proposed MFA operation. \nThere is a risk\r\nthat the macro-financial assistance, which is not dedicated to specific\r\nexpenses, could be used in a fraudulent way. In general terms, this risk is\r\nrelated to factors such as the quality of management systems in the central\r\nbank and the Ministry of Finance and the appropriateness of internal and\r\nexternal audit capabilities. \nAnother key risk\r\nto the operation stems from the economic and political uncertainty, notably due\r\nto the unprovoked Russian violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity. On the domestic front, the main risk is instability related to\r\ndifficulties in the political and economic reform process. The full\r\nimplementation of the stabilisation and reform measures supported by the\r\ninternational community, including the proposed MFA operation, might be\r\nundermined by social dissatisfaction potentially leading to unrest.\nFinally, there\r\nare risks stemming from a possible weakening of the European and global\r\neconomic environment.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control method(s) envisaged \nThe\r\nmacro-financial assistance will be liable to verification, control and auditing\r\nprocedures under the responsibility of the Commission, including the European\r\nAntifraud Office (OLAF), and by the European Court of Auditors.\n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Costs and benefits of controls and\r\nprobable non-compliance rate\nThe basic costs\r\nfor the Commission related to the methods of verification and control as well\r\nas the cost of the Operational Assessment of financial and administrative\r\ncircuits conducted prior to the operation, are described in Table 3.2.1. In\r\naddition, there are costs for the European Court of Auditors and of possible\r\ninterventions of the OLAF. The Operational Assessment not only helps assess\r\nrisks of misuse of the funds but, as a collateral benefit, it provides useful\r\ninformation on the necessary reforms in the area of public finance management. Regarding\r\nthe probable non-compliance rate, the risk of non-compliance (in the form of\r\nnon-repayment of the loan or misuse of the funds) is judged to be low, based on\r\nthe experience with the MFA instrument since its creation.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud and\r\nirregularities \nTo mitigate the\r\nrisks of fraudulent use several measures have been and will be taken: \nFirst, the\r\nCommission services, with the support of duly mandated external experts,\r\ncarried out an Operational Assessment of the financial circuits and\r\nadministrative procedures at the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of\r\nUkraine in April 2014, in order to fulfil the requirements of the Financial\r\nRegulation applicable to the General Budget of the European Communities. This\r\nreview covered areas such as budget preparation and execution, public internal\r\nfinancial control, internal and external audit, public procurement, cash and\r\npublic debt management, as well as the independence of the central bank. It determined that the framework for sound financial\r\nmanagement of macro-financial assistance is sufficiently effective in Ukraine\r\nfor the EU to provide this support. Also, the assistance will be paid to\r\na dedicated account at the National Bank of Ukraine.\nSecond, the\r\nproposed legal basis for macro-financial assistance to Ukraine includes a\r\nprovision on fraud prevention measures. These measures will be elaborated\r\nfurther in the Memorandum of Understanding and the Loan Agreement, envisaging a\r\nset of provisions on inspection, fraud prevention, audits, and recovery of\r\nfunds in case of fraud or corruption. It is further envisaged that a number of\r\nspecific policy conditions will be attached to the assistance, including in the\r\narea of public finance management, with a view to strengthening efficiency,\r\ntransparency and accountability. \nFinally, the\r\nassistance will be liable to verification, control and auditing procedures\r\nunder the responsibility of the Commission, including OLAF, and the European\r\nCourt of Auditors.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL\r\nIMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the multiannual financial\r\nframework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \nExisting expenditure budget lines \n01 03 02\r\nMacro-financial assistance\n01 03 06 Provisioning\r\nof the Guarantee Fund\nIn order of multiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Description\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.] || Diff./non-diff.

The provisioning amount is\r\ncalculated at the beginning of the year \"n\" as the difference between\r\nthe target amount and the Fund's net assets at the end of the year\r\n\"n-1\".
