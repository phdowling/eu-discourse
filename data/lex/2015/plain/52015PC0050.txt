Negotiations on trade facilitation however only started\r\nlater after July 2004, when the WTO General Council adopted the \"WTO Doha\r\nRound Framework Package\" including Annex D providing the negotiating\r\nframework for trade facilitation. \nOnce launched, negotiations on trade\r\nfacilitation had a mandate to clarify and improve relevant aspects of several\r\narticles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1994 (\"GATT 1994\"):\r\nArticle V (Freedom of Transit), Article VIII (Fees and Formalities connected\r\nwith Importation and Exportation), and Article X (Publication and\r\nAdministration of Trade Regulations) with a view to further expediting the\r\nmovement, release and clearance of goods, including goods in transit. Besides,\r\nthe mandate states that \"the negotiations shall further aim at provisions\r\nfor effective cooperation between customs or any other appropriate authorities\r\non trade facilitation and customs compliance issues\". Finally, the mandate\r\nalso states that results of the negotiations shall take fully into account the\r\nprinciple of special and differential treatment for developing and least-developed\r\ncountries. Including that the extent and the timing of entering into\r\ncommitments shall be related to the implementation capacities of developing and\r\nleast-developed Members.\nAt the 9th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC9) that took\r\nplace on 3-6 December 2013, consensus was reached on a set of DDA issues,\r\nincluding on the Agreement on Trade Facilitation. In this context, the main\r\noutcome of MC9 was the Ministerial Decision on Trade Facilitation\r\n(WT/MIN(13)/36 WT/L/911), under which:\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe negotiation of the Agreement on Trade\r\nFacilitation was concluded, subject to a legal revision of the text.\n\u00b7                        \r\nA Preparatory Committee on Trade Facilitation\r\nwas established in order to ensure the expeditious entry into force of the\r\nAgreement and in order to prepare for the efficient operation of the Agreement\r\non Trade Facilitation upon its entry into force.\n\u00b7                        \r\nMinisters instructed the General Council to\r\nadopt a Protocol to insert the Agreement as Annex 1A to the Marrakesh Agreement\r\nestablishing the WTO, and to open the Protocol for acceptance until 31 July\r\n2015. \nThe legal revision of the text of the\r\nAgreement was completed in the first half of 2014. The Protocol was meant for\r\nadoption by end July 2014; however, at the WTO General Council on 24-25 July, a\r\nMember blocked the adoption of the Protocol as it was not satisfied with\r\nprogress made on public stockholding programs (which were subject of another\r\nMinisterial Decision in Bali). In November 2014, following intense negotiation\r\nmainly between India and the US, an agreement was reached that broke the\r\nimpasse. \nTherefore, on 26 November 2014, the General\r\nCouncil adopted the Protocol amending the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the\r\nWorld Trade Organization and opened it for acceptance by each WTO Member\r\naccording with its internal procedures. The Protocol will enter into force in\r\naccordance with Article X.3 of the WTO Agreement, taking effect for the Members\r\nthat have accepted the Protocol and upon acceptance by two thirds of the WTO\r\nMembers.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE OUTCOME OF THE\r\nNEGOTIATIONS\nThe Agreement on Trade Facilitation is the\r\nfirst agreement in the WTO's history and contains a set of measures designed to\r\nimprove the cross-border movement of goods by improving transparency,\r\nstreamlining customs procedures and eliminating red tape. For developing countries,\r\nit also contains innovative flexibilities which may become standard in future\r\nrules-type agreements. Its benefits have been estimated to be very substantial.\r\nThe OECD Trade Facilitation\r\nIndicators estimate that comprehensive implementation of all\r\nmeasures of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation would reduce total trade costs\r\nby 10% in developed countries and by 13-15.5% in developing countries.\nThe Agreement is divided into two sections:\n\u00b7                        \r\nSection I contains provisions for expediting the\r\nmovement, release and clearance of goods. It clarifies and improves the\r\nrelevant articles (V, VIII and X) of the GATT 1994.\n\u00b7                        \r\nSection II contains special and differential\r\ntreatment provisions for developing and least-developed countries aimed at\r\nhelping them implement the provisions of the Agreement.\nThe commitments adressed in Section I are\r\nwide and include provisions for the publication of\r\nlaws, regulations and procedures, including publication in the Internet; provisions\r\nfor advance rulings; disciplines on fees and charges; pre-arrival processing of\r\ngoods; use of electronic payment; rapid release of goods; trade facilitation\r\nmeasures for authorized operators; fast release of expedited shipments and perishable\r\ngoods; reduced formalities and documentation requirements; promotion of the use\r\nof a single window; uniformity in application of border procedures; temporary\r\nadmission of goods; improved and simplified transit procedures; and provisions\r\nfor customs cooperation.\nBesides, to assist\r\ndeveloping countries and least-developed countries to implement trade\r\nfacilitation reforms, the Agreement includes unprecedented flexibilities on\r\nspecial and differential treatment. Although the Agreement will be binding in\r\nits entirety on developed countries as from its entry into force, it recognizes\r\nthat some developing and least-developed country members will require technical\r\nassistance before they can implement some of the obligations to which it binds\r\nthem. Consequently, it has been agreed that commitments by developing and least\r\ndeveloped country members will be implemented according to different categories\r\nof commitments that attach different timeframes for implementation.\nIt is up to each developing and least-developed\r\ncountry to determine the timing and entry into force of its commitments,\r\naccording to the following categories:\n\u00b7                        \r\nCategory A commitments are those that a Member\r\nhas designated for implementation upon entry into force of the Agreement;\n\u00b7                        \r\nCategory B commitments are those that a Member\r\nhas designated for implementation after a transitional period;\n\u00b7                        \r\nCategory C commitments are those that a Member\r\nhas designated for implementation after a transitional period and upon the\r\nacquisition of implementation capacity through technical assistance and support\r\nfor capacity building.\nA significant number of developing\r\ncountries have already submitted their notifications of Category A commitments.\nA complex early-warning procedure has been\r\nestablished to cover situations where a country experiences difficulty in\r\nobtaining the support required, or where it experiences difficulty in implementation\r\nwithout technical assistance, and needs to transfer certain commitments from\r\nCategory B to Category C. All commitments notified to the Committee on Trade\r\nFacilitation will be annexed to the Agreement and become an integral part thereof.\nThe Agreement on Trade Facilitation will\r\nenter into force once accepted by two-thirds of the WTO Membership. The swift\r\nentry into force and rapid implementation of the Agreement is in the interest\r\nof the European Union as well as other Members of the WTO, as the Agreement on Trade\r\nFacilitation will contribute to the economic development of all WTO Members.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nLegal basis \nThe primary objectives of Agreement on Trade\r\nFacilitation are to simplify customs procedures and to ensure that trade flows\r\nas seamlessly and predictably as possible. Therefore, the Agreement covers matters that fall under the\r\ncommon commercial policy. The legal basis of this\r\nproposal is Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(6) of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). \nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. As a result, the principle of subsidiarity does not\r\napply.\nProposed action\nArticle 218(6) of the TFEU provides that\r\nthe Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt the decision\r\nconcluding the Agreement after obtaining the consent of the European\r\nParliament. With this proposal the Council is requested to conclude the Protocol\r\nAmending the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization. The\r\nEuropean Parliament will be called upon to give its consent to the conclusion\r\nof the Protocol. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis proposal has no implications for the\r\nbudget of the Union.\n2015/0029 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, of the Protocol Amending the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing\r\nthe World Trade Organization\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 207(4), in\r\nconjunction with point v) of Article 218(6)(a) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[1],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The World Trade\r\nOrganization (\"WTO\") launched the Doha Round of trade negotiations,\r\nknown as the Doha Development Agenda in November 2001.

Besides, the mandate referred to provisions for effective cooperation\r\nbetween customs or any other appropriate authorities on trade facilitation and\r\ncustoms compliance issues.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Negotiations have been\r\nconducted by the Commission in consultation with the Committee established by\r\nArticle 207(3) of the Treaty. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The 9th WTO\r\nMinisterial Conference held in Bali on 3-6 December 2013 adopted the\r\nMinisterial Decision on Trade Facilitation, which concluded negotiations on the\r\nAgreement on Trade Facilitation subject to the legal review of the text.

A\r\nsignificant number of developing countries have already notified their Category A commitments pursuant to Article 15(1) of the Agreement on\r\nTrade Facilitation. The Committee on Trade Facilitation will receive the\r\nnotifications of commitments under Category A for least-developed countries\r\npursuant to Article 15(2) of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation and the\r\nnotifications of commitments under Categories B and C for both developing and\r\nleast-developed countries pursuant to Article 16(5) of the Agreement on Trade\r\nFacilitation.
