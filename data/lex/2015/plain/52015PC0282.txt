Considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\n\n\nFor this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and transparent.\n\n\n2.On 1 April 1987 the Commission decided\n1\n to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily understandable.\n\n\n3.The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December\u00a01992) confirmed this\n2\n, stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time.\n\n\nCodification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\n\n\n4.The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01528/2007 of 20 December 2007 applying the arrangements for products originating in certain states which are part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States provided for in agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements\n3\n. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it\n4\n, fully preserving the content of the acts being codified. At the same time, it is also necessary to make certain substantive amendments to Article 3(4) and to Article 22 of that Regulation. Therefore, the proposal is being presented in the form of a recast.\n\n\n5.The recast proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in 23\u00a0official languages, of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01528/2007 and the instruments amending it, carried out by the Publications Office of the European Union, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex\u00a0IV to the recast Regulation.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 (adapted)\n\n\n2015/0128 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\napplying the arrangements for products originating in certain states which are part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States provided for in agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements (recast)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6\u00a0on the Functioning of the European Union\u00a0\u00d5 , and in particular Article \u00d6\u00a0207(2)\u00a0\u00d5 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n5\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(1)Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01528/2007\n6\n\u00a0has been substantially amended several times\n7\n. Since further amendments are to be made, that Regulation should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 recital 1 (adapted)\n\n\n(2)\u00d6According to\u00a0\u00d5 the Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000\n8\n\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0as amended by the Agreement of 22 December 2005\n9\n\u00a0\u00d5 (\u2018ACP-EC Partnership Agreement\u2019), Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) \u00d6\u00a0were\u00a0\u00d5 to enter into force no later than 1 January 2008. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 recital 3 (adapted)\n\n\n(3)Since 2002 the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0has been negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements with the \u00d6\u00a0African, Caribbean and Pacific\u00a0\u00d5 (ACP) Group of States in the form of \u00d6\u00a0seven\u00a0\u00d5 regions comprising the Caribbean, Central Africa, Eastern and Southern Africa, \u00d6\u00a0the East African Community,\u00a0\u00d5 the Pacific Island States, the South African Development Community and West Africa. Such Economic Partnership Agreements \u00d6\u00a0have to\u00a0\u00d5 be consistent with WTO obligations, support regional integration and promote the gradual integration of the ACP economies into the rules-based world trading system, thereby fostering their sustainable development and contributing to the overall effort to eradicate poverty and to enhance living conditions in the ACP countries. In a first stage, negotiations may be concluded on agreements leading to the establishment of Economic Partnership Agreements covering at least WTO compatible goods arrangements consistent with regional economic and political integration processes, to be complemented as soon as possible by complete Economic Partnership Agreements.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 recital 4\n\n\n(4)Those agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements for which negotiations have been concluded provide that the parties may take steps to apply the agreement, before provisional application on a mutual basis, to the extent feasible. It is appropriate to take action to apply the agreements on the basis of these provisions.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 recital 5 (adapted)\n\n\n(5)The arrangements included in this Regulation are to be amended, as necessary, in accordance with the agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements, as and when such agreements are signed and concluded pursuant to Article \u00d6\u00a0218\u00a0\u00d5 of the Treaty \u00d6\u00a0on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)\u00a0\u00d5 and are either provisionally applied or in force. The arrangements are to be terminated in whole or in part if the agreements in question do not enter into force within a reasonable period of time in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 recital 6 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\n(6)For imports into the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5, the arrangements in the agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements should provide for duty free access and no tariff rate quotas for all products with the exception of arms. These arrangements are subject to transitional periods and arrangements for certain sensitive products and specific arrangements for the French Overseas Departments. In the light of the specificities of the situation of South Africa, products originating in South Africa should continue to benefit from the relevant provisions of the Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and South Africa, of the other part\n10\n\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0as amended by the Additional Protocol of 25\u00a0June 2005\n11\n\u00a0\u00d5 (\u2018TDCA\u2019), until such time as an agreement establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements enters into force between the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 and South Africa.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 recital 8 (adapted)\n\n\n(7)The rules of origin applicable to imports made under this Regulation should for a transitional period be those laid down in Annex II to this Regulation. Those rules of origin should be superseded by those annexed to any agreement with the regions or states listed in Annex\u00a0I \u00d6\u00a0to this Regulation\u00a0\u00d5 when that agreement is either provisionally applied, or enters into force, whichever is the earliest.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 recital 9 (adapted)\n\n\n(8)It is necessary to provide for the possibility of temporarily suspending the arrangements set out in this Regulation in the event of any failure to provide administrative cooperation, irregularities or fraud. Where a Member State supplies information to the Commission concerning possible fraud or failure to provide administrative cooperation, the relevant \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 legislation should apply, in particular Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97\n12\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 recital 10 (adapted)\n\n\n(9)It is appropriate that this Regulation should provide for \u00d6\u00a0a\u00a0\u00d5 special transitional safeguard and surveillance mechanism \u00d6\u00a0for sugar\u00a0\u00d5.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 recital 13 (adapted)\n\n\n(10)It is also appropriate to \u00d6\u00a0provide for\u00a0\u00d5 general safeguard measures for the products covered by this Regulation.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 recital 14\n\n\n(11)In view of the particular sensitivity of agricultural products, it is appropriate that bilateral safeguard measures may be taken when imports cause or threaten to cause disturbances in the markets for such products or disturbances in the mechanisms regulating those markets.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 recital 15 (adapted)\n\n\n(12)In accordance with Article \u00d6\u00a0349\u00a0\u00d5 of the \u00d6\u00a0TFEU\u00a0\u00d5, due account should be taken in all \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 policies of the particular structural, social and economic situations of the outermost regions of the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 specifically with reference to customs and trade policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 recital 16 (adapted)\n\n\n(13)Special account should therefore be taken both of the sensitivity of agricultural products, especially sugar, and of the particular vulnerability and interests of the outermost regions of the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 when laying down the rules on bilateral safeguards in an effective manner.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(14)Article 134 of the Treaty establishing the European Community had been deleted by the Treaty of Lisbon without being replaced with an equivalent Article in the Treaty on European Union or the TFEU. The reference to Article 134 of the Treaty establishing the European Community in Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 should therefore be deleted.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a038/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .5 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(15)In order to make technical adaptations to the arrangements for products originating in certain states part of the ACP Group of States, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the \u00d6\u00a0TFEU\u00a0\u00d5 should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending Annex\u00a0I to \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Regulation in order to add or to remove regions or states, and in respect of introducing technical amendments to Annex\u00a0II to \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Regulation that are necessary as a result of the application of that Annex. \u00f0\u00a0Moreover, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adding an Annex to this Regulation which sets out the regime applicable to products originating in South Africa once the relevant trade provisions of the TDCA have been superseded by the relevant provisions of an agreement establishing, or leading to the establishment of, an Economic Partnership Agreement.\u00a0\u00ef It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0527/2013 recital 3 (adapted)\n\n\n(16)\u00d6\u00a0Certain countries\u00a0\u00d5 not \u00d6\u00a0having\u00a0\u00d5 taken the necessary steps towards ratification of their respective Agreements \u00d6\u00a0have been removed from Annex I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01528/2007 by Regulation (EU) No\u00a0527/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n13\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00d5.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0527/2013 recital 5 (adapted)\n\n\n(17)In order to ensure that those countries can swiftly be reinstated in Annex\u00a0I to \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Regulation as soon as they have taken the necessary steps towards ratification of their respective Agreements, and pending entry into force thereof, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the \u00d6\u00a0TFEU\u00a0\u00d5 should be delegated to the Commission to reinstate the countries removed from Annex I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01528/2007 \u00d6\u00a0by\u00a0\u00d5 Regulation \u00d6\u00a0(EU) No 527/2013\u00a0\u00d5.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a037/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .14 (adapted)\n\n\n(18)The Commission should be empowered to adopt the measures necessary for \u00d6\u00a0the\u00a0\u00d5 implementation \u00d6\u00a0of this Regulation\u00a0\u00d5 in accordance with Regulation (EU) No\u00a0182/2011 of\u00a0the\u00a0European\u00a0Parliament\u00a0and\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Council\n14\n.\n\n\n(19)The advisory procedure should be used for the suspension of treatment given the nature of such suspensions. It should also be used for the adoption of surveillance and provisional safeguard measures given the effects of such measures. Where a delay in the imposition of measures would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, it is necessary to allow the Commission to adopt immediately applicable provisional measures,\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND MARKET ACCESS\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nSubject matter\n\n\nThis Regulation applies the arrangements for products originating in certain states which are part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States provided for in agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nScope\n\n\n1.

On the basis of that surveillance, the Commission shall check whether there is a cumulative increase of imports of one or more of those products originating in a particular region by more than 20\u00a0% in volume during a period of twelve consecutive months compared to the average of the yearly imports over the previous three twelve-month periods.\n\n\n3. If the level referred to in paragraph 2 is reached, the Commission shall analyse the pattern of trade, the economic justification and the sugar content of such imports. If the Commission concludes that such imports are used to circumvent the transitional safeguard mechanism provided for in Article 9, it may suspend the application of Article 4(1) to imports of products of tariff headings\u00a01704\u00a090\u00a099, 1806\u00a010\u00a030, 1806\u00a010\u00a090, 2106\u00a090\u00a059, 2106\u00a090\u00a098 originating in regions or states listed in Annex\u00a0I which are not least-developed countries listed in Annex\u00a0I to Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a0980/2005 until the end of the marketing year concerned.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a037/2014 Art. 1 and Annex\u00a0.14(5) (adapted)\n\n\n4.

A safeguard measure may be imposed in accordance with the provisions set out in this Chapter where products originating in regions or states listed in Annex I are being imported in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause any of the following:\n\n\n(a)serious injury to the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 industry;\n\n\n(b)disturbances in a sector of the economy, particularly where those disturbances produce major social problems or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5; or\n\n\n(c)disturbances in the markets of agricultural products covered by Annex I of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture or mechanisms regulating those markets.\n\n\n2. In cases where products originating in regions or states listed in Annex I are being imported into the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause disturbances in the economic situation of one or several of the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u2019s\u00a0\u00d5 outermost regions, a safeguard measure may be imposed in accordance with the provisions set out in this Chapter.\n\n\nArticle 13\n\n\nDetermination of the conditions to impose safeguard measures\n\n\n1. The determination of serious injury or a threat thereof shall cover inter alia the following factors:\n\n\n(a)the volume of imports, in particular where there has been a significant increase, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5;\n\n\n(b)the price of imports, in particular where there has been a significant price undercutting as compared with the price of a like product in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5;\n\n\n(c)the consequent impact on \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 producers as indicated by trends in certain economic factors such as production, capacity utilisation, stocks, sales, market share, the depression of prices or prevention of price increases which would normally have occurred, profits, return on capital employed, cash flow, and employment;\n\n\n(d)factors other than trends in imports which are causing or may have caused injury to the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 producers concerned.\n\n\n\n\n2. The determination of disturbances or a threat thereof shall be based on objective factors, including the following elements:\n\n\n(a)the increase in the volume of imports in absolute or relative terms to \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 production and to imports from other sources; and\n\n\n(b)the effect of such imports on prices; or\n\n\n(c)the effect of such imports on the situation of the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 industry or the economic sector concerned, including inter alia on the levels of sales, production, financial situation and employment.\n\n\n3. In determining whether imports are made under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause disturbances in the markets of agricultural products or mechanisms regulating those markets, including regulations  creating Common Market Organisations, all relevant objective factors must be taken into consideration, including one or more of the following elements:\n\n\n(a)the volume of imports as compared to previous calendar or marketing years' levels, as the case may be, internal production and consumption, and future levels planned in accordance with the reform of the Common Market Organisations;\n\n\n(b)the level of internal prices compared to the reference or target prices if applicable, and, if not applicable, compared to the average internal market prices during the same period of previous marketing years;\n\n\n(c)as of 1 October 2015, in the markets for products of tariff heading 1701, situations where the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 average market price of white sugar falls during two consecutive months below 80\u00a0% of the average \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 market price for white sugar prevailing during the previous marketing year.\n\n\n4. In determining whether the conditions referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3\u00a0are met in the case of the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u2019s\u00a0\u00d5 outermost regions, the analyses shall be restricted to the territory of the outermost region(s) concerned. Particular attention shall be paid to the size of the local industry, its financial situation and the situation of employment.\n\n\nArticle 14\n\n\nInitiation of proceedings\n\n\n1. An investigation shall be initiated upon request by a Member State or on the Commission's own initiative if it is apparent to the Commission that there is sufficient evidence to justify such initiation.\n\n\n2. The Member States shall inform the Commission should trends in imports from any of the regions or states listed in Annex I appear to call for safeguard measures. That information shall include the evidence available, as determined on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 13. The Commission shall pass that information on to all Member States within three working days.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a037/2014 Art. 1 and Annex\u00a0.14(6)\n\n\n3. Where it is apparent that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a proceeding, the Commission shall publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. Initiation shall take place within one month of the date of receipt of information from a Member State.\n\n\nThe Commission shall provide information to the Member States concerning its analysis of the information normally within 21 days of the date on which the information was provided to the Commission.\n\n\n4. If the Commission takes the view that the circumstances set out in Article 12 exist, it shall immediately notify the region or states listed in Annex I concerned of its intention to initiate an investigation. The notification may be accompanied by an invitation for consultations with the aim of clarifying the situation and arriving at a mutually satisfactory solution.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007\n\n\n\n\nArticle 15\n\n\nThe investigation\n\n\n1. Following the initiation of the proceeding, the Commission shall commence an investigation.\n\n\n2. The Commission may request Member States to supply information and Member States shall take whatever steps are necessary in order to give effect to any such request. Where that information is of general interest or where its transmission was requested by a Member State, the Commission shall forward it to all Member States provided it is not confidential; if it is confidential the Commission shall forward a non-confidential summary.\n\n\n3. In the event of an investigation restricted to an outermost region, the Commission may request the competent local authorities to supply the information referred to in paragraph 2 via the Member State concerned.\n\n\n4. The investigation shall, whenever possible, be concluded within six months of the initiation of the investigation. In exceptional circumstances, that time limit may be extended by a further period of three months.\n\n\nArticle 16\n\n\nImposition of provisional safeguard measures\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a037/2014 Art. 1 and Annex\u00a0.14(7)\n\n\n1. Provisional safeguard measures shall be applied in critical circumstances where a delay would cause damage which it would be difficult to repair, pursuant to a preliminary determination that circumstances set out in Article\u00a012 as appropriate exist. Provisional measures shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article\u00a021(4), or in cases of urgency, in accordance with Article 21(6).\n\n\n2. In view of the particular situation of outermost regions and their vulnerability to any surge in imports, provisional safeguard measures shall be applied in proceedings that concern them where a preliminary determination has shown that imports have increased. Provisional measures shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article\u00a021(4), or, in cases of urgency, in accordance with Article 21(6).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007\n\n\n3. Where a Member State requests immediate intervention by the Commission and where the conditions in paragraph 1 or 2\u00a0are met, the Commission shall take a decision within five working days of receiving the request.\n\n\n4. Provisional measures may take the form of an increase in the customs duty on the product concerned up to a level which does not exceed the customs duty applied to other WTO members, or tariff quotas.\n\n\n5. Provisional measures shall not apply for more than 180 days. Where provisional measures are restricted to outermost regions, they may not apply for more than 200 days.\n\n\n6. Should the provisional safeguard measures be repealed because the investigation shows that the conditions laid down in Articles 12 and 13 are not met, any duty collected as a result of those provisional measures shall be refunded automatically.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a037/2014 Art. 1 and Annex\u00a0.14(8)\n\n\n\n\nArticle 17\n\n\nTermination of investigation and proceeding without measures\n\n\nWhere bilateral safeguard measures are deemed unnecessary, the investigation and proceeding shall be terminated in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 21(5).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007\n\n\nArticle 18\n\n\nImposition of definitive measures\n\n\n1. Where the facts as finally established show that the circumstances set out in Article\u00a012, as appropriate, are met, the Commission shall request consultations with the region or state concerned meeting in the context of the appropriate institutional arrangement set up in the relevant agreements permitting a region or state to be included in Annex I with a view to seeking a mutually acceptable solution.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a037/2014 Art. 1 and Annex\u00a0.14(9)\n\n\n2. If the consultations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article do not lead to a mutually satisfactory solution within 30\u00a0days of the matter being referred to the region or state concerned, a decision to impose definitive bilateral safeguard measures shall be taken by the Commission in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 21(5) within 20 working days of the end of the consultation period.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 (adapted)\n\n\n3. Definitive measures may take one of the following forms:\n\n\n(a)a suspension of the further reduction of the rate of import duty for the product concerned originating in the region or state concerned;\n\n\n(b)an increase in the customs duty on the product concerned up to a level which does not exceed the customs duty applied to other WTO members;\n\n\n(c)a tariff quota.\n\n\n4. No bilateral safeguard measure shall be applied on the same product from the same region or state less than one year after previous such measures have lapsed or been removed.\n\n\nArticle 19\n\n\nDuration and review of safeguard measures\n\n\n\n\n1. A safeguard measure shall remain in force only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury or disturbances. That period shall not exceed two years, unless it is extended under paragraph 2. Where the measure is restricted to one or several of the outermost region(s) of the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5, the period of application may not exceed four years.\n\n\n2. The initial period of duration of a safeguard measure may exceptionally be extended provided it is determined that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury or disturbances.\n\n\n3. Extensions shall be adopted in accordance with the procedures of this Regulation applying to investigations and using the same procedures as the initial measures.\n\n\nThe total duration of a safeguard measure may not exceed four years, including any provisional measure. In the case of a measure restricted to outermost regions, that limit shall be extended to eight years.\n\n\n4. If the duration of a safeguard measure exceeds one year, it shall be progressively liberalised at regular intervals during its period of application, including any extension.\n\n\nConsultations with the region or state concerned shall be held periodically in the relevant institutional bodies of the agreements, with a view to establishing a timetable for their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.\n\n\nArticle 20\n\n\nSurveillance measures\n\n\n1. Where the trend in imports of a product originating in an ACP State is such that they could cause one of the situations referred to in Article 12, imports of that product may be subject to prior \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 surveillance.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a037/2014 Art. 1 and Annex\u00a0.14(10)\n\n\n2. The decision to impose surveillance shall be taken by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 21(4).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a01528/2007 (adapted)\n\n\n3. Surveillance measures shall have a limited period of validity. Unless otherwise provided, they shall cease to be valid at the end of the second six-month period following the first six months after the measures were introduced.\n\n\n4. Surveillance measures may be restricted to the territory of one or more \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 outermost region(s) where necessary.\n\n\n5. The decision to impose surveillance measures shall be communicated immediately to the appropriate institutional body set up in the relevant agreements permitting a region or state to be included in Annex I for information.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a037/2014 Art. 1 and Annex\u00a0.14(11) (adapted)\n\n\nArticle 21 \n\n\n\n\nCommittee procedure\n\n\n1.

Those measures must be strictly limited in time and must disrupt the operation of the internal market as little as possible.\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nPROCEDURAL PROVISIONS\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a038/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .5(3) (adapted)\n\n\nArticle 23\n\n\nAdaptation to technical developments\n\n\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 24 concerning technical amendments to Article 6 and Articles 9 to 22 which may be required as a result of differences between this Regulation and agreements signed with provisional application or concluded in accordance with Article 218 \u00d6\u00a0of the\u00a0\u00d5 TFEU with the regions or states listed in Annex I to this Regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a038/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .5(4) (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\nArticle 24\n\n\nExercise of the delegation\n\n\n1.

For the purpose of the application of the provisions of this Regulation, the following products shall be considered as originating in the ACP States of Annex I, hereafter, for the purpose of this Annex, referred to as \u2018ACP States\u2019:\n\n\n(a)products wholly obtained in the ACP States within the meaning of Article 3 of this Annex;\n\n\n(b)products obtained in the ACP States incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the ACP States within the meaning of Article 4 of this Annex.\n\n\n2. For the purpose of the implementation of paragraph 1, the territories of the ACP States shall be considered as being one territory.\n\n\nOriginating products made up of materials wholly obtained or sufficiently worked or processed in two or more ACP States shall be considered as products originating in the ACP State where the last working or processing took place, provided the working or processing carried out there goes beyond that referred to in Article 5 of this Annex.\n\n\n\n\n3. For products listed in Appendix 10, paragraph 2 shall apply only after 1 October 2015.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nWholly obtained products\n\n\n1. The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in the ACP States or in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 :\n\n\n(a)mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;\n\n\n(b)vegetable products harvested there;\n\n\n(c)live animals born and raised there;\n\n\n(d)products from live animals raised there;\n\n\n(e)products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;\n\n\n(f)products of aquaculture, including mariculture, where the fish are born and raised there;\n\n\n(g)products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial waters by their vessels;\n\n\n(h)products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products covered by point (g);\n\n\n(i)used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste;\n\n\n(j)waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;\n\n\n(k)products extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside their territorial waters provided that they have sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;\n\n\n(l)goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in points (a) to (k).\n\n\n2. The terms \u2018their vessels\u2019 and \u2018their factory ships\u2019 in points (g) and (h) of paragraph 1 shall apply only to vessels and factory ships \u00d6\u00a0which\u00a0\u00d5 :\n\n\n(a) are registered in a Member State or in an ACP State;\n\n\n(b) sail under the flag of a Member State or of an ACP State;\n\n\n(c) meet one of the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\n(i)they are at least 50\u00a0% owned by nationals of the ACP State or of a Member State\n\n\nor\n\n\n(ii)they are owned by companies \u00d6\u00a0which\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0;\n\n\n\u2013 have their head offices and their main places of business in the ACP State or in a Member State; and\n\n\n\u2013 are at least 50\u00a0% owned by the ACP State, public entities of that State or nationals of that country or of a Member State.\n\n\n3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 shall, upon request by an ACP State, recognise vessels chartered or leased by the ACP State to undertake fisheries activities in its exclusive economic zone as \u2018their vessels\u2019 under the following conditions:\n\n\n(a)that the ACP State offered the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 the opportunity to negotiate a fisheries agreement and the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 did not accept that offer;\n\n\n(b)that the charter or lease contract has been accepted by the Commission as providing adequate opportunities for the development of the capacity of the ACP State to fish on its own account and in particular as conferring on the ACP State the responsibility for the nautical and commercial management of the vessel placed at its disposal for a significant period of time.\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nSufficiently worked or processed products\n\n\n1. For the purposes of this Annex, products which are not wholly obtained shall be considered to be sufficiently worked or processed in the ACP States or in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 , when the conditions set out in the list in Appendix 2 or, alternatively, in Appendix 2A are fulfilled. The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Regulation, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.\n\n\n2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list, should not be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that:\n\n\n(a)their total value does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the product;\n\n\n(b)none of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are exceeded through the application of this paragraph.\n\n\nThis paragraph shall not apply to products falling within chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.\n\n\n3. (a)Notwithstanding paragraph 1 and after prior notification of the Commission by a Pacific ACP State, processed fishery products of headings 1604 and 1605 processed or manufactured in on-land premises in that State from non-originating materials of headings 0302 or 0303 that have been landed in a port of that State shall be considered as sufficiently worked or processed for the purposes of Article 2. The notification to the Commission shall indicate the development benefits to the fisheries sector in that State, and shall include the necessary information concerning the species concerned, the products to be manufactured and an indication of the respective quantities to be involved.\n\n\n(b)A report to the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 on the implementation of point (a) shall be drawn up by the Pacific ACP State no later than three years after the notification.\n\n\n(c)Point (a) shall apply without prejudice to sanitary and phytosanitary measures in force in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5, effective conservation and sustainable management of fishing resources and support to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities in the region.\n\n\n4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall apply except as provided in Article 5.\n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\n\n\nInsufficient working or processing operations\n\n\n1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 4\u00a0are satisfied:\n\n\n(a)operations to ensure the preservation of products in good condition during transport and storage (ventilation, spreading out, drying, chilling, placing in salt, sulphur dioxide or other aqueous solutions, removal of damaged parts, and like operations;\n\n\n(b)simple operations consisting of the removal of dust, sifting or screening, sorting, classifying, matching (including the making-up of sets of articles), washing, painting, cutting up;\n\n\n(c)changes of packaging and breaking up and assembly of packages;\n\n\n(d)simple placing in bottles, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards, etc., and all other simple packaging operations;\n\n\n(e)affixing marks, labels and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;\n\n\n(f)simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any other material;\n\n\n(g)simple assembly of parts to constitute a complete product;\n\n\n(h)a combination of two or more of the operations specified in points (a) to (g);\n\n\n(i)slaughter of animals;\n\n\n(j)husking, partial or total bleaching, polishing and glazing of cereals and rice;\n\n\n(k)operations to colour sugar or form sugar lumps; partial or total milling of sugar;\n\n\n(l)peeling, stoning and shelling of fruits, nuts and vegetables.\n\n\n2. All the operations carried out in either the ACP States or the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.\n\n\nArticle 6\n\n\nCumulation of origin\n\n\nCumulation with the OCT and the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. Materials originating in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 or in the OCT shall be considered as materials originating in the ACP States when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing beyond that referred to in Article 5.\n\n\n2. Working and processing carried out in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 or in the OCT shall be considered as having been carried out in the ACP States when the materials undergo subsequent working or processing in the ACP States beyond that referred to in Article 5.\n\n\n\n\n3. For the purpose of determining whether the products originate in the OCT, the provisions of this Annex shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\n\n4. For products listed in Appendix 10, the provisions of this Article shall apply only after 1 October 2015.\n\n\nCumulation with South Africa\n\n\n5. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 6, 7, 8 and 11, materials originating in South Africa shall be considered as originating in the ACP States when incorporated into a product obtained there provided they have undergone working or processing beyond that referred to in Article 5. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing.\n\n\n6. Products which have acquired originating status by virtue of paragraph 5 shall continue to be considered as products originating in the ACP States only when the value added there exceeds the value of the materials used that originate in South Africa. If that is not so, the products concerned shall be considered as originating in South Africa. In the allocation of origin, no account shall be taken of materials originating in South Africa which have undergone sufficient working or processing in the ACP States.\n\n\n7. The cumulation provided for in paragraph 5 shall not apply to the products listed in Appendices 7, 10 and 11.\n\n\n8. The cumulation provided for in paragraph 5 shall apply to the products listed in Appendix 8 only when the tariffs on those products in the framework of the Agreement on Trade, Development and Co-operation between the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 and the Republic of South Africa have been eliminated. The Commission shall publish the date on which the conditions of this paragraph have been fulfilled in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series).\n\n\n9. Without prejudice to paragraphs 7 and 8, working and processing carried out in South Africa shall be considered as having been carried out in another Member State of the South African Customs Union (SACU), being an ACP State, when the materials undergo subsequent working or processing in that other Member State of the SACU.\n\n\n10. Without prejudice to paragraphs 7 and 8 and at the request of the ACP States, working and processing carried out in South Africa shall be considered as having been carried out in the ACP States when the materials undergo subsequent working or processing in an ACP State within the context of a regional economic integration agreement.\n\n\n11. The requests of the ACP States shall be decided on in accordance with the \u00d6\u00a0examination\u00a0\u00d5 procedure referred to in Article \u00d6\u00a021(5)\u00a0\u00d5 of \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Regulation. \n\n\n12. The cumulation provided for in paragraph 5 may be applied only where the South African materials used have acquired the status of originating products through the application of rules of origin identical to those set out in this Annex. The cumulation provided for in paragraph 9 and 10 may be applied only through the application of rules of origin identical to those set out in this Annex.\n\n\nCumulation with neighbouring developing countries\n\n\n13. At the request of the ACP States, materials originating in a neighbouring developing country, other than an ACP State, belonging to a coherent geographical entity, shall be considered as materials originating in the ACP States when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided that:\n\n\n\u2013the working or processing carried out in the ACP State exceeds the operations listed in Article 5;\n\n\n\u2013the ACP States, the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 and the other countries concerned have concluded an agreement on adequate administrative procedures which will ensure correct implementation of this paragraph.\n\n\nThis paragraph shall not apply to tuna products classified under Harmonised System Chapters\u00a03 or 16 and to rice products of HS Code 1006.\n\n\nFor the purpose of determining whether products originate in a neighbouring developing country, the provisions of this Annex shall apply.\n\n\nThe requests of the ACP States shall be decided on in accordance with the \u00d6\u00a0examination\u00a0\u00d5 procedure referred to in Article \u00d6\u00a021(5)\u00a0\u00d5 of \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Regulation. Such decisions shall also identify the products for which cumulation provided for under this paragraph may not be permitted.\n\n\nArticle 7\n\n\nUnit of qualification\n\n\n\n\n1. The unit of qualification for the application of this Annex shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System.\n\n\nAccordingly:\n\n\n(a)when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole shall constitute the unit of qualification;\n\n\n(b)when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product shall be taken individually when this Annex is applied.\n\n\n2. Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.\n\n\nArticle 8\n\n\nAccessories, spare parts and tools\n\n\nAccessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.\n\n\nArticle 9\n\n\nSets\n\n\nSets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all the component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the set.\n\n\nArticle 10\n\n\nNeutral elements\n\n\nIn order to determine whether a product originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:\n\n\n(a)energy and fuel;\n\n\n(b)plant and equipment;\n\n\n(c)machines and tools;\n\n\n(d)goods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the product.\n\n\nTITLE III\n\n\nTERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n\n\n\nArticle 11\n\n\nPrinciple of territoriality\n\n\n1. The conditions set out in Title II of this Annex relating to the acquisition of originating status must be fulfilled without interruption in the ACP States, save as provided in Article 6.\n\n\n2. If originating goods exported from the ACP States, the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 or the OCT to another country are returned, except insofar as provided in Article 6, they shall be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n\n\n(a)the goods returned are the same goods as those exported; and\n\n\n(b)they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.\n\n\nArticle 12\n\n\nDirect transport\n\n\n1. The preferential treatment provided for in this Regulation shall apply only to products that satisfy the requirements of this Annex and are transported directly between the territory of the ACP States, of the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 , of the OCT or of South Africa for the purposes of Article 6 without entering any other territory. However, products constituting one single consignment may be  transported through other territories with, should the occasion arise, transhipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or warehousing and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.\n\n\nOriginating products may be transported by pipeline across territory other than that of an ACP State or of the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 .\n\n\n2. Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled shall be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing country by the production of:\n\n\n(a)a single transport document covering the passage from the exporting country through the country of transit; or\n\n\n(b)a certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country of transit:\n\n\n(i)giving an exact description of the products;\n\n\n(ii)stating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products and, where applicable, the names of the ships or the other means of transport used; and\n\n\n(iii)certifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country;\n\n\nor\n\n\n(c)failing those, any substantiating documents.\n\n\nArticle 13\n\n\nExhibitions\n\n\n\n\n1. Originating products sent from an ACP State for exhibition in a country other than those referred to in Article 6 and sold after the exhibition for importation into the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 shall benefit on importation from the provisions of this Regulation provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n\n\n(a)an exporter has consigned those products from an ACP State to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;\n\n\n(b)the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 ;\n\n\n(c)the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition; and\n\n\n(d)the products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition.\n\n\n2. A proof of origin shall be issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title IV and submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition shall be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required.\n\n\n3. Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organised for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products and during which the products remain under customs control.\n\n\nTITLE IV\n\n\nPROOF OF ORIGIN\n\n\nArticle 14\n\n\nGeneral requirements\n\n\n1. Products originating in the ACP States shall, on importation into the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 , benefit from the provisions of this Regulation upon submission of either:\n\n\n(a)a movement certificate EUR.1, a specimen of which is given in Appendix 3; or\n\n\n(b)in the cases specified in Article 19(1), a declaration, the text of which appears in Appendix 4, given by the exporter on an invoice, a delivery note or any other commercial document which describes the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified ( \u2018invoice declaration\u2019).\n\n\n2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, originating products within the meaning of this Annex shall, in the cases specified in Article 25, benefit from the provisions of this Regulation without it being necessary to submit any of the documents referred to above.\n\n\nArticle 15\n\n\nProcedure for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1\n\n\n1. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting country on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorised representative.\n\n\n2. For that purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill out both the movement certificate EUR.1 and the application form, specimens of which are given in Appendix 3. Those forms shall be completed in accordance with the provisions of this Annex. If they are handwritten, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products shall be given in the box reserved for that purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line shall be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through.\n\n\n3. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting ACP State where the movement certificate EUR.1 is issued, produce all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as fulfilment of the other requirements of this Annex.\n\n\n\n\n4. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting ACP State if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the ACP States or in one of the other countries referred to in Article 6 and fulfil the other requirements of this Annex.\n\n\n5. The issuing customs authorities shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Annex. For that purpose they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. The issuing customs authorities shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2\u00a0are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.\n\n\n6. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate.\n\n\n7. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.\n\n\nArticle 16\n\n\nMovement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively\n\n\n1. Notwithstanding Article 15(7), a movement certificate EUR.1 may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:\n\n\n(a)it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances; or\n\n\n(b)it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.\n\n\n2. For purposes the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter shall indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 relates, and state the reasons for his request.\n\n\n3. The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application agrees with that in the corresponding file.\n\n\n4. Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively shall be endorsed with the following phrase:\n\n\n\u2018ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY\u2019\n\n\n5. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in the \u2018Remarks\u2019 box of the movement certificate EUR.1.\n\n\nArticle 17\n\n\nIssue of a duplicate movement certificate EUR.1\n\n\n1. In the event of the theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.\n\n\n2. The duplicate issued in this way shall be endorsed with the following word:\n\n\n\u2018DUPLICATE\u2019\n\n\n3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in the \u2018Remarks\u2019 box of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1.\n\n\n\n\n4. The duplicate, which shall bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1, shall take effect as from that date.\n\n\nArticle 18\n\n\nIssue of movement certificates EUR.1 on the basis of a proof of origin issued or made out previously\n\n\nWhen originating products are placed under the control of a customs office in an ACP State or in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 , it shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates EUR.1 for the purpose of sending all or some of those products elsewhere within the ACP States or within the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 . The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs office under the control of which the products are placed.\n\n\nArticle 19\n\n\nConditions for making out an invoice declaration\n\n\n1. An invoice declaration as referred to in Article 14(1)(b) may be made out:\n\n\n(a)by an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 20, or\n\n\n(b)by any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products total value of which does not exceed EUR 6\u00a0000.\n\n\n2. An invoice declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the ACP States or in one of the other countries referred to in Article 6 and fulfil the other requirements of this Annex.\n\n\n3. The exporter making out an invoice declaration shall at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country, produce all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as fulfilment of the other requirements of this Annex.\n\n\n4. An invoice declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration the text of which appears in Appendix 4 using one of the linguistic versions set out in that Appendix and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. If the declaration is handwritten, it shall be written in ink in printed characters.\n\n\n5. Invoice declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 20 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting country a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any invoice declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.\n\n\n6. An invoice declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation on condition that it is presented in the importing country no longer than two years after the importation of the products to which it relates.\n\n\nArticle 20\n\n\nApproved exporter\n\n\n1. The customs authorities of the exporting country may authorise any exporter who makes frequent shipments of products under the provisions of this Regulation to make out invoice declarations irrespective of the value of  the products concerned. An exporter seeking such authorisation shall offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as fulfilment of the other requirements of this Annex.\n\n\n2. The customs authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate.\n\n\n3. The customs authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the invoice declaration.\n\n\n4. The customs authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.\n\n\n\n\n5. The customs authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, does not fulfil the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes incorrect use of the authorisation.\n\n\nArticle 21\n\n\nValidity of proof of origin\n\n\n1. A proof of origin shall be valid for ten months from the date of issue in the exporting country, and must be submitted within that period to the customs authorities of the importing country.\n\n\n2. Proof of origin which is submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.\n\n\n3. In other cases of late presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the proof of origin where the products have been submitted before the final date.\n\n\nArticle 22\n\n\nTransit procedure\n\n\nWhen the products enter an ACP State other than the country of origin, a further period of validity of 4 months shall begin on the date on which the customs authorities in the country of transit enter the following in box 7 of the certificate EUR.1:\n\n\n\u2013the word \u2018transit\u2019,\n\n\n\u2013the name of the country of transit,\n\n\n\u2013the official stamp, a specimen of which had been made available to the Commission, in conformity with Article 31, and\n\n\n\u2013the date of the endorsements.\n\n\nArticle 23\n\n\nSubmission of proof of origin\n\n\nProof of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. Those authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the application of the provisions of this Regulation.\n\n\nArticle 24\n\n\nImportation by instalments\n\n\nWhere, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing country, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or heading Nos 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonised System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.\n\n\nArticle 25\n\n\n\n\nExemptions from proof of origin\n\n\n1. Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Annex and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, that declaration can be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.\n\n\n2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.\n\n\n3. Furthermore, the total value of those products may not exceed EUR 500 in the case of small packages or EUR 1\u00a0200 in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.\n\n\nArticle 26\n\n\nInformation procedure for cumulation purposes\n\n\n1. When Articles 2(2) and 6(1) are applied, evidence of the originating status within the meaning of this Annex of the materials coming from the other ACP States, the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 or the OCT shall be given by a movement certificate EUR.1 or by the supplier's declaration, a specimen of which is given in Appendix 5A, given by the exporter in the State or OCT from which the materials came.\n\n\n2. When Articles 2(2), 6(2) and 6(9) are applied, evidence of the working or processing carried out in other ACP States, the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 , the OCT or South Africa shall be given by the supplier's declaration, a specimen of which appears in Appendix 5B, given by the exporter in the State or OCT from which the materials came.\n\n\n3. A separate supplier's declaration shall be given by the supplier for each consignment of material on the commercial invoice relating to that shipment or in an annex to that invoice, or on a delivery note or other commercial document relating to that shipment which describes the materials concerned in sufficient detail for them to be identified.\n\n\n4. The supplier's declaration may be made out on a pre-printed form.\n\n\n5. The suppliers' declarations shall be signed in manuscript. However, where the invoice and the supplier's declaration are established using electronic data-processing methods, the supplier's declaration need not be signed in manuscript provided the responsible official in the supplying company is identified to the satisfaction of the customs authorities in the State where the suppliers' declarations are drawn up. Those customs authorities may lay down conditions for the implementation of this paragraph.\n\n\n6. The supplier's declarations shall be submitted to the competent customs office in the exporting ACP State that has been requested to issue the movement certificate EUR.1.\n\n\nArticle 27\n\n\nSupporting documents\n\n\nThe documents referred to in Articles 15(3) and 19(3) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate EUR.1 or an invoice declaration can be considered as products originating in an ACP State or in one of the other countries referred to in Article 6 and fulfil the other requirements of this Annex may consist inter alia of the following:\n\n\n(a)direct evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained, for example, in his accounts or internal bookkeeping;\n\n\n(b)documents proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in an ACP State or in one of the other countries referred to in Article 6 where those documents are used in accordance with domestic law;\n\n\n(c)documents proving the working or processing of materials in the ACP States, in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 or in the OCT, issued or made out in an ACP State, in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 or in an OCT, where those documents are used in accordance with domestic law;\n\n\n(d)movement certificates EUR.1 or invoice declarations proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the ACP States or in one of the other countries referred to in Article 6 and in accordance with this Annex.\n\n\nArticle 28\n\n\n\n\nPreservation of proof of origin and supporting documents\n\n\n1. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep the documents referred to in Article 15(3) for at least three years.\n\n\n2. The exporter making out an invoice declaration shall keep a copy of this invoice declaration as well as the documents referred to in Article 19(3) for at least three years.\n\n\n3. The customs authorities of the exporting country issuing a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep the application form referred to in Article 15(2) for at least three years.\n\n\n4. The customs authorities of the importing country shall keep the movement certificates\u00a0EUR.1 and the invoice declarations submitted to them for at least three years.\n\n\nArticle 29\n\n\nDiscrepancies and formal errors\n\n\n1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that that document does correspond to the products submitted.\n\n\n2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause that document to be rejected if those errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in that document.\n\n\nArticle 30\n\n\nAmounts expressed in euro\n\n\n1. For purposes of the application of Article 19(1)(b) and Article 25(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of an ACP State, of the Member States and of the other countries or territories referred to in Article\u00a06 equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned.\n\n\n2. A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of Article 19(1)(b) or Article 25(3) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the country concerned.\n\n\n3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as on the first working day of October. The amounts shall be communicated to the Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1\u00a0January the following year. The Commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts.\n\n\n4. A country may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion of an amount expressed in euro into its national currency. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 per cent. A country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, before any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 per cent in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value.\n\n\n5. The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Commission. When carrying out that review, the Commission shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For that purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.\n\n\nTITLE V\n\n\nARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION\n\n\nArticle 31\n\n\nMutual assistance\n\n\n\n\n1. The ACP States shall send the Commission specimens of the stamps used together with the addresses of the customs authorities competent to issue movement certificates EUR.1 and carry out the subsequent verification of movement certificates EUR.1 and invoice declarations.\n\n\nMovement certificates EUR.1 and invoice declarations shall be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment from the date the information is received by the Commission.\n\n\nThe Commission shall send that information to the customs authorities of the Member States.\n\n\n2. In order to ensure the proper application of this Annex, the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 , the OCT and the ACP States shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of movement certificates EUR.1, invoice declarations or supplier's declarations and the correctness of the information given in those documents.\n\n\nThe authorities consulted shall provide the relevant information concerning the conditions under which a product has been made, indicating in particular the conditions in which the rules of origin have been complied with in the various ACP States, Member States and OCT concerned.\n\n\nArticle 32\n\n\nVerification of proof of origin\n\n\n1. Subsequent verifications of proof of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing country have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Annex.\n\n\n2. For the purposes of implementing paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing country shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the invoice declaration, or copies of those documents to the customs authorities of the exporting country giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof or origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.\n\n\n3. Verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting country. For that purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.\n\n\n4. If the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.\n\n\n5. The customs authorities requesting verification shall be informed of the results of that verification as soon as possible. Those results shall indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the ACP States or in one of the countries referred to in Article 6 and fulfil the other requirements of this Annex.\n\n\n6. If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.\n\n\n7. Where the verification procedure or any other information available appears to indicate that the provisions of this Annex are being contravened, appropriate enquires shall be carried out with due urgency to identify and prevent such contraventions.\n\n\nArticle 33\n\n\nVerification of suppliers' declarations\n\n\n1. Verification of suppliers' declaration may be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing State have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of the document or the accuracy or completeness of the information concerning the true origin of the materials in question.\n\n\n2. The customs authorities to which a supplier's declaration is submitted may request the customs authorities of the State where the declaration was made to issue an information certificate, a specimen of which is given in Appendix 6. Alternatively, the customs authorities to which a supplier's declaration is submitted may request the exporter to produce an information certificate issued by the customs authorities of the State where the declaration was made.\n\n\nA copy of the information certificate shall be preserved by the office which has issued it for at least three years.\n\n\n3. The requesting customs authorities shall be informed of the results of the verification as soon as possible. The results shall be such as to indicate positively whether the declaration concerning the status of the materials is correct.\n\n\n\n\n4. For the purpose of verification, suppliers shall keep a copy of the document containing the declaration together with all necessary evidence showing the true status of the materials for not less than three years.\n\n\n5. The customs authorities in the State where the supplier's declaration is drawn up shall have the right to call for any evidence or to carry out any check which they consider appropriate in order to verify the correctness of any supplier's declaration.\n\n\n6. Any movement certificate EUR.1 or invoice declaration issued or made out on the basis of an incorrect supplier's declaration shall be considered null and void.\n\n\nArticle 34\n\n\nPenalties\n\n\nPenalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining preferential treatment for products.\n\n\nArticle 35\n\n\nFree zones\n\n\n1. All necessary steps shall be taken to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin or a supplier's declaration and which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory are not replaced by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.\n\n\n2. By way of exemption from the provisions of paragraph 1, when originating products are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new EUR.1 certificate at the exporter's request provided that the treatment or processing undergone complies with the provisions of this Annex.\n\n\nArticle 36\n\n\nDerogations\n\n\n1. On its own initiative or in response to a request from a beneficiary country the Commission may grant a beneficiary country a temporary derogation from the provisions of this Annex where:\n\n\n(a)internal or external factors temporarily deprive it of the ability to comply with the rules for the acquisition of origin laid down in this Annex where it could do so previously; or\n\n\n(b)it requires time to prepare itself to comply with the rules for the acquisition of origin laid down in this Annex.\n\n\n2. Such a temporary derogation shall be limited to the duration of the effect of the internal or external factors giving rise to it or the length of time needed for the beneficiary country to achieve compliance with the rules.\n\n\n3. A request for derogation shall be made in writing to the Commission. It shall state the reasons as indicated in paragraph 1 why a derogation is required and shall include appropriate supporting documents.\n\n\n4. Measures under this article shall be adopted in accordance with the \u00d6\u00a0examination\u00a0\u00d5 procedure referred to in Article \u00d6\u00a021(5)\u00a0\u00d5 of \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Regulation.\n\n\nThe \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 shall respond positively to all requests by ACP States which are duly justified in accordance with this Article and which cannot cause serious injury to an established \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 industry.\n\n\nTITLE VI\n\n\n\n\nCEUTA AND MELILLA\n\n\nArticle 37\n\n\nSpecial conditions\n\n\n1. The term \u2018 \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 \u2019 used in this Annex shall not cover Ceuta and Melilla. The term \u2018products originating in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 shall not cover products originating in Ceuta and Melilla.\n\n\n2. The provisions of this Annex shall apply mutatis mutandis in determining whether products may be deemed as originating in the ACP States when imported into Ceuta and Melilla.\n\n\n3. Where products wholly obtained in Ceuta, Melilla or the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 undergo working and processing in the ACP States, they shall be considered as having been wholly obtained in the ACP States.\n\n\n4. When materials undergo further working or processing in the ACP States working or processing carried out in Ceuta, Melilla or the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 shall be considered as having been carried out in the ACP States.\n\n\n5. For the purpose of implementation of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, the insufficient operations listed in Article 5 shall not be considered as working or processing.\n\n\n6. Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory.\n\n\nTITLE VII\n\n\n FINAL PROVISION\n\n\nArticle 38\n\n\nAppendices\n\n\nThe Appendices to this Annex shall form an integral part thereof.\n\n\nAppendix 1\n\n\nIntroductory notes to the list in this Annex\n\n\nNote 1:\n\n\nThe list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 4 of this Annex.\n\n\nNote 2:\n\n\n1. First two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \u2018ex\u2019, this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.\n\n\n\n\n2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column\u00a01.\n\n\n3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.\n\n\n4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.\n\n\nNote 3:\n\n\n1. The provisions of Article 4 of this Annex concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 or in the ACP States.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nAn engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is made from \u2018other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\u2019 of heading No ex7224.\n\n\nIf this forging has been forged in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 . The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.\n\n\n2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. This if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.\n\n\n3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \u2018materials of any heading\u2019 may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression \u2018manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No \u2026\u2019 means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.\n\n\n4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nThe rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and those chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.\n\n\n5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles).\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nThe rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.\n\n\nHowever, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nIn the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth \u2014 even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn \u2014 that is the fibre stage.\n\n\n6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.\n\n\n\n\nNote 4:\n\n\n1. The term \u2018natural fibres\u2019 is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.\n\n\n2. The term \u2018natural fibres\u2019 includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos\u00a05301 to 5305.\n\n\n3. The terms \u2018textile pulp\u2019, \u2018chemical materials\u2019 and \u2018paper-making materials\u2019 are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.\n\n\n4. The term \u2018man-made staple fibres\u2019 is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.\n\n\nNote 5:\n\n\n1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).\n\n\n2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.\n\n\nThe following are the basic textile materials:\n\n\n\u2013silk,\n\n\n\u2013wool,\n\n\n\u2013coarse animal hair,\n\n\n\u2013fine animal hair,\n\n\n\u2013horsehair,\n\n\n\u2013cotton,\n\n\n\u2013paper-making materials and paper,\n\n\n\u2013flax,\n\n\n\u2013true hemp,\n\n\n\u2013jute and other textile baste fibres,\n\n\n\u2013sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,\n\n\n\n\n\u2013coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made filaments,\n\n\n\u2013artificial man-made filaments,\n\n\n\u2013current conducting filaments,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,\n\n\n\u2013other synthetic man-made staple fibres,\n\n\n\u2013artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,\n\n\n\u2013other artificial man-made staple fibres,\n\n\n\u2013yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped,\n\n\n\u2013yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped,\n\n\n\u2013products of heading No 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5\u00a0mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,\n\n\n\u2013other products of heading No 5605.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nA yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nA woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nTufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nIf the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.\n\n\n3. In the case of products incorporating \u2018yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped\u2019 this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn.\n\n\n4. In the case of products incorporating \u2018strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5\u00a0mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film\u2019, this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.\n\n\nNote 6:\n\n\n1. In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this Introductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned may be used provided that their weight does not exceed 10\u00a0% of the total weight of all the textile materials incorporated.\n\n\nTextile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63. Linings and interlinings are not being regarded as trimmings or accessories.\n\n\n2. Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do not have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope of Note 3.5.\n\n\n3. In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and accessories or other product, which do not contain any textiles, may anyway, be used freely where they cannot be made from the materials listed in column 3.\n\n\nFor example\n1\n, if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because they cannot be made from textile materials.\n\n\n4. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.\n\n\nNote 7:\n\n\n1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex2707, 2713 to 2715, ex2901, ex2902 and ex3403, the \u2018specific processes\u2019 are the following:\n\n\n(a)Vacuum distillation;\n\n\n(b)Redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process\n2\n;\n\n\n\n\n(c)Cracking;\n\n\n(d)Reforming;\n\n\n(e)Extraction by means of selective solvents;\n\n\n(f)The process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n\n\n(g)Polymerisation;\n\n\n(h)Alkylation;\n\n\n(i)Isomerisation.\n\n\n2. For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \u2018specific processes\u2019 are the following:\n\n\n(a)Vacuum distillation;\n\n\n(b)Redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process\n3\n;\n\n\n(c)Cracking;\n\n\n(d)Reforming;\n\n\n(e)Extraction by means of selective solvents;\n\n\n(f)The process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n\n\n(g)Polymerisation;\n\n\n(h)Alkylation;\n\n\n(i)Isomerisation;\n\n\n(j)In respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per cent of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);\n\n\n(k)In respect of products falling within heading No 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;\n\n\n(l)In respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex2710 only, treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20\u00a0bar and a temperature of more than 250\u00a0\u00b0C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading No ex2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation) in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;\n\n\n\n\n(m)In respect of fuel oils falling within heading No ex2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 per cent of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300\u00a0\u00b0C by the ASTM D 86 method;\n\n\n(n)In respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within heading\u00a0No\u00a0ex2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge.\n\n\n3. For the purposes of heading Nos ex2707, 2713 to 2715, ex2901, ex2902 and ex3403, simple operations such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, any combination of these operations or like operations do not confer origin.\n\n\nAppendix 2\n\n\nList of working or processing required to be carried out on non-originating materials in order that the product manufactured can obtain originating status\n\n\nThe products mentioned in the list may not all be covered by this Regulation.
