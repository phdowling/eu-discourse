The EU and Egypt signed the Convention on 15 June 2011 and on 9 October 2013 respectively.\nThe EU and Egypt deposited their instrument\r\nof acceptance with the depositary of the Convention on 26 March 2012 and 23 April\r\n2014 respectively. As a consequence, in application of its Article 10(3), the\r\nConvention entered into force in relation to the EU and Egypt on 1 May 2012 and on 1 June 2014 respectively.\nArticle 6 of the Convention provides that\r\neach Contracting Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the\r\nConvention is effectively applied. To that effect, the Association Council\r\nestablished by the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement\r\nestablishing an association between the European Communities and their Member\r\nStates, of the one part, and the Arab Republic of Egypt, of the other part[2],\r\nshould adopt a Decision replacing Protocol 4 concerning the definition of the\r\nconcept of 'originating products' and methods of administrative cooperation by\r\na new Protocol which, with regard to the rules of origin, refers to the\r\nConvention.

Furthermore, it has not been necessary to conduct an impact\r\nassessment, since the proposed amendments are technical in nature and do not\r\naffect the substance of the protocol on rules of origin currently in effect.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the Council Decision is\r\nthe first subparagraph of Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article\r\n218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union.
