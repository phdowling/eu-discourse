For this purpose, the present amendment takes into account and it is based on the Common Understanding on a temporary solution for Halloumi/Hellim, to be implemented pending the reunification of Cyprus, reached under the guidance of President Juncker during his visit to Cyprus last 16 July 2015\n1\n. However, the present amendment will equally apply to other possible future applications for the registration of names under Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 for which the geographical scope includes areas of the Republic of Cyprus where the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe Commission has consulted with the Government of the Republic of Cyprus and has received input from numerous stakeholders.\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThe Regulation lies down that, with regard to goods covered by a name registered under Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down a regime on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs, and for which the geographical scope includes areas of the Republic of Cyprus where the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control, a control body pursuant to Article 39(1) of that Regulation for the purpose of carrying out those tasks in the areas of the Republic of Cyprus where the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control shall perform the tasks foreseen in this Article. \n\n\n2015/0165 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\n\n\namending Regulation (EC) No 866/2004 on a regime under Article 2 of Protocol 10 to the Act of Accession as regards goods covered by quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to Protocol No 10 on Cyprus\n2\n to the 2003 Act of Accession, and in particular Article 2 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nActing in accordance with a special legislative procedure,\n\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Council Regulation (EC) No 866/2004\n3\n lays down special rules concerning goods, services and persons crossing the line between the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control and those areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus exercises effective control. \n\n\n(2)Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n4\n lays down a regime on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs, from which the covered products may benefit when placed in the EU market.\n\n\n(3)Article 3 of Protocol No 10 on Cyprus states that nothing in it shall preclude measures with a view to promoting the economic development of those areas.  \n\n\n(4)Pending the reunification of Cyprus, the manner in which the control mechanism regarding goods covered by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 for which the geographical scope includes areas of the Republic of Cyprus where the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control would be applied in the said areas, needs to be established. \n\n\n(5)A Common Understanding on a temporary solution for a possible Protected Designation of Origin for the cheese Halloumi/Hellim, to be implemented pending the reunification of Cyprus, has been reached under the guidance of President Juncker on 16 July 2015.
