Therefore, as an exceptional measure and given the unique situation this has created in Greece, the Commission in its Communication \"A new start for Jobs and Growth in Greece\" proposes three elements to ensure that the available EU funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund (CF) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), is effectively used for investments on the ground and reaches beneficiaries as rapidly as possible. In this context, the Commission proposes to increase the level of initial pre-financing of the funding available for the 2014-2020 period for cohesion policy programmes under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Goal and programmes supported by the EMFF to give an immediate boost to investment. In addition, in order to improve the effective use of available cohesion policy funding for the financing of operations under programmes adopted for the 2007-2013 period, it proposes to increase the maximum co-financing rates and to raise the ceiling for payments to programmes at the end of the programming period.  \n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\nIt is proposed to introduce an additional paragraph in Article 134 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to provide for additional initial pre-financing for 2014-2020 cohesion policy operational programmes under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Goal and for programmes financed from the EMFF in Greece. It is also proposed to add three additional paragraphs in Article 152 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to allow for the ceiling for the cumulative total of pre-financing and interim payments to be 100% and to increase the co-financing rate for 2007-2013 operational programmes for the Convergence and the Regional competitiveness and employment objectives in Greece to 100%. \n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\nThere was no consultation of external stakeholders.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The proposal consists of frontloading payment appropriations and is budgetary neutral over the 2014-2020 period.\n\n\nThe annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund remain unchanged.\n\n\nThe additional payment appropriations necessary to cover the immediate consequence of an increase of 2007-2013 co-financing rates and removal of the ceiling for payments are EUR 500 million in 2015 and EUR 500 million for the additional initial pre-financing in 2015.\n\n\nThese additional payment appropriations can potentially be covered by payment appropriations foreseen for interim payments for the 2014-2020 programmes depending on the progress of submission of interim payment applications in 2015. The submission of payment applications could be affected by the delayed designation of programme authorities by Member States, which is a condition for submitting interim payment applications. The Commission will monitor the situation and make appropriate proposals if needed.\n\n\nThe additional pre-financing of EUR\u00a0500 million for 2016 was however not foreseen in the draft budget 2016. Nor was the impact in 2016 of the increase in the maximum co-financing rates and in the ceiling for payments for 2007-2013 programmes. The Commission is therefore likely to propose to cover the additional payment needs through an amending letter to the 2016 draft budget taking into account revised Member States forecasts, the on-going adoption of programmes and state of play of designation of programme authorities.\n\n\nThe estimated impact on 2017 will be included in the next budgetary procedure.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\nThe proposal contains reporting arrangements concerning the implementation of these exceptional measures.\n\n\n\n2015/0160 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\n\n\namending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund as regards specific measures for Greece\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 177 thereof, \n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n1\n, \n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n2\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Greece has been affected by the consequences of the financial crisis in a unique manner. The crisis has led to persistently negative GDP growth rates in Greece over a number of years, which, in turn, has caused serious liquidity shortages and a lack of public funds available for the public investment needed to foster a sustainable recovery. This has created an exceptional situation which needs to be addressed with specific measures.\n\n\n(2)It is vital that the lack of liquidity and of public funds in Greece do not hinder investment under programmes supported by the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund (the 'Funds') and by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (the 'EMFF'). \n\n\n(3)In order to ensure that Greece has sufficient financial means to start the implementation of 2014-2020 programmes supported by the Funds and the EMFF in 2015 and 2016, it is appropriate to increase the level of the initial pre-financing paid to its operational programmes under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Goal and to programmes supported by the EMFF through the payment of an additional initial pre-financing amount in those years.\n\n\n(4)To ensure that the additional initial pre-financing amount is effectively used and reaches beneficiaries of the Funds and the EMFF as soon as possible\u00a0so that they can\u00a0make planned investments and be promptly reimbursed following the submission of their payment applications, the additional pre-financing amount should be repaid to the Commission if it is not followed by an adequate level of payment applications submitted to the Commission within a certain deadline. \n\n\n(5)In order to improve the effective use of available funding for the financing of operations under operational programmes for the Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment objectives supported by the Funds adopted for the 2007-2013 period in Greece, the maximum co-financing rates should be increased and the ceiling for payments to programmes at the end of the programming period raised. To ensure that the resources thus made available are effectively used for the financing of investments on the ground, a reporting mechanism should be provided for. \n\n\n(6)Given the urgency of the support needed, this Regulation should enter into force immediately.\n\n\n(7)Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 should therefore be amended,\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nRegulation (EU) No 1303/2013 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in Article 134, the following paragraph 1a is inserted:\n\n\n\n\n\"1a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the instalments provided for in points (b) and (c) of paragraph 1, an additional initial pre-financing amount of 3,5% of the amount of support from the Funds and the EMFF for the entire programming period shall be paid to operational programmes in Greece each year in 2015 and 2016.\n\n\nThe additional initial pre-financing shall not apply to programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal nor to the specific allocation for the Youth Employment Initiative.\n\n\nIf, by 31 December 2016, the total additional initial pre-financing amount paid on the basis of this paragraph in 2015 and 2016 to the operational programme by Fund, where applicable, is not covered by payment applications submitted by the certifying authority for that programme, Greece shall repay to the Commission the total amount of the additional initial pre-financing for that Fund paid to that programme. Those repayments shall not constitute a financial correction and shall not reduce support from the Funds or the EMFF to the operational programme. The amounts repaid shall constitute internal assigned revenue in accordance with point (c) of Article 21(3) of the Financial Regulation.\"\n\n\n(2)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in Article 152, the following paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are added:\n\n\n\"4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 79(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, the ceiling for the cumulative total of pre-financing and interim payments made shall be 100% of the contribution from the Funds to operational programmes for the Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment objectives in Greece. \n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Articles 53(2) and Article 77(1) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01083/2006 and notwithstanding the Commission decisions fixing the maximum rate and the maximum amount of the contribution from the Funds for each Greek operational programme and for each priority axis, interim payments and payments of the final balance shall be calculated by applying a maximum co-financing rate of 100% to the eligible expenditure indicated for Greek operational programmes for the Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment objectives under each priority axis in each statement of expenditure certified by the certifying authority. Article 77(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 shall not apply to operational programmes in Greece. \n\n\n6. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Greece shall establish a mechanism to ensure that additional amounts made available as a result of the measures set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 are used solely for payments to beneficiaries and operations for its operational progammes. \n\n\nGreece shall submit a report to the Commission on the implementation of paragraphs 4 and 5 by the end of 2016 and shall further report in the final implementation report to be submitted pursuant to Article 89(1a) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006.\"\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\nFor the European Parliament\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\nThe
