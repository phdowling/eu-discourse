In its\r\nWork Programme for 2015, the Commission committed to take initiatives to\r\npromote integration and employability in the labour market, including measures\r\nto support Member States in getting young people into work. The proposal on the\r\ntable regarding the Youth Employment Initiative is one of the ways to take this\r\npriority forward without delay.\nThe Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) was adopted\r\nfollowing a high-level political call from the European Council of February 2013\r\nto address the unprecedented levels of youth unemployment in certain regions of\r\nthe European Union (EU) facing a particularly difficult \u00a0situation. The\r\nFebruary 2013 Council and subsequent Council conclusions once again stressed\r\nthat the highest priority should be given to promoting youth employment. The\r\nEuropean Council called for the EU budget to be mobilised in support to Member\r\nStates' efforts in counteracting this trend. The purpose of the YEI is to provide\r\nadditional funding for promoting youth employment to the regions most affected\r\nby youth unemployment including through the implementation of the Council\r\nrecommendation on establishing the Youth Guarantee. Support provided under the\r\nYEI can only directly target young people not in employment, education or\r\ntraining and, unlike the European Social Fund, it cannot support systems and\r\nstructures. The YEI is integrated in the programming of the ESF and the\r\nprogramming arrangements can take the form of a dedicated operational\r\nprogramme, a dedicated priority axis within an operational programme or a part\r\nof one or more priority axes.\nDue to the urgency of the youth\r\nunemployment situation already from the outset the Commission proposed special\r\nprovisions so that the total amount of resources allocated to the YEI are committed\r\n(frontloaded) in the first two years of the 2014-2020 programming period, in\r\norder to allow for a speedy and substantial mobilisation of youth measures and\r\nfor immediate results. Operations under the YEI therefore have to be\r\nimplemented, in principle, by the end of 2018 and not 2023 as it is the case\r\nfor other operations supported by the European Structural and Investment Funds\r\n(ESI Funds), including the European Social Fund. In addition, it was decided\r\nthat expenditure under the YEI is eligible as from 1 September 2013 and that no\r\nnational co-financing is required for the specific allocation for the YEI. There\r\nare also other provisions in the 2014-2020 regulatory framework to speed up the\r\nimplementation of the YEI. \u00a0\nThe shorter implementation period of the\r\nYEI implies that progress with the implementation on the ground in the first\r\nyears will be crucial for the overall success of the Initiative to tackle the\r\nproblem faced by 7 million young Europeans who are without a job and are not in\r\neducation or training. Any further delays in the implementation of the YEI are\r\nlikely to compromise the process and actions undertaken by Member States to\r\ncombat youth unemployment.\nHowever, one year after the adoption of the\r\nESF Regulation and the YEI, the results do not meet the initial expectations. The\r\nfrontloading of the YEI commitments as such and the other specific measures for\r\nthe YEI have not led to the expected quick mobilisation of the resources from\r\nthe YEI. Among the main reasons identified are the ongoing process of\r\nnegotiation of the relevant operational programmes and the roll-out of\r\nrespective implementation arrangements in the Member States; the limited\r\ncapacity of the authorities to launch calls for projects and to process\r\napplications speedily and the lack of sufficient pre-financing to launch the\r\nnecessary measures. The latter issue has been raised at political level by, Member\r\nStates. A number of them have reported, at various levels, including in the\r\ncontext of meetings of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer\r\nAffairs Council (EPSCO) as well as in bilateral meetings with the Commission, that\r\nthey are facing significant difficulties in starting the implementation of\r\noperations due to the absence of sufficient funding to advance payments to\r\nbeneficiaries. From its side the European Parliament voiced concerns about the\r\nslow take-up of the YEI. This situation is particularly acute in the Member\r\nStates with the highest levels of youth unemployment since they are also the\r\nones which are facing more budgetary constraints and lack of funding. \nThe Commission has already adopted 28 out\r\nof the 34 operational programmes implementing the YEI and has closed\r\nnegotiations on a further four of those programmes which are pending adoption. In\r\naddition, the Council adopted in 2014, a number of country-specific\r\nrecommendations calling on Member States to intensify their efforts in reducing\r\nyouth unemployment. Administrative capacity and programme implementation\r\narrangements for the current period are being put in place by the Member States\r\nand the Commission has been supporting this process through technical guidance.\r\nIn terms of immediate action on the Commission's side regarding pre-financing,\r\nthe present proposal intends to respond to the issue raised by the Member\r\nStates. \nThe current levels of the initial pre-financing\r\nestablished in the Common Provisions Regulation have proved to be insufficient\r\nto close the existing funding gap and - taking into account the political\r\ncommitment entailed by the YEI - to support the effort of providing an immediate\r\nand quick response to the unacceptably high level of youth unemployment in the\r\nEU. The current levels of the initial pre-financing immediately paid upon\r\nadoption of an operational programme equal 1% of the Union contribution to that\r\noperational programme (or 1,5% for Member States under financial assistance).\r\nIn addition, interim payments to the Member State can only be made on the basis\r\nof expenditure already incurred by beneficiaries and paid, which is certified\r\nby the Member State. Interim payments are to be used to reimburse beneficiaries\r\nfor incurred expenditure. Therefore the interim payments are insufficient to\r\nmake advance payments to beneficiaries.\nThis situation, coupled with the increase in\r\nthe rate of young people at risk of poverty or social exclusion, calls for\r\nadditional measures to be put in place that address the specificities of the\r\nYEI. The frontloading of the YEI resources should be backed by mechanisms that\r\ncan actually ensure a quick mobilisation of the funding to operations in the\r\nfirst years of the programming period. In particular, it is necessary to ensure\r\nthat the initial pre-financing paid to operational programmes implementing the\r\nYEI is sufficient to fund payments to beneficiaries to start and implement\r\noperations. Contrary to the other shared management programmes, the YEI is\r\nsupported by a specific allocation which is fully funded by the EU budget. The\r\nspecific allocation for the YEI is, thus, the only source of funding under\r\nshared management which benefits of the exemption of the national co-financing\r\nrequirement. With the present proposal, the initial pre-financing made\r\navailable from the specific allocation for the YEI in 2015 will be increased to\r\nabout EUR 1 billion. The present proposal does not alter the initial\r\npre-financing paid from the ESF to operational programmes implementing the YEI,\r\nneither does it alter the initial pre-financing to be paid in 2016 from the\r\nspecific allocation for the YEI. Furthermore, it does not affect the initial\r\npre-financing paid to other programmes co-financed by other ESI Funds.\nThis increase of the initial pre-financing from\r\nthe specific allocation for the YEI paid to operational programmes supported by\r\nthe YEI (irrespective of the form of the programming arrangements) is\r\nconsidered as adequate and fully in line with the specific rules applicable to\r\nthe YEI. Furthermore, this proposal\u00a0 intends to adjust the YEI pre-financing\r\nprofile to the one of cohesion policy programmes and thus allow for the same\r\nlevel of pre-financing in relation to YEI as is normally the case for other\r\nprogrammes. In this sense the proposal aims to ensure equal treatment between\r\nthe YEI and cohesion policy funds. \nMoreover, the initial pre-financing should only\r\nbe used by the Member States for payments to beneficiaries in the\r\nimplementation of the programme supported by the YEI, in accordance with Article\r\n81 (2) of the Common Provisions Regulation and has to be made available to the responsible\r\nbody without delay. In addition, to ensure that the additional pre-financing\r\nresults in immediate implementation of the YEI, this proposal foresees for\r\nthese operational programmes that if 12 months after the entry into force of\r\nthis Regulation the Commission has not received interim payment applications \u00a0in\r\nwhich the Union contribution from the YEI amounts to at least 50% of the\r\nadditional pre-financing, the additional pre-financing will need to be\r\nreimbursed to the Commission.\nThis proposal is in line with the political\r\ncommitment of the European Union to provide an immediate\u00a0 support to the\r\nintegration of young people into the labour market.\nLast but not least, this proposal of increasing\r\npre-financing payments to the Member States does not alter the already agreed\r\noverall financial profile of national allocations: it merely proposes to\r\nadvance in time the allocations that already have been secured in the EU budget\r\nfor the YEI. The present proposal therefore increases the flexibility for the\r\nMember States to access this funding and mobilise it more thoroughly, which\r\nwould facilitate its implementation and thus using it to launch measures that\r\ndirectly benefit the integration of young Europeans into the labour market, notably\r\nthrough providing jobs, apprenticeships and traineeships. \u00a0\u00a0\nIf the current proposal were not to be\r\nadopted, the implementation of the YEI would continue to be very much delayed \u2013\r\ncontrary to the European Council's call for urgent action. As a result of the\r\nlack of readily available funding, crucial and much needed policy measures for\r\nthe integration of young people into the labour market would be seriously\r\nhampered.\nIn this context, there is an urgent need to\r\nincrease the amount of funding made available early in the programming period\r\nfor operations supported by the YEI. It is therefore necessary to increase the\r\ninitial pre-financing of the specific allocation for the YEI to allow speeding\r\nup the implementation of the YEI. The proposed pre-financing rate provides a\r\nmaximum impact without exceeding the budget availability for the YEI.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThere was no consultation of external\r\nstakeholders.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nIt is proposed to introduce an additional\r\nprovision in Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013, Article 22a, on the additional initial\r\npre-financing for operational programmes supported by the YEI. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposed modification does not imply\r\nany changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for\r\ncommitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The\r\nproposal is budgetary neutral over the 2014-2020 programming period.\nThe annual breakdown of commitment\r\nappropriations for the YEI remains unchanged.\nThe increased need for payment\r\nappropriations for the YEI additional initial pre-financing in 2015 will be fully\r\ncovered by appropriations of the 2015 budget for the YEI specific allocation. Consequently,\r\nthe proposed modification should not trigger a potential backlog of 2014-2020 unpaid\r\nclaims.\n2015/0026 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 of\r\nthe European Parliament and the Council on the European Social Fund, as regards\r\nan increase of the initial pre-financing amount paid to operational programmes\r\nsupported by the Youth Employment Initiative\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 164 thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[2],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the persistent\r\nhigh levels of youth unemployment in the Union, a Youth Employment Initiative\r\n(YEI) was established to provide support to young persons not in employment,\r\neducation or training in the most affected regions. To ensure a quick response\r\nto fighting youth unemployment, Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European\r\nParliament and the Council[3]\r\nand Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council[4] lay down provisions to\r\nallow for a quicker mobilisation of the resources allocated to the YEI, including,\r\ninter alia, the commitment of all the resources in the first two years of the\r\nprogramming period, the possibility to adopt operational programmes dedicated\r\nto the YEI before the Partnership Agreement is submitted to the Commission and the\r\neligibility of expenditure incurred with \u00a0operations under the YEI as from 1 September\r\n2013.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The budgetary constraints\r\nfaced by Member states and the lack of available funding at the initial stage\r\nof the programming period have caused significant delays in the implementation\r\nof the YEI. Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 establishes the levels for the initial\r\npre-financing amount to be paid to ensure that Member States have the means to\r\nprovide support to beneficiaries from the start of implementation of\r\noperational programmes. In the context of the YEI these amounts have been considered\r\ninsufficient to provide the necessary payments to beneficiaries for the\r\nimplementation of operations. \u00a0\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to address the\r\nbudgetary constraints faced by Member States at the initial stage of the\r\nprogramming period and, taking into account the urgent need to address youth\r\nunemployment and the specific features of the YEI, it is appropriate to lay\r\ndown provisions in order to complement Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, with a\r\nview to increase the level of the initial pre-financing paid to operational\r\nprogrammes supported by the YEI in 2015. To ensure that Member States have sufficient\r\nmeans to provide payments to beneficiaries responsible for the implementation\r\nof operations that target youth unemployment, an additional initial\r\npre-financing amount from the specific allocation for the YEI should be paid in\r\n2015 for operational programmes supported by the YEI, in order to complement\r\nthe pre-financing amounts paid in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\r\n\u00a0\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure that the\r\nadditional initial pre-financing amount is used for the immediate\r\nimplementation of the YEI, it should be foreseen that this amount is reimbursed\r\nto the Commission, if the Union contribution from\u00a0 the YEI does not amount to\r\nan adequate level in interim payment applications submitted to the Commission 12\r\nmonths after the entry into force of this Regulation. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow for the\r\nprompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, this\r\nRegulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication\r\nin the Official\u00a0 Journal of the European Union.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nIn Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 the\r\nfollowing Article 22a is inserted:\n'Article\r\n22a\nPayment\r\nof additional pre-financing to operational programmes supported by the YEI\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to the initial\r\npre-financing amount paid in accordance with point (b) of Article 134(1) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1303/2013, an initial pre-financing amount from the specific\r\nallocation for the YEI shall be paid in 2015 for all operational programmes\r\nsupported by the YEI, irrespective of the form of the programming arrangement\r\nin accordance with Article 18, in order to increase the initial pre-financing\r\nfrom the specific allocation for the YEI to 30 %.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of the\r\ncalculation of the additional pre-financing to be paid pursuant to paragraph 1,\r\nthe amounts paid from the specific allocation for the YEI to the operational\r\nprogramme in accordance with point (b) of Article 134(1) of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1303/2013 shall be deducted.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If 12 months after the\r\nentry into force of this Regulation, Member States do not submit interim payment\r\napplications in which the Union contribution from the YEI is at least equal to 50%\r\nof the additional pre-financing, they shall reimburse to the Commission the total\r\namount of the additional pre-financing paid in accordance with paragraph 1.
