The European Union and its Member States[2] are parties to the\r\nConvention[3]\r\nand the provisions of the Convention have been implemented in EU law by\r\nRegulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29\r\nApril 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC[4] (the POPs Regulation).\nThe overall objective of the Stockholm\r\nConvention is to protect human health and the environment from POPs. Specific\r\nreference is made to the precautionary approach as set out in Principle 15 of\r\nthe 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. The principle is made\r\noperational in Article 8 of the Convention, which lays down the rules for\r\nincluding additional chemicals in the Annexes to the Convention.\nAt the seventh Conference of the Parties\r\n(COP7) in May 2015, three decisions should be taken to add polychlorinated\r\nnaphthalenes (PCN) and hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) to Annexes A (elimination)\r\nand C (unintentional production) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) to Annex A. All\r\nthree substances were nominated by the EU in 2011. Furthermore the continued\r\nneed for specific exemptions and acceptable purposes for perfluorooctane\r\nsulfonic acid and its derivatives (PFOS) shall be assessed by COP7.\nAs regards the three new substances, the\r\nproduction, placing on the market, use and unintentional emission have already\r\nceased or have been severely reduced in the Union, whereas it cannot be\r\nexcluded that they are still produced, placed on the market, used and/or\r\nsignificantly unintentionally emitted in other countries. Due to the potential\r\nfor long-range environmental transport of these chemicals, the measures taken\r\nnationally or at the Union level are not sufficient to safeguard the high level\r\nof protection of the environment and human health but wider international\r\naction is necessary.\nThe POP RC recommendations\nAt its ninth meeting, the Persistent\r\nOrganic Pollutants Review Committee (POPRC) adopted the risk management\r\nevaluation on hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD). The risk management evaluation\r\nconcluded inter alia that:\n\u2013                        \r\nHCBD is not known to be currently intentionally\r\nproduced or used, therefore it is important to prevent its re-introduction and\r\nmanage the risks associated with its unintentional release.\n\u2013                        \r\nHCBD is generated as an unintentional by-product\r\nfrom industrial manufacturing processes (particularly the production of other\r\nchlorinated hydrocarbons and the production of magnesium). Measures to minimise\r\nreleases during production are known and already applied in countries that are\r\nparties to the Stockholm Convention. \n\u2013                        \r\nHCBD is unintentionally generated during\r\ncombustion and other thermal processes and industrial processes. Measures to\r\nreduce unintentional releases of POPs from such processes will lead to a\r\nfurther reduction of HCBD releases. Monitoring of HCBD may induce additional\r\ncosts. \nHCBD is released to an unknown extent from\r\nformer waste disposal sites. Control measures to minimise such releases are\r\navailable. The POPRC at its 9th meeting in October 2013 recommended the listing\r\nof HCBD in Annex A and Annex C to the Convention without exemption.\nAs regards polychlorinated naphthalenes\r\n(PCN) the risk management evaluation concluded inter alia that:\n\u2013                        \r\nPCN are not known to be currently intentionally\r\nproduced or used, however it is important to limit possible remaining uses and\r\nto prevent the re-introduction of PCN.\n\u2013                        \r\nPCN are unintentionally generated during\r\nhigh-temperature industrial processes (particularly waste incineration, but\r\nalso in other processes known to generate Polychlorinated\r\ndibenzo-p-dioxins/Polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF). Measures that\r\nreduce the release of PCDD/PCDF will also reduce PCN releases. Monitoring of\r\nPCN may induce additional costs.\u00a0 \n\u2013                        \r\nPCN are released to an unknown extent from waste\r\ndisposal sites and stocks of old appliances. Measures that are in place with\r\nrespect to PCB stockpiles will also efficiently reduce releases of PCN from\r\nstockpiles.\nThe POPRC at its 9th meeting in October\r\n2013 recommended the listing of PCN in Annex A and Annex C to the Convention\r\nwithout exemption.\nAt its tenth meeting in October 2014, the\r\nPOPRC adopted a risk management evaluation on pentachlorophenol its salts and\r\nesters (PCP). The risk management evaluation concluded inter alia that:\n\u2013                        \r\nProduction of PCP shall be restricted, with the\r\nonly exemption for uses of industrial wood preservation purposes for the\r\ntreatment of utility poles and cross-arms.\nThe POPRC at its 10th meeting in October\r\n2014 decided to recommend the listing of PCP in Annex A to the Convention with\r\na specific exemption for the production and use of PCP for utility poles and\r\ncross-arms. \nIn accordance with Article 8 (9) of the\r\nConvention, the POPRC has submitted these recommendations to the COP for its\r\nconsideration at the meeting in May 2015.\nThe POPRC also adopted recommendations on\r\nalternatives to the use of PFOS in open applications. Information on the\r\ncommercial availability and effectiveness of safer alternatives to PFOS for the\r\nfollowing applications has become available: carpets, leather and apparel,\r\ntextiles and upholstery, coating and coating additives, insecticides for the\r\ncontrol of red imported fire ants and termites, and insect bait for the control\r\nof leaf cutting ants from Atta spp. and Acromyrmex spp. Furthermore, POP RC\r\nalso encourages Parties to restrict the use of PFOS in hard metal plating,\r\n(allowed as a 'specific exemption' under the Convention), to closed-loop\r\nsystems only. The latter has been allowed as an 'acceptable purpose' under the\r\nConvention.\nHCBD and EU law\nHCBD is a priority hazardous substance\r\nunder the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) [5]. Furthermore,\r\nHCBD is listed in the Protocol on POPs of the UNECE Convention on Long-Range\r\nTransboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) and, therefore, Parties are requested to\r\neliminate its production and use. Commission Regulation (EU) No 519/2012 of 19\r\nJune 2012 amending Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council on persistent organic pollutants as regards Annex I[6] implements the ban in\r\nEU law. However, wastes and contaminated land issues remain, as well as\r\nconsideration of measures to prevent re-introduction.\nWhilst the production of HCBD in Europe has\r\nceased, it still may be produced unintentionally in some industrial activities.\r\nSuch activities, when meeting the thresholds in the Directive on industrial\r\nemissions (the IED; 2010/75/EU[7]),\r\nare required to apply the best available techniques (BAT) to prevent and reduce\r\nemissions and the impact on the environment as a whole.\u00a0 In order to operate,\r\nan industrial installation must obtain a permit from a Member State competent\r\nauthority. These permits must contain emission limit values for the polluting\r\nsubstances listed in Annex II of the IED, as well as other substances, likely\r\nto be emitted in significant quantities having regard to their nature and their\r\npotential for cross-media pollutant transfer. \nPCN and EU law \nPCN is listed in the Protocol on POPs of\r\nthe CLRTAP and, therefore, Parties are requested to eliminate its production\r\nand use. By virtue of Commission Regulation (EU) No 519/2012, production and\r\nuse of PCN is prohibited in the EU. Unintentional production via combustion\r\n(primarily waste incineration) is considered the most significant current\r\nsource.\nWhilst the production of PCN in Europe has\r\nceased, it still may be produced unintentionally in some industrial activities.\r\nSuch activities, when meeting the thresholds in the Directive on industrial\r\nemissions (the IED; 2010/75/EU), require mandatory application of the best\r\navailable techniques (BAT) to prevent and reduce emissions and the impact on\r\nthe environment as a whole. In order to operate, an industrial installation\r\nmust obtain a permit from a Member State competent authority. These permits\r\nmust contain emission limit values for the polluting substances listed in Annex\r\nII of the IED, as well as other substances, likely to be emitted in significant\r\nquantities having regard to their nature and their potential for cross-media\r\npollutant transfer. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PCP\r\nand EU law\nPlacing on the market or use of\r\npentachlorophenol as a substance, as a constituent in other substances or in\r\nmixtures in a concentration equal to or greater than 0.1% by weight is\r\nrestricted pursuant to entry 22 in Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006\r\n(REACH)[8].\r\nIn addition, placing on the market and use of PCP as a plant protection product\r\nand as a biocidal product is prohibited pursuant to Regulation (EC) No\r\n1107/2009[9]\r\nand Regulation (EU) No 528/2012[10],\r\nrespectively. \nActions subsequent to the COP7 Decisions\nSubstances listed in Annexes A, B and/or C\r\nto the Stockholm Convention will need to be included in the POPs Regulation in\r\norder to ensure that the EU implementation corresponds to the international\r\ncommitments[11].\nHCBD and PCN have been added to Annex I to\r\nthe POPs Regulation in 2012. Listing in Annex C of the Stockholm Convention\r\nwill require the listing in Annex III in addition.\nAfter the listing in Annex A to the\r\nStockholm Convention, PCP will have to be added to Annex I of the POPs\r\nRegulation. Since this will render the current listing in Annex XVII to the\r\nREACH Regulation obsolete, removal from that Annex will be initiated.\nPFOS and EU law\nAt the fourth meeting of the Conference of\r\nthe Parties to the Stockholm Convention in May 2009, it was agreed to list PFOS\r\nand its derivatives in Annex B to the Convention, with a number of specific\r\nexemptions and acceptable purposes. The implementing EU legislation is more\r\nrestrictive than the Stockholm Convention as it does not include the exemptions\r\nand the acceptable purposes that were already banned in the EU pursuant to\r\nREACH. This was done in order to comply with the over-arching principle of not\r\nlowering the level of environmental protection in the EU.\nProcedure for Adding new POP substances and\r\nAmending the Annexes of the Convention\nAccording to Article 8 of the Convention,\r\nParties may submit proposals to the Secretariat for listing a chemical in\r\nAnnexes A, B and/or C. The Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee (POP\r\nRC) shall examine the proposal.\nIf this review concludes that the chemical\r\nis likely, as a result of its long-range environmental transport, to lead to\r\nsignificant adverse human health and/or environmental effects such that global\r\naction is warranted, the proposal shall proceed and a risk management\r\nevaluation that includes an analysis of possible control measures shall be\r\ndrawn up. On this basis, the POP RC recommends whether the chemical should be\r\nconsidered by the Conference of Parties (COP) for listing in Annexes A, B\r\nand/or C. The final decision is taken by the COP. \nFor the EU, amendments to the Annexes A, B\r\nand/or C enter into force one year from the date of the communication by the\r\ndepositary of their adoption by the COP.\nThe POP RC recommendations and EU Law\nThe POP RC recommendation, if followed by\r\nthe COP in May 2015, will result in international bans on manufacturing,\r\nplacing on the market, import / export and use of PCN, HCBD and PCP, excluding\r\nPCP production and use for utility poles and cross-arms. \nThe listing of HCBD and PCN in Annex A and\r\nAnnex C and of PCP in Annex A to the Convention will require amendments to the\r\nPOPs Regulation. According to Article 14(1) of the Regulation, when substances\r\nare added to the Convention, changes to the Annexes of the Regulation can be\r\nmade in accordance with the committee procedures established in Articles 5a of\r\nDecision 1999/468/EC[12],\r\nhaving regard to Articles 10 and 11 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011[13]. \nWith regards to PFOS and its derivatives, a\r\ndeletion of the specific exemptions listed in the report of the POPRC will have\r\nno impact on the EU law as the relevant exemptions were either not implemented\r\nin the POPs Regulations or have already expired. The only exception to this is\r\nthe exemption for the use of PFOS in hard metal plating in open systems,\r\ncurrently exempted under the POPs Regulation for the use as wetting agents in\r\ncontrolled electroplating systems. This exemption under the POPs Regulation is\r\nhowever only allowed until 26 August 2015. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EU position\nIn view of the above, at the seventh COP to\r\nthe Stockholm Convention, the European Union should support the adding of PCN\r\nand HCBD to Annexes A and C to the Convention, and PCP to Annex A. As PCP is\r\nalready restricted in the EU a specific exemption for the production and use of\r\nPCP for utility poles and cross-arms is not needed, but can be accepted as part\r\nof an overall compromise. Furthermore, the European Union should support the\r\ndeletion of the relevant specific exemptions and acceptable purposes for PFOS\r\nand its derivatives, including the exemption for the use as wetting agents in\r\ncontrolled electroplating systems, since that the deletion of the exemption\r\nwill only enter into force after expiry of the exemption in the EU in August\r\n2015.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nAs PCN and HCBD are already listed in the\r\nPOPs Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 no further consultation is considered\r\nwarranted. As PCP is already banned for placing on the market and use in the EU\r\npursuant to the listing in Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (REACH)\r\nand the non-approval under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 and Regulation (EU) No\r\n528/2012, no further consultation was deemed necessary either. All substances\r\nhave been subjected to open consultations with stakeholders world-wide during\r\nthe POPRC assessment and stakeholders have also been admitted to the\r\ndeliberations of POPRC.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposal consists in a Council\r\nDecision, based on Articles 192(1) and 218(9) of the TFEU, establishing the\r\nposition to be adopted, on behalf of the EU, at COP7 of the Stockholm\r\nConvention on Persistent Organic Pollutants with regards to proposals for\r\namendments of Annexes A, B and C.\nArticle 218(9) TFEU is the appropriate\r\nlegal basis as the act that COP7 is called upon to adopt is a decision amending\r\nan annex to the Stockholm Convention which has legal effects.\n2015/0069 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf\r\nof the European Union, at the Seventh Conference of the Parties to the\r\nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants regarding the proposals\r\nfor amendments of Annexes A, B and C\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 191(1), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 14 October 2004, the\r\nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (\"the\r\nConvention\") was approved, on behalf of the European Community, by Council\r\nDecision 2006/507/EC[14].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union has implemented\r\nthe obligations of the Convention in Union law by way of Regulation (EC) No\r\n850/2004 of the European Parliament and the Council[15].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union places strong\r\nemphasis on the need for the gradual expansion of Annexes A, B and/or C to the\r\nConvention with new substances which fulfil the criteria for persistent organic\r\npollutants (POPs), taking into account the precautionary principle, with a view\r\nto meeting the objective of the Convention and the commitment of governments\r\nmade at the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in\r\n2002 to minimise the adverse effects of chemicals by 2020.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 22 of\r\nthe Convention, the Conference of the Parties (\"COP\") may adopt\r\ndecisions amending Annexes A, B and/or C to the Convention. Those decisions\r\nenter into force one year from the date of communication by the depositary of\r\nan amendment, save for those parties to the Convention (\"the\r\nParties\") that have opted out. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following a nomination of\r\npentachlorophenol (PCP)[16]\r\nreceived from the Union in 2011, the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review\r\nCommittee (\"POPRC\") established under the Convention has concluded\r\nits work on PCP. POPRC has found that PCP meets the criteria of the Convention\r\nfor a listing in Annex A. At its seventh meeting, the COP is expected to decide\r\non the inclusion of PCP in Annex A to the Convention.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The placing on the market\r\nand use of PCP is prohibited by entry 22 of Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No\r\n1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (REACH)[17]. Placing on the market\r\nand use of PCP as a plant protection product and as a biocidal product is\r\nprohibited pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council[18]\r\nand Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[19], respectively. Since\r\nPCP is capable of long-range environmental transport, a global phase-out of the\r\nuse of this substance would be more beneficial to the EU citizen than the\r\nprohibition in the Union.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 POPRC recommends the\r\nlisting of PCP under the Convention with a specific exemption for the\r\nproduction and use of PCP for utility poles and cross-arms. The Union does not\r\nneed the specific exemption but should accept the exemption in COP7, if that is\r\nrequired to ensure the listing of PCP. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following a nomination of\r\nchlorinated naphthalenes received from the Union in 2011, POPRC has found that\r\npolychlorinated naphthalenes (PCN) meet the criteria of the Convention for a\r\nlisting in Annexes A and C. At its seventh meeting, the COP is expected to\r\ndecide on the inclusion of PCN in Annexes A and C to the Convention.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is no production of\r\nPCN in the Union but it may be produced unintentionally, most significantly via\r\ncombustion (primarily waste incineration). Such activities are covered under\r\nDirective 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council[20], and require the\r\napplication of certain emission management measures.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The placing on the market\r\nand use of PCN is prohibited in the Union pursuant to Regulation (EC) No\r\n850/2004, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 519/2012[21]. Since PCN is capable\r\nof long-range environmental transport, a global phase-out of the use of this\r\nsubstance would be more beneficial to the EU citizen than the prohibition under\r\nRegulation (EC) No 850/2004 in the Union.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following a nomination of\r\nhexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) received from the Union in 2011, POPRC has found\r\nthat HCBD meets the criteria of the Convention for a listing in Annexes A and\r\nC. At its seventh meeting, the COP is expected to decide on the inclusion of\r\nHCBD in Annexes A and C to the Convention.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The production of HCBD has\r\nceased in the Union but it may be produced unintentionally in some industrial\r\nactivities. Such activities are covered under Directive 2010/75/EU and require\r\nthe application of certain emission management measures.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The placing on the market\r\nand use of HCBD is prohibited in the Union pursuant to Regulation (EC) No\r\n850/2004, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 519/2012. Since HCBD is\r\ncapable of long-range environmental transport, a global phase-out of the use of\r\nthis substance would be more beneficial to the EU citizen than the prohibition\r\nunder Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 in the Union.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Perfluorooctane sulfonic\r\nacid and its derivatives (PFOS) are already listed in Annex A to the Convention\r\nwith a number of specific exemptions. Following a review of those exemptions,\r\nPOPRC encourages parties to stop using PFOS in carpets, leather and apparel,\r\ntextiles and upholstery, coating and coating additives and insecticides for the\r\ncontrol of red imported fire ants and termites. POPRC also encourages Parties\r\nto restrict the use of PFOS in hard metal plating, which is allowed as a\r\n'specific exemption', by only keeping the use in hard metal plating only in\r\nclosed-loop systems, which is allowed as an 'acceptable purpose' under the\r\nConvention. Moreover, POPRC encourages parties to stop using PFOS in insect\r\nbaits for control of leaf cutting ants from Atta spp. and Acromyrmex spp.,\r\nwhich is currently allowed as an 'acceptable purpose'.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union should support\r\nthe deletion of the 'specific exemptions' and 'acceptable purposes' for PFOS\r\nand its derivatives in line with the proposal made by POPRC, including the\r\nexemption for use as wetting agents in controlled electroplating systems, which\r\nhas been implemented in the Union by Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 as amended by\r\nRegulation (EU) No 757/2010[22]\r\nwith the expiry date of 26 August 2015,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe position to\r\nbe taken by the Union at the seventh Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm\r\nConvention shall be, in line with the recommendations of the Persistent Organic\r\nPollutants Review Committee [23],\r\nto support:\n\u2013              \r\nthe listing of pentachlorophenol (PCP)[24] in Annex A to the\r\nConvention. If required, the Union can accept a 'specific exemption' for the\r\nproduction and use of PCP for utility poles and cross-arms;\n\u2013              \r\nthe listing of polychlorinated naphthalenes\r\n(PCN)[25]\r\nin Annexes A and C to the Convention without exemption;\n\u2013              \r\nthe listing of hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) in\r\nAnnexes A and C to the Convention without exemption;\n\u2013              \r\nthe deletion of the following exemptions and\r\nacceptable purposes from the entry on perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and\r\nits derivatives in Annex B to the Convention: carpets; leather and apparel;\r\ntextiles and upholstery; coating and coating additives; insecticides for the\r\ncontrol of red imported fire ants and termites; and insect bait for the control\r\nof leaf cutting ants from Atta spp. and Acromyrmex spp.;\n\u2013              \r\nthe deletion of the specific exemption for PFOS\r\nin metal plating, save for hard metal plating only in closed-loop systems,\r\nlisted as an 'acceptable purpose' in the Convention.\nRefinement of this position, in light of\r\ndevelopments at the seventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the\r\nStockholm Convention, may be agreed to by the representatives of the Union in\r\nthe meeting, following coordination on the spot, without further decision of\r\nthe Council. \nArticle 2\nThis\r\nDecision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.\nDone at
