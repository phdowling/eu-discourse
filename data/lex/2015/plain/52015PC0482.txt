The Agreement established, on the basis of reciprocity, legally binding rights and obligations for the purpose of simplifying the visa issuing procedures for the citizens of Cape Verde and for the EU citizens. Article 10 of this Agreement sets up a Joint Committee tasked to monitor the implementation of the Agreement. \n\n\nThe common guidelines for this Agreement are necessary in order to ensure a fully harmonised implementation of the Visa Facilitation Agreement amongst the consulates of the Member States and of the Republic of Cape Verde, and for clarifying the relationship between the provisions of that Agreement and the provisions of the contracting parties that continue to apply to visa issues not covered by the Agreement.\n\n\nThe implementing guidelines to be adopted will not be part of the Agreement; however, it is highly recommended that diplomatic and consular staff consistently follow them when implementing the provisions of the Agreement.\n\n\nThe Guidelines have been prepared in line with the Agreement which contains provisions on facilitations in the procedures for issuing visas for an intended stay of no more than 90 days per period of 180 days in the Schengen area for the citizens of Cape Verde and of the EU, as well as with the EU legislation in the area of common visa policy, such as the Visa Code.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe Guidelines, which are to be adopted on the basis of the empowerment given to the representative of the Commission in the Joint Committee on the basis of this proposal, are to explain in detail the provisions of the Agreement and provide guidance on its implementation. \n\n\nThe Guidelines take into consideration the provisions of the Visa Code and other legislative acts in the field of EU visa policy in order to ensure that consular staff of the Member States acts in accordance with the EU visa acquis when implementing the provisions of the Visa Facilitation Agreement. \n\n\nThe provisions of the Agreement have precedence over the provisions of the Visa Code on matters which they both regulate. \n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\nThe Guidelines as annexed to the Annex of this proposal for a Council Decision are the outcome of consultations with the Member States in the context of the Visa Working Party on 7.04.2015. and 11.05.2015. The Commission consulted these Guidelines with responsible authorities in Cape Verde in November 2014.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis proposal has no impact on the EU budget.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n2015/0232 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\nestablishing the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union \nwithin the Joint Committee set up under the Agreement \nbetween the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde \non facilitating the issue of short-stay visas \nto citizens of the Republic of Cape Verde and of the European Union, \nwith regard \nto the adoption of common guidelines for the implementation of the Agreement\n\n\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular to Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Article 10 of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde on facilitating the issue of short-stay visas to citizens of the Republic of Cape Verde and of the European Union  ('the Agreement') sets up a Joint Committee.

THE AGREEMENT \n\n\nBETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE REPUBLIC OF CAPE VERDE \n\n\nON FACILITATING THE ISSUE OF SHORT-STAY VISAS                                                   TO CITIZENS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CAPE VERDE                                                     AND OF THE EUROPEAN UNION\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde on facilitating the issuing of short-stay visas to citizens of the Republic of Cape Verde and of the European Union, which entered into force on 1.12.2014., is to facilitate, on the basis of reciprocity, the procedures for issuing visas for an intended stay of no more than 90 days per period of 180 days to the citizens of Republic of Cape Verde and of the European Union.\n\n\nThe Agreement establishes reciprocal legally binding rights and obligations for the purpose of simplifying the procedures of issuing visas to the citizens of Republic of Cape Verde and of the European Union.\n\n\nThese Guidelines, adopted by the Joint Committee established by the Agreement, aim at ensuring a correct and harmonised implementation of the provisions of the Agreement by the diplomatic missions and consular posts of the Republic of Cape Verde and of the Member States. These Guidelines are not part of the Agreement and therefore are not legally binding. However, it is highly recommended that diplomatic and consular staff consistently follow them when implementing the provisions of the Agreement.\n\n\nThe Guidelines are conceived as a living document, to be updated in light of the experiences of the implementation of the Agreement under the responsibility of the Joint Committee set up by Article 10 of the Agreement.\n\n\n\nI.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GENERAL ISSUES.\n\n\n\n1.1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Purpose and scope of application.\n\n\nArticle 1 of the Agreement stipulates that: \u201cThe purpose of this Agreement is to facilitate, on the basis of reciprocity, the issue of visas to citizens of Cape Verde and of the Union for an intended stay of no more than 90 days per period of 180 days.\u201d\n\n\nThe Agreement applies to all citizens of the Republic of Cape Verde and of the European Union who apply for a short-stay visa, regardless of the country in which they reside. \n\n\nThe Agreement does not apply to stateless persons holding a residence permit issued by the Republic of Cape Verde or the Member States of the European Union. The normal rules of the EU visa acquis apply to this category of persons.\n\n\n\n1.2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scope of the Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 2 of the Agreement stipulates that:\n\n\n\u201c1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The measures to facilitate the issue of visas set out in this Agreement shall apply to citizens of Cape Verde and of the Union only in so far as they are not exempt from visa requirements under the laws and regulations of the Union or its Member States or of Cape Verde, or under the present Agreement or other international agreements.\n\n\n2. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national law of Cape Verde and of the Member States or the law of the Union shall apply to matters not covered by the provisions of this Agreement, such as refusal to issue a visa, recognition of travel documents, proof of sufficient means of subsistence, refusal of entry and expulsion measures.\"\n\n\nWithout prejudice to Article 8 (which provides for the exemption from the visa requirement for holders of diplomatic or service passports issued by the Republic of Cape Verde and by the Member States), the Agreement does not affect the existing rules on visa obligations and visa exemptions. For instance, Article 4 of Council Regulation N\u00b0539/2001  allows Member States to exempt from the visa requirement civilian air and sea crews among other categories.\n\n\nThe Visa Code  applies to all issues not covered by the Agreement such as the determination of the Schengen Member State responsible for processing a visa application, the motivation of refusal to issue a visa and the right to appeal against a negative decision. Furthermore, Schengen rules and national law continue also to apply to issues which are not covered by the Agreement, such as the recognition of travel documents, proof of documentary evidence regarding the purpose of the journey and sufficient means of subsistence, the processing times for visa applications, refusal of entry in the territory of EU Member States, expulsion measures. \n\n\nEven if the conditions foreseen in the Agreement are met, the issuing of the visa still can be refused if the conditions laid down in Article 5 of the Schengen Borders Code  are not fulfilled, i.e. the person is not in possession of a valid travel document, an alert in the SIS has been issued, the person is considered a threat for public policy, internal security, etc. \n\n\nOther flexibilities in the issuing of visas allowed for by the Visa Code continue to apply. For instance, multiple-entry visas for a long period of validity \u2013 up to five years \u2013 can be issued to categories of persons other than those mentioned in Article 4, if the conditions foreseen in the Visa Code (Article 24) are met. In the same way, the provisions contained in the Code allowing waiver or reduction of the visa fee will continue to apply (Article 16 (5) and (6).\n\n\n\n\nThe national law of Cape Verde continues to apply to all issues related to issuing the EU citizens with visas by Cape Verde and not covered by the Agreement, such as those mentioned in three preceding paragraphs. \n\n\n\n1.3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Types of visas falling within the scope of the Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 3 (d) of the Agreement defines \u201cvisa\u201d as \u201can authorisation issued or a decision taken by a Member State or by Cape Verde which is required with a view to entering, for transit purposes or for an intended stay of no more than 90 days in total, the territory of that Member State or of several Member States or the territory of Cape Verde\".\n\n\nThe facilitations provided by the Agreement apply both to uniform visas valid for the entire territory of the Member States, and to visas with limited territorial validity (LTV). They also apply to short-stay and transit visas issued by Cape Verde to EU citizens. \n\n\n\n1.4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calculation of the length of stay authorised by a visa \n\n\nThe current definition in the Schengen Borders Code  of the notion of short stay reads as follows: \u201c90 days in any 180 day-period, which entails considering the 180-day period preceding each day of stay\u201d. \n\n\nThe day of entry will be calculated as the first day of stay in the territory of the Member States and the day of exit will be calculated as the last day of stay in the territory of the Member States. The notion of \u201cany\u201d implies the application of a \u201cmoving\u201d 180-day reference period, on each day of the stay looking back to the last 180 days period, in order to verify if the 90/180 day requirement continues to be fulfilled. This means that an absence in the territory of the Member States for an uninterrupted period of 90 days allows for a new stay of up to 90 days.\n\n\nA short-stay calculator, which can be used for calculating the period of allowed stay under the new rules, can be found on-line at the following address: http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/border-crossing/index_en.htm. \n\n\nExample of calculation of stay on the basis of the new definition:\n\n\nA person holding a multiple entry visa for 1 year (18.4.2014 \u2013 18.4.2015) enters for the first time on 19.4.2014 and stays for 3 days. Then the same person enters again on 18.6.2014 and stays for 86 days. What is the situation on specific dates? When will this person be allowed to enter again? \n\n\nOn 11.9.2014: Over the last 180 days (16.3.2014 \u2013 11.9.2014) the person had stayed for 3 days (19. \u2013 21.4.2014) plus 86 days (18.6.2014 \u2013 11.9.2014) = 89 days = No overstay. The person may still stay for up to 1 day.\n\n\nAs of 16.10.2014: The person might enter for a stay of 3 additional days (on 16.10.2014the stay on 19.4.2014 becomes irrelevant (outside the 180 days period); on 17.10.2014 the stay on 20.4.2014 becomes irrelevant (outside the 180 days period; etc.).\n\n\nAs of 15.12.2014: The person might enter for 86 additional days (on 15.12.2014, the stay on 18.6.2014 becomes irrelevant (outside the 180 days period); on 16.12.2014, the stay on 19.6.2014 becomes irrelevant, etc.).\n\n\n\n1.5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Situation regarding the Member States that do not yet fully apply the Schengen acquis, Member States that do not participate in the EU Common Visa Policy and associated countries.\n\n\nMember States that joined the EU in 2004 (Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia), 2007 (Bulgaria and Romania) and 2013 (Croatia) are bound by the Agreement as from its entry into force.\n\n\nOnly Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania do not yet fully implement the Schengen acquis. They will continue issuing national visas with a validity limited to their own national territory. Once these Member States fully implement the Schengen acquis, they will continue to apply the Agreement.\n\n\nNational law continues to apply to all issues not covered by the Agreement until the date of full implementation of the Schengen acquis by these Member States. As from that date, Schengen rules/national law apply to issues not regulated by the Agreement.\n\n\n\n\nBulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania are authorised  to recognise residence permits, D visas and short stay visas issued by Schengen States and associated countries for short stays on their territory. \n\n\nAccording to Article 21 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, all Schengen States must recognise the long-stay visas and residence permits issued by each other as valid for short stays on each other\u2019s territories. Schengen Member States accept residence permits, D visas and short stay visas of associated countries for entry and short stay and vice versa.\n\n\nThe Agreement does not apply to the UK, Ireland and Denmark but comprises joint declarations about the desirability of concluding bilateral agreements on visa facilitation between the Republic of Cape Verde and those Member States.\n\n\nAlthough associated with Schengen, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein are not bound by the Agreement. However, the agreement contains a joint declaration about the desirability to conclude bilateral agreements on visa facilitation between the Republic of Cape Verde and those Schengen countries without delay.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0European Union Agreement/Bilateral Agreements.\n\n\nArticle 11 of the Agreement stipulates that:\n\n\n\u201cFrom its entry into force, this Agreement shall take precedence over the provisions of any bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements concluded between Member States and Cape Verde, in so far as the provisions of those agreements or arrangements relate to matters that are dealt with by this Agreement.\u201d\n\n\nAs from the date of entry into force of the Agreement, provisions in the bilateral Agreements in force between Member States and the Republic of Cape Verde on issues dealt with by the visa facilitation agreement cease to apply. In accordance with Union law, Member States have to take the necessary measures to eliminate the incompatibilities between their bilateral Agreements and the European Union Agreement.\n\n\nShould a Member State have concluded a bilateral Agreement or arrangement with the Republic of Cape Verde on issues not covered by the European Union Agreement, this exemption would continue to apply after the entry into force of the European Union visa facilitation Agreement.\n\n\n\nII.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GUIDELINES ON SPECIFIC PROVISIONS.\n\n\n\n2.1. Rules that apply to all visa applicants\n\n\nImportant: It is recalled that the facilitations mentioned below regarding the departure in case of lost or stolen documents and the extension of visa in exceptional circumstances apply to all visa holders from the Republic of Cape Verde and the Member States.\n\n\n\n2.1.1. Extension of visa in exceptional circumstances.\n\n\nArticle 7 of the Agreement stipulates that:\n\n\n\u201d Citizens of Cape Verde and of the Union who are unable to leave the territory of the Member States or of Cape Verde respectively by the date indicated in their visas for reasons of force majeure shall have their visas extended free of charge in accordance with the legislation applied by the host State for the period necessary for their return to their State of residence.\"\n\n\nRegarding the possibility of extending the validity of the visa in cases of force majeure, for instance a stay in hospital due to an accident, where the holder of the visa does not have the possibility to leave the territory of the Member State  by the date indicated on the visa sticker, the provisions of Article 33(1)  of the Visa Code will apply as long as they are compatible with the Agreement (for example, the extended visa will remain a uniform visa, entitling entry to the territory of all the Schengen Member States for which this visa was valid at the time of issue). However, under the Agreement the extension of the visa is carried out free of charge in case of force majeure.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2. Rules that apply to certain categories of visa applicants.\n\n\n2.2.1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Issuing of multiple-entry visas.\n\n\nIn cases where the visa applicant needs to travel frequently or regularly to the territory of the Republic of Cape Verde or to the territory of the Member States, short-stay visas may be issued for several visits, provided that the total length of these visits does not exceed 90 days in any 180-day period. \n\n\nArticle 4 of the Agreement stipulates that:\n\n\n\u201c1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Diplomatic missions and consular posts of the Member States and of Cape Verde shall issue multiple-entry visas valid for five years to the following categories of citizen:\n\n\n(a) members of national and regional governments and parliaments, constitutional courts, supreme courts or courts of auditors, if they are not exempt from visa requirements under this Agreement, in the exercise of their duties;\n\n\n(b) permanent members of official delegations who, following an official invitation addressed to Cape Verde, the Member States or the Union, take part in meetings, consultations, negotiations or exchange programmes, or in events in the territory of the Member States or Cape Verde organised on the initiative of intergovernmental organisations;\n\n\n(c) business people and company representatives who regularly travel to the Member States or to Cape Verde;\n\n\n(d) spouses, children (including adopted children) who are under the age of 21 or are dependent, and parents visiting either:\n\n\n\u2014 citizens of Cape Verde legally resident in the territory of a Member State or citizens of the Union legally resident in Cape Verde, or\n\n\n\u2014 citizens of the Union resident in the Member State of their nationality, or citizens of Cape Verde resident in Cape Verde.\n\n\nHowever, if the need or intention to travel frequently or regularly is clearly limited to a shorter stay, the validity of the multiple-entry visa shall be limited to this stay, in particular where\n\n\n\u2014 the term of office, in the case of those covered by point (a) above,\n\n\n\u2014 the term of office of a permanent member of an official delegation, in the case of those covered by point (b) above,\n\n\n\u2014 the duration of the positions as business people and company representatives, in the case of those covered by point (c) above, or\n\n\n\u2014 the duration of the residence permits issued to Cape Verde citizens residing in the territory of a Member State and Union citizens residing in Cape Verde, in the case of those covered by point (d) above,\n\n\nis less than five years.\"\n\n\n\nTaking into account the professional status of these categories of persons, or their family relationship with a citizen of the Republic of Cape Verde or of the Member States who is legally residing in the territory of the Republic of Cape Verde or of the Member States, as well as regarding the relatives of citizens of the Union resident in the Member State of their nationality, or citizens of Cape Verde resident in Cape Verde, it is justified to grant them a multiple-entry visa with a validity of five years, or limited to the term of office or to their legal residence if these are of less than 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs regards persons falling under Article 4(1)(a), confirmation should be given regarding their professional status and the duration of their mandate.\n\n\nThis provision will not apply to persons falling under Article 4(1)(a) if they are exempted from the visa requirement by the Agreement, i.e. if they are holders of a diplomatic or a service passport. \n\n\nPersons falling under Article 4(1)(b), must present proof regarding their permanent status as a member of the delegation and the need to participate regularly in meetings, consultations, negotiations or exchange programs.\n\n\nPersons falling under Article 4(1)(c) must present proof regarding their professional status and the duration of their activities.\n\n\n\nPersons falling under Article 4(1)(d), must present proof regarding the legal residence of the inviting person. \n\n\nIn cases where the need or the intention to travel frequently or regularly is clearly limited to a shorter period, the validity of the multiple-entry visa will be limited to that period.\n\n\n\n\u201c2. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Diplomatic missions and consular posts of the Member States and Cape Verde shall issue multiple-entry visas valid for one year to the following categories of citizens, provided that during the previous year they have obtained at least one visa and that they have made use of it in accordance with the laws on entry and residence in the territory of the State in question:\n\n\n(a) representatives of civil society organisations travelling regularly to Member States or to Cape Verde for the purposes of educational training or to take part in seminars and conferences, including as part of exchange programmes;\n\n\n(b) practitioners of a liberal profession taking part in international exhibitions, conferences, symposia, seminars or other similar events who regularly travel to the Member States or to Cape Verde;\n\n\n(c) persons taking part in scientific, cultural and artistic activities, including university and other exchange programmes, who regularly travel to the Member States or to Cape Verde;\n\n\n(d) participants in international sports events and persons accompanying them in a professional capacity;\n\n\n(e) journalists and accredited persons accompanying them in a professional capacity;\n\n\n(f) school pupils, students, post-graduate students and accompanying teachers who undertake trips for the purposes of study or educational training, including exchange programmes and other school-related activities;\n\n\n(g) representatives of religious organisations recognised in Cape Verde or in the Member States who regularly travel to the Member States or to Cape Verde respectively;\n\n\n(h) persons visiting regularly for medical reasons;\n\n\n(i) participants in official exchange programmes organised by twinned towns or municipal authorities;\n\n\n(j) members of official delegations who, following an official invitation addressed to Cape Verde, the Member States or the Union, regularly take part in meetings, consultations, negotiations or exchange programmes, and in events in the territory of the Member States or of Cape Verde organised on the initiative of intergovernmental organisations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if the need or intention to travel frequently or regularly is clearly limited to a shorter stay, the validity of the multiple-entry visa shall be limited to the length of this stay.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn principle, multiple-entry visas valid for one year will be issued to the above mentioned categories if during the previous year (12 months) the visa applicant has obtained at least one visa and has made use of it in conformity with the laws on entry and stay of the State(s) visited (for instance, the person has not overstayed) and if there are reasons for requesting a multiple-entry visa. \n\n\nIn cases where it is not justified to issue a visa valid for one year, (for instance, if the duration of the exchange programme is of less than one year or the person does not need to travel for a full year) the validity of the visa will be of less than one year, provided that the other requirements for issuing the visa are met.\n\n\n\n\"3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Diplomatic missions and consular posts of the Member States and of Cape Verde shall issue multiple-entry visas that are valid for at least two years and at most five years to citizens in the categories referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, provided that during the two years prior to the application they have made use of a one-year multiple-entry visa in accordance with the laws on entry and residence in the territory of the host State.\n\n\n\nHowever, if the need or intention to travel frequently or regularly is clearly limited to a shorter stay, the validity of the multiple-entry visa shall be limited to the length of that stay.\"\n\n\n\n\"4.
