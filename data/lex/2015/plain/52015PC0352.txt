It sets standards for transfers of conventional weapons and requires State Parties to review all arms exports to ensure conventional arms and munitions will not be used inter alia in Human Rights abuses, terrorism and violations of humanitarian law. \n\n\nInitiated by UN Resolution 61/89 adopted in 2006, the ATT was adopted on 2 April 2013 by the UN General Assembly. The ATT entered into force on 24 December 2014 following ratification by 50 State Parties. 69 states have ratified the ATT including 26 EU Member States.\n\n\nThe ATT provides, inter alia, for measures (such as import and export controls), which fall within the scope of the Union's Common Commercial Policy. In this domain, the ATT addresses areas of Union law where the degree of regulation has already reached an advanced stage. Moreover, the following EU secondary legislation related to the internal market is also of relevance: a) Directive 2009/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 simplifying terms and conditions of transfers of defence-related products within the Community, b) Council Directive 91/477/EEC of 18 June 1991 on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons, and c) Regulation (EU) No 258/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2012 implementing Article 10 of the United Nations\u2019 Protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UN Firearms Protocol), and establishing export authorisation, and import and transit measures for firearms, their parts and components and ammunition. \n\n\nUnder Article 17(1) and (2) of the ATT, a Conference of States Parties must be convened by the provisional Secretariat within 18 months after entering into force of the ATT and must adopt by consensus its rules of procedure at the first session. This first session of the Conference of State Parties will take place on 24-27 August in Mexico. A final preparatory meeting takes place in Geneva on 6-8 July to present the work of the drafting Committee on the RoP and finalise negotiations in this regard. \n\n\nThe Conference of State Parties is responsible for reviewing the implementation of the ATT, considering amendments to the ATT, and consider issues arising from the interpretation of the ATT. Therefore, the Conference of State Parties will deal with questions partly falling under EU exclusive competence. Moreover, the RoP to be adopted will govern the way the Conference of State Parties will work and make decisions. Thus, the RoP need to considered a decision that will have direct impact on EU exclusive competence and the EU participating as observer in the Conference. In view of the intention of the Member States to vote for the RoP at the Conference of State Parties, the Commission proposes the adoption of a Council Decision within the meaning of Article 218(9) TFEU establishing the position on the RoP to be adopted on behalf of the European Union at the first session of the Conference.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nIn accordance with the rules on external competence as laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the ATT includes matters that fall under exclusive competence of the Union. \n\n\nDecision taken under the ATT, such as the adoption of the RoP of the Conference of State Parties to the ATT may impact on EU exclusive competences. Therefore, the RoP shall not contain any provisions that: \n\n\n(1)may prevent Member States to apply:\n\n\n(a)Council Directive 91/477/EEC of 18 June 1991 on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons, as amended;\n\n\n(b)Council Directive 93/15/EEC of 5 April 1993 on the harmonization of the provisions relating to the placing on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses, as amended;\n\n\n(c)Directive 2009/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 simplifying terms and conditions of transfers of defence-related products within the Community, as amended.\n\n\n(2)may restrict the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital within the Union's internal market, unless the restriction is specifically justified by Articles 36, 45(3), 52(1), 65, or 346 TFEU.\n\n\n(3)may restrict exports or imports from/into the Union, or transit through the territory of the Union shall be compatible with any applicable provisions of Union law, including in particular:\n\n\n\n\n(a)Council Regulation (EC) No 260/2009 of 26 February 2009, on the common rules for imports; \n\n\n(b)Council Regulation (EC) No 1061/2009, of 19 October 2009, establishing common rules for exports;\n\n\n(c)Regulation (EU) No 258/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2012 implementing Article 10 of the United Nations\u2019 Protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UN Firearms Protocol), and establishing export authorisation, and import and transit measures for firearms, their parts and components and ammunition and\n\n\n(d)Directive 2009/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 simplifying terms and conditions of transfers of defence-related products within the Community, as amended.\n\n\nThese various European Union legal acts are part of the acquis and it is therefore essential that they are not put in question by the adoption of the RoP of the Conference of State Parties to the ATT directly or indirectly. This extends to any amendments of the EU legislation in question as well as foreseeable future EU legislation in policy areas affected by the ATT.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis of the proposed Council Decision is Article 218(9) TFEU which provides that \"[the] Council, on proposal of the Commission [\u2026] shall adopt a decision [\u2026] establishing the positions to be adopted on the Union's behalf in a body set up by an agreement, when that body is called upon to adopt acts having legal effects [\u2026]\".\n\n\nAs it is not party to the ATT, the European Union as such cannot adopt the RoP of the Conference of State Parties to the ATT. However, the Conference of States Parties must be regarded as a body set up by an international agreement within the meaning of Article 218(9) TFEU; and the rules of procedure of that Conference must be regarded as an act having legal effects within the meaning of that Article. Therefore Article 218(9) TFEU is of application albeit the fact that the EU is not party to the ATT.\n\n\nGiven that the RoP have legal effect on areas which are within the exclusive competence of the EU, it is necessary that the Union institutions and the Member States take all the measures to cooperate in adopting the RoP of the ATT and to ensure the implementation of the commitments resulting from that Treaty. The Rules of Procedure should in particular allow sufficient time for consultation and discussion among EU Member States and the Union Institutions of draft acts having legal effects to be adopted by the Conference of State Parties.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nSee above\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe proposal is consistent and proportionate within the meaning of Article 218(9).\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nProposal for a Council Decision establishing a position on behalf of the EU\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nNot applicable \n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\n\nNot applicable \n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThe Commission did not seek any external expertise for the preparation of this proposal\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nNot applicable \n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\nProposal has no implications on fundamental rights \n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nNot applicable \n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\nNot applicable \n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nDue to the impossibility of the EU to become party to the Treaty, the article establishes  the EU position on the draft Rules of Procedure of the Conference of State Parties to the ATT to be adopted at the Conference's first session as these constitute an act having legal effects within the meaning of Article 218(9) TFEU. \n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the decision is to authorise the Member States with respect to those matters falling under the exclusive competence of the Union to act on behalf of the European Union within the legal boundaries set by the Treaty, and so the decision is addressed to them.\n\n\n2015/0154 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, with regard to the draft Rules of Procedures at the Conference of State Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 114 and 207(3), in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Arms Trade Treaty (hereinafter referred to as the 'ATT'') entered into force on 24 December 2014. 26 Member States ratified the ATT. The European Union is not State Party to the ATT. \n\n\n(2)Pursuant to Article 17 of the ATT, a conference of State Parties shall be convened by the provisional Secretariat, established under Article 18 thereof, no later than a year following the entering into force of the ATT. The Conference of State Parties shall adopt by consensus its rules of procedures at its first session which will take place on 24-27 August 2015.  \n\n\n(3)Some of the provisions of the ATT concern matters that fall under the exclusive competence of the Union because they are within the scope of the Common Commercial Policy or affect the Internal Market rules for the transfer of conventional arms and explosives. \n\n\n(4)The Conference of State Parties shall review the implementation of the ATT, interpret and implement it, and may consider amendments to it. Its rules of procedure will govern how the Conference of State Parties will work and take decisions. Therefore its Rules of Procedure are to be considered as an act having legal effects within the meaning of Article 218(9) TFEU.\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position of the Union on the Rules of Procedures of the Conference of State Parties to the ATT to be held on 24-27 August 2015 shall be in accordance with the Annex to this Decision and shall be adopted by the Member States which are State Parties to the ATT, acting jointly in the interest of the Union.\n\n\nMinor changes to the position set out in annex of this Decision may be agreed to by the representatives of the Union on the spot without further decision of the Council.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on .\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\n\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 14.7.2015\nCOM(2015) 352 final\nANNEX\nto the\nCouncil Decision\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, with regard to the draft Rules of Procedures at the Conference of State Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX\n\n\nto the\n\n\nCouncil Decision\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, with regard to the draft Rules of Procedures at the Conference of State Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)\n\n\nAs concerns the Rules of Procedure for the Conference of State Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) to be adopted at the Conference\u2019s first session on 24-27 August in Mexico, Member States that are State Party to the ATT acting jointly in the interest of the Union will ensure that these Rules of Procedure do not contain any provisions that may prevent Member States from applying existing and future EU legislation in the area of EU exclusive competence.\n\n\nIn particular, Member States that are State Party to the Arms Trade Treaty shall ensure appropriate participation of the EU at the Conference of State Parties to the ATT and any other body set up in the ATT framework. The Rules of Procedure shall ensure time-limits which allow appropriate consultation among EU Member States and the Union Institutions of drafts of any acts having legal effects prior to their adoption by the Conference of State Parties.\n\n\nAs the ATT is an agreement and adopted under the auspices of the UN the Union's participation in the Conference of the State Parties to the ATT and any other body set up under the ATT framework should be consistent with the extended observer status granted to the EU as concerns participation in UN bodies established by the UN General Assembly by Resolution A/65/276 adopted on 3 May 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
