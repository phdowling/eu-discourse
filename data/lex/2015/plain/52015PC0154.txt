By this instrument preferences can be temporarily suspended in case\r\ntheir application would result in an unexpected and significant increase of\r\nimports causing economic damage to the domestic industry of the importing party\r\n(i.e. it is possible to either suspend the further tariff liberalization or\r\nreintroduce the MFN customs duty rate). Furthermore, this Agreement also\r\nincludes a so-called anti-circumvention mechanism, which provides for the\r\npossibility to reintroduce the MFN customs duty rate when imports of certain\r\nagricultural goods from Moldova exceed a given threshold without due\r\njustification of their exact origin. \nAn implementing regulation of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council is necessary to put in place in the EU\u2019s internal\r\nlegislation the necessary instrument to be able to apply the bilateral\r\nsafeguard clause and the anti-circumvention mechanism.\nThe attached proposal for a Regulation of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council is largely based on comparable\r\nimplementing regulation which were discussed and agreed among the three\r\ninstitutions for each of the recent FTAs currently in force: Korea (regulation\r\npublished in 2011), Central America (regulation published in 2013) and Colombia\r\nand Peru (regulation published in 2013).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThis proposal for an implementing\r\nRegulation is directly derived from the text of the Agreement negotiated with\r\nthe Republic of Moldova. Consequently, neither a separate consultation with\r\ninterested parties nor any impact assessment is necessary.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe attached proposal for a Regulation of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council constitutes the legal instrument for\r\nthe implementation of the safeguard clause and the anti-circumvention mechanism\r\nof the Agreement already concluded with the Republic of Moldova.\nLegal basis\nArticle 207(2) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union.\n2015/0079 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nimplementing the safeguard clause and the\r\nanti-circumvention mechanism providing for the temporary suspension of tariff\r\npreferences of the Association Agreement between the European Union and the\r\nEuropean Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and\r\nthe Republic of Moldova, of the other part.\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission, \nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national parliaments, \nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure[1],\r\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 June 2009 the\r\nCouncil authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Republic of\r\nMoldova for the conclusion of a new agreement between the Union and the\r\nRepublic of Moldova. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those negotiations have\r\nbeen concluded and the Association Agreement between the European Union and the\r\nEuropean Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and\r\nthe Republic of Moldova, of the other part[2]\r\n(\u2018the Agreement\u2019) was signed on 24 June 2014 and has been provisionally applied\r\nfrom 1 September 2014. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to lay\r\ndown the procedures to guarantee the effective application of the safeguard\r\nclause that has been agreed with the Republic of Moldova.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement includes\r\nalso an anti-circumvention mechanism for the temporary suspension of tariff\r\npreferences on specific products. It is also necessary to lay down the\r\nprocedures for the application of this mechanism.\u00a0 \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Safeguard measures may be\r\nconsidered only if the product in question is imported into the Union in such\r\nincreased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to Union production, and\r\nunder such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to\r\nUnion producers of like or directly competing products as laid down in Article\r\n165(1) of the Agreement. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain terms such as\r\n\u2018serious injury\u2019, \u2018threat of serious injury\u2019 and \u2018transitional period\u2019 as\r\nreferred to in Article 169 of the Agreement should be defined. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The tasks of following up\r\nand reviewing the Agreement, carrying out investigations and, if necessary,\r\nimposing safeguard measures should be carried out in the most transparent\r\nmanner possible. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\r\nreceive information including available evidence from the Member States of any\r\ntrends in imports which might call for the application of safeguard measures. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reliability of\r\nstatistics on all imports from the Republic of Moldova to the Union is\r\ntherefore crucial to determining whether the conditions to apply safeguard\r\nmeasures are met. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If there is sufficient prima\r\nfacie evidence to justify the initiation of proceedings, the Commission\r\nshould publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There should be detailed\r\nprovisions on the initiation of investigations, access to and inspections by\r\ninterested parties of the information gathered, hearings for the interested\r\nparties involved and the opportunities for those parties to submit their views.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\r\nnotify the Republic of Moldova in writing of the initiation of an investigation\r\nand consult the Republic of Moldova as provided for in Article 166(1) of the\r\nAgreement. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also necessary to set\r\ntime limits for the initiation of an investigation and for determinations as to\r\nwhether or not safeguard measures are appropriate, with a view to ensuring that\r\nsuch determinations are made quickly, in order to increase legal certainty for\r\nthe economic operators concerned. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An investigation should\r\nprecede the application of any safeguard measure, subject to the Commission\r\nbeing allowed to apply provisional safeguard measures in critical circumstances\r\nas referred to in Article 167 of the Agreement. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Safeguard measures should\r\nbe applied only to the extent, and for such time, as may be necessary to\r\nprevent serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. The maximum duration of\r\nsafeguard measures should be determined and specific provisions regarding\r\nextension and review of such measures should be laid down. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There should be a\r\npossibility to suspend the preferential customs duties for a maximum period of\r\nsix months when the imports of certain agricultural products and processed\r\nagricultural products reach the annual import volumes defined in the Annexes\r\n(XV-C) to the Association Agreement.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For reasons of\r\ntransparency, the Commission should submit an annual report to the European\r\nParliament and to the Council on the implementation of the Agreement and the\r\napplication of the safeguard measures and the anti-circumvention mechanism. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the adoption of provisional and definitive safeguard measures,\r\nfor the imposition of prior surveillance measures and for the termination of an\r\ninvestigation without measures provided for in the Agreement, implementing\r\npowers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised\r\nin accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council[3].\r\n\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The advisory procedure\r\nshould be used for the adoption of surveillance and provisional safeguard\r\nmeasures given the effects of those measures and their sequential logic in\r\nrelation to the adoption of definitive safeguard measures. The advisory\r\nprocedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts given that those\r\nacts have to be implemented quickly once the relevant threshold has been met\r\nand have only a very limited period of application. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The examination procedure\r\nshould be used for the adoption of definitive safeguard measures and for the\r\nreviews of such measures. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should adopt\r\nimmediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases a delay\r\nin the imposition of provisional safeguard measures would cause damage which\r\nwould be difficult to repair or in order to prevent a negative impact on the\r\nUnion market as a result of an increase in imports. Where such immediately\r\napplicable implementing acts are applied, the advisory procedure should be\r\nused,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: \nCHAPTER I -\r\nSAFEGUARD PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation lays down\r\nprovisions for implementing the safeguard clause and the anti-circumvention\r\nmechanism providing for the temporary suspension of tariff preferences\r\ncontained in the Association Agreement between the European Union and the\r\nEuropean Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and\r\nthe Republic of Moldova, of the other part. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation applies to\r\nproducts originating in the Republic of Moldova.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n(a)                   \r\n\u2018product\u2019 means a good originating in the Union\r\nor in the Republic of Moldova;
