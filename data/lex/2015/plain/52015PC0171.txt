A reference to Regulation (EU) No 377/2014 establishing the Copernicus Programme was therefore included in Article 1(8d) of Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement. The modalities of the cooperation foreseen between the EEA Contracting Parties in that regard were also provided under the relevant provision of Protocol 31 EEA.\n\n\nPursuant to point (e) of Article 1(8d) of Protocol 31, Norway and Liechtenstein are exempted from participation in the Copernicus Programme. Norway has however now lifted the impediments to its participation. Therefore, the relevant provisions setting out the participation of the EFTA States to the Programme shall also apply to Norway and the reference to Norway in point (e) is deleted.\n\n\nIt should be noted that Norway requested to commence its participation in the Copernicus Programme retrospectively from 1 January 2014. The financial contribution to Copernicus relating to the financial year 2014 will be added to the contribution relating to the financial year 2015 and included in the call for funds 2015. In this context, the Norwegian parliament already tentatively approved the relevant funds. \n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nArticle 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 concerning arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement provides that the Council establishes the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf on such Decisions, on a proposal from the Commission. \n\n\nThe Commission submits the Draft Decision of the EEA Joint Committee for adoption by the Council as the Union\u2019s position. The Commission would hope to be able to present it in the EEA Joint Committee at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\n2015/0088 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union,\nin the EEA Joint Committee concerning an amendment to Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement, on cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms\n(Copernicus)\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 189(2) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 of 28 November 1994 concerning arrangements for implementing the Agreement on the European Economic Area\n2\n, and in particular Article 1(3) thereof,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Agreement on the European Economic Area\n3\n ('the EEA Agreement') entered into force on 1 January 1994.\n\n\n(2)Pursuant to Article 98 of the EEA Agreement, the EEA Joint Committee may decide to amend, inter alia, Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement.\n\n\n(3)Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement contains provisions and arrangements concerning cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms.\n\n\n(4)The cooperation of the Contracting Parties to the EEA Agreement was extended to include Regulation (EU) No 377/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 establishing the Copernicus Programme and repealing Regulation (EU) No 911/2010\n4\n by Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No 249/2014 of 13 November 2014\n5\n.\n\n\n(5)This cooperation should be extended to Norway, under the conditions provided for in Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement, whose participation should therefore commence from 1 January 2014.\n\n\n(6)Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement should therefore be amended in order to allow for this extended cooperation to take place from 1 January 2014.\n\n\n(7)The position of the Union within the EEA Joint Committee should therefore be based on the attached draft Decision,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, within the EEA Joint Committee on the proposed amendment to Protocol 31 to the EEA\u00a0Agreement, on cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms, shall be based on the draft Decision of the EEA\u00a0Joint Committee attached to this\u00a0Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n[not yet published]\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ L 305, 30.11.1994, p. 6.\n\n\n\n(3)\nOJ L 1, 3.1.1994, p. 3. \n\n\n\n(4)\nOJ L 122, 22.4.2014, p. 44.\n\n\n\n(5)\nOJ L [not yet published]\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
