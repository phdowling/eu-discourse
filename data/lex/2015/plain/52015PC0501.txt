The Services Waiver\n1\n allows WTO Members to grant unilateral preferences on services to the LDCs and it requires acceptance by the Council for Trade in Services (CTS) of the notified preferences granted with respect to measures other than those described in Article XVI of the GATS (market access). \n\n\nOn 23 July 2015 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Decision\n2\n establishing the position of the Union within the Council for Trade in Services of the WTO on the acceptance of preferences notified by other WTO Members as regards services and service suppliers of Least-Developed Countries other than those described in Article XVI of the GATS (market acceess). \n\n\nThe proposed Council Decision establishes the position of the European Union in the CTS to be in a position to seek approval with regard to the preferential treatment going beyond market access the European Union intends to grant unilaterally to services and services suppliers of LDCs.\u00a0\n\n\nThe intended treatment to be accorded to LDCs was prepared on the basis of an approach expressed to WTO Members at a high-level meeting of the CTS on 5 February 2015 and a signal of intention to notify transmitted to the WTO on 30 July 2015.\n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area and other Union policies\n\n\nAt the Ninth WTO Ministerial Conference in Bali, which took place on 3-6 December 2013, the European Union joined the consensus on the adoption of a Decision on the operationalization of a Services Waiver for LDCs\n3\n. The EU is committed to the success of the upcoming Tenth Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Nairobi in December 2015 and to moving decisively forward the Doha Development Round negotiations and the implementation of the Bali outcome package, including the LDC elements. The proposed Council Decision is part of this Bali implementation process.\u00a0\n\n\nSupporting the economic advancement of LDCs, through the preferences to be granted under the Waiver will contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Treaty stating that the EU shall contribute to the harmonious development of world trade, define and pursue common policies to foster the sustainable development of developing countries\n4\n. This proposed notification will also be conducive to conclude a part of the Doha Development Agenda negotiations on services.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\uf0b7Legal basis\n\n\n\nThe legal bases for the proposed Council Decision are Articles 91, 100 and the first subparagraph of Article 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU). \n\n\n\nArticle 218(9) of the TFEU provides that when an act having legal effects needs to be adopted in a body set up by an international agreement, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission or the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, shall adopt a decision establishing the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf with respect to the adoption of this act in this body. While the notification of preferences that the Union intends to grant to LDCs does not have legal effects, it would include commitments going beyond market access which require approval in the CTS, for which this Article 218(9) Decision is appropriate. The envisaged preferences relate to obligations under the General Agreement on Trade in Services and may concern all service sectors, including transport services. Therefore, the proposed Decision falls within the scope of Articles 91, 100 and 207(4), first subparagraph, of the TFEU. \n\n\n3.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe proposal has no budgetary implications.\n\n\n\n2015/0240 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\n\n\nestablishing the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the Council for Trade in Services of the World Trade Organization to seek approval for preferential treatment going beyond market access to be unilaterally offered by the European Union to services and services suppliers of Least-Developed Countries on the basis of the LDC Services Waiver\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular of Articles 91, 100 and the first subparagraph of Article 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof, \n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission, \n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Article IX of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) sets out the procedures for the granting of waivers concerning the Multilateral Trade Agreements in Annex 1A, 1B or 1C to that Agreements and their annexes.\n\n\n(2)A waiver was requested whereby the WTO Members would be enabled to grant preferential treatment to services and service suppliers of Least-Developed Country Members without according the same treatment to like services and service suppliers of all other WTO Members by exceptionally derogating from the obligation under paragraph 1 of Article II of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The Council adopted the position of the Union in support of the waiver by Council Decision of 14 December 2011 (2012/8/EU).\n\n\n(3)The WTO Ministerial Decision of 17 December 2011 authorising WTO Members to grant such preferential treatment to services and service suppliers of Least-Developed Country Members for a period of 15 years, sets forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 (i) that Members according preferential treatment pursuant to this waiver shall submit a notification to the Council for Trade in Services (CTS) and (ii) that preferential treatment with respect to the application of measures other than those described in Article XVI of the GATS is subject to approval by the CTS in accordance with its procedures. The requirement of CTS approval with regard to those measures was restated in paragraph 1.3 of the WTO Ministerial Decision of 7 December 2013. \n\n\n(4)By Council Decision of [] 2015 [] the position of the Union to accept preferences going beyond Article XVI GATS granted by other WTO Members to the services and service suppliers of Least-Developed Country Members was established.\n\n\n(5)In addition to the acceptance of preferences granted by other WTO Members, it is in the interest of the development objectives of the European Union and is conducive to conclude a part of the Doha Development Agenda negotiations on services that the European Union seeks approval for the preferential treatment beyond market access that it intends to grant to the services and service suppliers of Least-Developed Country Members, with a special consideration of preferences granted regarding temporary stay of natural persons for the provision of services to create incentives for fulfilling readmission obligations under international law, implementing existing readmission agreements and concluding new ones, provided Least-Developed Country Members cooperate with the European Union on migration management,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Union will seek approval within the Council for Trade in Services of the WTO with regard to the preferential treatment that the Union intends to grant to services and service suppliers of Least-Developed Countries and specifically with regard to those preferences going beyond market access as set out in the Addendum to this Decision and in accordance with the WTO Ministerial Decisions of 17 December 2011 (WT/L/847)\u00a0and 7\u00a0December 2013 (WT/L/918). \n\n\nThis position shall be expressed by the European Commission.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nWaivers are permissions granted by the WTO General Council/Ministerial Conference to derogate temporarily from certain WTO obligations which are otherwise applicable.\n\n\n\n(2)\nCOM (2015)356.\n\n\n\n(3)\nWT/L/918.\n\n\n\n(4)\nArticle 205 and 206 of the TFEU and Article 21 of the TEU.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 14.10.2015\nCOM(2015) 501 final\nANNEX\nto the\nProposal for a Council Decision\nestablishing the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the Council for Trade in Services of the World Trade Organization to seek approval for preferential treatment going beyond market access to be unilaterally offered by the European Union to services and services suppliers of Least-Developed Countries on the basis of the LDC Services Waiver\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION's NOTIFICATION OF PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT IT INTENDS TO GRANT TO SERVICES AND SERVICES SUPPLIERS OF LEAST-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES\n\n\nNotification to the Council for Trade in Services\n\n\nThe Permanent Mission of the European Union to the World Trade Organization in Geneva has the honour to notify to the World Trade Organization Council for Trade in Services the preferential treatment which the European Union intends to make available to services and services suppliers of Least-Developed Countries in accordance with the decision by Ministers at the WTO\u2019s Eighth Ministerial Conference on Preferential\u00a0Treatment to Services and Service Suppliers of Least-Developed Countries (WT/L/847), and the decision by Ministers at the WTO\u2019s Ninth Ministerial Conference on Operationalization of the Waiver Concerning Preferential Treatment to Services and Services Suppliers of Least-Developed Countries (WT/L/918).\n\n\nThe preferential treatment is intended to be made in sectors and modes of supply that are of particular export interest to Least-Developed Countries, as set out in The Collective Request Pursuant to the Bali Decision on the Operationalization of the LDC Services Waiver Concerning Preferential Treatment to Services and Service Suppliers of Least Developed Countries (S/C/W/356). The European Union intends to maintain these preferences for the period of the Waiver, unless notification a contrario.\n\n\nEuropean Union\n\n\nSchedule - Trade in Services\n\n\n\n\nHeadnotes\n\n\n\n1.1 The EU maintains that the right to submit to a review (e.g. an authorisation and/or notification procedure) the direct or indirect acquisition and/or control of a company or firm or the establishment of a new company or firm on national security grounds, under existing or future legislation, will be preserved and does not require specific reservations in the offer. \n\n\n1.2 For greater certainty, for the EU, the obligation to grant national treatment does not entail the requirement to extend to nationals or juridical persons of LDC Members the treatment granted in a Member State to the nationals and juridical persons of another Member State pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or to any measure adopted pursuant to that Treaty, including their implementation in the Member States. Such national treatment is granted only to legal persons of the LDC Members established in accordance with the law of another Member State and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business in that Member State, including those legal persons established within the EU which are owned or controlled by nationals of the LDC Member. \n\n\n1.3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The EU further reserves the right to make technical changes to this Schedule and to correct any errors, omissions or inaccuracies. This Schedule does not contain commitments on audio-visual services\n\n\n1.4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in this Schedule shall be construed to require the privatisation of public undertakings or to impose any obligation with respect to government procurement. \n\n\n1.5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The EU reserves the right to maintain or introduce any measures with respect to subsidies. \n\n\n1.6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistent with the provisions of this Schedule, the EU retains the right to regulate and to introduce new regulations to meet legitimate policy objectives.\n\n\n1.7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The EU is examining the interface between its regulatory framework on audit services and the EU's present and future international obligations. This process may lead to further modifications or clarification of this Schedule.\n\n\n1.8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding its obligation on market access, the EU may require that in the case of incorporation under its own law including the respective law of the individual Member States of the European Union, investors and service suppliers must adopt a specific legal form. To the extent that such requirement is applied in a non-discriminatory manner, it does not need to be specified in this Schedule in order to be maintained or adopted by the EU or its respective Member State.\n\n\n\n\n1.9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in this Schedule shall be construed to require the EU to compensate for inherent competitive disadvantages which result from the foreign character of the relevant services or services suppliers.\n\n\n1.10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Schedule shall not apply to measures affecting natural persons seeking access to the employment market of the EU, nor shall it apply to measures regarding citizenship, residence or employment on a permanent basis. Nothing in this Schedule shall prevent the EU from applying measures to regulate the entry of natural persons into, or their temporary stay in, its territory, including those measures necessary to protect the integrity of, and to ensure the orderly movement of natural persons across, its borders, provided that such measures are not applied in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to LDC Members under the terms of a specific commitment.\n\n\n1.11. This Schedule does not cover services relating to the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\n\n\n\n2. Lists of commitments \n\n\n2.1 The sectors liberalised by the EU pursuant to the Annexes and, by means of reservations, the market access and national treatment limitations applicable to services and service suppliers of LDC Members in those sectors, are set out in lists of commitments included in the Annexes    \n\n\na.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0List of commitments relating to commercial presence (Annex A) \n\n\nb.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0List of commitments relating to cross-border supply of services (Annex B)\n\n\nc.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0List of reservations relating to business visitors for establishment purposes, intra-corporate transferees and service sellers (Annex C) \n\n\nd.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0List of reservations relating to contractual services suppliers and independent professionals (Annex D) \n\n\n\n3.

Exclusive rights on such services are often granted to private operators, for instance operators with concessions from public authorities, subject to specific service obligations.

Legal services in respect of EC law shall in principle be carried out by or through a fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in the EC acting personally, and legal services in respect of the law of a Member State of the European Union shall in principle be carried out by or through a fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in that Member State acting personally. Full admission to the Bar in the relevant Member State of the European Union might therefore be necessary for representation before courts and other competent authorities in the EC since it involves practice of EC and national procedural law. However, in some Member States, foreign lawyers not fully admitted to the Bar are allowed to represent in civil proceedings a party being a national or belonging to the State in which the lawyer is entitled to practice.\n\n\n\n(10)\nDoes not include legal advisory and legal representational services on tax matters, which are to be found under 1.A.a).
