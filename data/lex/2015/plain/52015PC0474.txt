At the end of those negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled by the negotiators on 10\u00a0July 2015. It covers a period of four years from the date of provisional application laid down in Article\u00a014 \u2013 i.e. from the date of its signature.\n\n\nThe main aim of the Protocol is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in Mauritanian waters taking into account available scientific assessments, in particular those of the Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF), and in accordance with scientific advice and the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), within the limits of the available surplus. The Commission based its position in part on the results of a forward-looking assessment, carried out by external experts, of whether a new Protocol should be concluded. \n\n\nThe objective is to also enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the fishing zone of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, in the interests of both parties.\n\n\nThe Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories:\n\n\n\u2013Category\u00a01 \u2013 Vessels fishing for crustaceans other than spiny lobster and crab: 5\u00a0000 tonnes and 25 vessels;\n\n\n\u2013Category 2 - Black hake (non-freezer) trawlers and bottom longliners: 6\u00a0000 tonnes and 6 vessels;\n\n\n\u2013Category 3 - Vessels fishing for demersal species other than black hake with gear other than trawls: 3\u00a0000 tonnes and 6 vessels;\n\n\n\u2013Category 4 - Tuna seiners: 12\u00a0500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 25 vessels;\n\n\n\u2013Category\u00a05 - Pole-and-line tuna vessels and longliners: 7\u00a0500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 15 vessels;\n\n\n\u2013Category\u00a06 - Pelagic freezer trawlers: 247\u00a0500 and 19 vessels;\n\n\n\u2013Category\u00a07 - Non-freezer pelagic vessels: 15\u00a0000 tonnes (deducted from volume under category 6 if used) and 2 vessels. \n\n\nThe method for allocating fishing opportunities among the Member States should be defined. The Commission proposes, on this basis, that the Council adopt the attached proposal for a Regulation.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe interested parties were consulted during the evaluation of the Protocol for the period 2012-14. Experts from the Member States were also consulted in technical meetings. These consultations led to the conclusion that it would be beneficial to renew the Fisheries Agreement and agree on a Fisheries Protocol with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThis procedure is being initiated in parallel with the procedures relating to the Council Decision on the provisional application of the Protocol.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n\nThe annual financial contribution has been set at EUR\u00a059\u00a0125\u00a0000 per year, on the basis of:\n\n\na) a total allowable catch of 261\u00a0500 tonnes for fishing categories 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 and a reference tonnage of 20\u00a0000 tonnes for fishing categories 4 and 5 of the Protocol, corresponding to an amount linked to access to EUR\u00a055\u00a0000\u00a0000 per year, and \n\n\nb) support for the development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania amounting to EUR\u00a04\u00a0125\u00a0000 per year. This support meets the aims of national fishing policy and in particular the needs of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania as regards supporting scientific and technical cooperation, training, fisheries monitoring, protecting the environment and development infrastructure.\n\n\n2015/0228 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\n\n\non the allocation of the fishing opportunities under the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for a period of four years\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)On 30\u00a0November 2006, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1801/2006 on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania (\u2018the Partnership Agreement\u2019)\n1\n.\n\n\n(2)On 10\u00a0July 2015, the Union and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania initialled a new Protocol to the partnership agreement (hereinafter \u2018the Protocol\u2019).
