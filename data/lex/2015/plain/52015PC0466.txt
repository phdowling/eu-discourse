"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 30.9.2015\nCOM(2015) 466 final\n2015/0223(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia and the Implementation Protocol thereto\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nOn the basis of the relevant negotiating directives\n1\n, the Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of Liberia with a view to concluding a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and an Implementation Protocol thereto between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia. Following these negotiations, a new Agreement and Protocol were initialled on 5 June 2015. They cover a period of five years from the date of their provisional application, i.e. from the date of their signature, as laid down in Article 15 of the Agreement and Article 12 of the Protocol.\n\n\nThe new Agreement will provide for a framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to establishing a strategic partnership between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia.\n\n\nThe main objective of the new Protocol is to provide fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the Liberian fishing zone, on the basis of the best available scientific advice and respecting the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), where applicable within the limits of the available surplus. The Commission based its position in part on the results of a forward-looking assessment, carried out by external experts, of whether a new Agreement and Protocol should be concluded. The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in Liberia\u2019s fishing zone, in the interests of both parties. \n\n\nThe Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories:\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a028 tuna seiners;\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06 surface long-liners.\n\n\nThe Commission accordingly proposes that the Council authorise the signing and provisional application of the new Agreement and the Implementation Protocol thereto.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe interested parties were consulted during the ex-ante evaluation on a possible Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and Protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia. Experts from the Member States and industry were also consulted in technical meetings. Furthermore, the Liberian fisheries authorities and stakeholders were consulted during a technical meeting. These consultations led to the conclusion that it would be beneficial for the EU and the Republic of Liberia to conclude a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and Protocol.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThis procedure is being carried out in parallel with the procedures relating to the Council Decision on the conclusion, with the consent of the European Parliament, of the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia and of the Implementation Protocol thereto, and to the Council Regulation on the allocation of fishing opportunities between the EU Member States.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe annual financial contribution is EUR\u00a0715\u00a0000 for the first year, EUR\u00a0650\u00a0000 for the second, third and fourth years, and EUR\u00a0585\u00a0000 for the fifth year, on the basis of:\n\n\n(a) a reference tonnage of 6\u00a0500 tonnes, for which an amount linked to access has been set at EUR\u00a0357\u00a0500 for the first year, EUR\u00a0325\u00a0000 for the second, third and fourth years, and EUR\u00a0292\u00a0500 for the fifth year; and\n\n\n(b) support for development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Republic of Liberia, amounting to EUR\u00a0357\u00a0500 for the first year, EUR\u00a0325\u00a0000 for the second, third and fourth years, and EUR\u00a0292\u00a0500 for the fifth year. This support meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the Republic of Liberia's needs in relation to scientific research, artisanal fisheries as well as fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance and the fight against illegal fishing.\n\n\n2015/0223 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and

action\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1.4.Objective(s)\n\n\n1.4.1.The Commission's multiannual strategic objective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative \n\n\n\nThe negotiation and conclusion of Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) with third countries meets the general objective of giving EU fishing vessels access to the fishing zones of third countries and developing a partnership with those countries with a view to strengthening the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources outside EU waters.\n\n\nSFPAs also ensure consistency between the principles governing the Common Fisheries Policy and the commitments made under other European policies (sustainable use of third-country resources, combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, integration of partner countries into the global economy and better political and financial governance of fisheries).\n\n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\n\n\nSpecific objective: \n\n\nTo contribute to sustainable fishing in non-EU waters, maintain a European presence in distant-water fisheries and protect the interests of the European fisheries sector and consumers by negotiating and concluding SFPAs with coastal states, consistent with other European policies.\n\n\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\n\n\nMaritime affairs and fisheries, to establish a governance framework for fishing activities carried out by European Union fishing vessels in third country waters (SFAs) (budget line 11.0301).\n\n\n\n1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion of the Agreement enables the establishment of a strategic fisheries partnership between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia. The conclusion of the Protocol will create fishing opportunities for Union vessels in the Liberian fishing zone.\n\n\nThe Protocol will also contribute to better management and conservation of fishery resources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular as regards monitoring and combating illegal fishing.\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nRates of utilisation of fishing opportunities (annual uptake of fishing authorisations as a percentage of availability under the Protocol);\n\n\nGathering and analysing data on catches and the commercial value of the Agreement;\n\n\nContribution to employment and to added value in the EU and to stabilising the EU market (in aggregate with other SFPAs);\n\n\nNumber of technical meetings and meetings of the Joint Committee.\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nThere has never been an SFPA or Protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia. A forward looking assessment, carried out by external experts, concluded that a new SFPA and Protocol between the EU and the Republic of Liberia would be beneficial for both parties.\n\n\nIt is intended that the new Agreement and Protocol will apply provisionally from the date of their signature in order not to delay the start of fishing operations.\n\n\nThe new Protocol will provide a framework for the fishing activities of the European fleet in the Liberian fishing zone and will authorise European vessel owners to apply for fishing licences allowing them to fish in that zone. In addition, the new Protocol enhances cooperation between the EU and the Republic of Liberia, with a view to promoting the development of a sustainable fishing policy. It provides, in particular, for vessels to be monitored via VMS and for the electronic transmission of catch data. The sectoral support available under the Protocol will help the Republic of Liberia with its national fisheries strategy, including the fight against IUU fishing.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nAs regards this new Agreement and Protocol, failure to act by the EU would allow the emergence of private agreements which would not guarantee sustainable fisheries. The European Union also hopes that with this Protocol, the Republic of Liberia will continue to cooperate effectively with the EU particularly as regards the fight against illegal fishing.\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nAn analysis of past catches in the Liberian fishing zone and of recent catches within the framework of similar protocols in the region, as well as the assessments and scientific advice available, led the parties to set a reference tonnage for tuna and tuna-like species of 6 500 tonnes a year with fishing opportunities for 28 purse seiners and 6 surface long-liners. Sectoral support has been set at a relatively high level in order to take into account requirements in terms of building the capacity of the Liberian fisheries authorities and the priorities of the national fisheries strategy.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nFunds paid out under SFPAs constitute fungible revenue in the budgets of the third-country partners. However, allocating some of those funds for implementing measures as part of the country\u2019s sectoral policy is a condition for the conclusion and monitoring of SFPAs. These financial resources are compatible with other sources of funding from other providers of international funding for carrying out projects and/or programmes at national level in the fisheries sector.\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\nX\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013X\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from 2015 to 2020\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from 2015 to 2019\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\nX\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013X by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe Commission (DG MARE, in collaboration with its fisheries counsellor based in the region) will ensure regular monitoring of the implementation of the Protocol, particularly as regards the use by operators of fishing opportunities and catch data. \n\n\nThe SFPA Agreement provides for at least one annual meeting of the Joint Committee, at which the Commission and the Republic of Liberia review the implementation of the Agreement and Protocol and, if necessary, adjust the programming and, if applicable, the financial contribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified \n\n\n\nThere is some risk in setting up a new fisheries Agreement and Protocol, particularly with regard to the amounts intended to finance the sectoral fisheries policy (under-programming).\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nExtensive dialogue is planned on the programming and implementation of the sectoral policy laid down in the Agreement and the Protocol. Joint analysis of results, as referred to in Article 4 of the Protocol, also forms part of these control methods.\n\n\nIn addition, the Agreement and the Protocol contain specific clauses for their suspension, on certain conditions and in given circumstances.\n\n\n\n2.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\nThe Commission undertakes to establish political dialogue and regular coordination with the Republic of Liberia with a view to improving the management of the Agreement and the Protocol and strengthening the EU\u2019s contribution to the sustainable management of resources. In any case, any payment which the Commission makes under an SFPA is subject to the Commission's standard rules and budgetary and financial procedures. This makes it possible, in particular, to fully identify the bank accounts of the third countries into which the financial contribution is paid. For this particular Protocol, Article 3(8) stipulates that the entire financial contribution must be paid into an account of the Public Treasury account opened with the Central Bank of Liberia.\n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\n\n\uf0b7Existing budget

However, the total annual amount paid by the Union shall not be more than twice the figure indicated in Article 3(2)(a).\n\n\n2.The Joint Committee may also, as necessary, examine and decide to adopt by mutual agreement technical provisions of this Protocol and the Annex thereto.\n\n\nArticle 7 - Experimental fisheries and new fishing opportunities\n\n\n1.At the request of one of the Parties, the Joint Committee may consider the possibility of experimental fishing campaigns in the Liberian fishing zone with a view to test the technical feasibility and economic viability of new fisheries not provided for in Article 1 of this Protocol. To this end, the Joint Committee shall determine on a case by case basis the species, the conditions and any other relevant parameters. \n\n\n2.Taking into account best available scientific advice and on the basis of the results of the experimental campaigns, if the Union becomes interested in new fishing opportunities, the Joint Committee shall convene to discuss and prescribe the conditions applicable to such new fishing activities. \n\n\n3.Following authorisation by Liberia for these new fishing activities, the Joint Committee shall make corresponding amendments to this Protocol and the Annex thereto.\n\n\nArticle 8 \u2013 Suspension\n\n\n1.The implementation of this Protocol, including payment of the financial contribution as referred to in Article 3(2)(a) and (b), may be suspended at the initiative of either one of the Parties in the cases and under the conditions referred to in Article 13 of the Agreement.\n\n\n2.Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 4 of this Protocol, payment of the financial contributions shall resume as soon as the situation existing prior to the events mentioned in Article 13 of the Agreement has been re-established.\n\n\nArticle 9 - Termination\n\n\nThis Protocol may be terminated at the initiative of either one of the Parties in the cases and under the conditions referred to in Article 14 of the Agreement. \n\n\nArticle 10 - Electronic exchanges of data\n\n\n1.Liberia and the Union undertake to implement the necessary systems for the electronic exchange of all information and documents related to the implementation of the Agreement and this Protocol. \n\n\n2.The electronic form of a document at any point shall be considered equivalent to the paper version.\n\n\n3.Both Parties will immediately notify the other Party of any disruption of a computer system impeding such exchanges. In these circumstances, the information and documents related to the implementation of the Agreement and this Protocol shall be replaced automatically by their paper version in the manner defined in the Annex.\n\n\nArticle 11 \u2013 Confidentiality\n\n\n1.Liberia and the Union undertake to ensure that all commercially sensitive data related to the Union vessels and their fishing activities obtained in the framework of the Agreement and this Protocol shall be treated at all times in conformity with their respective confidentiality and data protection principles.\n\n\n2.Both Parties shall ensure that only aggregated data for fishing activities of the EU fleet in the Liberian fishing zone shall be made public, in conformity with the corresponding provisions of the ICCAT and other regional fisheries management organisations. Data which may be considered as otherwise confidential shall be used exclusively for the implementation of the Agreement and for the purposes of fisheries management, monitoring, control and surveillance.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 12 - Provisional application\n\n\nSignature of this Protocol by the Parties entails its provisional application prior to its entry into force.\n\n\nArticle 13 - Entry into force\n\n\nThis Protocol shall enter into force when the Parties have notified each other of the completion of the necessary procedures.\n\n\nANNEX\n\n\nCONDITIONS GOVERNING FISHING ACTIVITIES BY UNION VESSELS IN THE LIBERIAN FISHING ZONE\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n\nDesignation of competent authority\n\n\n1.For the purposes of this Annex and unless otherwise specified, any reference to the European Union (the \"Union\") or to Liberia as a competent authority shall mean:\n\n\n\u2013 for the Union: the European Commission, where applicable via the Delegation of the European Union to Liberia (EU Delegation);\n\n\n\u2013 for Liberia: the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).\n\n\nLiberian fishing zone\n\n\n2.The geographic coordinates of the Liberian fishing zone as defined in Article 1(g) of the Agreement and the baselines are described in Appendix 5 to this Annex. \n\n\n3.Zones closed to fishing, in line with the national legislation in force, such as national parks, marine protected areas and fish breeding grounds, as well as areas closed to shipping are described in Appendix 5 to this Annex. \n\n\n4.Liberia shall notify the vessel-owners of the coordinates of these zones when the fishing authorisation is issued. \n\n\n5.Liberia shall notify the Union, at least two (2) months before enforcement, of any changes to the zones closed to shipping and fishing.\n\n\nPayments by vessel owners\n\n\n6.Before provisional application of the Protocol, Liberia shall notify the Union of the details of the Government bank account(s) into which the financial sums payable by Union vessels under the Agreement must be paid. The associated bank transfer costs shall be borne by the vessel owners.\n\n\nContacts\n\n\n\n\n7.The contact details of the Liberian authorities are included in Appendix 7 to this Annex.\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nFISHING AUTHORISATIONS\n\n\nSECTION 1\n\n\nAPPLICATION AND ISSUING OF FISHING AUTHORISATIONS\n\n\nConditions for obtaining a fishing authorisation\n\n\n1.Only eligible vessels may obtain an authorisation to fish in the Liberian fishing zone. \n\n\n2.For a vessel to be eligible, neither the owner, the master nor the vessel itself must be prohibited from fishing in Liberia. They must be in order vis-\u00e0-vis the Liberian authorities insofar as they must have fulfilled all prior obligations arising from their fishing activities in Liberia under fisheries agreements concluded with the Union. Vessels must also be included in the EU register of fishing vessels, in the ICCAT record of vessels, and not on the IUU listing of ICCAT or any other Regional Fisheries Management Organisations.\n\n\nApplication for a fishing authorisation\n\n\n3.The Union shall submit, by electronic means, to Liberia, with a copy to the EU Delegation to Liberia, an application for any vessel wishing to fish under the Agreement at least fifteen (15) calendar days before the date of commencement of the period of validity requested. The originals are to be sent directly by the Union to Liberia with a copy to the EU Delegation to Liberia.\n\n\n4.Applications shall be submitted on a form drawn up in accordance with the specimen in Appendix 1 to this Annex and shall be accompanied by the following documents:\n\n\n(i)proof of payment of the advance fee for the period of validity of the requested fishing authorisation, which is non-refundable;\n\n\n(ii)For each initial application under the Protocol, or following a technical change of the vessel concerned, a recent (12 months or less) digital colour photograph of the vessel of adequate resolution (at least 15x10 cm in size), showing a detailed lateral view of the vessel including the vessel's name and identification number visible on the hull;\n\n\n(iii)seaworthiness certificate of the vessel;\n\n\n(iv)Vessel registration certificate;\n\n\n(v)Certificate of tonnage;\n\n\n(vi)Certificate of insurance;\n\n\n(vii)An illustration and detailed description of the fishing gears used.\n\n\n5.The information provided in the application form referred to in point 4 will be used by the competent Liberian authorities to process and issue the Liberia Maritime Authority certificate of number within the period referred to in point 3 above. The Liberia Maritime Authority certificate of number should be issued before the issuing of the fishing authorisation by the Liberian competent authorities. \n\n\n6.As part of their first application for a fishing authorisation under this Protocol, all Union vessels shall undergo a pre-authorisation inspection. The issuing of the first fishing authorisation shall be conditional on the succesful completion of this inspection, which shall be carried out in designated ports in the sub-region agreed between the Union and Liberia, subject to authorisation by the Port State concerned. Any inspections taking place outside of the Port of Monrovia shall be done with all associated costs to be borne by the vessel-owner. \n\n\n\n\n7.For the renewal of a fishing authorisation under the Protocol in force for a vessel whose technical specifications have not been modified, the renewal application shall be accompanied only by proof of payment of the fees which are non-refundable. In the event where the technical specifications have been modified, the application shall be re-submited with all relevant documents as specified in point 4 and the issuing of the fishing authorisation shall be subject to the succesful completion of a new pre-authorisation inspection. \n\n\n8.In the event that Liberia has not obtained authorisation from the Port State concerned to carry out the inspection, the vessel-owner shall be automatically absolved of the obligation to undergo the pre-authorisation inspections referred to in points 6 and 7.\n\n\nIssuing of the fishing authorisation\n\n\n9.Liberia shall issue the fishing authorisations to vessel owners or inform the Union of its refusal within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of all the documents referred to in point 4 above. The original of the fishing authorisation shall be sent to the vessel owners or their agents via the Union. If the Union offices are closed, Liberia may send the fishing authorisation directly to the vessel owner or his agent with a copy to the Union.\n\n\n10.At the same time, in order not to delay the possibility of fishing, a copy of the fishing authorisation shall be transmitted electronically to the Union, for forwarding to the vessel owner, and to the EU Delegation to Liberia for information. This copy may be used for a maximum period of sixty (60) calendar days after the issuing date of the fishing authorisation. During this period, the copy shall be considered equivalent to the original.\n\n\n11.The original of the fishing authorisation shall be held on board at all times, without prejudice to the provisions of point 10 above. \n\n\nList of vessels authorised to fish \n\n\n12.After the fishing authorisation is issued, Liberia shall include immediately the Union vessel in the list of vessels which are authorised to fish in the Liberian fishing zone. This list shall be sent immediately to the Monitoring Control and Surveillance Unit (MCSU), the National Fisheries Monitoring Center (NFMC) and Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) of Liberia and to the Union. Liberia shall update regularly the list of vessels authorised to fish. The new list shall be sent without delay to the MCSU, NFMC and MOA of Liberia, and to the Union.\n\n\n13.In the event the fishing authorisation is not issued within the timeframe specified in point 9 above, the vessel shall be included in the list on a provisional basis, unless there is clear evidence that it does not comply with the requirements of point 2 above. During this time, the vessel shall be authorised to fish. \n\n\nTransfer of fishing authorisation\n\n\n14.Fishing authorisations shall be issued for a specific vessel and shall not be transferable.\n\n\n15.However, at the request of the Union and where force majeure is proven, in particular in the event of the loss or prolonged immobilisation of a vessel due to a serious technical failure, a fishing authorisation shall be replaced by a new authorisation for another vessel of the same fishing category as the vessel being replaced, subject to the submission of a new fishing authorisation application as required under point 4 above and the succesful completion of a pre-authorisation inspection as required under point 6 above but with no further fee due. In this case, the calculation of the catch levels to determine whether an additional payment should be made shall take account of the sum of the total catches of the two vessels. \n\n\n16.The vessel owner or his agent shall return the cancelled fishing authorisation to Liberia via the EU Delegation to Liberia. The new fishing authorisation shall take effect on the day on which the cancelled authorisation is returned. The EU Delegation to Liberia shall be informed of the transfer of the fishing authorisation.\n\n\n17.Liberia shall update the list of vessels authorised to fish and shall send it without delay to the MCSU, NFMC and MOA of Liberia, and to the Union.\n\n\nPeriod of validity of the fishing authorisation\n\n\n18.Fishing authorisations shall be valid for an annual period and be renewable.\n\n\n19.In order to establish the start of the period of validity, \u2018annual period\u2019 shall mean:\n\n\n(i)for the first year of application of the Protocol, the period between the date of its provisional application and 31 December of the same year;\n\n\n(ii)then, each complete calendar year;\n\n\n(iii)for the last year of application of the Protocol, the period between 1 January and the date of expiry of the Protocol.\n\n\n\n\nFor the first and last years of application of the Protocol, the advance fee referred to in Section 2 below shall be calculated pro rata temporis.\n\n\nDocuments to be carried onboard\n\n\n20.While the fishing vessel is in the Liberian fishing zone or in an agreed designated port in the sub-region, the following documents must be carried on board the vessel at all times:\n\n\n(i)The fishing authorization;\n\n\n(ii)The vessel certificate of registry;\n\n\n(iii)Liberia Maritime Authority certificate of number;\n\n\n(iv)Up-to-date certified drawings or descriptions of the layout of the fishing vessels and in particular, the number of fish holds of the fishing vessels, with the storage capacity expressed in cubic meters;\n\n\n(v)if any modification was made to the characteristics of the fishing vessel with respect to its length overall, its gross registered tonnage, the horsepower of its main engine or engines or its hold capacity, a certificate, certified by a competent authority of the flag state of the fishing vessel, describing the nature of such modification;\n\n\n(vi)if the fishing vessel is equipped with chilled or refrigerated sea-water tanks, a document certified by a competent authority of the flag state of the vessel indicating the calibration of the tanks in cubic meters; \n\n\n(vii)a copy of the applicable Liberia fisheries legislation, to be provided by Liberia; and\n\n\n(viii)the documents referred to in point 4 above.\n\n\n\nSECTION 2\n\n\nFISHING AUTHORISATION CONDITIONS \u2013 FEES AND ADVANCE PAYMENTS\n\n\n1.The fees to be paid by the shipowners shall be calculated on the basis of the following rate per tonne of fish caught in the Liberian fishing zone : \n\n\n\u2013EUR\u00a055 per tonne for the first year of application;\n\n\n\u2013EUR\u00a060 per tonne for the second and third years of application;\n\n\n\u2013EUR\u00a065 per tonne for the fourth year of application;\n\n\n\u2013EUR\u00a070 per tonne for the fifth year of application.\n\n\n2.Fishing authorisations shall be issued once the following advance fees have been paid by the shipowners to the competent authorities of Liberia:\n\n\n\n\n\u2013For tuna seiners:\n\n\n\u2013EUR\u00a07 150 per vessel, equivalent to the fees due for 130 tonnes per year for the first year of application of the Protocol;\n\n\n\u2013EUR\u00a07 150 per vessel, equivalent to the fees due for 119,17 tonnes per year for the second and third years of application of the Protocol;\n\n\n\u2013EUR\u00a07 150 per vessel, equivalent to the fees due for 110 tonnes per year for the fourth year of application of the Protocol;\n\n\n\u2013EUR\u00a07 150 per vessel, equivalent to the fees due for 102,14 tonnes per year for the fifth year of application of the Protocol.\n\n\n\u2013For surface longliners:\n\n\n\u2013EUR\u00a02 200 per vessel, equivalent to the fees due for 40 tonnes per year for the first year of application of the Protocol;\n\n\n\u2013EUR\u00a02 200 per vessel, equivalent to the fees due for 36,67 tonnes per year for the second and third years of application of the Protocol;\n\n\n\u2013EUR\u00a02 200 per vessel, equivalent to the fees due for 33,85 tonnes per year for the fourth year of application of the Protocol;\n\n\n\u2013EUR\u00a02 200 per vessel, equivalent to the fees due for 31,43 tonnes per year for the fifth year of application of the Protocol.\n\n\n3.The advance fee shall include all national and local charges except for port taxes and service charges.\n\n\n4.Where the period of validity of the fishing authorisation is less than one year, the amount of the advance fee shall be adapted pro-rata temporis to the duration of the period of validity requested.\n\n\n5.If the final statement of fees is higher than the advance fee paid by the vessel-owner for obtaining the fishing authorisation, the vessel-owner shall pay the balance to Liberia no later than 30 September of the year following which the catches were made. Where the final statement is less than the advance fee referred to in point 2, the balance shall not be recoverable by the shipowner.\n\n\nSECTION 3\n\n\nSUPPORT VESSELS\n\n\n1.Liberia shall authorise Union vessels which are holders of a fishing authorisation to be assisted by support vessels. The support vessels shall fly the flag of an EU Member State, and shall not be equipped for catching fish or be used for transhipments.\n\n\n2.Liberia shall define its support activities and the conditions for obtaining authorisations and shall draw up a list of authorised support vessels and send it without delay to the national body for controlling fishing and to the Union.\n\n\n3.The annual authorisation fee applicable to the support vessel is EUR 3 000 per vessel.\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nCONSERVATION TECHNICAL MEASURES\n\n\n\n\n1.Conservation technical measures applicable to the vessels holding a fishing authorisation, relating to the fishing zone, fishing gear and additional catch, shall be defined for each fishing category in the technical sheets contained in Appendix 2 to this Annex. \n\n\n2.The vessels shall comply with all the recommendations adopted by ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas) and the provisions under the relevant Liberian legislation.\n\n\n3.The use of drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs) in the Liberian fishing zone shall be limited to artificial supports with non-entangling underwater hanging structures. The deployment and use of such artificial drifting FADs shall be subject to the adoption by the Union of a management plan in line with the provisions adopted by ICCAT.\n\n\n4.Union vessels shall conduct all fishing activities in a manner which will not disrupt traditional, local-based fisheries, and shall release all turtles, marine mammals, seabirds and reef fish in a manner which will provide this miscellaneous catch with the greatest chance of survival.\n\n\n5.Union vessels, their masters and operators shall conduct all fishing operations in a manner, which will not disrupt the fishing activities of other fishing vessels and shall not interfere with the fishing gear of other fishing vessels.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV \n\n\nCONTROL, MONITORING AND SURVEILLANCE\n\n\nSECTION 1\n\n\nCATCH REPORTING\n\n\nFishing logbook\n\n\n1.The master of an Union vessel fishing under the Agreement shall keep a fishing logbook, for which the model for each category of fishing is included in Appendix 3 to this Annex. \n\n\n2.The fishing logbook shall be completed by the master for each day the vessel is present in the Liberian fishing zone. \n\n\n3.Each day the master shall record in the fishing logbook the quantity of each species, identified by its FAO alpha 3 code, caught and kept on board, expressed in kilograms of live weight or, where necessary, the number of individual fish. For each main species, the master shall also include the bycatch.\n\n\n4.Where applicable, the master shall also record each day in the fishing logbook:\n\n\n(i)the quantities of each species discarded, expressed in kilograms of live weight or, where necessary, the number of individual fish.\n\n\n(ii)the gear type used;\n\n\n(iii)the noon position of the vessel and, where applicable, the set position of the fishing gear and soak time or the number of hooks and the sea surface temperature;\n\n\n(iv)the total number of hauls per day, aggregate time for each haul and total number of days fished per fishing trip; and \n\n\n(v)such other information as may be decided by the Joint Committee.\n\n\n5.If no sets were made by a vessel for a particular day, or if a set is made and no fish are caught, the vessel master shall be required to record this information on the daily log sheet form. On days when no fishing operations are conducted, by midnight local time of that day, the vessel must record on the logbook the fact that no operations were conducted.\n\n\n\n\n6.Time and date of entries in and departures from the Liberia fishing zone shall be recorded in the logbook immediately after entry in and departure from the Liberia fishing zone.\n\n\n7.The fishing logbook shall be filled in legibly, in block capitals, and signed by the master. \n\n\n8.The master shall be responsible for the accuracy of the data recorded in the fishing logbook.\n\n\nCatch reporting\n\n\n9.The master shall notify the vessel\u2019s catch by submitting its fishing logbooks for the period of its presence in the Liberian fishing zone to the Bureau of National Fisheries (BNF) . \n\n\n10.The fishing logbooks shall be transmitted in one of the following ways: \n\n\n(i)when calling into a Liberian port, the original of each fishing logbook shall be submitted to the local representative of Liberia, who shall confirm receipt thereof in writing;\n\n\n(ii)when leaving the Liberian fishing zone without first passing through a Liberian port, each fishing logbook shall be sent within a period of fourteen (14) calendar days after arrival in any other port, and in any case within a period of thirty (30) calendar days after leaving the Liberian fishing zone. \n\n\n(a)preferably by e-mail in the form of a scanned copy, or\n\n\n(b)by fax, or\n\n\n(c)the original by letter.\n\n\n11.The two Parties shall make every effort to establish a system for the electronic exchange of all the data, in view of accelerating its transmission.\n\n\n12.As soon as it is possible for catch declarations to be sent by e-mail, the master shall send the fishing logbooks to Liberia at the e-mail address given by Liberia. Liberia shall confirm receipt thereof immediately by return e-mail. \n\n\n13.The master shall send a copy of all the fishing logbooks to the EU Delegation to Liberia. For each vessel, the master shall also send a copy of all the fishing logbooks to the BNF and one of the following scientific institutes:\n\n\n(i)IRD (Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement);\n\n\n(ii)IEO (Instituto Espa\u00f1ol de Oceanografia);\n\n\n(iii)IPMA (Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da Atmosf\u00e8ra).\n\n\n14.The return of the vessel into the Liberian fishing zone within the period of validity of its fishing authorisation shall give rise to further catch reporting. \n\n\n15.Where the provisions concerning catch reporting are not complied with, Liberia may suspend the fishing authorisation of the vessel concerned until the missing catch report is obtained and penalise the vessel owner in accordance with the relevant provisions under the national legislation in force. If the offence is repeated, Liberia may refuse to renew the fishing authorisation. Liberia shall inform the Union immediately of any penalty applied in this context.\n\n\nTransition to an electronic system\n\n\n\n\n16.The two Parties indicate their shared willingness to ensure a transition to an electronic system for declaring catches based on the technical characteristics laid down in Appendix 6 to this Annex. The parties agree to determine together the transmission arrangements with the aim of the system becoming operational as soon as possible. Liberia shall inform the Union as soon as the conditions for this transition have been met. From the date this information is sent, the two Parties shall agree to have the system fully operational within two months. \n\n\nQuarterly catch declarations\n\n\n17.Until the electronic system for declaring catches referred to under point 16 above is in place, Member States shall inform the European Commission, not later than fifteen (15) calender days from the end of each quarter, of the tonnages caught during the past quarter, as validated by their national administrations and confirmed by the scientific institutes referred to in point 13 above. The scientific institutes shall conduct an analysis of the catch data by cross-checking the available data in the fishing logbooks, landing declarations, sales declarations and, where applicable, scientific observation reports. On this basis, the Union shall draw up, for each vessel authorised to fish in the Liberian fishing zone, a quarterly catch declaration broken down per species and per month, in accordance with the template provided in Appendix 8 to this Annex. \n\n\n18.The aggregated data originating from the fishing logbooks shall be considered provisional until notification by the Union of the final statement of fees referred to in point 23 below.\n\n\nFinal statement of fees\n\n\n19.Until the electronic system for declaring catches referred to under point 16 above is in place, Member States shall inform the European Commission, not later than 15 May each year, of the tonnages caught during the past year, as validated by their national administrations and confirmed by the scientific institutes referred to in point 13 above. \n\n\n20.The scientific institutes shall conduct an analysis of the catch data by cross-checking the available data in the fishing logbooks, landing declarations, sales declarations and, where applicable, scientific observation reports. \n\n\n21.The methodology used by the Union's scientific institutes to analyse the level and composition of the catches in the Liberian fishing zone shall be shared with the BNF.\n\n\n22.On the basis of the catch declarations referred to in point 19 above, the Union shall draw up for each vessel authorised to fish in the Liberian fishing zone in the previous year a final statement of the fees due for the vessel in respect of its annual fishing campaign for the previous calendar year. \n\n\n23.The Union shall send this final statement of fees simultaneously to Liberia and to the vessel owners via the Member States before 30 June of the year in progress.\n\n\n24.Liberia shall notify the Union of receipt of the statement and may request from the EU any clarifications it deems necessary. In this case, the Union shall consult the national administrations of the flag-States and the Union's scientific institutes and shall make every effort to provide to Liberia any additional information needed. Where applicable, a dedicated joint scientific meeting may be organised in order to examine the catch data and the methodologies used for cross-checking information. \n\n\n25.Liberia may contest the final annual catch declaration and the final statement of fees within 30 calendar days after the notification given under point 24, on the basis of documentary proof. In the case of disagreement, the Parties shall consult each other in the Joint Committee. If Liberia does not object within the aforementioned period, the final statement of fees shall be considered to be adopted.\n\n\nSECTION 2\n\n\nLANDING AND TRANSHIPMENT\n\n\nLanding procedure \n\n\n1.The master of a Union vessel wishing to land catches from the Liberian fishing zone in a Liberian port shall notify Liberia, at least forty-eight (48) hours before landing until the Mesurado pier becomes operational and thereafter at least twenty-four (24) hours before landing, of the following:\n\n\n(a)the name and IRCS of the fishing vessel which is to land, \n\n\n(b)the port of landing,\n\n\n(c)the planned date and time of the landing, \n\n\n(d)the quantity (expressed in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish) of each species to be landed (identified by its FAO alpha 3 code),\n\n\n\n\n(e)the product presentation.\n\n\n2.The landing operation must be carried out in the fishing zone of a Liberian port authorised for this purpose. \n\n\n3.Non-compliance with the provisions regarding the landing procedure shall lead to the application of the relevant penalties provided for under Liberian legislation.\n\n\nLanding incentives \n\n\n4.Union vessels shall endeavour to supply tuna to the local industry at the international market price. Until such time as the Mesurado pier in Liberia becomes operational, a Union vessel which holds a fishing authorisation in accordance with the terms set out in this Protocol and which lands its tuna catches in a Liberian designated port, shall benefit from a financial incentive in the form of a reduction in the fee of EUR 10 per tonne of bycatch landed in the case of sale of the catch to a Liberian fishing enterprise for supply to the Liberian market. This mechanism shall be limited to maximum 50% of the final catches reported.\n\n\n5.When the Mesurado fisheries terminal becomes operational, Union vessels shall benefit from the financial incentive in the form of partial reduction in the fee of EUR 10 per tonne landed. An additional reduction in the fee of EUR 10 per tonne landed shall be given in the case of sale to the local industry. With regards to bycatch a special reduction in the fee of EUR 25 per tonne of bycatch landed will be given when the catch is sold to the local market. This mechanism shall be limited to the maximum of 50% of the final tuna catches reported.\n\n\nTranshipment\n\n\n6.The master of a Union vessel wishing to tranship catches from the Liberian fishing zone in a Liberian port shall notify Liberia, at least forty-eight (48) hours before transhipment until the Mesurado pier becomes operational and thereafter at least twenty-four (24) hours before transhipment, of the following:\n\n\n(a)the name and IRCS of the donor fishing vessel, \n\n\n(b)the name and IRCS of the receiving fishing vessel, \n\n\n(c)the transhipment port,\n\n\n(d)the planned date and time of transhipment,\n\n\n(e)the quantity (expressed in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish) of each species to be transhipped (identified by its FAO alpha 3 code),\n\n\n(f)the product presentation.\n\n\n7.The transhipment operation shall be carried out in a Liberian port authorised for this purpose in the presence of Liberian inspectors. In order to avoid delays, in exceptional cases where the presence of a Liberian inspector is not possible, the master shall be authorised to commence transhipment after expiration of the notice period given in accordance with point 6. Transhipment at sea is prohibited.\n\n\n8.Transhipment shall be considered an exit from the Liberian fishing zone as defined in Section 3. Vessels must therefore submit their catch declarations to the competent authorities no later than 24 hours after completion of the transhipment or in any event at least 6 hours before the donor vessel leaves port whichever occurs first and the vessel owner shall state whether he intends to continue fishing or leave the Liberian fishing zone. For the receiving vessel, the reporting requirements of the applicable Liberian legislation shall apply.\n\n\nSECTION 3\n\n\nCONTROL AND INSPECTION\n\n\nEntering and leaving the zone\n\n\n1.Liberia must be notified of any Union vessel holding a fishing authorisation which enters or exits the Liberian fishing zone at least six (6) hours before the entry or exit.\n\n\n\n\n2.When notifying its entry or exit, the Union vessel shall notify in particular: \n\n\n(i)the date, time and point of passage scheduled;\n\n\n(ii)the quantity of all species held on board, identified by its FAO alpha 3 code and expressed in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish;\n\n\n(iii)the product presentation. \n\n\n3.Notification shall be given preferably by e-mail or, failing that, by fax or radio, to an e-mail address, a telephone number or a frequency communicated by Liberia as specified in Appendix 7. Liberia shall confirm receipt thereof immediately by return e-mail. Liberia shall immediately inform the vessels concerned and the Union of any change to the e-mail address, telephone number or transmission frequency. \n\n\n4.Any Union vessel found to be fishing in the Liberian fishing zone without having previously notified its presence shall be considered to be a vessel fishing illegally. \n\n\nInspection at sea\n\n\n5.Inspection at sea in the Liberian fishing zone of Union vessels holding a fishing authorisation shall be carried out by vessels and inspectors from Liberia who are clearly identified as being assigned to carry out fishing checks. \n\n\n6.Before going on board, the Liberian inspectors shall inform the Union vessel of their decision to carry out an inspection. The master of the Union vessel shall allow and facilitate the Liberian inspectors to come on board and carry out their work. The inspection shall be carried out by a maximum of five (5) inspectors, who must provide proof of their identity and official position as an inspector before carrying out the inspection.\n\n\n7.The master shall immediately comply with all reasonable instructions given by the authorized officers, and shall facilitate safe boarding, and facilitate the inspection of the vessel, gear, equipment, records, fish, fish products and documentation related to the crew.\n\n\n8.The vessel\u2019s master or crew shall not assault, obstruct, resist, delay, refuse boarding, intimidate, interfere with an authorized officer in the performance of duties. \n\n\n9.The Liberian inspectors shall only stay on board the Union vessel for the time necessary to carry out tasks linked to the inspection. They shall carry out the inspection in a way which minimises the impact on the vessel, its fishing activity and cargo.\n\n\n10.Liberia may authorise the Union to participate in the inspections as an observer.\n\n\n11.At the end of each inspection, the Liberian inspectors shall draw up an inspection report. The master of the Union vessel shall have the right to include his comments in the inspection report. The inspection report shall be signed by the inspector drawing up the report and the master of the Union vessel.\n\n\n12.The signature of the inspection report by the master shall be without prejudice to the vessel owner\u2019s right of defence in respect of an infringement. If the master refuses to sign this document, he or she shall specify the reasons for doing so in writing and the inspector shall write \u2018refusal to sign\u2019 on it. The Liberian inspectors shall give a copy of the inspection report to the master of the Union vessel before leaving the vessel. Liberia shall send a copy of the inspection report to the Union within eight (8) calendar days of the inspection.\n\n\nInspection in port\n\n\n13.Inspection in or off port of Union vessels holding a fishing authorisation which land catch from the Liberian fishing zone in a port in the sub-region designated by common agreement between the Union and Liberia shall be carried out by vessels and inspectors from Liberia who are clearly identified as being assigned to carry out fishing checks, subject to authorisation of the Port State concerned. \n\n\n14.Before going on board, the Liberian inspectors shall inform the Union vessel of their decision to carry out an inspection. The master of the Union vessel shall allow and facilitate the Liberian inspectors to come on board and carry out their work.

The Liberian inspectors shall give a copy of the inspection report to the master of the Union vessel before leaving the vessel. Liberia shall send a copy of the inspection report to the Union within eight (8) calendar days of the inspection.\n\n\nParticipatory monitoring in the fight against IUU fishing\n\n\n21.In order to strengthen the fight against IUU fishing, masters of Union fishing vessels shall report the presence of any vessels in the Liberian fishing zone engaged in activities which may constitute IUU fishing, seeking for as much information as possible about what has been sighted. Sighting reports shall be sent without delay to the MCSU, NFMC and MOA of Liberia and the competent authority of the Member State of the sighting vessel, which shall immediately transmit them to the Union or to the body designated by it. \n\n\n22.Liberia shall send the Union any sighting reports it has on fishing vessels engaged in activities which may constitute IUU fishing in the Liberian fishing zone. \n\n\nSECTION 4\n\n\nSATTELITE-BASED VESSEL MONITORING SYSTEM (VMS)\n\n\nVessel position messages \u2013 VMS system\n\n\n1.Whilst they are in the Liberian fishing zone, Union vessels holding a fishing authorisation must be equipped at all times with a satellite monitoring system (Vessel Monitoring System \u2013 VMS) to enable automatic and continuous communication of their position, every two hours, to the fishing control centre (Fisheries Monitoring Centre \u2013 FMC) of their flag State. \n\n\n2.Each position message must contain:\n\n\n(a)the vessel identification;\n\n\n(b)the most recent geographical position of the vessel (longitude, latitude), with a position error of less than 100\u00a0metres, and with a confidence interval of 99\u00a0%;\n\n\n(c)the date and time the position is recorded;\n\n\n(d)the speed and the course of the vessel.\n\n\n3.Each position message must be configured in accordance with the format included in Appendix 4 to this Annex.\n\n\n4.The first position recorded after entry into the Liberian fishing zone shall be identified by the code \u2018ENT\u2019. All subsequent positions shall be identified by the code \u2018POS\u2019, with the exception of the first position recorded after exit from the Liberian fishing zone, which shall be identified by the code \u2018EXI\u2019.\n\n\n5.The FMC of the flag State shall ensure the automatic processing and, if necessary, the electronic transmission of the position messages. The position messages shall be recorded in a secure manner and kept for a period of three years.\n\n\nTransmission by the vessel in the event of breakdown of the VMS\n\n\n\n\n6.The master shall ensure at all times that the VMS of his vessel is fully operational and that the position messages are correctly transmitted to the FMC of the flag State. \n\n\n7.In the event of breakdown, the VMS of the vessel shall be repaired or replaced within 10 days. After that period, the vessel shall no longer be authorised to fish in the Liberian fishing zone. \n\n\n8.Vessels fishing in the Liberian fishing zone with a defective VMS must communicate their position messages by e-mail, radio or fax to the FMC of the flag State, at least every four hours, and must provide all the compulsory information.\n\n\nSecure communication of the position messages to Liberia\n\n\n9.The FMC of the flag State shall automatically send the position messages of the vessels concerned to the FMC of Liberia. The FMCs of the flag State and Liberia shall exchange their contact e-mail addresses and inform each other without delay of any change to those addresses.\n\n\n10.The transmission of position messages between the FMCs of the flag State and Liberia shall be carried out electronically using a secure communication system.\n\n\n11.The FMC of Liberia shall inform the FMC of the flag State and the Union of any interruption in the reception of consecutive position messages from a vessel holding a fishing authorisation, where the vessel concerned has not notified its exit from the zone. \n\n\nMalfunction of the communication system\n\n\n12.Liberia shall ensure the compatibility of its electronic equipment with that of the FMC of the flag State and inform the Union immediately of any malfunction as regards the communication and reception of position messages with a view to finding a technical solution as soon as possible. The Joint Committee shall deal with any possible dispute arising. \n\n\n13.The master shall be considered responsible for any proven tampering with a vessel\u2019s VMS aimed at disturbing its operation or falsifying its position messages. Any infringements shall be subject to the penalties provided for by the Liberian legislation in force.\n\n\nRevision of the frequency of position messages\n\n\n14.On the basis of documentary evidence proving an infringement, Liberia may ask the FMC of the flag State, copying in the Union, to reduce the interval for sending position messages from a vessel to every thirty minutes for a set period of investigation. This documentary evidence must be sent without delay by Liberia to the FMC of the flag State and to the Union. The FMC of the flag State shall immediately send the position messages to Liberia at the new frequency. \n\n\n15.At the end of the set investigation period, Liberia shall immediately inform the FMC of the flag State and the Union and subsequently inform them of any follow-up.\n\n\nSECTION 5\n\n\nOBSERVERS\n\n\nObservation of fishing activities \n\n\n1.Vessels holding a fishing authorisation shall be subject to a scheme for observing their fishing activities carried out within the framework of the Agreement.\n\n\n2.This observation scheme shall conform to the recommendations adopted by ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas). \n\n\n3.Until such time as the new ICCAT Regional Observer Programme becomes operational, the following provisions on observers shall apply.\n\n\nDesignated vessels and observers\n\n\n\n\n4.The BNF shall designate the Union vessels which must allow an observer to embark and the observer assigned to them at the latest fifteen (15) calendar days before the date provided for the embarkation of the observer. Union vessels shall, at the request of the Liberian authorities, take on board one observer in order to reach the cover rate of 15\u00a0% of authorised vessels. \n\n\n5.The BNF shall draw up a list of vessels designated to take an observer on board and a list of the appointed observers. These lists shall be kept up to date. They shall be forwarded to the Union as soon as they have been drawn up and every three months thereafter when they have been updated.\n\n\n6.When the fishing authorisation is issued, the BNF shall inform the Union and the vessel owner, or his agent, of the designated vessels and the observers which will be present on board each vessel. The time and port of embarkation, which may be a non-Liberian port, shall be chosen by the vessel-owner. The BNF shall immediately inform the Union and the vessel owner or his agent of any change in the designated vessels and observers.\n\n\n7.The BNF shall endeavour not to designate observers for vessels which already have an observer on board, or which are already formally obliged to allow an observer to embark during the fishing season in question as part of their activities in fishing zones other than the Liberian fishing zone.\n\n\n8.The time spent on board by observers shall be one fishing trip or, at the express request of the vessel-owner, more than one fishing trip for a particular vessel.\n\n\n9.The observers shall not spend more time on board the vessel than is necessary to carry out their duties.\n\n\nFlat-rate financial contribution\n\n\n10.At the time the annual advance fee is paid, the vessel owner shall also pay Liberia a flat-rate sum of EUR\u00a0400 per year for each vessel.\n\n\nObserver\u2019s salary\n\n\n11.The salary and social contributions of the observer shall be borne by Liberia. \n\n\nEmbarkation conditions\n\n\n12.The embarkation conditions for the observer, in particular the duration of presence on board, shall be defined by mutual agreement between the vessel owner or his agent and the BNF.\n\n\n13.Observers shall be treated on board as officers. However, receiving the observer on board shall take into account the technical structure of the vessel.\n\n\n14.The vessel owner shall bear the costs of providing accommodation and food for the observer on board, including access to washing and toilet facilities, of a quality at least as good as that supplied to officers on the fishing vessel. \n\n\n15.The master shall take all the measures for which he is responsible to guarantee the physical safety and general wellbeing of the observer.\n\n\n16.The master shall ensure that the observer has access to the facilities, gear and equipment on board the vessel which the observer needs to carry out his duties, including:\n\n\n(i)the bridge and the communications and navigation equipment of the vessel; \n\n\n(ii)the documents and records, including all logbooks of the vessel, whether required to be carried and maintained under Liberia Fisheries Regulation or otherwise for purposes of record inspection and copying;\n\n\n17.The master shall permit the observer at all times to:\n\n\n(i)receive and transmit messages and communicate with the shore and other vessels by means of the vessel\u2019s communications equipment;\n\n\n\n\n(ii)take, measure, remove from the vessel and retain samples or whole specimens of any fish; \n\n\n(iii)store samples and whole specimens on the vessel, including samples and whole specimens held in the vessel\u2019s freezing facilities; \n\n\n(iv)take photographs of the fishing activities, including fish, gear, equipment, documents, charts and records, and remove from the vessel such photographs or film as the observer may have taken or used on board the vessel.\n\n\nObserver\u2019s obligations\n\n\n18.Whilst they are on board observers shall:\n\n\n(a)take all appropriate measures so as not to interrupt or hinder fishing operations;\n\n\n(b)respect on-board property and equipment;\n\n\n(c)respect the confidential nature of any document belonging to the vessel.\n\n\nEmbarkation and landing of observers\n\n\n19.The vessel owner or his agent shall notify Liberia, with a notice period of ten (10) calendar days before the embarkation, of the date, time and port of embarkation of the observer. If the observer is embarked in a foreign country, their travel costs to the port of embarkation shall be borne by the vessel owner. \n\n\n20.If the observer does not arrive to embark within twelve (12) hours of the date and time set, the vessel owner shall be automatically discharged from his obligation to allow the observer to embark. The vessel shall be free to leave the port and start fishing operations.\n\n\n21.Where the observer is not disembarked in a Liberian port, the vessel owner shall bear the costs of repatriation of the observer to Liberia as soon as possible.\n\n\n22.If the vessel does not arrive at the agreed time at the previously agreed port to receive an observer, the ship-owner shall pay the costs at a daily subsistence rate of EUR 80 for the number of days relating to the observer\u2019s inability to board while waiting at the port (accommodation, food, etc.).\n\n\n23.If the vessel fails to appear, without having provided the BNF and NFMC with prior notification, Liberia may take appropriate action in accordance with the applicable Liberian legislation.\n\n\nObserver\u2019s duties\n\n\n24.The observer shall carry out the following duties:\n\n\n(a)observe the fishing activities of the vessel;\n\n\n(b)the species, quantity, size and condition of fish taken;\n\n\n(c)the methods by which, the areas in which, and the depths at which, fish are taken;\n\n\n(d)the effects of fishing methods on fish, and the environment;\n\n\n\n\n(e)processing, transportation, transhipment, storage, or disposal of any fish;\n\n\n(f)verify the position of the vessel during fisheries operations;\n\n\n(g)perform biological sampling in the context of a scientific programme;\n\n\n(h)note the fishing gear used;\n\n\n(i)verify the catch data for the Liberian fishing zone recorded in the logbook;\n\n\n(j)verify the percentages of by-catch and estimate the discarded catch;\n\n\n(k)communicate observations by radio, fax or e-mail at least once a week while the vessel is fishing in the Liberian fishing zone, including the quantity of catch and by-catch on board.\n\n\nObserver\u2019s report\n\n\n25.Before leaving the vessel, the observer shall submit a summary report of his observations to the master of the vessel, the content of which shall be agreed on by the Joint Committee. The master of the vessel shall have the right to make comments in the observer\u2019s report. The report shall be signed by the observer and the master. The master shall receive a copy of the observer\u2019s report. \n\n\n26.The observer shall send his report to the BNF, which shall send a copy of it to the Union within fifteen (15) calendar days of the observer\u2019s disembarkation.\n\n\n27.The information contained in the observer report may be used for both science and compliance analysis by the competent Liberian and Union authorities.\n\n\nSECTION 6\n\n\nINFRINGEMENTS\n\n\nHandling of infringements\n\n\n1.Any infringement committed by a Union vessel holding a fishing authorisation in accordance with the provisions of this Annex must be referred to in an infringement or inspection report produced by the competent Liberian authority. The notification of the infringement and the relevant applicable sanctions served on the master or the fishing company shall be sent directly to the vessel-owner following the procedure set in the applicable Liberian legislation. A copy of the notification shall be sent to the flag state of the vessel and to the Union within 24 hours.\n\n\n2.The signature of the inspection report by the master shall be without prejudice to the vessel owner\u2019s right of defence in respect of an infringement. The master of the vessel shall cooperate while the inspection procedure is being carried out.\n\n\nDetention of a vessel \u2013 Information meeting\n\n\n3.Where permitted under the Liberian legislation in force regarding the infringement, any Union vessel having committed an infringement may be forced to cease its fishing activity and, where the vessel is at sea, to return to a Liberian port.\n\n\n4.Liberia shall notify the Union within twenty-four (24) hours of any detention of a Union vessel holding a fishing authorisation. That notification shall include documentary evidence supporting the detention of the vessel. \n\n\n5.Before taking any measure against the vessel, the master, the crew or the cargo, with the exception of measures aimed at protecting evidence, Liberia shall organise, at the request of the Union, within one working day of notification of the detention of the vessel, an information meeting to clarify the facts which have led to the vessel being detained and to explain what further action may be taken. A representative of the flag State of the vessel may attend that information meeting. \n\n\n\n\nPenalties for infringements - Compromise procedure\n\n\n6.The penalty for the infringement shall be set by Liberia according to the provisions of the national legislation in force.\n\n\n7.In the event that the ship owner does not accept the fines, and provided that the infringement does not involve a criminal act, a compromise procedure shall be undertaken between the Liberian authorities and the EU vessel to settle the issue amicably prior to launching the legal proceedings. A representative of the flag State of the vessel and of the Union may participate in that compromise procedure. The compromise procedure shall finish at the latest three (3) calendar\u00a0days after the notification of the detention of the vessel.\n\n\nLegal proceedings \u2013 Bank security\n\n\n8.If the compromise procedure fails and the infringement is brought before the competent court, the owner of the vessel which committed the infringement shall deposit a bank security at a bank designated by Liberia, the amount of which, as shall be set by Liberia, shall cover the costs linked to the detention of the vessel, the estimated fine and any compensation. The bank security may not be recovered until the legal proceedings have been concluded.\n\n\n9.The bank security shall be released and returned to the vessel owner without delay after the judgment has been delivered:\n\n\n(a)in full, if no penalty has been imposed;\n\n\n(b)for the amount of the remaining balance, if the penalty is a fine which is lower than the amount of the bank security.\n\n\n10.Liberia shall inform the Union of the outcome of the legal proceedings within eight (8) calendar days of the judgment being delivered.\n\n\nRelease of the vessel and the crew\n\n\n11.The vessel and its crew shall be authorised to leave the port once the penalty has been paid in a compromise procedure, or once the bank security has been deposited.\n\n\nCHAPTER V \n\n\nSIGNING-ON OF SEAMEN\n\n\n1.Owners of tuna seiners and longliners vessels shall employ ACP nationals, subject to the following conditions and limits:\n\n\n\u2013for the fleet of tuna seiners, at least 20\u00a0% of the seamen signed on during the tuna-fishing season in the fishing zone of third countries shall be of ACP origin;\n\n\n\u2013for the fleet of longliners, at least 20\u00a0% of the seamen signed on during the tuna-fishing season in the fishing zone of third countries shall be of ACP origin. \n\n\n2.Vessel owners shall endeavour to sign on three (3) qualified Liberian seamen per vessel. The vessel-owner shall be free to select the seamen they take on board their vessels from the names on the list submitted by the BNF to the Union.\n\n\n3.The International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work shall apply as of right to seamen signed on by Union vessels. This concerns in particular the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\n\n4.The employment contracts of seamen from the ACP countries shall be drawn up between the vessel owners\u2019 representative(s) and the seamen and/or their trade unions or representatives. A copy shall be given to the signatories, the BNF, the Liberia Maritime Authority (LiMA) and to the Ministry of Labour of Liberia. These contracts shall guarantee the seamen the social security cover applicable to them, including life assurance and sickness and accident insurance. \n\n\n5.The wages of the seamen from the ACP countries shall be paid by the vessel owners. They shall be fixed, before fishing authorisations are issued, by mutual agreement among the vessel owners or their representatives and the seamen and/or their trade unions or representatives. However, the wage conditions granted to the seamen shall not be lower than those applied to their respective countries and shall under no circumstances be below ILO standards.\n\n\n\n\n6.All seamen employed aboard Union vessels shall report to the master of the vessel designated on the day before their proposed embarkation date. Where a seaman fails to report at the date and time agreed for embarkation, vessel owners shall be automatically absolved of their obligation to take the seaman on board.\n\n\n7.Where the Liberian seaman is not disembarked in a Liberia port, the vessel owner shall bear the costs of repatriation of the seamen to Liberia as soon as possible. \n\n\n8.If the vessel does not arrive at the agreed time at a previously agreed port to receive Liberian seaman, the ship-owner shall pay the costs at a daily subsistence rate of EUR 80 for the number of days relating to the Liberian seaman\u2019s inability to board while waiting at the port (accommodation, food, etc.).\n\n\n9.Vessels owners shall transmit on an annual basis information on seamen signed on. This information shall include the number of seamen who are nationals:\n\n\n(a)of the Union;\n\n\n(b)of an ACP country, distinguishing Liberians from other ACP-nationals; and\n\n\n(c)of non-ACP and non-Union countries.\n\n\nAppendices to this Annex\n\n\nAppendix 1 \u2013 Fishing authorisation application form\n\n\nAppendix 2 \u2013 Technical sheet\n\n\nAppendix 3 \u2013 Fishing logbook\n\n\nAppendix 4 \u2013 Format of VMS position message\n\n\nAppendix 5 \u2013 Limits of the Liberian fishing zone\n\n\nAppendix 6 \u2013 Electronic reporting of fishing operations\n\n\nAppendix 7 \u2013 Contact details of the Liberian authorities\n\n\nAppendix 8 \u2013Catch declaration form\n\n\nAppendix 1\n\n\nLIBERIA - EUROPEAN UNION FISHING AGREEMENT\n\n\nFISHING AUTHORISATION APPLICATION FORM\n\n\n\nI - APPLICANT\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name of vessel owner: .....................................................................................................................................\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Address of vessel owner: .....................................................................................................................................\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name of the vessel owner\u2019s association or agent (if applicable): .....................................................................................................................................\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Address of the vessel owner\u2019s association or agent (if applicable): .....................................................................................................................................\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Telephone:..........................

The Liberian authorities shall also undertake to communicate any changes to those coordinates at least one month in advance.\n\n\nAppendix 6\n\n\nGUIDELINES FOR MANAGING AND IMPLEMENTING THE ELECTRONIC REPORTING SYSTEM FOR FISHING ACTIVITIES (ERS)\n\n\n\nGeneral provisions\n\n\n(1)All Union fishing vessels must be equipped with an electronic system, hereinafter referred to as an \u2018ERS\u2019, capable of recording and transmitting data concerning the vessel\u2019s fishing activities, hereinafter referred to as \u2018ERS data\u2019, when the vessel is operating in the Liberian fishing zone.\n\n\n(2)A Union vessel that is not equipped with an ERS, or whose ERS is not working, is not authorised to enter the Liberian fishing zone in order to engage in fishing activities.\n\n\n(3)ERS data shall be transmitted in accordance with the procedures of the vessel\u2019s flag State, i.e. they shall firstly be sent to the Fisheries Monitoring Centre (hereinafter: FMC) of the flag State which will make them automatically available to the Liberian FMC. \n\n\n(4)The flag State and Liberia shall ensure that their FMCs have the necessary IT\u00a0equipment and software to automatically transmit ERS data in XML format and shall have a backup procedure in place capable of saving and storing ERS data in a format which will be computer-readable for at least three (3) years.\n\n\n\n\n(5)Any change or update to this format shall be identified and dated and must be operational six (6) months after its introduction.\n\n\n(6)ERS data must be transmitted using the electronic means of communication operated by the European Commission on behalf of the EU, referred to as the DEH (Data Exchange Highway).\n\n\n(7)The flag State and Liberia shall each designate an ERS correspondent who will act as the point of contact. \n\n\n(a)ERS correspondents shall be designated for a minimum period of six (6) months.\n\n\n(b)The FMCs of the flag State and  Liberia shall notify one another of the contact details (name, address, telephone number, fax, e-mail address) of their ERS correspondent, before the supplier starts production of the ERS.\n\n\n(c)Any changes to the contact details of the ERS correspondent must be notified immediately.\n\n\nProducing and communicating ERS data\n\n\n(8)Union fishing vessels must:\n\n\n(a)communicate on a daily basis ERS data for each day spent in the Liberian fishing zone;\n\n\n(b)record the quantity of each species caught and kept on board as target species or by-catch, or discarded, for each fishing operation;\n\n\n(c)declare the bad catch of each species specified in the fishing authorisation issued by Liberia;\n\n\n(d)identify each species by its FAO 3-alpha code;\n\n\n(e)express quantities in kilograms of live weight or, where necessary, the number of individual fish;\n\n\n(f)record, in the ERS data, the transhipped and/or unloaded quantity of each species; \n\n\n(g)record in the ERS data, every time the Liberian fishing zone is entered (COE message) or exited (COX message), a specific message containing the quantities held on board at the time of passing for each species specified in the fishing authorisation issued by Liberia;\n\n\n(h)transmit ERS data on a daily basis to the FMC of the flag State, according to the format referred to in paragraph 3 above, by 23:59 UTC at the latest.\n\n\n(9)The master is responsible for the accuracy of the ERS data recorded and sent. \n\n\n(10)The FMC of the flag State shall send the ERS data automatically and without delay to the Liberian FMC. \n\n\n(11)The Liberian FMC shall confirm that it has received the ERS data by means of a return message and shall handle all ERS data confidentially. \n\n\nFailure of the on-board ERS and/or transmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State\n\n\n\n\n(12)The flag State shall immediately inform the master and/or owner of a vessel flying its flag, or their agent, of any technical failure of the ERS installed on board or breakdown in transmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State. \n\n\n(13)The flag State shall inform Liberia of the failure detected and the corrective measures taken. \n\n\n(14)In the event of a breakdown in the on-board ERS, the master and/or owner shall ensure the ERS is repaired or replaced within ten (10) calendar days. If the vessel makes a call at a port within those ten (10) days, it may only resume fishing activity in the Liberian fishing zone once its ERS is in perfect working order, unless Liberia authorises otherwise. \n\n\n(15)Following a technical failure in its ERS, a fishing vessel may not leave port until:\n\n\n(a)its ERS is in working order once again, to the satisfaction of the flag State and Liberia, or\n\n\n(b)it receives authorisation from the flag State. In the latter case, the flag State shall inform Liberia of its decision before the vessel leaves. \n\n\n(16)Any Union vessels operating in the Liberian fishing zone with a faulty ERS must transmit all ERS data on a daily basis and by 23:59\u00a0UTC at the latest to the FMC of the flag State by any other available means of electronic communication accessible by the Liberian FMC. \n\n\n(17)ERS data which could not be made available to Liberia via the ERS owing to the failure referred to in paragraph 12 shall be transmitted by the FMC of the flag State to the Liberian FMC by another mutually agreed form of electronic communication. This alternative transmission shall be considered priority as it will not be possible to comply with the transmission deadlines usually applicable.\n\n\n(18)If the Liberian FMC does not receive ERS data from a vessel for three (3) consecutive days, Liberia may instruct a vessel to immediately call at a port of Liberia\u2019s choosing in order to investigate. \n\n\nFMC failure \u2013 ERS data not received by the Liberian FMC\n\n\n(19)In the event that ERS data is not received by an FMC, its ERS correspondent shall immediately inform the ERS correspondent for the other FMC and, if necessary, work together in order to resolve the problem.\n\n\n(20)Before the ERS becomes operational, the FMC of the flag State and the Liberian FMC shall mutually agree on the alternative means of electronic communication to be used in order to transmit ERS data in the event of an FMC failure, and shall immediately inform one another of any changes.\n\n\n(21)If the Liberian FMC reports that ERS data has not been received, the FMC of the flag State shall identify the causes of the problem and take appropriate measures in order to resolve the problem. The FMC of the flag State shall inform the Liberian FMC and the Union of the outcome of the measures taken within twenty-four (24)\u00a0hours after recognising the failure. \n\n\n(22)If more than twenty-four (24) hours is required in order to resolve the problem, the FMC of the flag State shall immediately transmit the missing ERS data to the Liberian FMC via one of the alternative means of electronic communication referred to in point 20.\n\n\n(23)Liberia shall inform its competent monitoring services (MCS) so that Union vessels are not considered by the Liberian FMC as being in violation of their obligations for not transmitting ERS data, owing to a failure in one of the FMCs.\n\n\nFMC maintenance\n\n\n(24)Planned maintenance of an FMC (maintenance programme) which may affect the exchange of ERS data must be notified at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance to the other FMC, indicating, where possible, the date and duration of the maintenance work. Information about unplanned maintenance work shall be sent to the other FMC as soon as possible.\n\n\n(25)During the maintenance work, the provision of ERS data may be put on hold until the system is operational again. The relevant ERS data shall be made available immediately after the maintenance work has been completed.\n\n\n(26)If the maintenance work takes more than twenty-four (24) \u00a0hours, ERS data shall be sent to the other FMC using one of the alternative means of electronic communication referred to in point 20.\n\n\n(27)Liberia shall inform its competent monitoring services (MCS) so that Union vessels are not considered by the Liberian FMC as being in violation of their obligations for not transmitting ERS data, owing to the maintenance of an FMC.\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 7\n\n\nCONTACT DETAILS OF THE LIBERIAN AUTHORITIES\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ministry of Agriculture:\n\n\nAddress: LIBSUCO Compound, LPRC Road, off Somalia Drive, Gardnersville, Liberia\n\n\nPostal address: P.O.
