"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nStrasbourg, 24.11.2015\nCOM(2015) 586 final\n2015/0270(COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) 806/2014 in order to establish a European Deposit Insurance Scheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n\nThis legislative proposal envisages the establishment of a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) as the third pillar of Banking Union in three successive stages: a reinsurance scheme for participating national DGSs in a first period of three years, a co-insurance scheme for participating national DGSs in a second period of four years, and full insurance for participating national DGSs in the steady state. A national DGS can only benefit from EDIS if its funds are being built up in line with a precise funding path and it otherwise complies with essential requirements under Union law. The Single Resolution Board, which would be expanded to administer EDIS, would monitor national DGSs and release funds only where clearly defined conditions are met. The introduction of EDIS would be accompanied by ambitious measures in parallel to reduce risks in the banking sectors of Member States.\n\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n1.1.Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\n\nIn 2012, the Commission called for a Banking Union that would place the banking sector on a more sound footing and restore confidence in the Euro as part of a longer term vision for economic and fiscal integration.\n1\n The Banking Union should be implemented by shifting supervision to the European level, establishing an integrated framework for bank crisis management and, equally important, a common system for deposit protection. While the first two steps have been achieved by the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), a common system for deposit protection has not yet been established.\n\n\n\nThe Five Presidents' Report\n2\n and the Commission's follow-up Communication\n3\n set out a clear plan for deepening Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), including steps to further limit risks to financial stability. Completing the Banking Union is an indispensable step towards a full and deep EMU. For the single currency, a unified and fully integrated financial system is key for effective monetary policy transmission, adequate risk diversification across Member States and general confidence in the euro area banking system.\n\n\nIn particular, the Five Presidents\u2019 Report proposes to establish, in the long term, a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), as the third pillar of a fully-fledged Banking Union alongside bank supervision, which has been entrusted to the SSM, and with bank resolution, which has been entrusted to the SRM. \n\n\n\nThe Five Presidents' Report signals that, as the current set-up with national Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGSs) remains vulnerable to large local shocks, common deposit insurance would increase the resilience of the Banking Union against future crises. \n\n\n\nThe Commission committed in its follow-up Communication of 21 October to put forward a legislative proposal before the end of 2015 on the first steps towards EDIS with a view to creating a more European system, disconnected from the sovereign, so that financial stability is enhanced, citizens can be certain that the safety of their deposits does not depend on their geographical location, and sound banks are not penalised by their place of establishment. \n\n\nThe Commission indicated, in line with the Five Presidents' Report, that a first step would be taken towards a more common system, building on a \"reinsurance-based\" approach that would take into account different funding levels in national schemes and moral hazard issues. A joint Deposit Insurance Fund would be created, managed under the auspices of the existing Single Resolution Board. The EDIS would be mandatory for euro area Member States and open to non-euro area Member States willing to join the Banking Union.\n\n\nEDIS would progressively evolve from a reinsurance scheme into a fully mutualised co-insurance scheme over a number of years. In the context of efforts to deepen the EMU, together with the work on the establishment of bridge-financing arrangements for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) and on developing a common fiscal backstop, this step is necessary to reduce the bank/sovereign links in individual Member States by means of steps towards risk sharing among all the Member States in the Banking Union, and thereby to reinforce the Banking Union in achieving its key objective. However, such risk sharing implied by steps to reinforce Banking Union must proceed in parallel with risk reducing measures designed to break the bank-sovereign link more directly. \n\n\n1.2.Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThis proposed Regulation is consistent with existing policy provisions.\n\n\n\nFollowing the establishment of the SSM by Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013\n4\n and of the SRM by Regulation (EU) No 806/2014\n5\n, EDIS addresses the misalignment between the Union supervision and resolution of banks in the participating Member States, on the one hand, and the effectiveness and credibility of national DGSs in case of failure of those same banks pursuant to the Directive 2014/59/EU on Deposit Guarantee Schemes\n6\n (DGS Directive), on the other.\n\n\nThis proposed Regulation builds on the existing framework of national DGSs as governed by the DGS Directive. The uniform application of the deposit guarantee framework in the Member States participating in EDIS would be enhanced as a result of this proposed Regulation through the attribution to a Single Resolution and Deposit Insurance Board (\"the Board\") of decision-making, monitoring and enforcement powers relating to the deposit guarantee framework. \n\n\n1.3.Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nEDIS would contribute to reducing the link between the perceived fiscal position of individual Member States and the funding costs of banks operating in those Member States and thereby help breaking the link between sovereigns and banks. This would increase the resilience of the banking sector against future crises and contribute to the overall objective of financial stability which underpins the economic and monetary policy of the Union. Risks would be spread more widely, enhancing financial stability not only in the Member State concerned but also in other participating and non-participating Member States, by limiting potential contagion effects. Moreover, it will help restore the level playing field in the internal market by limiting the competitive disadvantage that sound banks are suffering because of their place of establishment. In an environment of financial stability, lending from financial institutions to the wider economy is incentivised by reduced funding costs of funding for financial institutions, thereby boosting growth and employment and enhancing the competitiveness of the Union's economy.\n\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n2.1.Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for the proposed Regulation is Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which allows the adoption of measures for the approximation of national provisions aiming at the establishment and functioning of the internal market.\n\n\nThe proposed Regulation aims to preserve the integrity and enhance the functioning of the internal market. Uniform application of a single set of rules for deposit protection, together with access to a European Deposit Insurance Fund (\"the Deposit Insurance Fund\") managed by a central authority would contribute to the orderly functioning of the Union financial markets and to financial stability in the Union. It would remove obstacles to the exercise of fundamental freedoms avoiding significant distortion of competition, at least in those Member States which share the supervision and resolution of credit institutions and the protection of depositors at the European level.\n\n\nArticle 114 of the TFEU is, therefore, the appropriate legal base.\n\n\n2.2.Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nUnder the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), in areas which do not fall within its exclusive responsibility, the Union should act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at central level or at regional and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level.\n\n\nIn the current situation, where DGS remain purely national, they are vulnerable to large local shocks maintaining a strong interaction between banks and their national sovereign. This situation undermines the homogeneity of protection for deposits and can contribute to a lack of confidence among depositors.\n\n\nFurthermore, substantial differences in the protection of depositors taken at national level, and subject to local specificities and funding constraints, may undermine the integrity of the internal market.\n\n\nOnly action at European level can ensure appropriate deposit insurance for depositors across the internal market and weaken the link between national DGSs and the financial position of the respective sovereign.\n\n\nThe SSM ensures a level playing field in the supervision of banks and diminishes the risk of forbearance The SRM ensures that, when a bank failure occurs, restructuring can be carried out at the least cost, taxpayers are adequatley protected, and creditors and credit institutions receive fair and equal treatment across the internal market without being penalised because of their place of establishment. In the same vein, it is appropriate that the Union takes legislative action to establish the arrangements necessary to protect deposits of credit institutions which would fall under the scope of the Banking Union.\n\n\nFurthermore, EDIS would bring significant economies of scale and would avoid the negative externalities that may derive from purely national decisions and funds.\n\n\n2.3.Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe proposal is in line with the principle of proportionality. Under the principle of proportionality as established by Article 5(4) of the TEU, the content and form of Union action shall not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. \n\n\n\nIn the Banking Union, bank supervision and resolution are exercised at the same level of authority. Tensions may arise if a European resolution authority were to decide on the liquidation or resolution of a bank without being able to ensure that deposits are protected in the process, causing financial stability risks. Indeed, the recent crisis highlighted the need for swift and decisive action backed by European level funding arrangements. EDIS would ensure that the same rules are applied in the same manner to protect deposits in any participating Member State. Adequate backup funding would mitigate problems in individual banks from translating into a loss of confidence in the entire banking system of the Member State or of otherMember State perceived by markets to be exposed to similar risks.\n\n\nThe added legal certainty, aligned incentives in the Banking Union context, and economic benefits of central and uniform protection of depositors make the proposed Regulation compliant with the principle of proportionality.\n\n\n2.4.Choice of the instruments\n\n\nA progressively centralised application of the deposit guarantee rules laid down in the DGS Directive, by a single Union authority in the participating Member States, can be ensured only where the rules governing the establishment and functioning of EDIS are directly applicable in the Member States to avoid divergent interpretations across Member States. This and the fact that a Deposit Insurance Fund is set up at the level of the Banking Union, to be managed by a Board representing all members of the Banking Union, require a Regulation as the appropriate legal instrument. \n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n3.1.What is the problem and why is it a problem?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Banking Union, deposit insurance remains purely national, which leaves national DGSs vulnerable to large local shocks and Member States\u2019 budgets continue to be exposed to risks in their banking sectors. This prevents the realization of the full benefits of the internal market and of the Banking Union and potentially negatively affects depositor confidence and the rights of establishment of credit institutions and depositors. \n\n\n\nDGSs are in place in all Member States, as required by the DGS Directive. Although they already share some common aspects regarding their main features and their functioning, important aspects are still left at the discretion of Member States. Member States can also authorise, upon approval by the European Commission, reduced target levels for available financial means. \n\n\nThe differences in funding levels and size of the existing 38 DGSs in the EU may negatively affect depositors\u2019 confidence and could impair the functioning of the internal market. \n\n\n3.2.Why should the EU act?\n\n\n\nEDIS would complement the Banking Union alongside bank supervision and resolution. It would both reduce the vulnerability of bank depositors to large local shocks and further reduce the link between banks and their home sovereign. Furthermore, in a system where the responsibilities for bank supervision and resolution are shared, the circumstances under which a national DGS may be used are already not any longer under national control. Both Directive 2014/59/EU (the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive \u2013 BRRD) and Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation \u2013 SRMR) contain provisions on the possible use of DGS funds in resolution. Hence, establishing a common system also for deposit insurance is a logical next step in completing the Banking Union, and better aligns liability and control. \n\n\n\n3.3.What can be achieved?\n\n\nA quantitative analysis has considered the effectiveness of a fully mutualised EDIS in coping with potential pay-outs. The analysis indicates that the number and size of banks for which the Deposit Insurance Fund could handle pay-outs increases significantly for all Member States under EDIS compared to national DGSs. \n\n\nFurthermore, the analysis indicates that the expected shortfall of a payout, expressed as percentage of the target level, would be lower for EDIS than for any of the national DGSs. \n\n\n\nThe above assessments have been made under the assumption that EDIS would not require additional contributions from banks, but that banks\u2019 contributions envisaged for the building up of national funds would alternatively be used to build up EDIS. The results show that having the same amount of funds, but made available for a single European DGS, could represent a more efficient protection and use of funds than maintaining purely national DGSs. \n\n\n\n3.4.What are the various options to achieve the objectives?\n\n\n3.4.1.Current funding levels in the EDIS design \n\n\nThe assessment shows that EDIS would start on the basis of very heterogeneous funding levels of national DGSs. This implies that EDIS needs to provide liquidity support in its initial phase, as otherwise local DGS would still depend almost exclusively on national alternative funding means. Second, EDIS should be designed in a way that avoids disproportionate advantages for schemes which have not yet started collecting ex-ante funds and avoids disincentives to do so in the future. \n\n\n3.4.2.Scope of EDIS\n\n\nIt is expected that differences in funding levels would no longer be an issue when DGSs have followed their obligations in the DGS Directive to build-up ex-ante funds. The analysis shows that a common system would operate more efficiently, i.e. providing a higher level of protection without the need to increase overall contributions. It would also be better placed to reduce Member States\u2019 exposure to their domestic banking system.  \n\n\n3.4.3.Contributions\n\n\nThe analysis shows that (i) the risk-weighting of contributions changes the distribution of the financial burden among the banks of a given banking sector, (ii) assessing the risk of a given bank relative to the banks of the Banking Union rather than to the banks of the national or DGS\u2019s banking sector is likely to change the level of contribution to be paid by that individual bank. However, no group of banks was identified as being advantaged or disadvantaged. \n\n\nThe likelihood that a DGS may have to mobilise funds to compensate depositors increases with the risk of that bank. Hence the proposal envisages to risk-adjust contributions, i.e. continues the principle already established by the DGS Directive.\n\n\n\nSecond, the analysis shows that the comparison group has an impact on the contributions paid by individual institutions. Therefore, in the reinsurance phase of EDIS, where risks largely remain at the national level, an individual bank\u2019s risk profile is determined relative to the remainder of its national banking system. Once EDIS becomes a system with joint liability at Banking Union level, an individual bank\u2019s risk profile is determined relative to all banks in the Banking Union. This would ensure that EDIS remains cost-neutral overall for banks and national DGSs, and avoid complications in determining banks\u2019 risk profiles in the build-up phase of the Deposit Insurance Fund.\n\n\n\n3.5.Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe proposed Regulation has no consequences for the protection of fundamental rights further than those of the Regulation and Directive that it modifies and which are respectively catered for in the explanatory memoranda of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, establishing a Single Resolution \n\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nConcerning its EDIS-related functions, the Board would be fully financed by administrative contributions from credit institutions affiliated to participating DGSs. In turn, this means that the EDIS-related functions will not necessitate a contribution from the EU budget. The additional human resources of the Board amounting to 22 full-time equivalent units in the form of establishment plan posts, contract agents and Seconded National Experts in year nine, after the phase of full insurance has been reached, mirror the tasks that the proposed Regulation entrusts to it. In the same way as for the creation of the Single Resolution Board, the posts required for the extension of the tasks of this new body fall outside the scope of the 5 % staff reduction target set out in the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council COM(2013) 519 of 10.7.2013.\n\n\nConcerning its EDIS-related functions, the Board would be fully financed by administrative contributions from credit institutions affiliated to participating DGSs. The additional resources of the Board mirror the tasks that the proposed Regulation entrusts to it. \n\n\n5.DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n5.1.A European Deposit Insurance Scheme\n\n\nThis proposal envisages the establishment of EDIS through an amendment of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (SRM Regulation). The rules on the functioning of the SRM would not be modified by this amendment.\n\n\n5.1.1.Gradual evolution of EDIS\n\n\nThe proposed amendment to the SRM Regulation establishes EDIS in three successive stages (Article 2(2)): a reinsurance scheme, a co-insurance scheme and a full insurance scheme. EDIS would be administered by the Board in all stages jointly with participating DGSs or, where a DGS does not administer itself, by the national designated authority responsible to administer the respective participating DGS (Article 2(2) subparagraph 2). The Deposit Insurance Fund is part of EDIS. It would be filled by contributions owed and paid by banks directly to the Board and calculated and invoiced by participating DGSs.\n\n\n5.1.2.Scope of EDIS\n\n\nEDIS applies to all DGSs that are officially recognised in a participating Member State and to all credit institutions affiliated to such schemes. The participating Member States are those whose currency is the euro and those other Member States that have established a close cooperation with the European Central Bank to participate in the SSM (Article 4(1)).\n\n\nAs the cover provided by EDIS is limited to the mandatory functions DGSs have under the Directive, i.e. payouts to depositors and contributions to resolution, EDIS applies to all schemes that may, in principle, encounter payout events or be requested to contribute to a resolution procedure. This includes statutory DGSs, institutional protection schemes (IPSs) and contractual schemes that have been officially recognised by a Member State as DGSs (Article 1(2) of the DGS Directive). Their recognition as DGSs is inseparably linked to their obligations to compensate depositors in case deposits are unavailable and to contribute to resolution procedures. \n\n\nThe rights and obligations that participating DGS have within EDIS are those of the designated authority where the DGS is not administered by a private entity but by the designated authority itself (Article 2(2) subparagraph 2). This takes account of the discretion that Member States have with regard to the introduction, recognition and administration of DGSs at national level (see Article 2(18) of the Directive).\n\n\nIf the close cooperation of a non-Euro Member State is suspended or terminated, the participating DGSs officially recognised in this Member State and the credit institutions affiliated to these DGSs cease to be covered by the SRM Regulation with regard to both the SRM and to EDIS (Article 4). In case of termination only, each of these DGSs is also entitled to a share of the available financial means that the Deposit Insurance Fund disposes of at the time of termination. This entitlement serves to furnish the respective DGS with the funds it needs to meet its funding obligations under the Directive. The share that the respective DGS may claim is subject to a calculation method. With a view to the lower threshold for sufficient funding established by Article 11(5)(a) of the DGS Directive, a DGS cannot claim more from the Deposit Insurance Fund than is necessary for its available financial means to reach two-thirds of its target level. The Board would decide, in agreement with that Member State, on the modalities and conditions for the transfer of funds to the respective DGS within three months.\n\n\n5.1.3.General principles governing EDIS\n\n\nArticle 6 sets out general principles that apply both to the SRM and EDIS. These principles become relevant where the Board or the other public authorities and bodies have discretion in taking a decision or other action. \n\n\nNeither the Board nor a participating DGS may discriminate against entities (including DGSs and their member banks), deposit holders, investors or other creditors established in the Union on grounds of their nationality or place of business (Article 6(1)). This rule is a fundamental principle of Union law and of particular importance in financial markets where transactions between parties of different nationalities and with different places of business are widespread.\n\n\nThe obligation of the Board and participating DGS must undertake every action, proposal or policy with full regard and duty of care for the unity and integrity of the internal market (Article 6(2)). Removing financial fragmentation is a key driver for the Banking Union and authorities administering EDIS need to thoroughly assess the impact of any discretionary action or decision they consider on light of the functioning of the internal market.\n\n\nWhile paragraphs 3 to 5 of Article 6 on the treatment of groups are not applicable in the context of EDIS, Article 6(6) prevents the Board from taking decisions within EDIS that require Member States to provide extraordinary public financial support or that impinge on their budgetary sovereignty and fiscal responsibilities.\n\n\nIn the context of EDIS, the Board may adopt decisions addressed to participating DGSs (Article 74f). Participating DGSs must comply, but Article 6(7) enables them to specify further the measures to be taken, as long as these measures are in compliance with the decision of the Board in question.\n\n\n5.2.The different stages of EDIS\n\n\n\n\nIn all three stages, reinsurance, co-insurance and full insurance, EDIS would both provide funding, and cover losses of participating deposit guarantee schemes. \n\n\nThe funding provided by EDIS addresses the initial liquidity need of a DGS to compensate depositors within the payout deadline set by the Directive (normally seven working days), but also to satisfy the request for contribution to a resolution procedure in time. The funding must be reimbursed by the participating DGS to the Board.\n\n\nEDIS, would, in all stages, also cover losses that the participating DGS ultimately incurs by compensating depositors or contributing to resolution. A participating DGS's ultimate loss is normally smaller than its compensation payments to depositors or its contribution to resolution. After a payout event the DGS may collect on the claims for repayment of (covered) deposits that depositors had against the failed bank and that are transferred to the participating DGS to the extent that it compensated these depositors (Article 9(2), first sentence, of the DGS Directive). Although, if a bank becomes insolvent and therefore these claims are not satisfied in full, any proceeds from the insolvency estate reduce the DGS\u2019s ultimate loss.\n\n\nIf a DGS has contributed to resolution its loss can be lower than the amount of that contribution, in particular if the amount that the DGS owes as a contribution is reduced on the basis of a subsequent valuation (Article 109(1) subparagraph 4 in conjunction with Article 75 of the BRRD).\n\n\nEDIS does not cover losses through additional payments to the participating DGS. Rather, the amount of initial funding that the participating DGS has to repay is reduced by the share of the loss covered by EDIS.\n\n\nThe level of funding provided and the share of loss covered by EDIS increase in each stage. \n\n\n5.2.1.Reinsurance\n\n\nIn the reinsurance phase, which is proposed to last for three years, EDIS may provide limited funding, and cover a limited share of the loss of a participating DGS that encounters a payout event or has been requested to contribute to resolution (Article 41a). \n\n\nIn the initial stage of reinsurance, coverage is limited to resolution proceedings conducted by the Board (Articles 41a(2) and 79). Purely national resolution proceedings are only covered by co-insurance and full insurance.\n\n\n5.2.1.1.Provision of funding in the reinsurance stage\n\n\nFunding in the reinsurance stage would be provided if there is a liquidity shortfall of the participating DGS (Article 41a(2)). The process to establish a liquidity shortfall differs depending on whether (a) the participating DGS encounters a payout event or (b) has to contribute to resolution.\n\n\n(a)In a payout event a participating DGS (Article 41b(1)) has a liquidity shortfall if the amount of covered deposits in the failing bank is larger than the total of (a) the amount of available financial means that the participating DGS should hypothetically have, given the funding path established by Article 41j, and (b) the amount of extraordinary (ex-post) contributions the participating DGS can raise within three days from the payout event.\n\n\nThe amount of covered deposits used to calculate the liquidity shortfall only consists of eligible deposits up to the standard coverage level of 100,000 euro or its equivalent in national currency (Article 6(1) of the DGS Directive). Temporary high balances as defined in Article 6(2) of the DGS Directive or any deductions that the DGS may make in accordance with Articles 7 or 8 of the DGS Directive before compensating depositors are normally not yet known at the time of the payout event and are therefore disregarded. The use of the hypothetical level of available financial means rather than the actual level serves to weaken potential incentive for a participating DGS to fall short of its obligation to raise ex-ante contributions in line with a precise funding path. Finally, extraordinary (ex-post) contributions (Article 10(8) of the Directive), to the extent they can be raised within a very short period, are an additional source of liquidity that could lower the liquidity shortfall of a participating DGS. The three-day period strikes an appropriate balance between the objective to exhaust liquidity resources in the DGS first and the need to compensate depositors within seven working days of the payout event.\n\n\n(b)In a resolution case (Article 41b(2)) the liquidity shortfall is the amount that the participating DGS has to contribute to resolution, less the amount of available financial means that the participating DGS should hypothetically have in place given the funding path established by Article 41j. The hypothetical level of available financial means is the only liquidity resource that the participating DGS needs to tap to reduce its liquidity shortfall. In a resolution case there is no need for the participating DGS to raise short-term ex-post contributions since Article 10(8) of the DGS Directive is limited to payout events.\n\n\nIf the participating DGS has a liquidity shortfall, it may request funding from the Deposit Insurance Fund of up to 20% of that shortfall. The remaining 80% of the liquidity shortfall need to be covered by other funding sources. By applying the hypothetical level of available financial means to calculate the liquidity shortfall, EDIS allows those participating DGSs who, at the time of the payout event, have more available financial means than required to obtain funding from EDIS for their (technical) liquidity shortfall and to use their additional funds to cover (part of) the remaining 80% of their liquidity shortfall. The funding provided by EDIS is capped. \n\n\n5.2.1.2.Loss cover in the reinsurance stage\n\n\nIn its reinsurance stage, in addition to providing funding for a liquidity shortfall, EDIS covers in a second step also 20% of the participating DGS\u2019s excess\u00a0loss. The concept of excess loss differs depending on whether the participating DGS encountered a payout event or was requested to contribute to resolution.\n\n\nIn a payout event (Article 41c(1)) the participating DGS incurs an excess loss if the total amount that it repaid to depositors (Article 8 of the Directive) exceeds the sum of (a) the amount it collected in insolvency proceedings on the deposit claims that it obtained (Article 9(2), first sentence, of the DGS Directive) by compensating depositors, (b) the amount of available financial means that the participating DGS should hypothetically have in place given the  funding path established by Article 41j, and (c) the amount of extraordinary (ex-post) contributions the participating DGS can raise within one year from the payout event.\n\n\nWhile the liquidity shortfall is calculated on the basis of the amount of covered deposits (eligible deposits up to 100,000 euro), the calculation of the excess loss, that is done later in the reinsurance procedure, can be based on the actual amounts repaid to depositors. This amount is reduced by the proceeds from the insolvency estate that the participating DGS has obtained. Moreover, the hypothetical amount of available financial means, which the participating DGS should have had in place at the time of the payout event, is also deducted. Finally, the participating DGS is assumed to have been able to collect the amount of ex-post contributions that it is allowed by the DGS Directive to raise within one year from the payout event. This is 0.5% of the total covered deposits of its member banks (Article 10(8) of the DGS Directive with the ex-post contributions that were raised within a three-day period after the payout event. The resulting amount is the excess loss of the participating DGS.\n\n\nIn a resolution case (Article 41c(2)), the excess loss is the amount that the participating DGS has to contribute to resolution less the sum of:\n\n\n\n\n(a)the amount it may have been reimbursed after a subsequent valuation found out that its contribution should have been lower than initially requested by the resolution authority\n7\n, and \n\n\n(b)the amount of available financial means that the participating DGS should have in place given the funding path established by Article 41j. \n\n\nHere again, there is no need for the participating DGS to raise ex-post contributions since Article 10(8) of the Directive is limited to pay-out events.\n\n\nThe loss cover of 20% of the excess loss is applied by reducing the amount of funding that the participating DGS\u2019s is obliged to repay to EDIS by the amount of loss cover. The loss cover by EDIS is also capped. \n\n\n5.2.2.Co-insurance\n\n\nAfter the initial three-year reinsurance phase, participating DGSs are co-insured by EDIS for a period of four years. Participating DGSs may request both funding and loss cover from the Deposit Insurance Fund in case they encounter a payout event or have been requested to contribute to resolution (Article 41d). EDIS now also provides funding for, and covers losses arising from, contributions to national resolution proceedings.\n\n\nThe difference with the reinsurance phase is that funding is provided and loss is covered as from the \u201cfirst euro\u201d and the share borne by EDIS would gradually increase over the co-insurance period.\n\n\nEDIS provides funding for a percentage of the participating DGSs liquidity need arising from a payout event or a request to contribute to resolution. It also covers the same percentage of the loss the participating DGS ultimately incurs from these events. The share would be 20% in the first year of the co-insurance phase and increases each subsequent year by 20 percentage points, reaching 80% in the last year of co-insurance.\n\n\nIn case of a payout event the liquidity need is equal to the total amount of covered deposits of the failing bank, i.e. eligible deposits up to 100,000 euro (Article 41f(1)). The loss is determined by subtracting the participating DGSs proceeds from the insolvency estate (Article 41g(1)).\n\n\nIn a resolution case the liquidity need is equal to the amount of contribution requested by the Board and the national resolution authority, respectively (Article 41f(2)). The loss is determined by subtracting the difference the participating DGS may have been paid after a subsequent valuation determined that the initial contribution should have been lower (Article 41g(2)).\n\n\nThere would be no cap on the provision of funding or the loss cover. \n\n\n5.2.3.Full insurance\n\n\nAfter the four-year co-insurance phase, participating DGSs would be fully insured by EDIS. Full insurance provides full funding of the liquidity need and covers all losses arising from a payout event or a request to contribute to resolution. The mechanism is the same as in the co-insurance phase, but with EDIS covering a share of 100%.\n\n\n5.2.4.Safeguards for coverage by EDIS\n\n\nThe proposal includes safeguards against incorrect or unwarranted access to EDIS by national DGS. They will be excluded if they have failed to comply with obligations under the Regulation or the national law implementing key provisions of the Directive, or if the respective Member State has failed to correctly implement these Articles (Article 41i). They will only be covered by EDIS if their available financial means amount to at least the harmonised funding path set out in the Regulation (Article 41j). This serves to ensure that only participating DGSs that have observed their own obligations which limit the risk at the level of EDIS may benefit from its protection. The Board can decide to disqualify a participating DGS from EDIS coverage by specific voting requirements.\n\n\n5.3.State aid assessment\n\n\nWhile a DGS\u2019s compensation payments to depositors are not state aid, its contribution to resolution, although intended to ensure that depositors continue to have access to deposits, results in a benefit for the institution under resolution. The contribution may therefore be considered state aid and may require notification and approval from the Commission. Where the contribution is made from funds at the European level (SRF and Deposit Insurance Fund), the state aid procedure applies by analogy (Article 19). \n\n\n5.4.Administration of EDIS\n\n\nEDIS would be administered by the Board together with participating DGS (or the designated authority administering a participating DGS). The procedure can be roughly divided into a phase leading to the provision of funding and a phase after the provision of funding.\n\n\n5.4.1.Procedure leading to funding\n\n\n\n\nParticipating DGSs are required to alert the Board without delay once they become aware of circumstances that are likely to result in a payout event or a request from the resolution authority to contribute to resolution (Article 41i). They must provide the Board with an estimate of the expected liquidity shortfall (reinsurance phase) or liquidity need (co-insurance and full insurance phase). This allows the Board to prepare itself for the immediate provision of funding in case of a payout event or a request to contribute to resolution.\n\n\nParticipating DGSs must notify a payout event or a request to contribute to resolution immediately to the Board (Art 41l). Even if the Board itself requested a contribution to resolution (Article 79), such notification is still formally necessary since the composition of the Board in EDIS is different from its composition in the SRM (see below) and the participating DGS is not required to request funding or loss cover from EDIS. Along with the notification, the participating DGS must provide information to the Board to assess whether the relevant conditions are met (Article 41k):\n\n\n\u2013The amount of covered deposits to calculate the liquidity shortfall or liquidity need. \n\n\n\u2013The available financial means at the time of the payout event or use in resolution to determine which level of available financial means the participating DGS should have at the time of the payout event of use in resolution, given the funding path established by Article 41j.\n\n\n\u2013The estimate of the extraordinary ex-post contributions it can raise within three days from the payout event of use in resolution.\n\n\n\u2013Any other material impediment of the participating DGS to meet its liabilities towards depositors or the resolution authority and possible remedies.\n\n\nThe Board would determine within 24 hours whether the conditions for EDIS, as set out in Article 41a (reinsurance), Article 41d (co-insurance) or Article 41h (full insurance), are met (Art 41l(1). It shall further determine, normally within the same period of time, the amount of funding that it would provide to the participating DGS (Art 41l(2) subparagraph 2).\n\n\nWhere one or more participating DGSs encounter several payout events or uses in resolution (events) simultaneously, the available financial means of the Deposit Insurance Fund may not suffice. In this case the funding that each participating DGS may obtain for each event would be limited by a share of the Deposit Insurance Fund\u2019s available financial means, according to a pro-rata calculation (Article 41l(3).\n\n\nThe Board must immediately inform participating DGSs about whether the conditions for coverage by EDIS are met, and the amount of funding it would provide to the participating DGS. Participating DGSs may, within 24 hours, request a review of the Board\u2019s decision(s) on which the Board shall decide within another 24 hours (Article 41m).\n\n\nFunding would be provided immediately after the Board has determined the amount and will be paid in the form of a cash contribution to the participating DGS (Article 41n). Where the Board increases the amount of funding after having reviewed its initial decision upon request of the participating DGS, that amount shall be due once the Board has adopted its decision on the request for review.\n\n\n5.4.2.Procedure after funding\n\n\nAfter the provision of funding, the Board must determine the excess loss (reinsurance) or loss (co-insurance, full insurance) of the participating DGS, monitor the use of the provided funding for payouts to depositors or for the contribution to resolution, and monitor the participating DGS\u2019s efforts to collect on deposit claims from the insolvency estate.\n\n\nAfter a payout event, the amount of (excess) loss becomes clear over time, as the participating DGS would be raising ex-post contributions and obtaining proceeds from the insolvency estate from time to time. In case of a contribution to resolution, where no ex-post contributions may be raised by the participating DGS and it has no claims for recourse against third parties, the (excess) loss can be determined already after the participating DGS has received the payment of any difference amount it may be entitled to after a subsequent valuation established that the initial contribution should have been lower. Therefore, after a payout event only, the Board must continuously assess the development of the (excess) loss before determining the final (excess) loss. In parallel, the participating DGS shall repay to the Board the funding it has obtained in portions corresponding to the ex-post contributions or proceeds from the insolvency estate as they become available to the participating DGS (Article 41o).\n\n\nThe difference between the initial funding the participating DGS obtains from the Deposit Insurance Fund and the amount of funding it ultimately has to repay to the Board results in the (excess) loss covered by EDIS.\n\n\nAfter a payout event, the Board would also rigorously monitor the payout procedure, and in particular the use of the funding it provided to the participating DGS for that purpose, and how the participating DGS has pursued its deposit claims in the insolvency procedure. The participating DGS is required to provide, at regular intervals established by the Board, accurate, reliable and complete information, in particular on the payout procedure and on the exercise of its subrogated rights in insolvency proceedings. The participating DGS must endeavour to maximise its proceeds from the insolvency estate. Negligent behaviour by the participating DGS may result in claims for damages by the Board, but the Board may, after hearing the participating DGS, also decide to exercise itself all rights arising from deposit claims into which the participating DGS has subrogated. The Board may then collect the proceeds directly for its own account to satisfy its claim for the repayment of the funding provided to the participating DGS (Article 41q)\n\n\n5.5.Financial provisions for EDIS\n\n\nThe functioning of EDIS requires financial resources to cover administrative expenditures and provide the necessary coverage (funding and loss cover) for participating DGSs.\n\n\n5.5.1.General budgetary provisions and administrative contributions \n\n\nThe budget currently contains two parts: Part I for the administration of the Board and Part II for the SRF.\n\n\nAdministrative expenditures of EDIS would be covered by existing administrative contributions that are raised into Part I of the Board\u2019s budget, taking account of the additional administrative burden caused by EDIS and the fact that the scope ratione personae of the SRM and of EDIS are not identical (Article 65(5)).\n\n\n\n\nThe Deposit Insurance Fund would be contained in a new Part III of the Board\u2019s budget. Its structure of revenues and expenditures (Article 60a) corresponds to that of the Part II for the SRF (Article 60) and is further explained in section 5.5.2 below.\n\n\nThe general budgetary provisions (Articles 57, 58, 61 to 64, and 66) also apply to Part III of the budget.\n\n\nThe Board would be responsible to administer both the SRF and the Deposit Insurance Fund and invest their funds according to the rules of the SRM Regulation and delegated acts adopted by the Commission (Article 75).\n\n\n5.5.2.Ex-ante contributions to the Deposit Insurance Fund \n\n\nThe Deposit Insurance Fund Deposit Insurance Fund would be filled by ex-ante contributions that are owed and paid by banks directly to the Board and are calculated and invoiced by participating DGSs on behalf of the Board (Article 74a(1) . These ex-ante contributions are an obligation separate from the obligation to pay ex-ante contributions to participating DGS in accordance with Article 10(1), subparagraph 2, of the DGS Directive. However, in order to achieve cost-neutrality for the banking sector, the ex-ante contributions paid to the Deposit Insurance Fund may be compensated at the level of the participating DGS (see below, section 5.5.2.2).\n8\n\n\n\n5.5.2.1.Target levels of the Deposit Insurance Fund \n\n\nThe available financial means of the Deposit Insurance Fund must reach two subsequent target levels (Article 74b(1) and (2): (a) an initial target level of 20% of four ninth of  the sum of all national minimum target levels by the end of the three-year reinsurance phase and (b) a final target level equal to the sum of the minimum target levels that participating DGSs must reach under the Directive by the end of the four-year co-insurance period. The minimum target levels would be fully harmonised for all participating DGS. Together the minimum target levels of the Deposit Insurance Fund and the participating DGS would increase in a linear way, by one ninth every year in the period until 2024.\n\n\nEx-ante contributions to be paid by banks shall be spread out in time as evenly as possible until the initial or final target level is reached. After the reinsurance period, if the available financial means have been used to provide funding or cover losses and sunk below the initial target level, they must be raised until the target level is reached again.\n\n\nEach year, the ex-ante contributions owed and to be paid by each bank to the Board are determined in two steps: (a) The Board determines the total amount of ex-ante contributions that it may claim from the member banks of each participating DGS (Article 74d(1)). (b) Each participating DGS, based on the relevant total amount determined by the Board, then calculates the contribution owed and to be paid by each of its member banks (Article 74d(2)) and invoices this amount on behalf of the Board.\n\n\nDuring the reinsurance phase, the risk-based ex-ante contribution of each member bank has to pay to the Deposit Insurance Fund would be calculated by the participating DGS in relation to all of its other member banks. After the reinsurance phase, the risk-based ex-ante contributions of each bank would be calculated in relation to all banks within the scope of EDIS. This would be done by the Board, with the assistance of participating DGSs, and on the basis of a set of risk-based methods established by a Commission delegated act.\n\n\nThe ex-ante contribution invoiced by the participating DGS on behalf of the Board must be paid by the bank directly to the Board, which would credit the amount to the Deposit Insurance Fund (and as revenue in Part III of its budget).\n\n\n5.5.2.2.Compensation at the level of participating DGSs\n\n\nThis proposal enables participating Member States to achieve cost-neutrality for the member banks of their participating DGSs. They may decide that the creation of a separate obligation by banks to pay ex-ante contributions to the Deposit Insurance Fund justifies compensation at the level of the participating DGS. In taking this decision, Member States need to pay due regard to the principle of proportionality and to consider whether the level of deposit protection that is being built up by the evolving establishment of EDIS justifies a reduction of financial resources for deposit protection at the level of the participating DGS.\n\n\nCost-neutrality is provided for in Article 74c(4): (a) The ex-ante contributions banks pay to the Deposit Insurance Fund count towards the target level that the respective participating DGS needs to reach under the Directive; (b) if, by the end of the built-up phase (3 July 2024 or later), a national DGS has complied with the precise funding path (Art. 41j) and its member banks have paid all contributions that were due to the DIF, these contributions constitute the amount of contributions necessary to reach the national target level of 0.8%; and (c) participating Member States may allow their DGSs to consider the contributions that their member banks paid to EDIS when calculating the level of contributions and/or to reimburse their member banks from their available financial means to the extent these exceed the amounts set out in the precise funding path.\n\n\nDepending on the level of available financial means the participating DGS has already raised, it may either compensate its member banks through lower contributions or through reimbursing contributions it already received from its member banks.\n\n\n5.5.3.Extraordinary ex-post contributions \n\n\nAs from the start of the co-insurance phase, the Board may also claim payment of extraordinary ex-post contributions from the banks affiliated to participating DGSs when the Deposit Insurance Fund\u2019s available means are insufficient for funding and loss cover. National DGS would remain responsible for raising ex-post contributions from the national banking sector to replenish their national system following a pay-out event or a resolution contribution. \n\n\nEx-post contributions are owed and paid by banks directly to the Board and, during the co-insurance period, calculated and invoiced by the respective participating DGS on behalf of the Board. The Board determines the total amount of ex-post contributions it may claim from the member banks of each participating DGS within the limits established by a Commission delegated act. Participating DGS calculate the ex-post contribution owed by each of their member bank on the basis of the total amount determined by the Board, applying the same risk-based method it applies to calculate the ex-ante contribution under Article 10(1) of the Directive.\n\n\nAfter the co-insurance phase, the ex-post contribution owed by each bank is calculated by the Board on the basis of the risk-based methods established by the Commission delegated act that is also applied to calculate the ex-ante contributions after the co-insurance phase. Participating DGSs invoice the ex-post contribution on behalf of the Board.\n\n\nBoth in the co-insurance and full insurance phases the Board may, on its own initiative or upon proposal by the relevant competent authority, defer the payment of the ex-post contribution by an individual bank in full or in part. The deferral must be necessary to protect the financial position of the bank, may not last longer than six month, but can be renewed on request of the bank.\n\n\n\n\nA Commission delegated act will set the maximum amounts that can be raised by EDIS ex-post, taking into account the national ex-post contributions. \n\n\n5.5.4.Additional financial sources for the Deposit Insurance Fund \n\n\nIn additional to raising ex-ante and ex-post contributions, the Board may contract additional financial sources for the Deposit Insurance Fund. Gradually replacing the funding at the level of participating DGSs, it may request a loan from deposit-guarantee schemes recognised in non-participating Member States which may decide on such request in accordance with Article 12 of the Directive (Article 74g). To achieve reciprocity the Board may, in turn, also decide to grant loans to deposit-guarantee schemes in non-participating Member States.\n\n\nThe Board may also contract for the Deposit Insurance Fund other alternative funding means from third parties in particular if funds the Board can raise by ex-ante contributions and ex-post contributions are not (immediately) available (Article 74h). Repayable funding means shall be recouped by raising ex-ante and ex-post contributions during the maturity period.\n\n\n5.5.5.EDIS - Decision-making \n\n\nEDIS would be administered by the Board, both in its executive and plenary session. The executive session would be composed of the same members for both EDIS- and SRM-related decisions and tasks. The special tasks of EDIS would require a special composition of the plenary session for decisions that relate to EDIS only. Members representing national resolution authorities in the plenary session would be replaced by members representing national designated authorities.\n\n\nThe plenary session would have specific tasks attributed to it.\n\n\nAs some Board decisions are relevant for the Board as a whole or for both the SRM and EDIS, they would be taken in a new joint plenary session with specific representatives and voting procedures.\n\n\nAll other decisions on EDIS would be adopted in the Board\u2019s executive session.\n\n\n5.6.Other rules\n\n\nProvisions on specific subject-matter that apply to the SRM would also apply to the Board when exercising its functions within EDIS: privileges and immunities, language arrangements, staff and staff exchange, internal committees, appeals panel, actions before the court of justice, liability of the Board, professional secrecy and exchange of information, data protection, access to documents, security rules on sensitive or classified information, court of auditors.\n\n\nThe amendments introducing EDIS would be applied as from the entry into force of the amending Regulation. \n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Regulation (EU) 806/2014 in order to establish a European Deposit Insurance Scheme\n\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank\n9\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n10\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Over the past years, the Union has made progress in creating an internal market for banking services. A better integrated internal market for banking services is essential in order to foster economic growth in the Union, to safeguard the stability of the banking system and to protect depositors. \n\n\n(2)On 18 October 2012, the European Council concluded that \"In the light of the fundamental challenges facing it, the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) needs to be strengthened to ensure economic and social welfare as well as stability and sustained prosperity\" and \"that the process towards deeper economic and monetary union should build on the Union institutional and legal framework and be characterised by openness and transparency towards Member States whose currency is not the euro and by respect for the integrity of the internal market\". To that end, the Banking Union has been established, underpinned by a comprehensive and detailed single rulebook for financial services for the internal market as a whole. The process towards establishing the Banking Union has been characterised by openness and transparency towards non-participating Member States and by respect for the integrity of the internal market.\n\n\n(3)The European Parliament, in its resolution of 20 November 2012 'Towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union', also stated that breaking the negative feedback loops between sovereigns, banks and the real economy is crucial for a smooth functioning of the EMU, stressed the urgent need for additional and far-reaching measures for the realisation of a fully operational Banking Union, while ensuring the continued proper functioning of the internal market for financial services and the free movement of capital. \n\n\n(4)While key steps have been made towards ensuring the efficient functioning of the Banking Union, with the Single Supervisory Mechanism (the 'SSM') established by Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013\n11\n ensuring that the Union's policy relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions in the euro area Member States and those non euro area Member States who choose to participate in the SSM (the 'participating Member States') is implemented in a coherent and effective manner and with the Single Resolution Mechanism (the \u2018SRM\u2019)  established by Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 ensuring a consistent framework for the resolution of banks that are failing or likely to fail in the participating Member States, further steps are still needed to complete the Banking Union.\n\n\n(5)In June 2015, the Five Presidents Report on Completing Europe\u2019s Economic and Monetary Union pointed out that a single banking system can only be truly single if confidence in the safety of bank deposits is the same irrespective of the Member State in which a bank operates. This requires single bank supervision, single bank resolution and single deposit insurance. The Five Presidents report therefore proposed to complete the Banking Union by establishing a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), the third pillar of a fully-fledged Banking Union alongside bank supervision and resolution. Concrete steps in that direction should already be taken as a priority, with a re-insurance system at the European level for the national deposit guarantee schemes as a first step towards a fully mutualised approach. The scope of this reinsurance system should coincide with that of the SSM.\n\n\n(6)The recent crisis has shown that the functioning of the internal market may be under threat and that there is an increasing risk of financial fragmentation. The failure of a bank that is relatively large compared to the national banking sector or the concurrent failure of a part of the national banking sector may cause national DGSs to be vulnerable to large local shocks, even with the additional funding mechanisms provided by Directive 2014/49/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n12\n. This vulnerability of national DGSs to large local shocks can contribute to adverse feedback between banks and their national sovereign undermining the homogeneity of protection for deposits and contributing to a lack of confidence among depositors and resulting in market instability.\n\n\n(7)The absence of a homogenous level of depositor protection can distort competition and create an effective barrier for the freedoms of establishment and free provision of services by credit institutions within the internal market. A common deposit insurance scheme is therefore essential for the completion of the internal market in financial services.\n\n\n(8)Although Directive 2014/49/EU significantly improves the capacity of national schemes to compensate depositors, more efficient deposit guarantee arrangements are needed at the level of the Banking Union to ensure sufficient financial means to underpin the confidence of all depositors and thereby safeguard financial stability. EDIS would increase the resilience of the Banking Union against future crises by sharing risk more widely and would offer equal protection for insured depositors, supporting the proper functioning of the internal market. \n\n\n(9)Funds used by deposit guarantee schemes to repay depositors for unavailable covered deposits in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2014/49/EU on deposit guarantee schemes do not constitute State aid or Fund aid. However, where those funds are used in the restructuring of credit institutions and constitute State aid or Fund aid, they must comply with Article 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, respectively, with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n13\n, which should be amended for that purpose.\n\n\n(10)Despite the further harmonisation introduced by the Directive 2014/49/EU, national DGSs retain certain options and discretions, including with respect to certain essential elements like target levels, risk factors to be applied when assessing credit institutions\u2019 contributions, repayment periods or the use of funds. Those differences between national rules may obstruct the free provision of services and create distortions of competition. In a highly integrated banking sector, uniformity of rules and approaches is needed to ensure a consistently robust level of protection of depositors throughout the Union and so guarantee the objective of financial stability.\n\n\n(11)The establishment of an EDIS, with decision-making, monitoring and enforcement powers centralised and entrusted to the Single Resolution and Deposit Insurance Board (\"the Board\"), will be essential in achieving the objective of a harmonised deposit guarantee framework. The uniform application of the deposit guarantee requirements in the participating Member States will be enhanced as a result of it being entrusted to such a central authority. In this way, the operation of EDIS should facilitate, by supporting and providing a framework for the establishment and subsequent implementation of uniform rules on deposit guarantee arrangements, the harmonisation process in the field of financial services.\n\n\n(12)Furthermore, EDIS is part of the wider EU rules harmonising prudential supervision and recovery and resolution, which are complementary aspects of the internal market for banking services. Supervision can only be effective and meaningful if an adequate deposit insurance scheme, corresponding to the developments in the field of supervision, is created. EDIS is therefore instrumental to a wider process of harmonisation and its objectives are closely linked to the Union framework on prudential supervision and recovery and resolution whose centralised application are mutually dependant. For instance, adequate coordination at the level of supervision and deposit guarantee is needed in cases where the European Central Bank (ECB) envisages withdrawing an authorisation to a credit institution or where a credit institution does not comply with the obligation to be a member of a DGS. A similar high level of integration is needed between the resolution actions and the deposit insurance tasks attributed to the Board.\n\n\n(13)This Regulation applies only in respect of banks whose home supervisor is the ECB or the national competent authority in Member States whose currency is the euro or in Member States whose currency is not the euro which have established a close cooperation in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013. The scope of application of this Regulation is linked to the scope of application of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013. Indeed, bearing in mind the significant level to which the supervisory tasks attributed to the SSM and deposit guarantee actions are interwoven, the establishment of a centralised system of supervision operated under Article 127(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is fundamentally important to the process of harmonisation of deposit guarantee in participating Member States. The fact of being subject to supervision by the SSM constitutes a specific attribute that places the entities falling within the scope of application of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 in an objectively and characterised distinct position for deposit guarantee purposes. It is necessary to adopt measures to create a single deposit insurance scheme for all Member States participating in the SSM in order to facilitate the proper and stable functioning of the internal market.\n\n\n(14)In order to ensure parallelism with the SSM and the SRM, EDIS should apply to participating Member States. Banks established in the Member States not participating in the SSM should not be subject to EDIS. As long as supervision in a Member State remains outside the SSM, that Member State should remain responsible for ensuring the protection of depositors against the consequences of the insolvency of a credit institution. As Member States join the SSM, they should also automatically become subject to the EDIS. Ultimately, the EDIS could potentially extend to the entire internal market.\n\n\n(15)In order to ensure a level playing field within the internal market as a whole, this Regulation is consistent with Directive 2014/49/EU. It complements the rules and principles of that Directive to ensure the proper functioning of EDIS and that appropriate funding is available to the latter. The material law on deposit guarantee to be applied within the EDIS framework will therefore be consistent with the one applicable by the national DGSs or designated authorities of the non-participating Member States, harmonised through the Directive 2014/49/EU.\n\n\n(16)In integrated financial markets, any financial support to reimburse depositors enhances the financial stability not only in the participating Member State concerned but also in other Member States, by preventing any spill-over of bank crises into non-participating Member States. The conferral of deposit insurance tasks to the Board should not in any way hamper the functioning of the internal market for financial services. The European Banking Authority (EBA) should therefore maintain its role and retain its existing powers and tasks: it should develop and contribute to the consistent application of the Union legislation applicable to all Member\u00a0States and enhance convergence of deposit guarantee practices across the Union as a whole. \n\n\n\n\n(17)EDIS should progressively evolve from a reinsurance scheme into a fully mutualised co-insurance scheme over a number of years. In the context of efforts to deepen the EMU, together with the work on the establishment of bridge-financing arrangements for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) and on developing a common fiscal backstop, this step is necessary to reduce the bank/sovereign links in individual Member States by means of steps towards risk sharing among all the Member States in the Banking Union, and thereby to reinforce the Banking Union in achieving its key objective. However, such risk sharing implied by steps to reinforce Banking Union must proceed in parallel with risk reducing measures designed to break the bank-sovereign link more directly. \n\n\n(18)EDIS should be established in three sequential stages, first a reinsurance scheme that covers a share of the liquidity shortfall and of the excess losses of participating DGSs, followed by a co-insurance scheme that covers a gradually increasing share of the liquidity shortfall and losses of participating DGSs and eventually resulting in a full insurance scheme that covers all liquidity needs and losses of participating deposit guarantee schemes.\n\n\n(19)In the reinsurance stage, and in order to limit the liability for the European Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cthe Deposit Insurance Fund\u201d) and to reduce moral hazard risk at the national level, assistance from the Deposit Insurance Fund can only be requested if the national DGS has raised ex-ante contributions in accordance with a precise funding path, and if it first depletes these funds. However, to the extent that a national DGS has collected funds over and above that which is required by the funding path, it only needs to use up the funds it had to collect to comply with the funding path before being able to receive coverage by EDIS. Therefore, DGSs which have collected more funds than is needed to comply with the funding path should not be in a worse position than those which have collected funds not exceeding the levels set out in the funding path. \n\n\n(20)As the Deposit Insurance Fund, in the re-insurance stage, would only provide an additional source of funding and would only weaken the link between banks and their national sovereign, without however ensuring that all depositors in the Banking Union enjoy an equal level of protection, the reinsurance stage should, after three years, gradually progress into a co-insurance scheme and ultimately into a fully mutualised deposit insurance scheme.\n\n\n(21)While the reinsurance and coinsurance stages would share many common features, ensuring a smooth gradual evolution, pay-outs under the co-insurance stage would be shared between national DGS and the Deposit Insurance Fund as of the first euro of loss. The relative contribution from the Deposit Insurance Fund would gradually increase to 100 percent, resulting in the full mutualisation of depositor risk across the Banking Union after four years. \n\n\n(22)Safeguards should be built into EDIS so as to limit moral hazard risk and to ensure that the coverage by EDIS is only provided where nationals DGSs act in a prudent manner. Firstly, national DGSs should comply with their obligations under this Regulation, the Directive 2014/49/EU and other relevant EU law, in particular their obligation to build up their funds in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 2014/49/EU as further specified in this Regulation. In order to benefit from coverage by EDIS, participating DGSs need to raise ex-ante contributions in accordance with a precise funding path. This also implies that the possibility of a target level reduction in accordance with Article 10(6) of Directive 2014/49/EU is no longer available if the DGS wants to benefit from EDIS. Secondly, in case of a pay-out event or where its funds are used in resolution, a national DGS should bear a fair share of the loss themselves. It should therefore be required to collect ex-post contributions from its members to replenish its fund and to repay EDIS to the extent that the initially received funding exceeds the share of loss to be borne by EDIS. Thirdly, following a pay-out event, the national DGS should maximise the proceeds from the insolvency estate and repay the Board and the Board should have sufficient powers to safeguards its rights. Fourthly, the Board should have the powers to recover all or part of funding in case of a participating DGS did not comply with key obligations. \n\n\n(23)The Deposit Insurance Fund is an essential element without which the progressive establishment of EDIS could not be achieved. Different national systems of funding would not provide for homogenous deposit insurance across the Banking Union. Throughout the three stages, the Deposit Insurance Fund should help ensuring the stabilising role of DGSs, a uniform high level of protection to all depositors in a harmonised framework throughout the Union and avoiding the creation of obstacles for the exercise of fundamental freedoms or the distortion of competition in the internal market due to different levels of protection at national level. \n\n\n(24)The Deposit Insurance Fund should be financed by direct contributions from banks. Decisions taken within the EDIS, requiring the use of the Deposit Insurance Fund or of a national deposit guarantee scheme should not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of the Member States. In that regard, only extraordinary public financial support should be considered to be an impingement on the budgetary sovereignty and fiscal responsibilities of the Member States.\n\n\n(25)This Regulation establishes the modalities for the use of the Deposit Insurance Fund and the general criteria to determine the fixing and calculation of ex ante and ex post contributions and lays down the powers of the Board for using and managing the Deposit Insurance Fund.\n\n\n(26)Contributions would be directly levied on banks to finance the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Board would collect the contributions and administer the Deposit Insurance Fund, while national DGSs would continue to collect national contributions and administer national funds. In order to ensure fair and harmonised contributions for participating banks and provide incentives to operate under a model which presents less risk, both contributions to EDIS and to national DGS should be calculated on the basis of covered deposits and a risk-adjustment factor per bank. During the re-insurance period the risk-adjustment factor should consider the degree of risk incurred by a bank relative to all other banks affiliated to the same participating DGS. Once the stage of co-insurance is reached, the risk-adjustment factor should consider the degree of risk incurred by a bank relative to all other banks established in the participating Member States. This would ensure that, overall, EDIS is cost-neutral for banks and national DGSs and avoid any redistribution of contributions during the build-up phase of the Deposit Insurance Fund. \n\n\n(27)In principle, contributions should be collected from the industry prior to, and independently of, any deposit insurance action. When prior funding is insufficient to cover the losses or costs incurred by the use of the Deposit Insurance Fund, additional contributions should be collected to bear the additional cost or loss. Moreover, the Deposit Insurance Fund should be able to contract borrowings or other forms of support from credit institutions, financial institutions or other third parties in the event that the ex-ante and ex post contributions are not immediately accessible or do not cover the expenses incurred by the use of the Deposit Insurance Fund in relation to deposit insurance actions.\n\n\n(28)In order to reach a critical mass and to avoid pro-cyclical effects which would arise if the Deposit Insurance Fund had to rely solely on ex post contributions in a systemic crisis, it is indispensable that the ex-ante available financial means of the Deposit Insurance Fund amount at least to a certain minimum target level.\n\n\n(29)The initial and final target level of the Deposit Insurance Fund should be established as a percentage of the total minimum target levels of participating DGS. It should progressively reach 20% of four ninth of the total minimum target levels by the end of the reinsurance period and the sum of all minimum target levels by the end of the co-insurance period. The possibility to apply for approval to authorise a lower target level in accordance with Article 10(6) of Directive 2014/49/EU should not be considered when setting the initial or final target levels of the Deposit Insurance Fund. An appropriate time frame should be set to reach the target level for the Deposit Insurance Fund.\n\n\n(30)Ensuring effective and sufficient financing of the Deposit Insurance Fund is of paramount importance to the credibility of EDIS. The capacity of the Board to contract alternative funding means for the Deposit Insurance Fund should be enhanced in a manner that optimises the cost of funding and preserves the creditworthiness of the Deposit Insurance Fund. Immediately after the entry into force of this Regulation, the necessary steps should be taken by the Board in cooperation with the participating Member States to develop the appropriate methods and modalities permitting the enhancement of the borrowing capacity of the Deposit Insurance Fund that should be in place by the date of application of this Regulation.\n\n\n(31)It is necessary to ensure that the Deposit Insurance Fund is fully available for the purpose of ensuring the guarantee of deposits. Therefore, the Deposit Insurance Fund should primarily be used for the efficient implementation of deposit guarantee requirements and actions. Furthermore, it should be used only in accordance with the applicable deposit guarantee objectives and principles. Under certain conditions, the Deposit Insurance Fund could also provide funding where the available financial means of a DGS are used in resolution in accordance with Article 79 of this Regulation.\n\n\n(32)In order to protect the value of the amounts held in the Deposit Insurance Fund, those amounts should be invested in sufficiently safe, diversified and liquid assets.\n\n\n(33)Where close cooperation with the ECB of a participating Member State whose currency is not the euro is terminated in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, a fair partition of the cumulated contributions of the participating Member State concerned should be decided taking into account the interests of the participating Member State concerned and the Deposit Insurance Fund.\n\n\n(34)In order to guarantee its full autonomy and independence when undertaking deposit insurance actions under this Regulation, the Board should have an autonomous budget with revenues from obligatory contributions from the institutions in the participating Member States. This Regulation should be without prejudice to the ability of Member States to levy fees to cover the administrative expenses of their national DGSs or designated authorities.\n\n\n(35)The Board, where all the criteria relating to the use of the Deposit Insurance Fund are met, should provide the relevant funding and loss cover to the national DGS. \n\n\n(36)The Board should operate in joint-plenary, plenary and executive sessions. The Board, in its executive session, should prepare all decisions concerning pay-out procedures and, to the fullest extent possible, adopt those decisions. Regarding the use of the Deposit Insurance Fund, it is important that there is no first-mover advantage and that the outflows of the Deposit Insurance Fund are monitored. Once the net accumulated use of the Deposit Insurance Fund in the previous consecutive 12 months reaches the threshold of 25% of the final target level, the plenary session should evaluate the application of the deposit insurance actions or the participations in resolution actions and the use of the Deposit Insurance Fund, and should provide guidance which the executive session should follow in subsequent decisions. Guidance to the executive session should, in particular, focus on ensuring the non-discriminatory application of deposit insurance actions or participation in resolution actions, on measures to be taken to avoid a depletion of the Deposit Insurance Fund.\n\n\n\n\n(37)The efficiency and uniformity of deposit insurance actions should be ensured in all of the participating Member States. For that purpose, where a participating DGS has not applied or has not complied with a decision by the Board pursuant to this Regulation or has applied it in a way which poses a threat to any of the deposit insurance scheme's objectives or to the efficient implementation of the deposit insurance action, the Board should be empowered to order any necessary action which significantly addresses the concern or threat to the EDIS objectives. Any action by a participating DGS that would restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of the Board should be excluded. \n\n\n(38)When making decisions or taking actions, in particular regarding entities established both in participating Member States and in non-participating Member States, possible adverse effects on those Member States, such as threats to the financial stability of their financial markets, and on the entities established in those Member States, should also be taken into consideration.\n\n\n(39)The Board, the designated authorities, the competent authorities, including the ECB, and the resolution authorities should, where necessary, conclude a memorandum of understanding describing in general terms how they will cooperate with one another in the performance of their respective tasks under Union law. The memorandum should be reviewed on a regular basis.\n\n\n(40)The relevant entities, bodies and authorities involved in the application of this Regulation should cooperate with each other in accordance with the duty of sincere cooperation enshrined in the Treaties.\n\n\n(41)The Board and the designated authorities and competent authorities of the non-participating Member States should also conclude memoranda of understanding describing in general terms how they will cooperate with one another in the performance of their tasks under Directive 2014/49/EU. The memoranda of understanding could, inter alia, clarify the consultation relating to decisions of the Board that have effect on branches located in the non-participating Member States, where the credit institution is established in a participating Member State. The memoranda should be reviewed on a regular basis.\n\n\n(42)The procedure relating to the adoption of decisions by the Board respects the principle of delegation of powers to agencies as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union. \n\n\n(43)This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the rights, freedoms and principles recognised in particular by the Charter, and, in particular, the right to property, the protection of personal data, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial and the right of defence, and should be implemented in accordance with those rights and principles.\n\n\n(44)Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely setting up a more efficient and effective deposit guarantee framework and ensuring the consistent application of deposit guarantee rules, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather be better achieved at the Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n\n(45)The Commission should review the application of this Regulation in order to assess its impact on the internal market and to determine whether any modifications or further developments are needed in order to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of the EDIS.\n\n\n(46)In order for EDIS to function in an effective manner as of [\u2026.], the provisions concerning the payment of contributions to the Deposit Insurance Fund, the establishment of all the relevant procedures and any other operational and institutional aspects should apply from XX.\n\n\n(47)Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 should be amended to incorporate and respectively take into account the establishment of EDIS,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) No 806/2014\n\n\nRegulation (EU) 806/2014 is amended as follows:\n\n\n1.the title is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"REGULATION (EU) No 806/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 July 2014 on a Single Resolution Mechanism and a European Deposit Insurance Scheme and amending Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010\";\n\n\n2.Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cArticle 1\nSubject matter\n\n\n1.This Regulation establishes uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of the entities referred to in Article\u00a02 that are established in the participating Member States referred to in Article 4.\n\n\nThose uniform rules and that uniform procedure shall be applied by the Single Resolution Board established in accordance with Article 42 (the \u2018Board\u2019), together with the Council and the Commission and the national resolution authorities within the framework of the Single Resolution Mechanism (\u2018SRM\u2019) established by this Regulation. The SRM shall be supported by a Single Resolution Fund (the 'SRF'\u2019).\n\n\nThe use of the SRF shall be contingent upon the entry into force of an agreement among the participating Member States (\u2018the Agreement\u2019) on transferring the funds raised at national level towards the SRF as well as on a progressive merger of the different funds raised at national level to be allocated to national compartments of the Fund.\n\n\n2.In addition, this Regulation establishes a European Deposit Insurance Scheme ('EDIS') in three successive stages:\n\n\n\u2013a reinsurance scheme that, to a certain extent, provides funding and covers a share of the losses of participating deposit guarantee schemes in accordance with Article 41a;\n\n\n\u2013a co-insurance scheme that, to a gradually increasing extent, provides funding and covers losses of participating deposit guarantee schemes in accordance with Article 41c;\n\n\n\u2013a full insurance scheme that provides the funding and covers the losses of participating deposit guarantee schemes in accordance with Article 41e.\n\n\nEDIS shall be administered by the Board in cooperation with participating DGSs and designated authorities in accordance with Part IIa.

In the event that the close cooperation with the ECB of a Member\u00a0State whose currency is not the euro is terminated in accordance with Article\u00a07 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01024/2013, the Board shall decide within three months after the date of adoption of the decision to terminate close cooperation, in agreement with that Member\u00a0State, on the modalities for, and any conditions applicable to: \n\n\n(a)the recoupment of contributions that the Member\u00a0State concerned has transferred to the SRF;\n\n\n(b)the transfer of contributions to DGSs officially recognised in the Member State concerned that were paid into the DIF by the credit institutions affiliated to those DGSs.\n\n\nFor the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph, recoupments shall include the part of the compartment corresponding to the Member\u00a0State concerned not subject to mutualisation.

The Board's activities under this Regulation may under no circumstances engage the budgetary liability of the Member States.\n\n\nArticle 74b\nTarget levels of the Deposit Insurance Fund\n\n\n1.By the end of the reinsurance period the available financial means of the DIF shall reach an initial target level of 20% of four ninth of the sum of the minimum target levels that participating DGSs shall reach in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 10(2) of Directive 2014/49/EU.\n\n\n2.By the end of the co-insurance period the available financial means of the DIF shall reach the sum of the minimum target levels that participating DGSs shall reach under the first subparagraph of Article 10(2) of Directive 2014/49/EU.\n\n\n3.During the reinsurance and co-insurance periods contributions to the DIF calculated in accordance with Article 74c shall be spread out in time as evenly as possible until the respective target level is reached.\n\n\n4.After the target level specified in paragraph 2 has been reached for the first time and where the available financial means have subsequently been reduced to less than two-thirds of the target level, the contributions calculated in accordance with Article 74c shall be set at a level allowing to reach the target level within six years.\n\n\n5.The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 93 to specify the following:\n\n\n(a)criteria for the spreading out in time of the contributions to the DIF calculated under paragraph 2;\n\n\n(b)criteria for establishing the annual contributions provided for in paragraph 4.\n\n\nArticle 74c\nEx-ante contributions\n\n\n1.Each year during the reinsurance and co-insurance period, the Board shall, after consulting the ECB and the national competent authority and in close cooperation with the participating DGSs and designated authorities, determine for each participating DGS the total amount of ex-ante contributions that it may claim from the credit institutions affiliated to the respective participating DGS in order to reach the target levels provided for in Article 74b. The total amount of contributions shall not exceed the target levels provided for in Article 74b (1) and (2).\n\n\n2. During the reinsurance period each participating DGS shall calculate, on the basis of the total amount determined by the Board under paragraph 1, the contribution of each credit institution affiliated to it. It shall apply the risk-based method established by the delegated act according to the second subparagraph of paragraph 5.\n\n\nAfter the reinsurance period, the Board itself shall calculate the contribution of each credit institution affiliated to a participating DGS. The Board shall apply the risk-based method established by the delegated act according to the third subparagraph of paragraph 5.\n\n\nIn all stages of EDIS the participating DGS shall invoice, on behalf of the Board, the contribution of each credit institution on an annual basis. Credit institutions shall pay the invoiced amount directly to the Board. The contributions shall become due on 31 May of each year.\n\n\n3.The duly received contributions of each credit institution referred to in Article 2(2) shall not be reimbursed to those entities.\n\n\n4.The contributions that credit institutions affiliated to a participating DGS pay into the DIF in accordance with this Article shall count towards the minimum target level that the participating DGS shall reach in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 10(2) of Directive 2014/49/EU. If the participating DGS, by 3 July 2024 or any later date, has followed the funding path set out in Article 41j and credit institutions affiliated to it paid to the DIF all ex-ante contributions that, until 3 July 2024, had to be paid to the DIF, these contributions shall constitute the full contribution owed in order to reach the target level in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 10(2) of Directive 2014/49/EU.\n\n\nMember States may provide that a participating DGS may consider the contributions that credit institutions affiliated to it paid into the DIF when setting the level of their ex-ante contributions or may reimburse these credit institutions from its available financial means to the extent they exceed the amounts set out in Article 41j on the relevant date.\n\n\n5.The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 93 in order to specify a risk-based method for the calculation of contributions in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article.\n\n\nIt shall adopt one delegated act specifying the method for the calculation of contributions payable to participating DGSs and, for the reinsurance period only, to the DIF. In this delegated act the calculation shall be based on the amount of covered deposits and the degree of risk incurred by each credit institution relative to all other credit institutions affiliated to the same participating DGS. \n\n\n\n\nIt shall adopt a second delegated act specifying the method for the calculation of the contributions payable to the DIF as from the co-insurance period. In this second delegated act the calculation shall be based on the amount of covered deposits and the degree of risk incurred by each credit institution relative to all other credit institutions referred to in point (b) of Article 2(2).\n\n\nBoth delegated acts shall include a calculation formula, specific indicators, risk classes for members, thresholds for risk weights assigned to specific risk classes, and other necessary elements. The degree of risk shall be assessed on the basis of the following criteria:\n\n\n(a)the level of loss absorbing capacity of the institution;\n\n\n(b)the institution\u2019s ability to meet its short- and long-term obligations;\n\n\n(c)the stability and variety of the institutions sources of funding and its unencumbered highly liquid assets\u2019;\n\n\n(d)the quality of the institution\u2019s assets;\n\n\n(e)the institution\u2019s business model and management;\n\n\n(f)the degree to which the institution\u2019s assets are encumbered.\n\n\n\nArticle 74d\nExtraordinary ex-post contributions\n\n\n1.Where, after the reinsurance period, the available financial means are not sufficient to cover the losses, costs or other expenses incurred by the DIF following a payout event, extraordinary ex-post contributions from the credit institutions affiliated to participating DGSs shall be raised in order to cover the additional amounts. Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3, the amount of ex-post contributions to be raised shall be equal to the shortfall of available financial means but shall not exceed the maximum share of total covered deposits of all credit institutions within the scope of EDIS laid down by delegated act of the Commission in accordance with paragraph 5.\n\n\n2.The Board shall itself calculate the contribution of each credit-institution affiliated to each participating DGS. It shall apply the risk-based method specified in the delegated act adopted by the Commission in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 74c(5).\n\n\nThe third subparagraph of Article 74c(2) shall apply by analogy.\n\n\n3.The Board shall, on its own initiative after consulting the relevant competent authority, or upon proposal by the relevant competent authority, defer, in whole or in part, in accordance with the delegated acts referred to in paragraph 4, an institution's payment of extraordinary ex-post contributions if it is necessary to protect its financial position. Such a deferral shall not be granted for a period of longer than six months but may be renewed on request of the institution. The contributions deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be made later at a point in time when the payment no longer jeopardises the institution's financial position.\n\n\n4.The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 93 to specify the annual limits referred to in paragraph 1 and the circumstances and conditions under which the payment of ex-post contributions by an entity referred to in point (b) of Article 2(2) may be partially or entirely deferred pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article.\n\n\nArticle 74e\nImplementation of decisions under this Regulation\n\n\n1.The participating DGS shall take the necessary action to implement decisions referred to in this Regulation.\n\n\nSubject to this Regulation, the participating DGS shall exercise its powers under national law transposing the Directive 2014/49/EU and in accordance with the conditions laid down in national law. The participating DGS shall fully inform the Board of the exercise of those powers.\n\n\n2.Where a participating DGS has not applied or has not complied with a decision by the Board pursuant to this Regulation or has applied it in a way which poses a threat to the efficient implementation of EDIS and to the objectives of this Regulation, the Board may order the participating DGS to adopt any necessary action to comply with the decision in question.\n\n\n3.Where a participating DGS addressed a decision to a credit institution affiliated to it, including the invoicing of contributions, and the credit institution has intentionally or negligently not complied with that decision, the Board shall take a decision imposing a fine on the credit institution in accordance with Article 38.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 74f\nVoluntary lending to and borrowing from non-participating DGS\n\n\n1.The Board shall decide to make a request to borrow for the DIF from deposit guarantee schemes within non-participating Member States in the event that:\n\n\n(a)the amounts raised under Article 74c are not sufficient to cover the losses, costs or other expenses incurred by the use of the DIF in relation to resolution actions;\n\n\n(b)the extraordinary ex-post contributions provided for in Article 74d are not immediately accessible; \n\n\n(c)the alternative funding means provided for in Article 74g are not immediately accessible on reasonable terms.\n\n\n2.Those deposit guarantee schemes shall decide on such a request in accordance with Article 12 of Directive 2014/49/EU.\n\n\n3.The Board may decide to lend to other deposit guarantee schemes within non-participating Member States upon request. Article 12 of Directive 2014/49/EU shall apply by analogy with respect to the borrowing conditions.\n\n\nArticle 74g\nAlternative funding means\n\n\n1.The Board may contract for the DIF borrowings or other forms of support from institutions, financial institutions or other third parties, which offer better financial terms, at the most appropriate time so as to optimise the cost of funding and preserve its reputation. The proceeds of such borrowings shall be used exclusively to meet payment obligations towards participating DGSs, in the event that the amounts raised in accordance with Articles 74c and 74d are not immediately accessible or do not cover the amounts claimed from the DIF in relation to payout events.\n\n\n2.The borrowing or other forms of support referred to in paragraph 1 shall be fully recouped in accordance with Articles 74c and 74d.\n\n\n3.Any expenses incurred by the use of the borrowings specified in paragraph 1 shall be borne by Part III of the budget of the Board and not by the Union budget or the participating Member States.\n\n\n4.The Board may decide to invest proceeds from borrowings in accordance with Article 75 in order to protect their real value.\";\n\n\n35.in Chapter 2 of Title V of Part III, the heading of Section 2 is replaced by \"Administration of the SRF and DIF\".\n\n\n36.Article 75 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"Article\u00a075\nInvestments\n\n\n1.The Board shall administer the SRF and the DIF in accordance with this Regulation and delegated acts adopted under paragraph\u00a04.\n\n\n2.The amounts received from an institution under resolution or a bridge institution, the interests and other earnings on investments and any other earnings shall benefit only the SRF and the DIF.\n\n\n3.The Board shall have a prudent and safe investment strategy that is provided for in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article, and shall invest the amounts held in the SRF and the DIF in obligations of the Member States or intergovernmental organisations, or in highly liquid assets of high creditworthiness, taking into account the delegated act referred to in Article 460 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as well as other relevant provisions of that Regulation. Investments shall be sufficiently sectorally, geographically and proportionally diversified. The return on those investments shall benefit the SRF and the DIF respectively.\n\n\n4.The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts on the detailed rules for the administration of the SRF and the DIF and general principles and criteria for their investment strategy, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article\u00a093.\";\n\n\n37.the following Article 77a is inserted:\n\n\n\n\n\"Article\u00a077a\nUse of the DIF\n\n\n1.During the reinsurance period the Board shall use the DIF to provide the funding in accordance with Article 41a(2) and cover a share of the excess loss in accordance with Article 41a(3).\n\n\n2.During and after the co-insurance period the Board shall use the DIF to provide the funding in accordance with Article 41d(2) and Article 41h(2), respectively, and cover the loss in accordance with Article 41d(3) and 41h(3), respectively.\n\n\n3.The use of the DIF with respect to a credit institution affiliated to a participating DGS shall be contingent upon compliance by this credit institution with the obligations incumbent on it as a member of the participating DGS set out in this Regulation and in Directive\u00a02014/49/EU.\";\n\n\n38.in Title VI of Part III, in Article 81(4), Article 83(2) and (3), Article 87(4), Article 88(2) and (6), the words \"national resolution authority\" are replaced by \"national resolution authority, participating DGS or designated authorities where relevant\"  and the words \"national resolution authorities\" are replaced by \"national resolution authorities, participating DGS or designated authorities where relevant\";\n\n\n39.Article 93 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(a)paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"2.

Reducing barriers to free movement of capital and creating a level-playing field for credit institutions across the Union.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) Protecting public finances by weakening its interaction with the financial situation of credit institutions.\n\n\n\n6.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\n\n\nSpecific objective No\n\n\nIn the light of the general objectives above, the following specific objectives are sought:\n\n\n1) Completing Banking Union by launching a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) that complements the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism.\n\n\n2) Creating a Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) within the Budget of the Single Resolution Board (SRB or Board) which helps absorb geographically asymmetric shocks in the Union's internal market for financial services, improving protection of depositors across the Union.\n\n\n3) Protecting public finances by levying costs of deposit insurance on all banks within the Union.\n\n\nThe following sub-objectives are sought: \n\n\na) In a first stage (reinsurance period), the DIF, to a certain extent, provides funding and covers the share of losses of a participating deposit-guarantee scheme (DGS) in case the financial means necessary for the participating DGS to comply with its payment obligations under Directive 2014/49/EU towards depositors or towards a resolution authority exceed the financial resources the DGS.\n\n\nb) In a second stage (co-insurance period), the DIF, to a gradually increasing extent, provides funding and covers losses of a participating deposit guarantee scheme in the situation described above (under a).\n\n\nc) In a third stage (full insurance), the DIF provides all funding and covers all losses of a participating deposit guarantee scheme in the situation described above (under a).\n\n\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\n\n\nFinancial services and capital markets.\n\n\nPolicy strategy and coordination for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union.\n\n\nManagement of the Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union.\n\n\n\n6.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\n\n1) The proposal will significantly weaken the interaction between public finances of a participating Member State and the credit institutions established therein.\n\n\n2) The proposal will reduce fragmentation of the internal market for financial services and level the playing-field for all credit institutions established in participating Member States.\n\n\n3) The proposal will significantly increase confidence in the protection of deposits in all participating Member States.\n\n\n\n6.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\n\n\n\n1) Reduced shifting of deposits from credit institutions established in participating Member States that are perceived to have impaired public finances to credit institutions established in participating Member States that are perceived to have unimpaired public finances.\n\n\n2) Reduced deposit interest rate spread differences between credit institutions established in different participating Member States.\n\n\n3) Increased number and size of credit institutions for which a participating DGS, in case the deposits held in that credit institution become unavailable or the credit institution becomes subject to resolution proceedings, is able to satisfy its obligation towards depositors or the resolution authority.\n\n\n\n6.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n6.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nIn 2012 the Commission called for a Banking Union that would place the banking sector on a more sound footing and restore confidence in the Euro as part of a longer term vision for economic and fiscal integration.  The Banking Union should be implemented by shifting supervision to the European level, establishing an integrated bank crisis management and, equally important, a common system for deposit protection. While the first two steps have been achieved by the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism, a common system for deposit protection has not yet been established.\n\n\nThe Five Presidents' Report  and the Commission's follow-up Communication  set out a clear plan for deepening Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), including steps to further limit risks to financial stability. Completing the Banking Union is an indispensable step towards a full and deep EMU. For the single currency, a unified and fully integrated financial system is key for effective monetary policy transmission, adequate risk diversification across Member States and general confidence in the euro area banking system.\n\n\nIn particular, the Five Presidents Report proposes to establish, in the long term, a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), as the third pillar of a fully-fledged Banking Union alongside bank supervision, which lays with the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), and with bank resolution, which has been entrusted to the Single Resolution Board (SRB).\n\n\n\n6.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nThe Five Presidents' Report signals that, as the current set-up with national deposit guarantee schemes remains vulnerable to large local shocks (in particular when the sovereign and the national banking sector are perceived to be in a fragile situation), common deposit insurance would increase the resilience against future crises. A common scheme is also more likely to be fiscally neutral over time than national deposit guarantee schemes because risks are spread more widely and because private contributions are raised over a much larger pool of financial institutions. According to the Five President's Report, interim steps should already be taken until mid-2017, as part of Stage 1 of completing Europe's Economic and Monetary Union, for example in the form of a reinsurance mechanism. EDIS would be privately funded through ex ante risk-based fees paid by all the participating banks in the Member States and devised in a way that would prevent moral hazard.\n\n\n\n6.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThere is little publically available information on the staff levels of national DGS. Also, national DGS are organised in different forms and receive to different degrees staff assistance from or share services with e.g. banking associations or supervisory authorities. A survey by the European Forum of Deposit Insurers indicates that levels of direct staff (i.e. without support functions) ranges between 10 and 40 FTE.\n\n\n\n6.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nFollowing the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) by Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 and of the Single resolution Mechanism (SRM) by Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, there is a misalignment between the Union supervision and resolution of banks in the participating Member States, on the one hand, and the effectiveness and credibility of national DGS in case of failure of those same banks pursuant to Directive 2014/49/EU, on the other hand. The establishment of EDIS is an essential step towards the completion of the third pillar of a fully-fledged Banking Union alongside bank supervision and resolution.\n\n\nThis proposed Regulation builds on the existing framework of national deposit guarantee schemes as governed by Directive 2014/49/EU  (DGS Directive). The establishment of EDIS is an integral part of the process of further harmonisation of deposit guarantees under Directive 2014/49/EU. The uniform application of the deposit guarantee framework in the Member States participating to EDIS will be enhanced as a result of this proposed Regulation by attributing decision-making, monitoring and enforcement powers relating to EDIS to the Single Resolution Board (\"the Board\"). This approach will ensure equal protection for covered depositors and support the proper functioning of the Internal Market. To ensure that all participating Member States have full confidence in the quality and impartiality of the protection of deposits by EDIS and to enhance the effectiveness of the deposit guarantee, the proposed Regulation sets up a Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). The Single Resolution Board would collect the contributions directly from institutions and manage and administer the DIF.\n\n\n\n6.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\u25fb Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\n\n\u2611\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from 2017 to 2024,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n6.7.Management mode(s) planned\n16\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u2611 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n7.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n7.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\n\nArticle 45 of the Regulation requires the Board to be accountable to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission for the implementation of this Regulation, among other things, to submit each year a report to the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the European Court of Auditors on the execution of the tasks conferred upon it by this Regulation.\n\n\n\n7.2.Management and control system \n\n\n\n\n7.2.1.Risk(s) identified \n\n\n\nThe proposal would not bring about new risks in relation to the legal, economical, efficient and effective use of budget appropriations.\n\n\nHowever, internal risk management should take into account the specific nature of the financing mechanism of the Single Resolution Board. Differently from many other bodies set up by the Union, the services provided by the Board will be exclusively financed by financial institutions.\n\n\nSecondly, the Board will be responsible for ensuring the management of the Deposit Insurance Fund. In this regard, a set of internal control procedures will have to be developed and established.\n\n\n\n7.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nThe framework and rules for internal control should follow the pattern applied by other authorities established by the Commission, except for the management of the Single Resolution Board, which will require the establishment of a specif set of rules.\n\n\n\n7.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \n\n\n\nInternal controls shall be embedded in the Board\u2019s procedures relevant to the discharge of its responsibility and the implementation of the tasks conferred to it. The costs of such procedures shall not exceed their benefits in avoiding material errors.\n\n\n\n7.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\n\nThe Regulation establishes that a participating DGS shall not be covered by EDIS in the reinsurance, co-insurance or full insurance phase if the participating DGS or any other relevant authority of the respective Member State have failed to comply with the obligations under the Regulation or of Directive 2014/49/EU on deposit guarantee schemes.\n\n\nFor the purposes of combating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) shall apply to the Board without any restriction.\n\n\nThe Board shall accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and shall immediately adopt appropriate provisions for all Board staff.\n\n\nThe funding decisions and the agreements and the implementing instruments resulting from them shall explicitly stipulate that the Court of Auditors and OLAF may, if need be, carry out on-the-spot checks at the beneficiaries of money disbursed by Board as well as on the staff responsible for allocating this money.\n\n\nArticles 61-66 of the Regulation set out the provisions on implementation and control of the Board\u2019s budget and applicable financial rules.\n\n\n\n8.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\nThe analysis below provides an estimation of the overall costs for the Board and its administration. No costs are expected for the EU budget since all expenses of the board will be fully financed by the approximatley 6,000 financial institutions covered by EDIS. The calculation method will be based on size and will be set out in a delegated act in 2016. For reasons of conistency, the same methodology should be applied  under EDIS.\n\n\nThe tasks of the Board will be limited as regards Deposit Insurance. EDIS will evolve over the following three phases: (i) reinsurance, (ii) co-insurance and (iii) full insurance. In all phases, the Board will need to assess whether the requesting DGS complies with a number of provisions of Directive 2014/49/EU, notably whether it has built up its national fund. Different from the Board\u2019s function in resolution, there is no discretionary element in its decision, since the payment obligation of the participating DGS towards depositors (compensation) or towards a resolution authority (contribution to resolution) follows the determination of an administative or judicial authority.\n\n\nIn the first phase, the Board will assess requests for reinsurance cover and and provide the necessary funding to compensate national DGS within the limits of coverage. These tasks remain the same under the co-insurance phase, but, all other things being equal, one may expect a higher number of potential cases as the preconditions for coverage by EDIS are less restrictive than in the reinsurance period. Under full-insurance, the tasks of the Board would increase significantly. In addition to respond to requests for coverage, it would need to calculate and collect contributions from individual banks and manage the European Deposit Insurance Fund. These tasks are similar to tasks under the Single Resolution Mechanism. Hence siginifcant economies of scale can be expected and the increase in tasks does not result in a proportionately increasing need for staff.\n\n\nThe staffing of DGS depends on the scope for the interventions. Some DGS have the possibility to use their funds for measures which would prevent institutions from failing, i.e. avoiding pay-out events in the first place. DGS with such possibility also have broader risk monitoring and management capabilities than DGS which mainly serve as \u2018paybox\u2019 to compensate depositors. The scope for EDIS would be limited to financially assist national DGS in such paybox function.   \n\n\nThere is little publically available information on the staff levels of national DGS. A survey by the European Forum for Deposit Insurers indicates that levels for direct (i.e. without support functions) staff ranges between 10 and 40 FTE for such DGS with comparable functions to EDIS.   \n\n\n\n\nIn view of the limited, but gradually increasing tasks of EDIS, the Commission proposes the following FTE for direct functions\n\n\n\uf0b7Under Reinsurance: 5 FTE (+ 0.5 FTE overhead)\n\n\n\uf0b7Under Co-insurance: 10 FTE (+1 FTE overhead)\n\n\n\uf0b7Under full insurance: 20 FTE (+2 FTE overhead) \n\n\n\nTable: Indicative development of FTEs\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Resources\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishment plan posts: AD\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishment plan posts: AST\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishment plan posts: AST/SC\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal establishment plan posts\n\n\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContract agents\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeconded national experts\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal staff\n\n\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDG FISMA currently has a ratio of overhead staff of 11.2 per cent.

A 9% overhead ratio therefore seems feasible.\n\n\n\nTable: Indicative development of expenditure\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenditure\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle 1: Staff expenditure\n\n\n\n\n658\n\n\n\n\n658\n\n\n\n\n658\n\n\n\n\n658\n\n\n\n\n1,315\n\n\n\n\n1,315\n\n\n\n\n1,315\n\n\n\n\n2,631\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle 2: Infrastructure and operating expenditure\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n110\n\n\n\n\n110\n\n\n\n\n110\n\n\n\n\n220\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle 3: Operational expenditure\n\n\n\n\n116\n\n\n\n\n116\n\n\n\n\n116\n\n\n\n\n116\n\n\n\n\n232\n\n\n\n\n232\n\n\n\n\n232\n\n\n\n\n464\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n824\n\n\n\n\n824\n\n\n\n\n824\n\n\n\n\n824\n\n\n\n\n1,657\n\n\n\n\n1,657\n\n\n\n\n1,657\n\n\n\n\n3,315\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain assumptions\n\n\nBuilding on what has been assessed for the resolution function of the Single Resolution Board, the following distribution of personnel is suggested:\n\n\n\uf0b780% of TAs (68% of ADs and 12% of ASTs);\n\n\n\uf0b710% of ENDs;\n\n\n\uf0b710% of CAs.\n\n\nStaff Regulation of EU institutions will be applied, which is reflected in the used per head rates:\n\n\n\uf0b7average yearly cost of a TA: EUR 131,000;\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7average yearly cost of an END: EUR 78,000;\n\n\n\uf0b7average yearly cost of a CA: EUR 70,000.\n\n\nIn addition to the salary, this cost includes indirect costs such as building, training, IT and socio-medical infrastructure costs. \n\n\nSince the Board has its seat in Brussels, a salary correction coefficient of 1 is used. \n\n\nOperational expenditures are expected to amount to 15% of total Board\u2019s costs. This is significantly lower than the 25% estimated for the resolution function, since it is expected that costs for the development and maintenance of information systems and internal services could be shared with the resolution function. \n\n\n\n8.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\n\n\nNo impact on the Union's
