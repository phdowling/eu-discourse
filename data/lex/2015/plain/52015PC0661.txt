The draft JCD extends the EU system to the EEA EFTA States, so that the system will encompass all the EEA States. \n\n\nExcess emissions premiums, Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 as reflected in adaptation (i) in the JCD \n\n\nAn adaptation text has been included to the effect that it will be for the EFTA Surveillance Authority to impose excess emissions premiums on manufacturers in the EEA EFTA States. \n\n\nPremiums will be imposed jointly for new passenger cars sold in the EU and the EEA EFTA States respectively. Consequently, the premiums need to be distributed between the EU/EFTA sides. \n\n\nA distribution key is therefore suggested, so that the premiums are distributed proportionally based on the share of new passenger cars registered in the EU or in the EFTA States, respectively, relative to the total number of new passenger cars registered in the EEA.\n\n\nCollection of excess emissions premiums, Article 9(3) of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 as reflected in adaptation (j) in the JCD\n\n\nArticle 9(3) provides a legal basis for the Commission to establish methods for the collection of excess emissions premiums. Such methods were established by Commission Decision 2012/100/EU\n1\n. As there is a separate surveillance authority and surveillance system under the EEA Agreement, an adaptation text has been included for the EFTA Surveillance Authority to determine the means for collecting excess emissions premiums. These means shall be based on the Commission\u2019s means. \n\n\nAllocation of excess emissions premiums, Article 9(4) of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 as reflected in adaptation (k) in the JCD\n\n\nArticle 9(4) states that the premiums shall be considered revenue for the general budget of the EU. \n\n\nConsequently, an adaptation text has been included for the EFTA States to determine the allocation of the amounts of the excess emissions premium that correspond to the EFTA side.\n\n\nApplicability of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 to Liechtenstein as reflected in adaptation (n) in the JCD\n\n\nThe historically longstanding relationship between Liechtenstein and Switzerland is very close and heavily influenced by the Customs and Currency Treaty between the two countries (establishing a customs and currency union) which was concluded in 1923 (LGBl. 1923 No 24). The Customs and Currency Treaty with Switzerland also has a significant impact on the environmental and fiscal strategies of Liechtenstein. Many Swiss environmental provisions are, by way of the Customs and Currency Treaty, directly applicable in Liechtenstein or are implemented into Liechtenstein law on the basis of bilateral treaties between the two countries. \n\n\n\n\nAgainst this background, Liechtenstein requests to be exempted from the application of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, considering that by applying the Swiss emission performance scheme in Liechtenstein the aims set by the EU legislation will equally be achieved.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nArticle 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 concerning arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement provides that the Council establishes the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf on such Decisions, on a proposal from the Commission. \n\n\nThe Commission submits the Draft Decision of the EEA Joint Committee for adoption by the Council as the Union\u2019s position. The Commission would hope to be able to present it in the EEA Joint Committee at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\n2015/0301 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position
