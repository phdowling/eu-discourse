A number of EU agencies, in particular Frontex, the European Maritime Safety Agency and the European Fisheries Control Agency, support the national authorities in the exercise of these functions.\n\n\nIn 2014, the Commission finalised a feasibility study to examine the need for improved co-operation and co-ordination between national bodies and agencies carrying out coastguard functions. This study identifies a range of issues for closer collaboration, in particular in the areas of operational surveillance and data sharing which underpins all these functions.\n\n\nThe need to enhance collaboration and coordination between authorities carrying out coastguard functions has subsequently been acknowledged in the Union maritime transport legislation, the European Union Maritime Security Strategy with an Action Plan adopted by the Council in 2014 and in the European Agenda on Migration adopted by the Commission in 2015.\n\n\nThe purpose of this legislative proposal reinforcing European co-operation on coastguard functions is to improve cooperation and coordination between the relevant EU agencies in order to enhance synergies between their respective services, thus allowing them to provide more efficient and cost effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coastguard functions.\n\n\nThis legislative proposal forms part of a set of measures proposed by the Commission to reinforce the protection of Europe's external borders, including European cooperation on coastguard function, which also includes proposals for a Regulation establishing a European Border and Coast Guard Agency and to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency. The substantive amendments in this proposal are identical to the proposed provisions on European coastguard cooperation in the proposal for a Regulation establishing a European Border and Coast Guard Agency and to the proposed amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThis proposal is consistent with the policy objectives of the European Maritime Transport Policy until 2018 and of the European Maritime Safety Agency which was established with the purpose of ensuring a high, uniform, and effective level of maritime safety, maritime security, prevention of, and response to, pollution caused by ships. It is at the heart of the EMSA's mission, competencies and activities with maritime administrations and bodies carrying out coast guard functions.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe objective of this initiative is to improve European cooperation on coastguard functions by developing cross-sectoral cooperation among the European Border and Coast Guard Agency , the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coastguard functions.\n\n\nThe underlying problem is that coastguard functions, such as border control, maritime safety and security, search and rescue operations, fisheries control, pollution control etc., are currently carried out by more than 300 authorities in Member States, which are not always well coordinated even at national level. By promoting collaboration and co-ordination between authorities carrying out coastguard functions, this proposal is fully consistent with Union policies on migration, security, IUU fishing as well as on transport and mobility.\n\n\nThe additional tasks for EMSA are fully in line with European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to also fulfil their duties and tasks. There are already bilateral Service Level Agreements in place between EMSA and European Border and Coast Guard Agency and between EMSA and EFCA for delivery of maritime information services. With  European Border and Coast Guard Agency the exchange of currently available data is organised since April 2013 and data is permanently streamed from EMSA into EUROSUR and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency Situation Center. The established practices will be used for the enhanced data streams.\n\n\nThis legislative proposal is without prejudice to the Commission's commitment to bringing founding regulations of EU decentralised agencies in line with the Common Approach on decentralised agencies when being revised for policy related reasons. \n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nThe proposal is based on Article 100(2) of the TFEU on establishing provisions for the pursuit of the objectives of the common sea transport policy.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity \n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal deals with support to national authorities carrying out coastguard functions at national and Union level, and where appropriate at international level.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe proposal aims at reinforcing the EU's coastguard capacity to response to threats and risks in the maritime domain by improving cooperation and promoting cross-border and cross-sector cost-effective actions. This will avoid duplication of effort while ensuring that the main actors (in particular EU agencies) act in a coherent and efficient manner and develop synergies together. It takes into account the need to have more control in the maritime area while limiting the workload for national and EU administrations.\n\n\nThe added value of EMSA particular activities at EU level are: \n\n\n\n\u2013providing valuable information to improve surveillance of the external borders of the European Union with new Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS or drones) services and continued SAT-AIS services, which otherwise would not be provided or provided to a lesser extent (aerial surveillance, which is very costly);\n\n\n\u2013providing services and data at EU level is cost efficient, due to economies of scale, which cannot be obtained by similar actions at national level;\n\n\n\u2013reuse of data and sharing of data with all concerned EU Member States and EU Agencies, avoiding duplication of effort and offering multiple use of the same data and the same services, enabling the use of new and modern technologies;\n\n\n\u2013collecting all relevant maritime data on human activity at sea in one place, offering a \u201cone stop shop\u201d solution, which feeds other authorities at national and EU level with this data. The ICT infrastructure and distribution network is already mostly in place and does not need to be developed again. EMSA is already providing different maritime data sets to European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA for which interfaces have been established;\n\n\n\u2013the use of EMSA\u2019s already established maritime information systems, harmonisation of existing systems and services for promoting information exchange between coastguard authorities on an EU level;\n\n\n\u2013increasing the collective skills and capacity for coastguard functions and assisting them to collaborate and act jointly, based on a harmonised approach.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nAs the purpose of the proposal is to amend Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency, it is necessary to propose a Regulation.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nN/A (this initiative aims at implementing commitments contained in the European Agenda on migration referring to coastguard activities). \n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\nThere was however a feasibility study commissioned by DG MOVE\n1\n, as provided in recital (30) of Regulation No 100/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n2\n.\n\n\nThe study identified some 316 civilian and military Member States' authorities, which are responsible for Coast Guard functions and collaborating via 70 different structures.  The study highlighted key shortcomings with the existing co-operation: \n\n\n\u2013the lack of information on the remit, powers and capabilities of other authorities;\n\n\n\u2013human resources, financial constraints and the limited number of operational assets;\n\n\n\u2013ad hoc coordination and lack of interoperability of systems, processes and assets; \n\n\n\u2013limited joint planning and joint operations. \n\n\nOne of the key findings was the pivotal role of the existing operational surveillance and data sharing which underpins all of the functions and which rely on EMSA systems.\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nThe initiative is not part of the REFIT agenda but should apply its main principles.\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThis initiative requires an increase in the EU contribution to EMSA of around 22 million per year (that is around \u20ac87 million for the 2017 to 2020 period) and the recruitment of 17 TA.\n\n\nThis is operational expenditure (title 3) for around \u20ac81 million mainly to cover provision of RPAS services (\u20ac67 million) and SAT-AIS and Satcom data and services to increase the surveillance capability of the 3 agencies and national authorities to strengthen as a primary objective the control of the external maritime borders of the European Union.\n\n\n(See also the legislative financial statement attached).\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nAs this measure will be implemented by EMSA, its evaluation will be included in the 5-year evaluation of the agency, which findings and recommendations shall be forwarded by the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council and shall be made public.  \n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nThe proposal aims at developing European cooperation on coastguard functions by developing forms of cooperation among European Border and Coast Guard, EMSA and EFCA to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coastguard functions.\n\n\nEMSA will lead notably for a significant improvement of the surveillance capability to strengthen the control of the external maritime borders of the European Union through the following actions: \n\n\na.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sharing information generated by fusing and analysing data available in ship reporting systems and other information systems hosted by or accessible to the Agencies, in accordance with their respective legal bases and without prejudice to the ownership of data by Member States;\n\n\nOutput: improving the dissemination of real time and near real time maritime surveillance data between the three Agencies and relevant authorities\n\n\nBased on the current SLA\u2019s EMSA has with respectively European Border and Coast Guard Agencyand EFCA, maritime information is streamed into the systems of the other Agencies. When improving surveillance capabilities, data of new sensors, in particular of RPAS (including video and infrared data) should be incorporated in the maritime picture, this will require new functionalities in the current system to improve the provision of information and sharing it with the other Agencies and relevant authorities. Software developments and interface upgrades are needed to update the systems to cope with the information from new sensors. \n\n\nb.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Providing surveillance and communication services based on state-of-the-art technology, including space-based and ground infrastructure and sensors mounted on any kind of platform, such as remotely piloted aircraft systems;\n\n\nOutput: flexible RPAS services for border control surveillance\n\n\nWith the current land- and satellite based technologies, it is still difficult to detect small boats made out of rubber or wood, used to get migrants across the Mediterranean Sea. These types of boats do not generally generate enough reflection to be visible on radar satellite imagery. With optical imagery only very targeted small areas can be covered, provided that it is day time and there are no clouds. Satellite information in general is only available at certain times according to the flight track of the satellites. Additional services based on RPAS (drones), can overcome these limitations. \n\n\nThe Agency will organise and provide, as an institutional service provider, RPAS service operations in support of  European Border and Coast Guard Agency and border control authorities. In addition, EMSA as a maritime safety agency will contribute to a more friendly perception of using this technology. This technology has a multipurpose character and can be used for a variety of public tasks at sea (border control, safety of navigation, Search and Rescue, pollution detection, fishery control, law enforcement actions). Strengthening the cooperation between the Agencies will further enhance synergies and multipurpose use of the same assets.  \n\n\nBy having  EMSA providing RPAS services,  European Border and Coast Guard Agency and border control authorities will substantially benefit from the service as EMSA is already collecting, processing, fusing and correlating data of human activity at sea. RPAS derived information would be handled as an additional data source, which will be added to the information streamed into EUROSUR. A scalable service is foreseen with a number of simultaneous RPAS operations in the Mediterranean Sea, to be divided for example over 4 areas of interest: Greek-Turkish border (Aegean Sea), Central Mediterranean Sea (Lybia), West Mediterranean Sea (Strait of Gibraltar) and East Mediterranean Sea (Cyprus region). The deployment should be based on mobile units, which can be relocated as new \u201chot spots\u201d may develop overtime. \n\n\nThe RPAS services should be cheaper as manned patrol aircraft and should be used as a complementary tool in the overall surveillance chain, including satellite imagery, vessel positioning information and surveillance by maritime patrol aircraft and vessels.\n\n\nOutput: securing AIS data collected by satellite\n\n\nUntil today, EMSA, in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), is providing Satellite-AIS (SAT-AIS) data services at no cost to other EU Agencies and EU Member States through its maritime applications. This data is financed by ESA up to 31st August 2016 after\u00a0which the research and development programme comes to an end. SAT-AIS data is an invaluable source of information which very much enhances maritime situational awareness. It is assisting both Member States and EU Agencies and bodies (i.e.  European Border and Coast Guard Agency, EFCA, MAOC-N) in their surveillance tasks. Without this data, many vessels are not able to be tracked due to the unavailability of other data sources, in particular in the south of the Mediterranean Sea, or because vessels are transiting beyond the coverage of the AIS shore-based stations and therefore cannot be monitored through terrestrial-based AIS systems (the case for activities of fishing vessels under EU flag when operating outside of the EU) .\n\n\n\nWithout SAT-AIS data, much added value will be lost and there will be a considerable decrease in the maritime situational awareness, negatively impacting the surveillance capability at external borders. It is therefore necessary to acquire SAT-AIS data.\n\n\nOutput: communication services, in particular SAT-COM in support of joint operations.\n\n\nFor the coordination and delivery of maritime surveillance data coming from RPAS and other sensors, satellite communication is required. Satellite communication is used for navigation of the RPAS and for transmitting the data collected by its payload. This is a substantial cost driver. The Agency will have to invest in interfaces receiving data from communication satellites and from the European Data Relay System (EDRS) in particular. Certainly the input of multiple data streams in different data formats simultaneously will require software developments. The presented costs do not include satellite transmission costs.\n\n\nEMSA will also contribute for:\n\n\nc.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Capacity building at national and Union level by elaborating guidelines, recommendations and best practices as well as by supporting the training and exchange of staff, with a view to enhance the exchange of information and cooperation on coastguard functions;\n\n\n\n\nOutput: Training, distant learning and exchange of best practices, and project-based development of common or interoperable operations standards\n\n\nStrengthening the coastguard functions of national authorities entails also education and training. Already, the Agency has established a significant training portfolio, including e-learning modules for experts of Member States, accession countries and European Neighbourhood Policy countries. This basis will be used to develop new modules and training sessions strengthening skills and capabilities at national level. \n\n\nNewly developed training courses, workshops for exchanging best practices and e-learning modules as well as new specific area-related projects will help to increase capacity of coastguards, creating common standards and approaches at EU level, which will facilitate multinational cooperation and joint operations. \n\n\n\n2015/0313 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee,\n\n\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)National authorities carrying out coastguard functions are responsible for a wide range of tasks, including but not limited to maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental protection.

This basis will be used to develop new modules and training sessions strengthening skills and capacities at national level. \n\n\nNewly developed training courses, workshops for exchanging best practices and e-learning modules as well as new specific area-related projects will help to increase capacity of coastguards, creating common standards and approaches at EU level, which will facilitate multinational cooperation and joint operations. \n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nImproving the dissemination of real time and near real time maritime surveillance data between the three Agencies and relevant authorities:\n\n\nThe upgrade and improvements of the interfaces and functionalities will:\n\n\n- enable the sharing of data from new sensors (using new data formats);\n\n\n- contribute to share increased surveillance data amongst all relevant stakeholders.\n\n\nFlexible RPAS services for border control surveillance: \n\n\nIncreased maritime surveillance at the external borders of the EU should result in:\n\n\n- early detection of migrant departures;\n\n\n- better detection of migrants in distress at sea (saving more lives), supporting Search and Rescue operations at sea;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- early and better detection of any other illegal activity whilst crossing the external maritime borders of the European Union;\n\n\n- utilising these missions for multiple (coastguard) purposes, assisting maritime surveillance for:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- detection of illegal fishing,\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- detection and interception of drug- trafficking and smuggling,\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- pollution detection and monitoring,\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- support of law enforcement activities.\n\n\nSurveillance data is \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d and will be provided to the relevant competent authorities either at national or EU level to give appropriate follow-up.\n\n\nSecuring AIS data collected by satellite:\n\n\nThis information will allow the identification of vessels outside the range of the AIS shore-based stations of EU Member States and will assist users to set up a more complete maritime picture for border control operations. This information will result in:\n\n\n- being able to discriminate between normal traffic and non-identifiable human activity at sea which may need closer verification by correlating this information with other data sources available at EMSA;\n\n\n- a better ability to follow the location of national and or EU deployed governmental assets during Search and Rescue (SAR) operations for a more optimal coordination;\n\n\n- a better ability to deploy assets to the correct geographical position of vessels identified in need of support thus minimising the time for authorities / SAR to arrive to the scene;\n\n\n- in the possibilty of offereing geospatial intelligence for an accurate and timely monitoring of vessels on a global basis.\n\n\nIf this SAT-AIS data could not be provided, less comprehensive information would be provided about what is happening at the external sea borders. \n\n\nCommunication services, in particular SAT-COM in support of joint operations:\n\n\nSatellite communications play a vital role when utilising new technologies such as remotely piloted aircraft systems. It is through such satellite communication technology that improved maritime surveillance in (near) real time is provided.  \n\n\nTraining, distant learning and exchange of best practices, project based development of common or interoperable operations standards:\n\n\nInvesting in training, e-learning and exchange of best practices, and project based development of common or interoperable operations standards should result in:\n\n\n- increasing skills and capabilities in the field of coastguard functions at national level, leading to more performant operations;\n\n\n- increasing the level of harmonisation and common approaches to maritime surveillance and other coastguard functions, leading to interoperability and common operations standards, which should facilitate joint operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nThe most complex and critical process is the organisation of pilot RPAS services.\n\n\nIn 2016, the Agency plans to demonstrate a pilot RPAS service for Member States and EU Agencies. From the regulatory side, the Agency intends to involve EASA and Eurocontrol and, for the user side,  European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA are invited to participate in this pilot activity. In addition, the consultation with the European Space Agency should contribute to further development of RPAS solutions for the civil maritime surveillance domain.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nThe added value of these activities at EU level are: \n\n\n- providing valuable information to improve surveillance of the external borders of the European Union, with new RPAS services and continued SAT-AIS services which otherwise would not be provided or provided to a lesser extent (aerial surveillance, which is very costly);\n\n\n- providing  services and data at EU level is cost efficient, due to economies of scale, which cannot be obtained by similar actions at national level;\n\n\n- reuse of data and sharing of data with all concerned EU Member States and EU Agencies, avoiding duplication of effort and offering multiple use of the same data and the same services, enabling the use of new and modern technologies;\n\n\n - collecting all relevant maritime data on human activity at sea in one place, offering a \u201cone stop shop\u201d solution, which feeds other authorities at national and EU level with this data. The ICT infrastructure and distribution network is already mostly in place and does not need to be developed again. EMSA is already providing different maritime data sets to  European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA for which interfaces have been established;\n\n\n- the use of EMSA\u2019s already established maritime information systems, harmonisation of existing systems and services for promoting information exchange between coastguard authorities on an EU level;\n\n\n- increasing the collective skills and capacity for coastguard bodies, and assisting them to collaborate and act jointly based on a harmonised approach.\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nBased on previous military applications of RPAS technology, EMSA has learned what is feasible in terms of a civil RPAS capacity and how RPAS could be useful to improve maritime surveillance at a better price-quality ratio and assist in obtaining better awareness of what is happening at the external maritime borders of the European Union. \n\n\nBased on the on-going cooperation with the European Space Agency, the use of SAT-AIS data has been proven to greatly improve the maritime situational awareness. Many Member States and European agency users have demonstrated the operational usefulness of SAT-AIS data through real cases to the extent that nowadays they very much base their daily operations on the use of SAT-AIS data. User testimonies have been collected following several user meetings over the past three years. It is therefore clear that without SAT-AIS data, there would be a clear limitation in the quality of the maritime domain awareness which would negatively impact the ability of users to act in an effective way. \n\n\nIn the field of Port State Control, the Agency supports a European wide scheme for a minimum level of training that\u00a0 enhances capacity building at EU and national level. Moreover, \u201cCore skills\u201d trainings developed for certain functions have proven to be of added value to complement national capabilities and to foster exchange of best practices, and could therefore be of added value for different coastguard functions.\n\n\nThe Agency has an extensive experience in working with national authorities carrying coastguard functions and promoting cross-border cooperation. A recent example concerns assistance to vessels in distress for which the Agency together with the Commission has facilitated the elaboration of operational guidelines on places of refuge on the basis of EU legislation which will promote a harmonised and effective response by national authorities. Such elaboration of operational guidelines and common / interoperable standards and processes could be replicated in other areas.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nThese additional EMSA tasks are fully in line with  European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to also fulfill their duties and tasks. The data obtained from both RPAS and SAT-AIS means will greatly improve their situational awareness. There are already bilateral Service Level Agreements in place between EMSA and  European Border and Coast Guard Agency and between EMSA and EFCA for delivery of maritime information services. With  European Border and Coast Guard Agency the exchange of currently available data is organised since April 2013 and data is permanently streamed from EMSA into EUROSUR and the  European Border and Coast Guard Agency Situation Center. The established practices will be used for the enhanced data streams.\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u2327 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe Agency is audited annually by the European Court of Auditors and annually by the Internal Audit Service of the Commission.
