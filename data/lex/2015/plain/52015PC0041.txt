These fishing opportunities are usually amended several times during\r\nthe period in which they are in effect. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot applicable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposed amendments seek to modify Regulation\r\n(EU) 2015/104 as described below.\nIn its proposal for Regulation (EU) 2015/104\r\n(COM (2014) 670), the Commission included measures for the protection of the\r\nstock of seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in the\r\nNorth East Atlantic. In June 2014, the International Council for the\r\nExploration of the Sea (ICES) released scientific advice on this stock, which\r\nhas been in rapid decline since 2012. Furthermore, the Scientific, Technical\r\nand Economic Committee for Fisherires (STECF) considered that in general\r\ncurrent national measures for the protection of seabass have proved\r\nineffective. Seabass is a late maturing and slow growing species. The fishing\r\nmortality on this stock is currently four times higher than the level which\r\nwould ensure maximum sustainable yield (MSY).\nThe Commission proposal included a limit on\r\ncatches by recreational fishermen, a so-called \"bag limit\", and a set\r\nof measures addressing the commercial fishery for the species. These measures\r\nwere not retained by the Council and are therefore absent from Council Regulation\r\n(EU) 2015/104.\nThe Commission is now in the process of\r\nadopting measures aimed at urgently reducing the fishing mortality of seabass\r\nin the Northeast Atlantic, based on article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council on the Common Fisheries Policy\r\n(\u201cthe basic regulation of the CFP\u201d). These measures target the commercial\r\nfishery for seabass. Given the contribution of recreational fisheries to the\r\nfishing mortality of this species, a catch limit for recreational fishermen\r\nneeds to be introduced in the Fishing Opportunities Regulation for 2015.\n2015/0025 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU) 2015/104 as\r\nregards certain fishing opportunities for\u00a0 seabass\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EU) 2015/104[1] does not contain\r\nfishing opportunities for the stock of seabass (Dicentrarchus\r\nlabrax) in the North East Atlantic.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In June 2014, the\r\nInternational Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) released scientific\r\nadvice on the stock on seabass in the North East Atlantic, and confirmed that\r\nthis stock has been in rapid decline since 2012.\u00a0 Furthermore, the Scientific,\r\nTechnical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) has evaluated the\r\nprotection of seabass by national measures in place and, in general, has deemed\r\nthose measures ineffective. Seabass is a late maturing and slow growing species.\r\nThe fishing mortality on seabass in the North East Atlantic is currently four\r\ntimes higher than the level which would ensure maximum sustainable yield (MSY).\r\n\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has adopted\r\nurgent measures based on Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[2]\r\nto reduce the fishing mortality caused by certain commercial fisheries for\r\nseabass.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also recreational\r\nfisheries contribute significantly to the fishing mortality on that stock. It\r\nis therefore appropriate to establish fishing opportunities in the form of a\r\ndaily limit on the number of fish that a recreational fisherman may retain.\r\nRecreational fisheries include various forms, such as fishing from a\r\nrecreational vessel or fishing from shore.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since such a daily limit\r\ncomplements the urgent measures which the Commission has adopted for certain commercial\r\nfisheries, this Regulation should enter into force seven days after its\r\npublication.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EU)\r\n2015/104 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\r\n\nRegulation (EU) 2015/104 is amended as\r\nfollows:\n(1)                   \r\nArticle 2 is replaced by the following:\n\"Article 2\nScope\n1.
