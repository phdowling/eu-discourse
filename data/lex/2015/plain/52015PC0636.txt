"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 10.12.2015\nCOM(2015) 636 final\n2015/0289(COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\non the sustainable management of external fishing fleets, repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008\n{SWD(2015) 276 final}{SWD(2015) 279 final}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nThe Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) covers the conservation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries and fleet exploiting those resources. It encompasses fishing activities carried out in Union waters as well as those carried out outside Union waters by Union fishing vessels.\n\n\nRegulation (EC) No1006/2008\n1\n (the \u2018FAR\u2019) deals with authorisations of Union vessels to fish outside Union waters and authorisations granted to third country fishing vessels to operate in Union waters. Together with the Control\n2\n\u00a0and the IUU\n3\n\u00a0Regulations, it is one of the three implementing pillars of the CFP.  \n\n\nReform of the CFP is enshrined in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013\n4\n (the \u2018Basic Regulation\u2019). It promotes in particular a sustainable, ecosystem-based and precautionary approach to fisheries management, emphasising the coherence between its internal and external dimension. Union fishing activities outside Union waters should be based on the same principles and standards as those applicable under Union law in the area of the CFP. The Union should be able to monitor its fleet wherever it operates and whatever the framework. The current FAR Regulation needs to be revised to properly address the objectives of the new CFP and to provide consistency with the Control Regulation.\n\n\nAs an integral part of the CFP reform, the Commission proposed a revision to the FAR Regulation in its Communication on External Dimension of the CFP\n5\n in 2011. It was supported by a European Parliament resolution adopted in 2012\n6\n.\n\n\nThe revision of the FAR is a REFIT initiative aimed at clarifying and simplifying the current provisions, in particular in terms of responsibilities at Union, national and operator level, as well as bringing the FAR in line with the Control Regulation.\n\n\nSeveral developments at international level also support the need for a revision. The Union has endorsed the FAO International Plan of Action to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and undeclared fishing (IPOA-IUU)\n7\n adopted in 2001. The IPOA-IUU and the FAO Voluntary Guidelines for flag state performance\n8\n endorsed in 2014 underlie the responsibility of the flag State to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems. The Voluntary Guidelines advocate that the flag State sets up an authorisation regime to ensure that no vessel is allowed to operate unless authorised. They also recommend that the flag State and the coastal state grant an authorisation when the fishing activities take place under a fisheries access agreement or even outside such an agreement\n9\n. Finally, in April 2015, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) delivered its advisory opinion on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) matters within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the members of the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission. ITLOS considers that a flag State\u2019s responsibility to prevent and/or repress IUU fishing activities within the EEZs of coastal states to be an obligation of \u2018due diligence\u2019. ITLOS stresses the liability of the Union, and not its Member States, for any breach of the fisheries access agreements it has with coastal states.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe FAR is one of the operational parts of CFP external policy as enshrined in Part VI of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 (the \u2018Basic Regulation\u2019). It also complements the Control Regulation and its Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011\n10\n, which apply to all activities covered by the CFP carried out in Union waters or by Union fishing vessels. The FAR deals with authorisations of Union fishing vessels outside Union waters and of third country fishing vessels inside Union waters. Therefore, the FAR deals with authorisation while the Control Regulation and its Implementing Regulation deal with control and enforcement. This proposal aims to streamline the FAR with respect to the Control Regulation so that the latter applies mutatis mutandis to control and reporting aspects. Finally, since the FAR is aimed at allowing the Union to better monitor its external fleet, it will actively contribute to combatting illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  \n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe Basic Regulation states that the Union \u2018should improve policy coherence of Union initiatives, with particular regard to environmental, trade and development activities and strengthen consistency of actions taken in the context of development cooperation and scientific, technical and economic cooperation\u2019\n11\n. By promoting the objectives of the CFP externally, in particular the sustainability of the Union\u2019s external fleet activities, the FAR is fully consistent with Union environmental and development policies.  \n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe proposal is based on Article 43(2) of the TFEU on establishing provisions necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the CFP.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity\n\n\nThe proposal deals with the management of authorisations of the Union fleet outside Union waters and of third country vessels in Union waters when carrying out fishing activities. It therefore forms part of the external dimension of the conservation of marine biological resources under the CFP, an exclusive competence of the Union, and so the subsidiarity principle does not apply in this context.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal aims to reinforce the EU\u2019s capacity to monitor its fleet regardless of the framework under which it operates. It takes into account the need to strike a balance between more control of the Union fleet and limiting the workload for national and EU administrations. As the Impact Assessment shows, it would help to simplify the current system. However, the expected advantages clearly outweigh the efforts involved, particularly in terms of positive impact on the management of fishing resources. In this regard the provisions proposed are limited to what is necessary to achieve the objective, and do not entail disproportionate burden\u2022Choice of instrument\n\n\nAs a regulation is directly applicable and binding on the Member States, it must contribute to the uniform application of the proposed rules throughout the Union, thus creating a level playing field for all EU operators involved in fishing activities outside EU waters.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS   \n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nA public consultation, based on a consultation document and a specific questionnaire, was held during the impact assessment process. This was followed by a series of technical meetings with the most affected Member States, i.e. those with the most significant external fleets. Furthermore, an extraordinary meeting of the Regional Advisory Council \u2014 Long Distance RAC \u2014 comprising representatives of the fishing industry and NGOs, was held to discuss the revision of the FAR.\n\n\nThese consultations enabled the Commission to get a better understanding of how the current system for managing the external fleet at national level operates, and have been instrumental in fine-tuning the current proposal. All groups of stakeholders, including Member States, ship-owners and NGOs, have been able to express their views and have demonstrated clear support for the objective of the proposal.  \n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nAn impact assessment has been prepared, alongside the legislative proposal, to consider possible alternative options, and asses and compare their impact. Several options have been considered:\n\n\nOption 1: entails a limited amendment to the current regulation to ensure alignment with the Lisbon Treaty provisions.\n\n\nOption 2: entails, in addition to option 1, developing guidelines for interpreting provisions which are not clear or precise enough. This would however leave out a number of objectives set out in the Basic Regulation.\n\n\nOption 3: is based on merely amending the Regulation to address shortcomings, uncertainties and gaps in the current legislation. However it would not enable some issues to be tackled, e.g. the regulation of direct authorisations and prevention of abusive reflagging.\n\n\nOption 4: entails adopting a new regulation with broader scope, including eligibility criteria for the submission for direct authorisations and would also include provisions to prevent abusive cases of reflagging.\n\n\nOption 5: would combine legal certainty with broader scope, thus leading to a complete framework regulating the activity of the EU external fleet abroad. For this reason, this option has been considered as the most effective option for achieving policy objectives, ensuring legal certainty and contributing to the international credibility of the Union. It would optimise environmental benefits linked to the protection of living marine resources and would outweigh possible adaptation costs for operators and administrations in the short term. Finally all options can be considered neutral from a social perspective.\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nThe revision of the FAR is part of the REFIT programme as it aims to simplify the current system, harmonise the various data requirements of the Member States, clarify responsibilities at Union, national, and operator level and increase consistency between the FAR, the Control Regulation and the IUU Regulation.\n\n\nClarification and simplification of the rules should streamline and improve the processing of authorisation requests, bringing more certainty for economic operators and eliminating overlap between relevant actors. This should help to improve the regulatory framework under which the external fleet operates, while enhancing the control of public authorities.   \n\n\n\n\nThe proposal should be supported by appropriate IT tools to simplify the processing and monitoring of fishing authorisations and to encourage the electronic exchange of data between national administrations and the Commission. It will also increase transparency by creating a register on fishing authorisations (containing both a public and a secure part) allowing all stakeholders to access information on the activities of the external fleet, in line with the rules on the processing of personal data.\n\n\nMost of the fleet concerned is composed of industrial fishing vessels, fishing outside EU waters. The owners of these vessels usually own a fleet made up of several vessels and would fall under the SME definition criteria in only limited cases. On that basis, and taking into account the absence of additional cost for private operators, there is no provision for specific measures for micro-enterprises or SMEs in the proposal. Furthermore, the proposal has no negative impact on the competitiveness of EU operators or international trade.\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe Commission envisages the creation of an expert group from national administrations to monitor the implementation of the Regulation as well as an evaluation of the system in place to be made available five years after its entry into force.\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nTitle I \u2014 The Regulation covers all fishing activities carried out by Union vessels outside Union waters. These can therefore be under an access agreement or direct authorisation from the third country, and/or under the umbrella of a regional fisheries management organisation, or on the high seas. The Regulation also covers third country vessels which operate in Union waters. Article 2 is intended to clarify its relationship to other rules dealing with authorisations, which may stem from the bilateral agreements or from the regional fisheries management organisations. These should be considered as special rules, whereas the present Regulation draws up the general framework. In the event of contradiction, the special rules should prevail.\n\n\nTitle II \u2014 Chapter I sets out the essential principle of the Regulation \u2014 that every vessel should be authorised by its flag Member State before fishing outside Union waters, and by the coastal State when the activity takes place in its waters. This authorisation should be given by the flag State only if the eligibility criteria in Article 5 are met, in any context. The responsibility of the flag State is central in this regard. A specific provision on reflagging allows the flag Member State to better identify when the reflagging operation indicates intended non-compliance that should prevent the authorisation being given.\n\n\nTitle II \u2014 Chapter II specifies the additional conditions to be met by Union vessels in order to fish in third country waters, be it under an access agreement or a direct authorisation. A central element is the prohibition to fish under a direct authorisation when an access agreement is in force, unless otherwise provided for in its so-called exclusivity clause, which reflects this principle in the agreements. The principle underpinning this title is that the Union needs to ensure that the activities of its external fleet do not undermine the sustainability of living marine resources within the waters of coastal states. In the case of a direct authorisation, the flag Member State should follow the best available scientific advice and a precautionary approach when authorising its vessels. The Commission is provided with all the relevant information and can intervene if it has doubts as to the compliance of the planned fishing operation with the Regulation.\n\n\nTitle II \u2014 Chapter III lays down the process for carrying out fishing activities under the auspices of an RFMO or on the high seas. The Commission may intervene if it believes the eligibility criteria are not being met. Besides, since some RFMOs also cover Union waters, it is reasonable that Union vessels under the auspices of such RFMOs fall under the scope of this Regulation.  \n\n\nTitle II \u2014 Chapter V lays down basic rules on chartering, which is a particular form of direct authorisation and which has been difficult to monitor so far. The main objective is to provide a legal framework for this practice to be able to better monitor Union vessels fishing under a chartering agreement and to align our legislation with the rules adopted by some RFMOs in this regard.\n\n\nTitle II \u2014 Chapter VI covers the application of the Control Regulation to the activities of the Union external fleet and related obligations in terms of reporting, together with some specific obligations related to the external nature of the activities.\n\n\nTitle III sets out the rules for the authorisation of fishing activities by third country vessels in Union waters. The objective of this part is to ensure that fishing activities taking place in Union waters are subject to the same rules independently of the flag of the vessel, while promoting a level playing field for Union operators and third-country operators in Union waters.\n\n\nTitle IV creates a fishing authorisation register to better monitor the Union external fleet and increase transparency regarding these activities, with part of the register being publicly accessible. People should be able to know at any time which vessel is authorised to fish what and where.\n\n\n2015/0289 (COD)\n\n\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\non the sustainable management of external fishing fleets, repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n12\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n13\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor\n14\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008\n15\n (\u2018FAR\u2019) established a system\u00a0concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Union fishing vessels outside Union waters and the access of third country vessels to Union waters,\n\n\n(2)The Union is a contracting party to the United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\n16\n (UNCLOS) and has ratified the 1995 United Nations Agreement on the Implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks of 4 August 1995 (UN Fish Stock Agreement)\n17\n. These international provisions set out the principle that all states have to adopt appropriate measures to ensure the sustainable management of marine resources and to cooperate with each other to this end.\n\n\n(3)The Union has accepted the Agreement to promote compliance with international conservation and management measures by fishing vessels on the high seas of 24 November 1993 of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO Compliance Agreement)\n18\n. This agreement stipulates that a contracting party is to abstain from granting authorisation to use a vessel for fishing on the high seas if certain conditions are not met, as well as implement sanctions if certain reporting obligations are not fulfilled.\n\n\n(4)The Union has endorsed the FAO International Plan of Action to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and undeclared fishing (IPOA-IUU) adopted in 2001. The IPOA-IUU and the FAO Voluntary Guidelines for flag state performance endorsed in 2014 underlie the responsibility of the flag State to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems. The IPOA-IUU provides that a flag State should issue authorisations to fish in waters outside its sovereignty or jurisdiction to vessels flying its flag. The Voluntary Guidelines also recommend an authorisation be given by the flag State and by the coastal state when the fishing activities take place under a fisheries access agreement or even outside such an agreement. They should both be satisfied that such activities will not undermine the sustainability of the stocks in the coastal state\u2019s waters (paragraphs 40 and 41).\n\n\n(5)The issue of the obligations and concomitant responsibilities and liabilities of the flag State and, where appropriate, the flag international organisation, for the conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas under UNCLOS has increasingly come into focus at international level. This has also been the case, under the heading of a due diligence obligation flowing from UNCLOS, for concurrent coastal State jurisdiction and flag State jurisdiction and, as appropriate, flag international organisation jurisdiction, to secure sound conservation of marine biological resources within sea areas under national jurisdiction. A due diligence obligation is an obligation for a State to exercise best possible efforts and to do the utmost to prevent illegal fishing, which includes the obligation to adopt the necessary administrative and enforcement measures to ensure that fishing vessels flying its flag, its nationals, or fishing vessels engaged in its waters are not involved in activities which breach the applicable conservation and management measures. For these reasons, it is important to organise both the activities of Union fishing vessels outside Union waters as well as the governance system pertaining thereto in such a manner that the Union's international obligations can be efficiently and effectively discharged and that situations where the Union might be reproached for internationally wrongful acts are avoided. \n\n\n(6)The outcomes of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \u2018Rio +20\u2019\n19\n as well as the international developments regarding the fight against illegal wildlife trade should be reflected into the Union's external fisheries policy.\n\n\n(7)The objective of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the \u2018Basic Regulation\u2019)\n20\n, is to ensure that fishing activities are environmentally, economically and socially sustainable and are managed consistently with the objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits, and that they are contributing to the availability of food supplies.\n\n\n(8)Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 stresses the need to promote the objectives of the CFP internationally, ensuring that Union fishing activities outside Union waters are based on the same principles and standards as those applicable under Union law, while promoting a level playing field for Union operators and third-country operators.\n\n\n\n\n(9)Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 was intended to establish common ground for authorising fishing activities to be carried out by Union vessels outside Union waters with a view to supporting the fight against IUU fishing and better control and monitoring of the EU fleet across the globe.\n\n\n(10)Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008\n21\n on IUU fishing was adopted in parallel to Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 and Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (\u2018the Control Regulation\u2019)\n22\n was adopted a year later. Those Regulations are the three implementing pillars of the control and enforcement provisions of the CFP.  \n\n\n(11)However, these three regulations were not implemented consistently; in particular there were inconsistencies between the FAR and the Control Regulation, which was adopted after the FAR Regulation. The implementation of the FAR also revealed several loopholes, since some challenges in terms of control, such as chartering, reflagging and the issuance of fishing authorisations issued by a third country competent authority to a Union fishing vessel outside the framework of a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement (\"direct authorisations\"), were not covered. Besides, some reporting obligations have proven difficult as has the division of administrative roles between the Member States and the Commission.\n\n\n(12)The core principle of the present regulation is that any Union vessel fishing outside Union waters should be authorised by its flag Member State and monitored accordingly, irrespective of where it operates and the framework under which it does so. The issuing of an authorisation should be dependent on a basic set of common eligibility criteria being fulfilled. The information gathered by the Member States and provided to the Commission should allow the latter to intervene in the monitoring of the fishing activities of all Union fishing vessels in any given area outside Union waters at any time.\n\n\n(13)Support vessels may have a substantial impact on the way fishing vessels are able to carry out their fishing activities and on the quantity of fish they can retrieve; it is therefore necessary to take them into account in the authorisation and reporting processes in this regulation.\n\n\n(14)Reflagging operations become an issue when their objective is to circumvent CFP rules or existing conservation and management measures. The Union should therefore be able to define, detect and hamper such operations. Traceability and proper follow-up of compliance history should be ensured throughout a vessel\u2019s lifespan. The requirement that a unique vessel number be granted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) should also serve this purpose.\n\n\n(15)In third country waters, Union vessels may operate either under the provisions of sustainable fisheries partnership agreements concluded between the Union and third countries or by obtaining direct fishing authorisations from third countries if no sustainable fisheries partnership agreement is in force. In both cases these activities should be carried out in a transparent and sustainable way. This is why the flag Member States should be empowered to authorise under a defined set of criteria and subject to monitoring, the vessels flying their flag to seek and obtain direct authorisations from third coastal states. The fishing activity should be authorised once the flag Member State is satisfied that it will not undermine sustainability. Unless the Commission has any further objection, the operator who has been given the authorisation from both the flag Member State and the coastal state should be allowed to start its fishing operation.\n\n\n(16)A specific issue pertaining to sustainable fisheries partnership agreements is the reallocation of under-utilised fishing opportunities that occur when fishing opportunities allocated to Member States by the relevant Council Regulations are not fully used. Since the access costs set out in the sustainable fisheries partnership agreements are financed for a large part by the Union budget, a reallocation system is important to preserve Union financial interests and ensure that no fishing opportunity which has been paid for is wasted. It is therefore necessary to clarify and improve the reallocation system, which should be a last resort mechanism. Its application should be temporary and it should not affect the initial allocation of fishing opportunities among Member States. Reallocation should only occur once the relevant Member States have given up on their rights to exchange fishing opportunities among themselves.\n\n\n(17)Fishing activities under the auspices of regional fisheries management organisations and on the high seas should also be authorised by the flag Member State and comply with regional fisheries management organisation specific rules or Union legislation governing fishing activities on the high seas.\n\n\n(18)Chartering arrangements may undermine the effectiveness of conservation and management measures, as well as have a negative impact on the sustainable exploitation of living marine resources. It is therefore necessary to set out a legal framework that helps the Union to better monitor the activities of Union chartered fishing vessels on the basis of what has been adopted by the relevant regional fisheries management organisation.\n\n\n(19)Procedures should be transparent and predictable for Union and third country operators, as well as for their respective competent authorities.\n\n\n(20)The exchange of data in electronic form between Member States and the Commission, as provided for by the Control Regulation, should be ensured. Member States should collect all requested data about their fleets and their fishing activities, manage it and make it available to the Commission. Moreover, they should cooperate with each other, the Commission and third countries where relevant in order to coordinate these data collection activities.\n\n\n(21)With a view to improving the transparency and accessibility of information on Union fishing authorisations, the Commission should set up an electronic fishing authorisation register comprising both a public and a secure part. Information in the Union fishing authorisation register includes personal data. The processing of personal data based on this Regulation should comply with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n23\n, Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n24\n and applicable national laws.\u00a0\n\n\n(22)With a view to properly addressing access to Union waters of fishing vessels flying the flag of a third country, the relevant rules should be consistent with those applicable to Union fishing vessels, in accordance with the Control Regulation. In particular, Article 33 of that Regulation on the reporting of catch and catch-related data should also apply to third country vessels fishing in Union waters.\n\n\n(23)Fishing vessels from third countries without authorisation under this Regulation should, when navigating in Union waters, be obliged to ensure that their fishing gear is installed in such a manner that it is not readily usable for fishing operations.\n\n\n(24)Member States should be responsible for controlling the fishing activities of third country vessels in Union waters and, in the event of infringements, for recording them in the national register provided for in Article 93 of the Control Regulation. \n\n\n(25)In order to simplify authorisation procedures, a common system of data exchange and data storage should be used by the Member States and the Commission to provide necessary information and updates while minimising administrative burden. In this regard, the data contained in the Union fleet register should be fully used.\n\n\n(26)In order to take into account technological progress and subsequent possible new international law requirements, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of modifications to the Annexes to this Regulation setting out the list of information to be provided by an operator in order to obtain a fishing authorisation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure the simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n\n\n(27)Implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to ensure uniform conditions for implementing the provisions of this Regulation in respect of the recording, format and the transmission of data related to fishing authorisations from the Member States to the Commission and to the Union fishing authorisation register, as well as to lay down a methodology for the reallocation of unused fishing opportunities. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n25\n.\n\n\n(28)The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the reallocation of fishing opportunities, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n\n\n\n\n(29)By reason of the number and importance of the amendments to be made, Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 should be repealed.\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS \n\n\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n\n\nThis Regulation sets out rules for issuing and managing fishing authorisations for:\n\n\n(a)Union fishing vessels operating in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a third country, under the auspices of a regional fisheries management organisation, in or outside Union waters, or on the high seas; and\n\n\n(b)third country fishing vessels operating in Union waters.\n\n\nArticle 2 \nRelationship to international and Union law\n\n\nThis Regulation shall apply without prejudice to the provisions:\n\n\n(a)in sustainable fisheries partnership agreements and similar fisheries agreements concluded between the Union and third countries;\n\n\n(b)adopted by regional fisheries management organisations or similar fisheries organisations to which the Union is a contracting party or a non-contracting cooperating party;\n\n\n(c)in Union legislation implementing or transposing provisions referred to in points (a) and (b).\n\n\nArticle 3\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the definitions in Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 shall apply. In addition, the following definitions shall also apply:\n\n\n(a)\u2018support vessel\u2019 means a vessel that is not equipped with operational fishing gear that facilitates, assists or prepares fishing activities;\n\n\n(b)\u2018fishing authorisation\u2019 means an authorisation issued in respect of a Union fishing vessel or third country fishing vessel, entitling it to carry out specific fishing activities during a specified period, in a given area or for a given fishery under specific conditions;\n\n\n(c)\u2018fishing authorisation register\u2019 means the management system of fishing authorisations and the associated database;\n\n\n(d)\u2018direct authorisation\u2019 means a fishing authorisation issued by a third country competent authority to a Union fishing vessel outside the framework of a sustainable fisheries partnership agreement;\n\n\n(e)\u2018third country waters\u2019 means waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a third country;\n\n\n(f)\u2018observer program\u2019 means a scheme under the auspices of a regional fisheries management organisation that provides observers onboard fishing vessels under certain conditions to verify the vessel's compliance with the rules adopted by that organisation.\n\n\n\n\nTITLE II\nFISHING ACTIVITIES BY UNION FISHING VESSELS OUTSIDE UNION WATERS\n\n\nChapter I \nCommon provisions \n\n\nArticle 4\nGeneral principle\n\n\nWithout prejudice to the requirement to obtain an authorisation from the competent organisation or third country, a Union fishing vessel may not carry out fishing activities outside Union waters unless it has been issued with a fishing authorisation by its flag Member State. \n\n\nArticle 5\nEligibility criteria\n\n\n1.A flag Member State may only issue a fishing authorisation for fishing activities outside Union waters if:\n\n\n(a)it has received complete and accurate information, in accordance with Annexes 1 and 2, about the fishing vessel and the associated support vessel(s), including non-Union support vessels; \n\n\n(b)the fishing vessel has a valid fishing license under Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009;\n\n\n(c)the fishing vessel and any associated support vessel have an IMO number;\n\n\n(d)the operator and the fishing vessel have not been subject to a sanction for a serious infringement according to the national law of the Member State pursuant to Article 42 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 and Article 90 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 during the 12 months prior to the application for the fishing authorisation;\n\n\n(e)the fishing vessel is not included in an IUU vessel list adopted by a regional fisheries management organisation and/or by the Union pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1005/2008;\n\n\n(f)where applicable, fishing opportunities are available to the flag Member State under the fisheries agreement concerned or the relevant provisions of the regional fisheries management organisation;
