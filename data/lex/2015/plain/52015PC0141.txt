This net balance available for EAGF expenditure for\r\n2016 is set by the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2015/141[4] in accordance with\r\nArticle 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and amounts to\r\nEUR 43 949 million.\nIn drawing up the 2016 Draft Budget, the\r\nfirst budgetary estimates for direct payments and market related expenditure\r\nshowed that the net balance available for EAGF expenditure for 2016 is not\r\nlikely to be exceeded and thus there is no need for further financial\r\ndiscipline.\nOn the basis of the above, the Commission\r\npresents a proposal for setting the adjustment rate for direct payments in\r\nrespect of calendar year 2015, which in accordance with Article 26(3) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is to be adopted by the European Parliament and\r\nthe Council by 30 June 2015. If this adjustment rate has not been set by 30\r\nJune 2015, pursuant to the same Article the Commission will set that rate. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThis proposal implements the rules provided\r\nfor in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and Article 8 of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1307/2013. Prior consultation with the interested parties and\r\npreparation of an impact assessment were not applicable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThis proposal sets the percentage rate of\r\nthe financial discipline adjustment rate in respect of calendar year 2015. \nConsidering that Member States have the\r\npossibility to make late payments to farmers outside the regulatory payment\r\nperiod applicable to direct payments and that the financial discipline adjustment\r\nrate varies from one calendar year to another, the amounts of direct payments\r\nto be granted to farmers should not be affected by the financial discipline\r\ndifferently, depending on when the payment is made to farmers by the Member\r\nStates. Therefore, in order to ensure equal treatment between farmers, the\r\nadjustment rate should be applied to amounts of direct payments to be granted\r\nto farmers for aid applications lodged in calendar year 2015 only,\r\nindependently of when the payment will actually be made to the farmer.\nArticle 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1307/2013 lays down that the adjustment rate applied to direct payments should\r\nonly apply to direct payments in excess of EUR 2 000. Bulgaria, Croatia and\r\nRomania are in the process of phasing-in of direct payments in calendar year\r\n2015. As a consequence, the financial discipline will not apply in these Member\r\nStates.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe calculation of the financial discipline\r\nadjustment rate is part of the preparation of the 2016 Draft Budget. \nThe amount of the reserve for crises in the\r\nagricultural sector, foreseen to be included in the Commission 2016 Draft\r\nBudget, amounts to EUR 441.6 million in current prices. The first estimates of\r\nbudget appropriations for direct payments and market related expenditure showed\r\nthat the net balance available for EAGF expenditure for 2016 is not likely to\r\nbe exceeded.\nThus the total reduction resulting from the\r\napplication of financial discipline amounts to EUR 441.6 million. The\r\npercentage of the financial discipline adjustment rate is 1.393041%. It has\r\nbeen calculated taking into account that it is to be applied only to amounts of\r\ndirect payments per farmer in excess of EUR 2 000 and not in all Member\r\nStates.\nThe application of this adjustment rate\r\nwill result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines\r\ncovering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in\r\nrespect of calendar year 2015 (financial year 2016). \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nFurther to determining the adjustment rate\r\nset by the present Regulation, Article 26(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013\r\nalso gives the possibility to the Commission, on the basis of new information\r\nin its possession, to adopt implementing acts adapting this rate. The\r\nCommission will review its forecasts for market related expenditure and direct\r\npayments when preparing the Amending Letter to the 2016 Draft Budget in October\r\n2015, and adopt the adaptation of the adjustment rate, if appropriate by 1\r\nDecember 2015. \n2015/0070 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nfixing the adjustment rate provided for in\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1306/2013 for direct payments in respect of calendar year\r\n2015\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 25 of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[6]\r\nlays down that a reserve intended to provide additional support for the\r\nagricultural sector in the case of major crises affecting the agricultural\r\nproduction or distribution has to be established by applying, at the beginning\r\nof each year, a reduction to direct payments with the financial discipline\r\nmechanism referred to in Article 26 of that Regulation.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 26(1) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1306/2013 lays down that in order to ensure that the\r\nannual ceilings set out in Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013[7] for the financing of\r\nthe market related expenditure and direct payments are respected, an adjustment\r\nrate for direct payments has to be determined when the forecasts for the\r\nfinancing of the measures financed under that sub-ceiling for a given financial\r\nyear indicate that the applicable annual ceilings will be exceeded.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of the reserve\r\nfor crises in the agricultural sector, foreseen to be included in the\r\nCommission 2016 Draft Budget, amounts to EUR 441.6 million in current prices.\r\nTo cover this amount, the financial discipline mechanism has to apply to direct\r\npayments under the support schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No\r\n1307/2013 of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council[8] in respect of calendar year 2015. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The preliminary forecasts\r\nfor the direct payments and market related expenditure to be determined in the\r\nCommission 2016 Draft Budget indicate that there is no need for any further\r\nfinancial discipline.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article 26(2)\r\nof Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 the Commission has to present a proposal\r\nto the European Parliament and to the Council concerning the adjustment rate no\r\nlater than 31 March of the calendar year in respect of which that adjustment\r\nrate applies. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a general rule, farmers\r\nsubmitting an aid application for direct payments for one calendar year (N) are\r\npaid within a fixed payment period falling under the financial year (N+1).\r\nHowever, Member States have the possibility to make late payments, within\r\ncertain limits, to farmers beyond this payment period without any time limits.\r\nSuch late payments may fall in a later financial year. When financial\r\ndiscipline is applied for a given calendar year, the adjustment rate should not\r\nbe applied to payments for which aid applications have been submitted in the\r\ncalendar years other than that for which the financial discipline applies.\r\nTherefore, in order to ensure equal treatment of farmers, it is appropriate to\r\nprovide that the adjustment rate is only applied to payments for which aid\r\napplications have been submitted in the calendar year for which the financial\r\ndiscipline is applied, irrespectively of when the payment to farmers is made.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 8(1) of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1307/2013 lays down that the adjustment rate applied to direct payments\r\ndetermined in accordance with Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is\r\nonly to apply to direct payments in excess of EUR 2 000 to be granted to\r\nfarmers in the corresponding calendar year. Furthermore Article 8(2) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1307/2013 provides\r\nthat as a result of the gradual introduction of direct payments, the adjustment\r\nrate is only to apply to Bulgaria and Romania from 1 January 2016 and to\r\nCroatia from 1 January 2022. The adjustment rate to be determined by the\r\npresent Regulation should therefore not apply to payments to farmers in those\r\nMember States.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Until 1 December 2015 the\r\nadjustment rate fixed by this Regulation may be adapted by the Commission, on\r\nthe basis of new information in its possession, pursuant to Article 26(4) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1306/2013, \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of\r\napplying the adjustment provided for in Articles 25 and 26 of Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 1306/2013 and in\r\naccordance with Article 8(1)\r\nof Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013, the amounts of direct payments under the support\r\nschemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 to be granted to a\r\nfarmer in excess of EUR 2 000 for an aid application submitted in respect\r\nof calendar year 2015 shall be reduced by 1.393041%.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reduction provided for\r\nin paragraph 1 shall not apply in Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of\r\nthe European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the European Parliament\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\nThe President\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n FINANCIAL STATEMENT || FS/15/RB/aj 361752 \n 6.15.2015.1 \n   || DATE: 27/01/2015   \n 1. || BUDGET HEADING: See budgetary forecast after financial discipline per item below: 05 03 01 02 (SAPS) 05 03 01 07 (Redistributive payment) 05 03 01 10 (BPS)* 05 03 01 11 (Payment for agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment) 05 03 01 12 (Payment for areas with natural constraints) 05 03 01 13 (Payment for young farmers) 05 03 02 40 (Area aid for cotton) 05 03 02 50 (POSEI \u2013 Community support programmes) 05 03 02 52 (POSEI \u2013 Aegean Islands) 05 03 02 60 (Voluntary coupled support) 05 03 02 61 (Small farmers scheme) 05 03 10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0(Reserve for crises in agricultural sector) * before taking into account assigned revenue || APPROPRIATIONS: in EUR million 4 236.0 1 251.0 18 307.0   12 239.0 3.0 549.0 241.0 416.0 17.0 4 047.0 p.m. 441.6   \n 2. || TITLE:   Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on fixing the adjustment rate provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 for direct payments in respect of calendar year 2015 \n 3. || LEGAL BASIS:   Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union   \n 4. || AIMS: This regulation sets the financial discipline adjustment rate to be applied to the amounts of direct payments to be granted to farmers in excess of EUR 2 000 for aid applications lodged in respect of calendar year 2015. \n 5. || FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS || 12 MONTH PERIOD (EUR million) || CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR 2015 (EUR million) || FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR 2016 (EUR million) \n 5.0 || EXPENDITURE -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHARGED TO THE EU BUDGET (REFUNDS/INTERVENTIONS) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL AUTHORITIES -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OTHER || - 441.6 + 441.6 || n.a. || - 441.6 + 441.6 \n 5.1 || REVENUE -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OWN RESOURCES OF THE EU (LEVIES/CUSTOMS DUTIES) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 \n 5.0.1 || ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE ||   ||   ||   ||   \n 5.1.1 || ESTIMATED REVENUE ||   ||   ||   ||   \n 5.2 || METHOD OF CALCULATION: See Comments \n 6.0 || CAN THE PROJECT BE FINANCED FROM APPROPRIATIONS ENTERED IN THE RELEVANT CHAPTER OF THE CURRENT BUDGET? || n.a. \n 6.1 || CAN THE PROJECT BE FINANCED BY TRANSFER BETWEEN CHAPTERS OF THE CURRENT BUDGET? || n.a. \n 6.2 || WILL A SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET BE NECESSARY? || NO \n 6.3 || WILL APPROPRIATIONS NEED TO BE ENTERED IN FUTURE BUDGETS? || NO \n OBSERVATIONS:   The calculation of the financial discipline adjustment rate is part of the preparation of the 2016 Draft Budget. The amount of the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, foreseen to be included in the Commission 2016 Draft Budget, amounts to EUR 441.6 million in current prices. Based on the first estimates of budget appropriations for direct payments and market related expenditure, the net balance available for EAGF expenditure for 2016 is not likely to be exceeded. Thus the total reduction resulting from the application of financial discipline amounts to EUR 441.6 million. The percentage of the financial discipline adjustment rate is 1.393041%. It has been calculated taking into account that it is to be applied only to amounts in excess of EUR 2 000 and for each Member State, except Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia. Since direct payments in Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, are in the process of phasing-in in calendar year 2015, the financial discipline will not apply to these Member States as a consequence.
