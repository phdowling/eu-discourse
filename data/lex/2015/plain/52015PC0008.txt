Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the\r\nCommission decided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten\r\namendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments\r\nshould endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they\r\nare responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily\r\nunderstandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a\r\ngiven matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament, the\r\nCouncil and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for\r\nthe fast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community\r\nCode on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen\r\nBorders Code)[3].\r\nThe new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the\r\ncodification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of\r\na preliminary consolidation, in 22 official languages, of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 562/2006 and the instruments amending it, carried out by the\r\nPublications Office of the European Union, by means of a data-processing\r\nsystem. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between\r\nthe old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex X to the\r\ncodified Regulation.\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\n(adapted)\n2015/0006 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\n\u00d6 on \u00d5 a \u00d6 Union \u00d5 Code on the\r\nrules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code)\r\n(codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the Functioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 77(2)(b)\r\nand (e) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00ea \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council[6]\r\nhas been substantially amended\r\nseveral times[7]. In the interests of clarity and rationality, that Regulation\r\nshould be codified.\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 1 (adapted)\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The adoption of measures\r\nunder Article \u00d6 77(2)(b)\r\nand (e) \u00d5 of the Treaty \u00d6 on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) \u00d5 with a view to\r\nensuring the absence of any controls on persons crossing internal borders forms\r\npart of the Union's objective of establishing an area without internal \u00d6 frontiers \u00d5 in which the\r\nfree movement of persons is ensured, as set out in Article \u00d6 26(2) \u00d5 of the \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 .\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 2 (adapted)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n\u00d6 67(2) \u00d5 of the \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 , the creation\r\nof an area in which persons may move freely is to be flanked by other measures.\r\nThe common policy on the crossing of external borders, as provided for by\r\nArticle \u00d6 77(1)(b) \u00d5 of the \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 , is such a\r\nmeasure.\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 3 (adapted)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Common measures on the\r\ncrossing of internal borders by persons and border control at external borders\r\nshould reflect the Schengen acquis incorporated in the European Union\r\nframework, and in particular the relevant provisions of the Convention\r\nimplementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of\r\nthe States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and\r\nthe French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders[8] and the Common Manual[9].\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 5 (adapted)\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Common rules on the\r\nmovement of persons across borders neither call into question nor affect the rights\r\nof free movement enjoyed by Union citizens and members of their families and by\r\nthird-country nationals and members of their families who, under agreements\r\nbetween the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 and its Member\r\nStates, on the one hand, and those third countries, on the other hand, enjoy\r\nrights of free movement equivalent to those of Union citizens.\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 6\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Border control is in the\r\ninterest not only of the Member State at whose external borders it is carried\r\nout but of all Member States which have abolished internal border control.\r\nBorder control should help to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in\r\nhuman beings and to prevent any threat to the Member States' internal security,\r\npublic policy, public health and international relations.\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 7\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Border checks should be\r\ncarried out in such a way as to fully respect human dignity. Border control\r\nshould be carried out in a professional and respectful manner and be\r\nproportionate to the objectives pursued.\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 8 (adapted), 81/2009 recital 1 (adapted)\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Border control comprises\r\nnot only checks on persons at border crossing points and surveillance between \u00d6 those \u00d5 border crossing\r\npoints, but also an analysis of the risks for internal security and of the\r\nthreats that may affect the security of external borders. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to \u00d6 set\r\nout \u00d5 the\r\nconditions, criteria and detailed rules governing checks at border crossing\r\npoints and surveillance at the border, including checks in the Schengen\r\nInformation System \u00d6 (SIS) \u00d5 . \n\u00ea 610/2013\r\nrecital 9 (adapted)\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00d6 It is\r\nnecessary to provide for \u00d5 rules dealing\r\nwith the calculation of the authorised length of short-term stays in the Union. Clear, simple and harmonised rules in all legal acts dealing with this issue would benefit\r\nboth travellers as well as border and visa authorities.\n\u00ea 81/2009 recital\r\n4 (adapted)\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since only a verification\r\nof fingerprints can confirm with certainty that a person wishing to enter the\r\nSchengen area is the person to whom the visa has been issued, provision should\r\nbe made for the use at external borders \u00d6 of the Visa\r\nInformation System (VIS) provided for under Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[10] \u00d5 .\n\u00ea 81/2009 recital\r\n5 (adapted)\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to verify whether\r\nthe entry conditions for third-country nationals laid down in \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation are\r\nfulfilled and to manage their tasks successfully, border guards should use all\r\nnecessary information available, including data which may be consulted in the VIS.\n\u00ea 81/2009 recital\r\n6\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to prevent\r\ncircumvention of border crossing points where the VIS may be used and to\r\nguarantee its full effectiveness, there is a particular need to use the VIS in a harmonised way when entry checks are carried out at the external borders.\n\u00ea 81/2009 recital\r\n7\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since in cases of repeated\r\nvisa applications it is appropriate for biometric data to be reused and copied\r\nfrom the first visa application in the VIS, use of the VIS for entry checks at\r\nthe external borders should be compulsory.\n\u00ea 81/2009 recital\r\n8\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of the VIS should\r\nentail a systematic search in the VIS using the number of the visa sticker in\r\ncombination with a verification of fingerprints. However, given the potential\r\nimpact of such searches on waiting times at border crossing points, it should\r\nbe possible, for a transitional period by way of derogation and in strictly\r\ndefined circumstances, to consult the VIS without a systematic verification of\r\nfingerprints. Member States should ensure that this derogation is used only\r\nwhere the conditions therefor are fully met and that the duration and frequency\r\nof application of this derogation is kept to a strict minimum at the individual\r\nborder crossing points.\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 9 (adapted)\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00d6 It \u00d5 should be \u00d6 possible\r\nto have \u00d5 checks at\r\nexternal borders \u00d6 relaxed \u00d5 in the event\r\nof exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances in order to avoid excessive\r\nwaiting time at border crossing points. The systematic stamping of the\r\ndocuments of third-country nationals remains an obligation in the event of\r\nborder checks being relaxed. Stamping makes it possible to establish, with\r\ncertainty, the date on which, and where, the border was crossed, without\r\nestablishing in all cases that all required travel document control measures\r\nhave been carried out.\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 10 (adapted)\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reduce the\r\nwaiting times of persons enjoying the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 right of free\r\nmovement, separate lanes, indicated by uniform signs in all Member States,\r\nshould, where circumstances allow, be provided at border crossing points.\r\nSeparate lanes should be provided in international airports. Where it is deemed\r\nappropriate and if local circumstances so allow, Member States should consider\r\ninstalling separate lanes at sea and land border crossing points.\n\u00ea 562/2006 recital\r\n11\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should ensure\r\nthat control procedures at external borders do not constitute a major barrier\r\nto trade and social and cultural interchange. To that end, they should deploy\r\nappropriate numbers of staff and resources.\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 12\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\r\ndesignate the national service or services responsible for border-control tasks\r\nin accordance with their national law. Where more than one service is\r\nresponsible in the same Member State, there should be close and constant\r\ncooperation between them.\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 13 (adapted)\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Operational cooperation and\r\nassistance between Member States in relation to border control should be\r\nmanaged and coordinated by the European Agency for the Management of\r\nOperational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States \u00d6 (\u2018Frontex\u2019), \u00d5 established by\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004[11].\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 14\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation is without\r\nprejudice to checks carried out under general police powers and security checks\r\non persons identical to those carried out for domestic flights, to the\r\npossibilities for Member States to carry out exceptional checks on baggage in\r\naccordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 3925/91[12], and to national law\r\non carrying travel or identity documents or to the requirement that persons\r\nnotify the authorities of their presence on the territory of the Member State\r\nin question.\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 16\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In an area where persons\r\nmay move freely, the reintroduction of border control at internal borders\r\nshould remain an exception. Border control should not be carried out or\r\nformalities imposed solely because such a border is crossed.\n\u00ea 1051/2013\r\nrecital 1 (adapted)\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The creation of an area in\r\nwhich the free movement of persons across internal borders is ensured is one of\r\nthe main achievements of the Union. In an area without internal border control,\r\nit is necessary to have a common response to situations seriously affecting the\r\npublic policy or internal security of that area, of parts thereof, or of one or\r\nmore Member States, by allowing for the temporary reintroduction of internal\r\nborder control in exceptional circumstances, but without jeopardising the\r\nprinciple of the free movement of persons. Given the impact that such measures\r\nof last resort may have on all persons having the right to move within the area\r\nwithout internal border control, the conditions and procedures for\r\nreintroducing such measures should be \u00d6 provided\r\nfor \u00d5, in order to\r\nensure that they are exceptional and that the principle of proportionality is\r\nrespected. The scope and duration of any temporary reintroduction of such\r\nmeasures should be restricted to the bare minimum needed to respond to a\r\nserious threat to public policy or internal security.\n\u00ea 1051/2013\r\nrecital 2 (adapted)\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  As free movement of\r\npersons is affected by the temporary reintroduction of internal border control,\r\nany decision to reintroduce such control should be taken in accordance with\r\ncommonly agreed criteria and should be duly notified to the Commission or be\r\nrecommended by a Union institution. In any case, the reintroduction of internal\r\nborder control should remain an exception and should only be effected as a\r\nmeasure of last resort, for a strictly limited scope and period of time, based\r\non specific objective criteria and on an assessment of its necessity which\r\nshould be monitored at Union level. Where a serious threat to public policy or\r\ninternal security requires immediate action, a Member State should be able to\r\nreintroduce border control at its internal borders for a period not exceeding\r\nten days. Any prolongation of that period needs to be monitored at Union level.\n\u00ea 1051/2013\r\nrecital 3\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The necessity and\r\nproportionality of reintroducing internal border control should be balanced\r\nagainst the threat to public policy or internal security triggering the need\r\nfor such reintroduction, as should alternative measures which could be taken at\r\nnational or Union level, or both, and the impact of such control on the free\r\nmovement of persons within the area without internal border control.\n\u00ea 1051/2013\r\nrecital 4\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reintroduction of\r\ninternal border control might exceptionally be necessary in the case of a\r\nserious threat to public policy or to internal security at the level of the\r\narea without internal border control or at national level, in particular\r\nfollowing terrorist incidents or threats, or because of threats posed by\r\norganised crime.\n\u00ea 1051/2013\r\nrecital 5\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Migration and the crossing\r\nof external borders by a large number of third-country nationals should not,\r\nper se, be considered to be a threat to public policy or internal security.\n\u00ea 1051/2013\r\nrecital 6\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\ncase-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, a derogation from the\r\nfundamental principle of free movement of persons must be interpreted strictly\r\nand the concept of public policy presupposes the existence of a genuine,\r\npresent and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental\r\ninterests of society.\n\u00ea 1051/2013\r\nrecital 7\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the experience\r\ngathered with respect to the functioning of the area without internal border\r\ncontrol and in order to help ensure the consistent implementation of the\r\nSchengen acquis, the Commission may draw up guidelines on the\r\nreintroduction of internal border control in cases which require such a measure\r\non a temporary basis and in cases where immediate action is needed. Those\r\nguidelines should provide clear indicators to facilitate the assessment of the\r\ncircumstances that could constitute serious threats to public policy or\r\ninternal security.\n\u00ea 1051/2013 recital\r\n8 (adapted)\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where serious deficiencies\r\nin the carrying out of external border control are identified in an evaluation\r\nreport drawn up pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013[13] and with a view to\r\nensuring compliance with the recommendations adopted pursuant to that\r\nRegulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to\r\nrecommend that the evaluated Member State take specific measures, such as\r\ndeploying European border guard teams, submitting strategic plans or, as a last\r\nresort and taking into account the seriousness of the situation, closing a\r\nspecific border crossing-point. Those powers should be exercised in accordance\r\nwith Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[14]. In the \u00d6 light \u00d5 of Article\r\n2(2)(b)(iii) of that Regulation, the examination procedure is applicable.\n\u00ea 1051/2013\r\nrecital 9\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The temporary\r\nreintroduction of border control at certain internal borders under a specific\r\nUnion-level procedure could also be justified in the case of exceptional\r\ncircumstances and as a measure of last resort where the overall functioning of\r\nthe area without internal border control is put at risk as a result of\r\npersistent serious deficiencies relating to external border control identified\r\nin the context of a rigorous evaluation process in accordance with Articles 14\r\nand 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013, where those circumstances would\r\nconstitute a serious threat to public policy or internal security in that area\r\nor in parts thereof. Such a specific procedure for the temporary reintroduction\r\nof border control at certain internal borders could also be triggered, under\r\nthe same conditions, as a result of the serious negligence by the evaluated Member State of its obligations. In view of the politically sensitive nature of such\r\nmeasures which touch on national executive and enforcement powers regarding\r\ninternal border control, implementing powers to adopt recommendations under\r\nthat specific Union-level procedure should be conferred on the Council, acting\r\non a proposal from the Commission.\n\u00ea 1051/2013\r\nrecital 10 (adapted)\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before any recommendation\r\non the temporary reintroduction of border control at certain internal borders\r\nis adopted, the possibility of resorting to measures aiming to address the\r\nunderlying situation, including assistance by Union bodies, offices or\r\nagencies, such asFrontex\u2019 or the European Police Office (\u2018Europol\u2019),\r\nestablished by Council Decision 2009/371/JHA[15],\r\nand technical or financial support measures at national level, Union level, or\r\nboth, should be fully explored in a timely manner. Where a serious deficiency\r\nis detected, the Commission may provide financial support measures to help the Member State concerned. Moreover, any Commission and Council recommendation should be based\r\non substantiated information.\n\u00ea 1051/2013\r\nrecital 11\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should have\r\nthe possibility to adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in\r\nduly justified cases relating to the need to prolong border control at internal\r\nborders, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n\u00ea 1051/2013\r\nrecital 12 (adapted)\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The evaluation reports and\r\nthe recommendations referred to in Articles 14 and 15 of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1053/2013 should form the basis for the triggering of the specific measures in\r\nthe case of serious deficiencies relating to external border control and of the\r\nspecific procedure in case of exceptional circumstances putting the overall functioning\r\nof the area without internal border control at risk provided for in this\r\nRegulation. The Member States and the Commission \u00d6 should \u00d5 jointly\r\nconduct regular, objective and impartial evaluations in order to verify the correct\r\napplication of this Regulation and the Commission coordinates the evaluations\r\nin close cooperation with the Member States. The evaluation mechanism \u00d6 should \u00d5 consist of the\r\nfollowing elements: multiannual and annual evaluation programmes, announced and\r\nunannounced on-site visits carried out by a small team of Commission\r\nrepresentatives and of experts designated by Member States, reports on the\r\noutcome of the evaluations adopted by the Commission and recommendations for remedial\r\naction adopted by the Council on a proposal from the Commission, appropriate\r\nfollow-up, monitoring and reporting.\n\u00ea 610/2013\r\nrecital 11 (adapted)\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU\r\nshould be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of additional\r\nmeasures governing surveillance as well as amendments to the Annexes to \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry\r\nout appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert\r\nlevel. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should\r\nensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\r\ndocuments to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n\u00ea 562/2006\r\nrecital 20\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation respects\r\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the\r\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

Where, in the area without internal\r\nborder control, there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security\r\nin a Member State, that Member State may exceptionally reintroduce border\r\ncontrol at all or specific parts of its internal borders for a limited period\r\nof up to 30 days or for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat if\r\nits duration exceeds 30 days. The scope and duration of the temporary\r\nreintroduction of border control at internal borders shall not exceed what is\r\nstrictly necessary to respond to the serious threat.\n2. Border control at internal borders shall\r\nonly be reintroduced as a last resort, and in accordance with Articles 27, 28\r\nand 29. The criteria referred to, respectively, in Articles 26 and 30 shall be\r\ntaken into account in each case where a decision on the reintroduction of\r\nborder control at internal borders is considered pursuant, respectively, to\r\nArticle 27, 28 or 29.\n3. If the serious threat to public policy\r\nor internal security in the Member State concerned persists beyond the period\r\nprovided for in paragraph 1 of this Article, that Member State may prolong\r\nborder control at its internal borders, taking account of the criteria referred\r\nto in Article 26 and in accordance with Article 27, on the same grounds as\r\nthose referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and, taking into account any\r\nnew elements, for renewable periods of up to 30 days.\n4.

The information referred to in paragraph\r\n1 and any Commission or Member State opinion under paragraph 4 shall be the\r\nsubject of consultation, including, where appropriate, joint meetings between\r\nthe Member State planning to reintroduce border control at internal borders,\r\nthe other Member States, especially those directly affected by such measures,\r\nand the Commission, with a view to organising, where appropriate, mutual\r\ncooperation between the Member States and to examining the proportionality of\r\nthe measures to the events giving rise to the reintroduction of border control\r\nand the threat to public policy or internal security.\n6. The consultation referred to in\r\nparagraph 5 shall take place at least ten days before the date planned for the\r\nreintroduction of border control.\nArticle 28\nSpecific\r\nprocedure for cases requiring immediate action\n1. Where a serious threat to public policy\r\nor internal security in a Member State requires immediate action to be taken,\r\nthe Member State concerned may, on an exceptional basis, immediately\r\nreintroduce border control at internal borders, for a limited period of up to\r\nten days.\n2. Where a Member State reintroduces border\r\ncontrol at internal borders, it shall at the same time notify the other Member\r\nStates and the Commission accordingly, and shall supply the information\r\nreferred to in Article 27(1), including the reasons that justify the use of the\r\nprocedure set out in this Article. The Commission may consult the other Member\r\nStates immediately upon receipt of the notification.\n3. If the serious threat to public policy\r\nor internal security persists beyond the period provided for in paragraph 1,\r\nthe Member State may decide to prolong the border control at internal borders\r\nfor renewable periods of up to 20 days. In doing so, the Member State concerned\r\nshall take into account the criteria referred to in Article 26 , including an\r\nupdated assessment of the necessity and the proportionality of the measure, and\r\nshall take into account any new elements.\nIn the event of such a prolongation, the\r\nprovisions of Article 27(4) and (5) shall apply mutatis mutandis, and\r\nthe consultation shall take place without delay after the decision to prolong\r\nhas been notified to the Commission and to the Member States.\n4.

The Commission shall inform the European\r\nParliament without delay of notifications made under this Article.\nArticle 29\nSpecific\r\nprocedure where exceptional circumstances put the overall functioning of the\r\narea without internal border control at risk\n1. In exceptional circumstances where the\r\noverall functioning of the area without internal border control is put at risk\r\nas a result of persistent serious deficiencies relating to external border\r\ncontrol as referred to in Article 21 , and insofar as those circumstances\r\nconstitute a serious threat to public policy or internal security within the\r\narea without internal border control or within parts thereof, border control at\r\ninternal borders may be reintroduced in accordance with paragraph 2 of this\r\nArticle for a period of up to six months. That period may be prolonged, no more\r\nthan three times, for a further period of up to six months if the exceptional\r\ncircumstances persist.\n2. The Council may, as a last resort and as\r\na measure to protect the common interests within the area without internal\r\nborder control, where all other measures, in particular those referred to in\r\nArticle 21(1), are ineffective in mitigating the serious threat identified,\r\nrecommend that one or more Member States decide to reintroduce border control at\r\nall or at specific parts of their internal borders. The Council's\r\nrecommendation shall be based on a proposal from the Commission. The Member\r\nStates may request the Commission to submit such a proposal to the Council for\r\na recommendation.\nIn its recommendation, the Council shall at\r\nleast indicate the information referred to in Article 27(1)(a) to (e).\nThe Council may recommend a prolongation in\r\naccordance with the conditions and procedure set out in this Article.\nBefore a Member State reintroduces border control\r\nat all or at specific parts of its internal borders under this paragraph, it\r\nshall notify the other Member States, the European Parliament and the\r\nCommission accordingly.\n3. In the event that the recommendation\r\nreferred to in paragraph 2 is not implemented by a Member State, that Member\r\nState shall without delay inform the Commission in writing of its reasons.\nIn such a case, the Commission shall\r\npresent a report to the European Parliament and to the Council assessing the\r\nreasons provided by the Member State concerned and the consequences for\r\nprotecting the common interests of the area without internal border control.\n4. On duly justified grounds of urgency\r\nrelating to situations where the circumstances giving rise to the need to\r\nprolong border control at internal borders in accordance with paragraph 2\r\nbecome known less than 10 days before the end of the preceding reintroduction\r\nperiod, the Commission may adopt any necessary recommendations by means of\r\nimmediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure\r\nreferred to in Article 38(3). Within 14 days of the adoption of such\r\nrecommendations, the Commission shall submit to the Council a proposal for a\r\nrecommendation in accordance with paragraph 2 \u00d6 of this\r\nArticle \u00d5.\n5. This Article shall be without prejudice\r\nto measures that may be adopted by the Member States in the event of a serious\r\nthreat to public policy or internal security under Articles 25, 27 and 28.\nArticle 30\nCriteria\r\nfor the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders where\r\nexceptional circumstances put the overall functioning of the area without\r\ninternal border control at risk\n1.
