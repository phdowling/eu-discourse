Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 is\r\napplied by all Member States, with the exception of Ireland and the United\r\nKingdom. \nRegulation (EU)\r\nNo 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council[2] amended Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 539/2001 by transferring 19 countries to Annex II, which lists the third\r\ncountries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement. Those 19\r\ncountries are: Colombia, Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,\r\nMicronesia, Nauru, Palau, Peru, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. The reference to each of those countries in\r\nAnnex II is accompanied by a footnote which specifies that \"the exemption\r\nfrom the visa requirement shall apply from the date of entry into force of an\r\nagreement on visa exemption to be concluded with the European Union\". \nRegulation (EU)\r\nNo 509/2014 was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June\r\n2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to\r\nauthorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the\r\nfollowing 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,\r\nMicronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa,\r\nSolomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United\r\nArab Emirates and Vanuatu[3].\r\nOn 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the\r\nCommission.\nColombia and\r\nPeru are, according to Recital 5 of Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 and the\r\njoint declaration issued at the time of adoption, subject to a specific\r\nprocedure which requires a further assessment of the fulfilment by them of the\r\nrelevant criteria, before the Commission can present to the Council\r\nrecommendations for decisions authorising the opening of negotiations on visa\r\nwaiver agreements with those two countries. They were therefore not included in\r\nthe above-mentioned Recommendation to the Council.\u00a0 \nThe negotiations on the visa waiver\r\nagreement with Dominica and the four other Caribbean countries were opened on\r\n12 November 2014 in Brussels. During that meeting the entire draft text could\r\nbe reviewed and agreement was reached on most of its aspects. The\r\nrepresentatives from the Caribbean countries insisted however on clarifying\r\ncertain provisions in Articles 6(2)(c), 8(1) and 8(4). After a number of\r\nsubsequent informal exchanges, minor modifications to those Articles were\r\naccepted by the Commission. The agreement was initialled by the chief\r\nnegotiators on 11 December 2014. \nThe Member States were informed during the\r\nmeeting of the Visa Working Party of the Council held on 21 November 2014.\nOn the part of the Union, the legal basis\r\nfor the agreement is point (a) of Article 77(2) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjunction with Article 218\r\nthereof.\nThe attached\r\nproposal constitutes the legal instrument for the signature of the agreement.\r\nThe Council will decide by qualified majority. \nTaking into account\r\nthe fact that Dominica will be able to complete its internal ratification\r\nprocedure quickly and the long period of time since the Commission first\r\nproposed to exempt citizens of Dominica from the visa requirement (November\r\n2012), the proposed decision on the signature sets out the provisional\r\napplication of the agreement as from the date of its signature in accordance\r\nwith Article 218(5) TFEU. Considering the need for the European Parliament\u2019s\r\nconsent before the agreement is concluded, the Commission will inform the\r\nEuropean Parliament of the provisional application of the agreement. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OUTCOME OF THE\r\nNEGOTIATIONS\nThe Commission\r\nconsiders that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives\r\nwere attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the\r\nUnion.\nThe final\r\ncontent of it can be summarised as follows:\nPurpose\nThe agreement provides for visa-free travel\r\nfor the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Dominica when\r\ntravelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period\r\nof 90 days in any 180-day period. \nIn order to safeguard equal treatment of\r\nall EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that\r\nDominica may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the\r\nMember States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or\r\nterminate the agreement\u00a0 in respect of all of its Member States.\nThe specific\r\nsituation of the United Kingdom and Ireland is reflected in the preamble. \nScope\nThe visa waiver covers all categories of\r\npersons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders)\r\ntravelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a\r\npaid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Dominica\r\nremain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party\r\nin accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure\r\nharmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the\r\ninterpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of\r\ncarrying out a paid activity.\nDuration of stay\nThe agreement provides for visa-free travel\r\nfor the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Dominica when\r\ntravelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period\r\nof 90 days in any 180-day period. A joint declaration on the interpretation of\r\nthis period of 90 days is attached to the agreement. \nThe agreement takes into account the\r\nsituation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis\r\nin full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal\r\nborders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Dominica to stay\r\nfor 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States\r\n(Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated\r\nfor the whole Schengen area.\nTerritorial application\nThe agreement contains provisions related\r\nto its territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the\r\nvisa waiver would entitle nationals of Dominica to stay only in those Member\r\nStates\u2019 European territories.\nDeclarations\nOther joint\r\ndeclarations are attached to the agreement:\n- on the full\r\ndissemination of information about the content and consequences of the visa\r\nwaiver agreement and related issues, such as the entry conditions, and\n- on the\r\nassociation of Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the\r\nimplementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONCLUSIONS\nIn the light of\r\nthe above-mentioned results, the Commission proposes that the Council\n\u2013     \r\ndecide that the agreement be signed on behalf of\r\nthe Union and authorise the President of the Council to appoint the person(s)\r\nduly empowered to sign on behalf of the Union;\n\u2013     \r\napprove the provisional application of the\r\nagreement pending its entry into force.\n2015/0048 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the Union,\r\nand provisional application of the Agreement between the European Union and the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica on the short-stay visa waiver\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular point (a) of\r\nArticle 77(2) in conjunction with Article 218(5), thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nCommission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and\r\nthe Council[4]\r\ntransferred from Annex I to Annex II of Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n539/2001[5]\r\nthe reference to Dominica. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reference to that\r\ncountry is accompanied by a footnote indicating that the exemption from the\r\nvisa requirement shall apply from the date of entry into force of an agreement\r\non visa exemption to be concluded with the European Union.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\u00a0 decision of 9 October\r\n2014, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate an agreement between\r\nthe European Union and Dominica on the short-stay visa waiver.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Negotiations on the\r\nagreement were opened on 12 November 2014.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement initialled\r\nby exchange of letters on 11 December 2014 should be signed and the attached\r\ndeclarations be approved.
