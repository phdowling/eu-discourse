Associated draft amendments to\r\nMARPOL Annexes I, II, IV and V of the MARPOL Convention were also approved by\r\nMEPC 67 with a view to adoption at MEPC 68. The Polar Code has been developed\r\nto supplement existing IMO instruments in order to increase the safety of\r\nship's operation and mitigate the impact on the people and environment in the\r\nremote, vulnerable and potentially harsh polar waters. \nThese changes to MARPOL are set out in Annex\r\n11 in the MEPC 67 report (MEPC 67/20). Paragraph 9.45 of that report indicates\r\nthat the changes will be adopted at MEPC 68.\u00a0 \n1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to the 2009\r\nGuidelines for exhaust gas cleaning systems\nThe IMO Sub-committee on Pollution Prevention\r\nand Response (PPR 2) approved draft amendments to the 2009 Guidelines for\r\nexhaust gas cleaning systems, set out in resolution MEPC.184(59), with a view\r\nto adoption at MEPC 68. The 2009 guidelines for exhaust gas cleaning systems\r\nshould provide clarity on the testing of scrubbers connected to ship machinery\r\nitems that cannot be tested at higher loads, or tested at all while \"at\r\nrest in harbour\". The draft amendments, based on EU proposals, concern the\r\nuse of a calculation-based methodology, such as computational fluid dynamics and/or\r\nthe use of established empiric formulae, to be a feasible alternative to the\r\nmeasurements and are set out in sections 6, 6.9, 10.1.2.1(ii) and 10.1.2.2 of\r\nthe 2009 Guidelines.\nThese changes to the 2009 Guidelines for\r\nexhaust gas cleaning systems are set out in Annex 1 in the PPR 2 report (PPR\r\n2/21). Paragraph 2.23 of that report indicates that the changes will be adopted\r\nat MEPC 68. \n1.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to SOLAS\r\nregulation II-2/20.3\nMSC 94 approved draft amendments to SOLAS\r\nregulation II-2/20.3 which will allow operation of the ventilation fans at a\r\ndecreased number of air changes when an air quality control system is in place\r\nin accordance with MSC/Circ.729 on Design guidelines and operational\r\nrecommendations for ventilation systems in ro-ro cargo spaces. The draft\r\namendments apply to cargo and passenger ships in vehicle, special category and\r\nro-ro spaces. \nThese changes are set out in Annex 11 to the\r\nMSC 94 report (MSC 94/21/add.1). Paragraph 8.7 of the MSC 94 report (MSC 94/21)\r\nindicates that the changes will be adopted at MSC 95. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADOPTION OF THE IMO\r\nAMENDMENTS\n2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of amendments \nThe amendments set out in points 1.1 - 1.3\r\nabove were approved at the 67th session of the Marine Environment\r\nProtection Committee meeting between 13 - 17 October 2014, the 94th\r\nsession of the Maritime Safety Committee meeting between 17 - 21 November 2014,\r\nthe 2nd session of the Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and\r\nResponse meeting between 19 - 23 January 2015 and are to be submitted for\r\nadoption to the 68th session of the Marine Environment Protection\r\nCommittee between 11 \u2013 16 May 2015 and the 95th session of the\r\nMaritime Safety Committee between 3 - 12 June 2015.\n2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Acceptance and entry into\r\nforce\nOnce adopted by the two Committees, the\r\namendments set out in points 1.1 and 1.3, above will be submitted to the\r\nrespective contracting parties in order for these to express their consent to\r\nbe bound by the said amendments. The resolution which will set out the\r\namendments to the 2009 Guidelines for exhaust gas cleaning systems referred to\r\nin point 1.2 above will indicate the date of entry into force.\u00a0 \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RELEVANT EU LEGISLATION AND EU COMPETENCE\n3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to MARPOL\r\nAnnexes I and II\nArticle 3 of Directive 2005/35/EC on\r\nship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties, including criminal\r\npenalties, for pollution offences sets out that this Directive applies in high\r\nseas. Some areas of the polar waters covered by the Polar Code are considered\r\nas high seas. In accordance with Article 2, the Directive applies to discharges\r\nof polluting substances, which shall mean substances covered by Annexes I (oil)\r\nand II (noxious liquid substances in bulk) to MARPOL 73/78. The purpose of\r\nDirective 2005/35/EC is to incorporate international standards for ship source\r\npollution into EU law, and to ensure that polluters are adequately penalised. In accordance with Article 4 of the Directive, Member States shall\r\nensure that ship-source discharges of polluting substances, including minor\r\ncases of such discharges, into any of the areas referred to in Article\r\n3(1) are regarded as infringements if committed with intent, recklessly or\r\nwith serious negligence. \nThe relevant sections are set out in Part II-A\r\nof the Polar Code on Pollution Prevention Measures, in which Chapters 1 and 2\r\ndeal with prevention of pollution by oil and control of pollution by noxious\r\nliquid substances in bulk. \nTherefore, the amendments due to be adopted at\r\nMEPC 68, which would introduce changes to MARPOL concerning the Polar Code\r\nwould affect EU law, through the application of Directive 2005/35/EC.\n3.2 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to the 2009\r\nGuidelines for exhaust gas cleaning systems\nThe 2009 Guidelines for exhaust gas cleaning\r\nsystems, set out in Resolution MEPC.184(59), are referred to in Annex II of\r\nDirective 2012/33/EU as\r\nregards the sulphur content of marine fuels as a principal\r\nmechanism for ensuring compliance with the Directive (the Sulphur Directive), in relation to conditions for the use of Exhaust Gas Cleaning\r\nSystems under that Directive, in particular the use of emission abatement\r\nmethods set out in Article 4c. \nThe amendments due to be adopted at MEPC 68,\r\nwhich would introduce changes to the 2009 Guidelines, would affect EU law\r\nthough the application of Directive 2012/33/EU. \n3.3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to SOLAS regulations II-2/20.3.1.2.1\nSOLAS regulation II-2/20.3.1.2.1, in which the\r\nissue of performance of ventilation systems is regulated, refers to the\r\nprotection of vehicle, special category and ro-ro spaces and applies to\r\npassenger ships. \nThe amendments to be adopted at MSC 95, which\r\nwould introduce changes to  SOLAS regulation II-2/20.3, would affect EU\r\nlaw though the application of Directive 2009/45/EC on safety rules and\r\nstandards for passenger ships. Article 6(2)(a)(i) establishes that new\r\npassenger ships of Class A shall comply entirely with the requirements of the\r\n1974 SOLAS Convention, as amended. Furthermore the Commission notes that\r\n Directive 2009/45/EC contains detailed rules on the ventilation of\r\npassenger ships for Class B, C and D ships which are identical to those found\r\nin SOLAS, as laid down in Annex I, Chapter II, Part B, paragraph 9. \u00a0\n3.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary\nIn view of the relevant EU legislation, the\r\nCommission considers that the adoption of the above-cited amendments expected\r\nto be adopted at MEPC 68 and MSC 95 comes under EU exclusive competence, which\r\nthe Union has acquired pursuant to Article 3(2) TFEU, in so far as the adoption\r\nof the international instruments at stake affect common rules. \nConsistent with a well consolidated body of\r\ncase law, even if the Union is not a member of IMO, the Member States are not\r\nauthorised to assume obligations likely to affect EU rules promulgated for the\r\nattainment of the objectives of the Treaties, unless they are authorised to do\r\nso by means of a Council decision, on a proposal by the Commission \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\nThe Commission therefore proposes a Council\r\nDecision on the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union for the\r\namendments cited in paragraphs 1.1 \u2013 1.3 above to be adopted at the 68th\r\nsession of the Marine Environment Protection Committee and the 95th\r\nsession of the Maritime Safety Committee respectively.\u00a0 \n2015/0071 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted on behalf of\r\nthe European Union at the International Maritime Organization during the 68th\r\nsession of the Marine Environment Protection Committee and the 95th session of\r\nthe Maritime Safety Committee on the adoption of amendments to MARPOL, SOLAS\r\nand the 2009 Guidelines for exhaust gas cleaning systems \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) and Article\r\n218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Action by the European\r\nUnion in the sector of maritime transport should aim to improve maritime safety\r\nand to protect the marine environment. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMO Marine Environment\r\nProtection Committee (MEPC) meeting at its 67th session approved\r\namendments to MARPOL. Those amendments are expected to be adopted in the 68th\r\nsession of the MEPC to be held in May 2015. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMO Sub-committee on\r\nPollution Prevention and Response (PPR) meeting at its 2nd session\r\napproved draft amendments to the 2009 Guidelines for exhaust gas cleaning\r\nsystems. Those amendments are expected to be adopted in the 68th\r\nsession of the MEPC to be held in May 2015.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMO Maritime Safety\r\nCommittee (MSC) meeting at its 94th session approved amendments to\r\nSOLAS and the STCW Convention and Code. Those amendments are expected to be\r\nadopted in the 95th session of the MSC to be held in June 2015.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to Annexes\r\nI and II of the MARPOL Convention will introduce measures associated with the\r\nadoption of the draft International Code for ships operating in polar waters\r\n(Polar Code), to make the Polar Code mandatory. The\r\nPolar Code extends the current MARPOL ban on oil/noxious liquid discharges in\r\nthe Antarctic to Polar Waters. Article 4, together with Article 3(1), of\r\nDirective 2005/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[1],\r\nestablishes that Member States\r\nshall ensure that ship-source discharges of polluting substances, including\r\nminor cases of such discharges, are regarded as infringements if committed with\r\nintent, recklessly or with serious negligence and therefore covers these\r\nissues. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to the 2009 Guidelines for exhaust gas cleaning systems will introduce the use of a calculation-based methodology for the\r\ntesting of scrubbers connected to ship machinery items that cannot be tested at\r\nhigher loads, or tested at all while \"at rest in harbour\". Article 4c\r\nand Annex II of Council Directive 1999/32/EC[2], as amended, covers these issues and Annex II is derived\r\nfrom the 2009 Guidelines which will be amended. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\namendments to SOLAS II-2/20.3.1.2.1 will allow operation of the ventilation\r\nfans at a decreased number of air changes when an air quality control system is\r\nin place for passenger ships in vehicle, special category and ro-ro spaces. Article 6(2)(a)(i) of Directive 2009/45/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[3] establishes that new passenger\r\nships of Class A shall comply entirely with the requirements of the 1974 SOLAS\r\nConvention, as amended, including Regulation II-2/20.3. Hence the changes to be adopted will have a direct legal effect on the\r\nDirective 2009/45/EC.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union is neither a\r\nmember of the IMO nor a contracting party to the conventions and codes\r\nconcerned. It is therefore necessary for the Council to authorise the Member\r\nStates to express the position of the Union and express their consent to be\r\nbound by these amendments.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe position of the Union at the 68th\r\nsession of the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee shall be to agree to\r\nthe adoption of the following amendments to:\n\u2013                        \r\nMARPOL Annexes I and II as laid down in Annex 11 in IMO Document MEPC 67/20;\n\u2013                        \r\nthe 2009 Guidelines for exhaust gas cleaning systems as laid down in Annex 1 in IMO Document PPR 2/21.\nArticle 2\nThe position of the Union at the 95th\r\nsession of the IMO Maritime Safety Committee shall be to agree to the adoption\r\nof the following amendment to\n\u2013                        \r\nSOLAS regulation II-2/20.3.1.2.1 as laid down in\r\nAnnex 11 in IMO Document MSC 94/21/add.1.\nArticle 3\nThe position of the Union as set out in\r\nArticles 1 and 2 shall be expressed by the Member States, which are members of\r\nIMO, acting jointly in the interest of the Union.\nArticle 4\nFormal and minor changes to the positions\r\nreferred to in Articles 1 and 2 may be agreed without requiring the position to\r\nbe amended.\nArticle 5\nMember States are hereby authorised to give\r\ntheir consent to be bound, in the interest of the Union, by the amendments\r\nreferred to in Articles 1 and Article 2.\nArticle 6\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member\r\nStates.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive\r\n2005/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on\r\nship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties, including criminal\r\npenalties, for pollution offences (OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, p. 11) \n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 1999/32/EC of 26 April 1999\r\nrelating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels and\r\namending Directive 93/12/EEC (OJ L 121, 11.5.1999, p. 13)\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2009/45/EC of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council of 6 May 2009 on safety rules and \nstandards for passenger ships (OJ L\r\n163, 25.6.2009, p. 1)\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
