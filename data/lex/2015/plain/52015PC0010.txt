The current level is\r\nwell below what historical trends would imply, and \u2013 in the absence of action \u2013\r\nprojections point towards an only partial rebound over the coming years.\r\nEconomic recovery, job creation, long-term growth and competitiveness are being\r\nhampered as a result. This investment gap poses risks to reaching the targets\r\nset by the Europe 2020 Strategy. The President of the European Commission in\r\nhis Political Guidelines for the Commission 2014-2019 therefore identified this\r\nissue as a key policy challenge, as did the European Council on 18 December\r\n2014 (EUCO 237/14) as well as the Group of Twenty Leaders' Summit on 15-16\r\nNovember 2014. \nGeneral\r\nuncertainty about the economic situation, high levels of public and private\r\ndebt in parts of the EU economy and their impact on credit risk limit the room\r\nfor manoeuvre. However, significant levels of savings and high levels of\r\nfinancial liquidity exist. Moreover, recent enquiries conducted jointly by the\r\nEuropean Commission, the European Investment Bank and EU Member States have\r\nconfirmed that a significant number of viable investment projects remains\r\nunfunded. \nAgainst this\r\nbackdrop, in its Communication \"An Investment Plan for Europe\",\r\npublished on the 26 November 2014, the Commission proposed an EU-level\r\ninitiative to address this issue. The Plan is based on three mutually\r\nreinforcing strands. First, the mobilisation of at least EUR 315 billion in\r\nadditional investment over the next three years, maximising the impact of\r\npublic resources and unlocking private investment. Second, targeted initiatives\r\nto make sure that this extra investment meets the needs of the real economy.\r\nAnd third, measures to provide greater regulatory predictability and to remove\r\nbarriers to investment, making Europe more attractive and thereby multiplying\r\nthe impact of the Plan.\nThis proposal\r\ncreates the necessary legal framework and provides the budgetary allocations\r\nfor the first two strands of the Plan in the framework of the EU's legal order.\r\nUpon adoption of the proposed regulation, it will be implemented jointly by the\r\nCommission and the European Investment Bank (EIB), as strategic partners, with\r\nthe clear aim of rallying stakeholders at all levels. For the third strand of\r\nthe Investment Plan concerning the regulatory environment and the removal of\r\nbarriers to investment, the Commission has set out a first set of actions in\r\nits Work Programme, adopted on 16 December 2014 (COM(2014)\r\n910). The Commission will also work together with the\r\nother EU Institutions and the Member States in the context of the European\r\nSemester as far as these matters are concerned.\nGiven the key\r\nrole which small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play in the EU economy,\r\nespecially in terms of employment creation, they will be a key beneficiary of\r\nthe support provided for under this proposal. \nIn this area as\r\nwell, the design and features of those mechanisms are based on existing\r\nexperience with innovative financing instruments employed jointly between the\r\nEU and the EIB Group.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nPresident Juncker presented the Investment\r\nPlan to the European Parliament on 26 November. Moreover, the Investment Plan\r\nwas endorsed by the European Council on 18 December 2014. The European Council\r\nalso invited the Union legislators to agree on the necessary legal text by June,\r\nso that the new investments could be activated as early as mid-2015. \nThe legal, economic and financial concepts\r\nunderpinning this proposal have been extensively discussed with the European\r\nInvestment Bank Group and informally discussed with public and private sector\r\nrepresentatives. Stakeholders from the private sector have particularly\r\nemphasised the importance of robust quality criteria and an independent\r\nselection of projects that could be supported by the Plan. More specifically,\r\nit was recommended that the projects should be (1) economically viable with the\r\nsupport of the initiative, (2) sufficiently mature to be appraised on a global\r\nor local basis, (3) of European added value and consistent with EU policy\r\npriorities (such as, for example, the 2030 climate and energy package, Europe\r\n2020 Strategy and other long-term EU strategic priorities). Moreover, projects\r\nshould not be limited to cross-border projects (such as the case with TEN-T and\r\nTEN-E projects).\nThe Commission additionally gained\r\nimportant insights from its involvement in the Special Task Force on Investment\r\nin the EU. The overall objective of the Task Force was to provide an overview\r\nof the main investment trends and needs; analyse the main barriers and\r\nbottlenecks to investment; propose practical solutions to overcome those\r\nbarriers and bottlenecks; identify strategic investments with EU added value\r\nthat could be undertaken in the short run; and make recommendations for\r\ndeveloping a credible and transparent pipeline for the medium to long term.\r\nThis work has been taken into account for the current proposal.\nThe final task force report is available on the following web site: \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/priorities/jobs-growth-investment/plan/docs/special-task-force-report-on-investment-in-the-eu_en.pdf\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal bases for this proposal are\r\nArticles 172, 173, Article 175(3) and Article 182(1) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union. This proposal sets out the legal framework necessary\r\nto implement the first two strands of the \"Investment Plan for\r\nEurope\". \nIn accordance with the principles of\r\nsubsidiarity and proportionality set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\r\nUnion, the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by\r\nthe Member States and can therefore be better achieved by the EU. By reason of\r\nthe disparities in Member States' fiscal capacity to act, action at Union level\r\ncan better achieve the objectives pursued, by reason of its scale and effects.\r\nMore specifically, the EU level will provide for economies of scale in the use\r\nof innovative financial instruments by catalysing private investment in the\r\nwhole EU and making best use of the European Institutions and their expertise\r\nand knowledge for that purpose. The multiplying effect and the impact on the\r\nground will thus be much higher than what could be achieved by an investment\r\noffensive in a single Member State or a Group of Member States. The Union's Single\r\nMarket, together with the fact that there will be no country-specific or\r\nsectorial project allocation, will provide for greater attractiveness for\r\ninvestors and lower aggregated risks. The proposal does not go beyond what is necessary\r\nto achieve the objectives pursued. \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Creating a European Fund for\r\nStrategic Investments and Establishing a European Investment Advisory Hub (Articles\r\n1-3)\nArticle 1 of the proposal empowers the\r\nCommission to conclude with the EIB an agreement on the establishment of the\r\n\"European Fund for Strategic Investments\" (EFSI) to support\r\ninvestments in the Union and to ensure increased access to financing for\r\ncompanies having up to 3000 employees, with a particular focus on small and\r\nmedium enterprises, through the supply of risk bearing capacity to the EIB.\r\nArticle 2 of the proposal establishes that this EU guarantee is to be allocated\r\nto specific EIB financing investment operations through the EFSI. \nThe use of the EU guarantee to the EFSI is\r\nto be subject to the governance structures determined therein. Notably, the\r\nEFSI shall have a Steering Board (Article 3) which determines the strategic\r\norientation, the strategic asset allocation and operating policies and procedures,\r\nincluding the investment policy of projects that EFSI can support and the risk\r\nprofile of the EFSI. An Investment Committee, consisting of independent\r\nprofessionals, shall be responsible for examining potential operations and\r\napproving the support for operations irrespective of the geographic location of\r\nthe project concerned. \nMembers of the Steering Board are appointed\r\nby the contributors of risk bearing capacity with voting power proportional to\r\nthe size of contributions. For as long as the only contributors to the EFSI are\r\nthe Union and the EIB, the number of members and votes within the Steering\r\nBoard shall be allocated based on the respective size of contributions in the\r\nform of cash or guarantees and all decisions shall be taken by consensus.\u00a0 \nWhen other parties accede to the EFSI\r\nAgreement, the number of members and votes within the Steering Board shall be\r\nallocated based on the respective size of contributions from contributors in\r\nthe form of cash or guarantees. The number of members and votes of the\r\nCommission and the EIB shall be recalculated accordingly. The Steering Board\r\nshall strive to make decisions by consensus. If the Steering Board is not able\r\nto decide by consensus within a deadline set by the Chairperson, the Steering\r\nBoard shall take a decision by simple majority. No decision of the Steering\r\nBoard shall be adopted if the Commission or the EIB votes against it.\nMembers of the Investment Committee shall\r\nconsist of six independent market experts and a Managing Director. The Managing\r\nDirector shall be assisted by a Deputy Managing Director. The Managing Director\r\nwill prepare and chair the meetings of the Investment Committee. Decisions in\r\nboth bodies are to be taken by simple majority, but in the Steering Board,\r\nconsensus shall be sought. The projects will be selected on their own merits,\r\nwithout any sectorial or geographic pre-established allocation so as to\r\nmaximize the value added of the Fund. The EFSI will also have the possibility\r\nto finance together with Member States and private investors investment\r\nplatforms at national, regional or sectorial level.\nOther than specific provisions governing\r\nthe creation, the activities and the governance of the EFSI, the EFSI Agreement\r\nshall also establish the European Investment Advisory Hub (EIAH, Article 2(2)).\r\nBuilding on existing EIB and Commission advisory services, the EIAH shall provide\r\nadvisory support for investment project identification, preparation and\r\ndevelopment and act as a single technical advisory hub (including on legal\r\nissues) for project financing within the EU. This shall include support on the\r\nuse of technical assistance for project structuring, use of innovative\r\nfinancial instruments, and use of public-private partnerships.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Granting of an EU Guarantee\r\nand Establishment of an EU Guarantee Fund (Articles 4-8) \nArticle 4 of the proposal creates an initial\r\nEU guarantee of EUR 16bn for EIB financing and investment operations. In\r\naccordance with Article 5, those operations need to support development of\r\ninfrastructure; or investment in education, health, research, development,\r\ninformation and communications technology and innovation; or expansion of\r\nrenewable energy and energy efficiency; or infrastructure projects in the\r\nenvironmental, natural resources, urban development and social fields; or SMEs\r\nand mid cap companies including by providing working capital risk financing.\r\nThe support can be provided directly from the EIB or through the European\r\nInvestment Fund. Those institutions will provide financing with a high degree\r\nof financial risk absorption (equity, quasi-equity, etc.) allowing private\r\nsector investors to invest alongside.\nIn order to ensure orderly execution of the\r\nEU budget even if the guarantee is called, Article 8 establishes a guarantee\r\nfund (the Fund). Experience on the nature of investments to be supported by the\r\nEFSI indicates that a ratio of 50% between the payments from the Union budget\r\nand from the Union's total guarantee obligations would be adequate. In the\r\nsteady state, this 50% target will be met from the EU budget, the amounts due\r\nto the Union from the investments, amounts received from any defaulting\r\ncreditors and the returns on the guarantee fund resources invested. However,\r\nfor an initial period, EUR 8bn will be provided only via payments from the budget.\r\nFrom 2016 onwards, these payments from the budget will gradually build up the\r\nendowment of the Fund and should reach an accumulated sum of EUR 8bn by 2020. Nonetheless,\r\nshould there be calls on the EU guarantee, it is appropriate that the\r\nalternative sources of the guarantee fund are also considered in the\r\ncalculation of the target level in order to limit the potential impact on the\r\nEU budget. This consideration in the calculation will be limited to the amount\r\nof the EU guarantee that has been called.\nIn order to provide for maximum\r\ncost-efficiency, the Commission shall be charged with investing those\r\nresources. Moreover, the Commission shall be empowered, via delegated act, to\r\nchange the Fund's target amount by 10% after 2018. This should allow the Commission\r\nto build on the practical experience acquired and prevent unnecessary drains on\r\nthe budget, while ensuring its continued protection.\nExcept for possible losses on equity, where\r\nthe EIB may decide to do an immediate guarantee call, guarantee calls should\r\nonly occur once a year after all profits and losses resulting from outstanding\r\noperations have been netted.\nShould the guarantee be called, the volume\r\nof guarantee would be reduced below the original EUR 16bn. However, future\r\nrevenues due to the Union from the EFSI activities should be allowed to\r\nreinstate the EU guarantee up to this original amount.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Establishing a European\r\nInvestment Project Pipeline (Article 9)\nAs often pointed out by stakeholders, a\r\nstumbling block to greater investment levels within the EU is a lack of\r\nknowledge of ongoing and future investment projects within the Union. Alongside\r\nthe work of the EFSI, the proposal also provides for the creation of a European\r\ninvestment project pipeline as a means to ensure that information on potential\r\nprojects is transparent and available to investors.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reporting, Accountability,\r\nEvaluation and Review of EFSI Operations (Articles 10-12)\nGiven the use of the EU guarantee by the\r\nEIB, it is appropriate for the EIB to report on a regular basis to the\r\nCommission, European Parliament and to the Council on operations conducted that\r\nare covered by the EU guarantee.\nArticle 12 sets out a number of regular\r\nevaluations by the EIB and the Commission to ensure that EFSI, the EU guarantee\r\nand the functioning of the guarantee fund are being utilised as intended. The\r\naccountability to the European Parliament is particularly important in this\r\ncontext.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General Provisions (Articles\r\n13-17)\nIt is appropriate for a number of general\r\nrules to be applicable within the context of the use by the EIB of the EU\r\nguarantee. Article 13 establishes that information be made publically available\r\nrelated to activities governed by the EU guarantee. Article 14 and Article 15 are\r\nprovided in relation to the competences of the Court of Auditors and OLAF\r\nrespectively, and Article 16 excludes certain types of activities. Finally,\r\nArticle 17 empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts in line with the\r\nrelevant procedure. \n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments (Articles 18-19)\nArticles 18 and 19 provide for the\r\nreallocation of operational appropriations from the Horizon2020 Programme\r\n(Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013) and the Connecting Europe Facility (Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1316/2013).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe EU guarantee provided for the EFSI amounts\r\nto EUR 16bn and is fully available from the entry into force of the Regulation.\r\nIn order to ensure orderly execution of the budget despite potential calls on\r\nthe guarantee, a guarantee fund is created and provisioned for 50% of total EU\r\nguarantee obligations by 2020. Payments into the guarantee fund will amount to\r\nEUR 500m\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in 2016, EUR 1bn in 2017, EUR 2bn in 2018. Payments in 2019 and\r\n2020 of EUR 2.25bn each will depend on the target amount of the guarantee fund\r\nbeing kept unchanged at 50% after 2018. Commitment appropriations will amount\r\nto EUR 1.35bn in 2015, EUR 2.03bn in 2016, EUR 2.641bn in 2017 and EUR 1.979bn\r\nin 2018. The progressive financing of the guarantee fund should not create\r\nrisks for the EU Budget during the first years, since possible guarantee calls\r\nrelating to losses incurred will only materialise over time. \nAs is the case with the EIB's current\r\nactivities, beneficiaries will be charged the costs of the EIB operations under\r\nEFSI. The use of the guarantee by the EIB and the investment of the guarantee\r\nfund's resources should yield a net positive income. EFSI proceeds will be\r\nshared pro-rata among the contributors of risk bearing capacity. Excess\r\nendowment of the guarantee fund may be used to restore the EU guarantee to its\r\ninitial amount.\nHowever, two actions will create costs for\r\nthe EIB for which the beneficiaries cannot be charged: \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Investment Advisory\r\nHub, created in accordance with Article 2(2) of this proposal, will primarily\r\nbe funded from existing envelopes for EIB technical assistance under existing\r\nEU programmes (Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon 2020\u2026).\u00a0 However, additional\r\nfunding of up to a maximum of EUR 20m per year (EUR 10m in 2015) may be\r\nnecessary and will be budgeted in accordance with the Financial Statement\r\nattached to this proposal. Any potential costs for the project pipeline will\r\nalso be covered.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EIB will incur administrative\r\nexpenses for increasing its financing via the EIF to small and medium\r\nenterprises. Based on current assumptions about the sort of instruments and the\r\nspeed of signatures for new operations, this will require the payment of fees\r\nin the order of an accumulated total of EUR 105m, around EUR 48m of which until\r\n2020. Given the possibility of a postponed payment \u2013 until income received can\r\nbe used for this purpose \u2013 these payments are not yet budgeted but only\r\ndescribed in the annex to the Financial Statement.\nCosts for the EIB which have neither been\r\nrecovered from the beneficiaries nor deduced from the remuneration of the guarantee\r\ngranted by the EU may be covered by the EU guarantee, within a cumulative limit\r\ncorresponding to 1% of its outstanding amounts. \nOperational appropriations required by this\r\nproposal are to be fully financed within the Multiannual Financial Framework\r\n2014-2020. EUR 6bn are to be reallocated within heading 1A, EUR 2.11bn will be\r\nfunded by making use of the Unallocated Margin including the Global Margin for\r\nCommitments. While grant financing from the Connecting Europe Facility and\r\nHorizon 2020 will be reduced, the multiplier effect generated by the EFSI will\r\nallow for a significant overall increase of investment in the policy areas\r\ncovered by those two existing programmes.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nThe financial envelope of this proposal\r\ndoes not explicitly include contributions from Member States or other third\r\nparties to any of the structures it creates. However, Article 1(2) explicitly\r\nallows for those parties interested to join the EFSI agreement by means of\r\ncapital contributions to the Fund.\nIf Member States decide to make\r\ncontributions to the EFSI, the Commission has indicated that it will take a\r\nfavourable position towards such contributions in the context of its assessment\r\nof public finances according to Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of\r\nthe European Union and Regulation (EC) No 1467/1997. The Commission\r\nCommunication (\"Making the best use of the flexibility within the existing\r\nrules of the Stability and Growth Pact\") of 13 January 2015 sets out the\r\nspecific considerations applicable in this scenario.\n2015/0009 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the European Fund for Strategic\r\nInvestments and amending Regulations (EU) No 1291/2013 and (EU) No 1316/2013\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 172, 173, and\r\nArticle 175(3) and Article 182(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinions of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The economic and financial\r\ncrisis has led to a lowering of the level of investments within the Union.\r\nInvestment has fallen by approximately 15% since its peak in 2007. The Union suffers in particular from a lack of investment as a\r\nconsequence of market uncertainty regarding the economic future and the fiscal\r\nconstraints on Member States. This lack of investment\r\nslows economic recovery and negatively affects job creation, long-term growth\r\nprospects and competitiveness. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comprehensive action is\r\nrequired to reverse the vicious circle created by a lack of investment.\r\nStructural reforms and fiscal responsibility are necessary preconditions for\r\nstimulating investment. Along with a renewed impetus towards investment\r\nfinancing, these preconditions can contribute to establishing a virtuous\r\ncircle, where investment projects help support employment and demand and lead\r\nto a sustained increase in growth potential.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The G20, through the\r\nGlobal Infrastructure Initiative, has recognised the importance of investment\r\nin boosting demand and lifting productivity and growth and has committed to\r\ncreating a climate that facilitates higher levels of investment.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout the economic\r\nand financial crisis, the Union has made efforts to promote growth, in\r\nparticular through initiatives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy that put in\r\nplace an approach for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The European\r\nInvestment Bank ('EIB') has also strengthened its role in instigating and\r\npromoting investment within the Union, partly by way of an increase in capital\r\nin January 2013. Further action is required to ensure that the investment needs\r\nof the Union are addressed and that the liquidity available on the market is\r\nused efficiently and channelled towards the funding of viable investment projects.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 July 2014, the then\r\nPresident-elect of the European Commission presented a set of Political\r\nGuidelines for the European Commission to the European Parliament. These\r\nPolitical Guidelines called for the mobilisation of \"up to EUR 300 billion\r\nin additional public and private investment in the real economy over the next\r\nthree years\" to stimulate investment for the purpose of job creation.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 26 November 2014, the\r\nCommission presented a communication entitled \"An Investment Plan for\r\nEurope\"[1]\r\nthat envisaged the creation of a European Fund for Strategic Investments\r\n('EFSI'), a transparent pipeline of investment projects at European level, the\r\ncreation of an advisory hub (European Investment Advisory Hub \u2013 'EIAH') and an\r\nambitious agenda to remove obstacles to investment and complete the Single\r\nMarket.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Council on 18\r\nDecember 2014 concluded that \"fostering investment and addressing market\r\nfailure in Europe is a key policy challenge\" and that \"The new focus\r\non investment, coupled with Member States' commitment to intensifying\r\nstructural reforms and to pursuing growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, will\r\nprovide the foundation for growth and jobs in Europe and calls for setting up a\r\nEuropean Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) in the EIB Group with the\r\naim to mobilise 315 billion euro in new investments between 2015 and\r\n2017\". \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EFSI is part of a\r\ncomprehensive approach to address uncertainty surrounding public and private\r\ninvestments. The strategy has three pillars: mobilising finance for investment,\r\nmaking investment reach the real economy and improving the investment\r\nenvironment in the Union.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investment environment\r\nwithin the Union should be improved by removing barriers to investment,\r\nreinforcing the Single Market and by enhancing regulatory predictability. The\r\nwork of the EFSI, and investments across Europe generally, should benefit from\r\nthis accompanying work.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of the EFSI\r\nshould be to help resolve the difficulties in financing and\u00a0 implementing productive\r\ninvestments in the Union and to ensure increased access to financing. It is\r\nintended that increased access to financing should be of particular benefit to\r\nsmall and medium enterprises. It is also appropriate to extend the benefit of\r\nsuch increased access to financing to mid-cap companies, which are companies\r\nhaving up to 3000 employees. Overcoming Europe's current investment\r\ndifficulties should contribute to strengthening the Union's economic, social\r\nand territorial cohesion.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EFSI should support\r\nstrategic investments with high economic value added contributing to achieving\r\nUnion policy objectives.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many small and medium\r\nenterprises, as well as mid-cap companies, across the Union require assistance\r\nto attract market financing, especially as regards investments that carry a\r\ngreater degree of risk. The EFSI should help these businesses to overcome\r\ncapital shortages by allowing the EIB and the European Investment Fund ('EIF')\r\nto provide direct and indirect equity injections, as well as to provide\r\nguarantees for high-quality securitisation of loans, and other products that\r\nare granted in pursuit of the aims of the EFSI. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EFSI should be\r\nestablished within the EIB in order to benefit from its experience and proven\r\ntrack record and in order for its operations to start to have a positive impact\r\nas quickly as possible. The work of the EFSI on providing finance to small and\r\nmedium enterprises and small mid-cap companies should be channelled through the\r\nEuropean Investment Fund ('EIF') to benefit from its experience in these\r\nactivities.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EFSI should target\r\nprojects delivering high societal and economic value. In particular, the EFSI\r\nshould target projects that promote job creation, long-term growth and\r\ncompetitiveness. The EFSI should support a wide range of financial products,\r\nincluding equity, debt or guarantees, to best accommodate the needs of the\r\nindividual project. This wide range of products should allow the EFSI to adapt\r\nto market needs whilst encouraging private investment in the projects. The EFSI\r\nshould not be a substitute for private market finance but should instead\r\ncatalyse private finance by addressing market failures so as to ensure the most\r\neffective and strategic use of public money. The requirement for consistency with\r\nState aid principles should contribute to such effective and strategic use.\u00a0 \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EFSI should target\r\nprojects with a higher risk-return profile than existing EIB and Union\r\ninstruments to ensure additionality over existing operations. The EFSI should finance\r\nprojects across the Union, including in the countries most affected by the\r\nfinancial crisis. The EFSI should only be used where financing is not available\r\nfrom other sources on reasonable terms.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EFSI should target\r\ninvestments that are expected to be economically and technically viable, which\r\nmay entail a degree of appropriate risk, whilst still meeting the particular\r\nrequirements for EFSI financing.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decisions on the use of the\r\nEFSI support for infrastructure and large mid-cap projects should be made by an\r\nInvestment Committee. The Investment Committee should be composed of\r\nindependent experts who are knowledgeable and experienced in the areas of\r\ninvestment projects. The Investment Committee should be accountable to a Steering\r\nBoard of the EFSI, who should supervise the fulfilment of the EFSI's\r\nobjectives. To effectively benefit from the experience of the EIF, the EFSI\r\nshould support funding to the EIF to allow the EIF to undertake individual\r\nprojects in the areas of small and medium enterprises and small mid-cap\r\ncompanies.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to enable the EFSI\r\nto support investments, the Union should grant a guarantee of an amount equal\r\nto EUR 16 000 000 000. When provided on a portfolio basis, the guarantee\r\ncoverage should be capped depending upon the type of instrument, such as debt,\r\nequity or guarantees, as a percentage of the volume of the portfolio of\r\noutstanding commitments. It is expected that when the guarantee is combined\r\nwith EUR 5 000 000 000 to be provided by the EIB, that the EFSI support should\r\ngenerate EUR 60 800 000 000 additional investment by the EIB and EIF. This EUR\r\n60 800 000 000 supported by the EFSI is expected to generate a total of EUR 315\r\n000 000 000 in investment in the Union within the period 2015 to 2017.\r\nGuarantees that are attached to projects which are completed without a call on\r\na guarantee are available for supporting new operations. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow for\r\nfurther increase in its resources, participation in the EFSI should be open to\r\nthird parties, including Member States, national promotional banks or public\r\nagencies owned or controlled by Member States, \u00a0private sector entities and\r\nentities outside the Union subject to the consent of existing contributors.\r\nThird parties may contribute directly to the EFSI and take part in the EFSI\r\ngovernance structure. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the level of projects,\r\nthird parties may co-finance together with EFSI on a project-by-project basis\r\nor in investment platforms related to specific geographic or thematic sectors. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provided that all relevant\r\neligibility criteria are fulfilled, Member States may use European Structural\r\nInvestment Funds to contribute to the financing of eligible projects that are\r\nsupported by the EU guarantee. The flexibility of this approach should maximise\r\nthe potential to attract investors to the areas of investment targeted by the\r\nEFSI.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Infrastructure and project\r\ninvestments supported under EFSI should be consistent with State aid rules. To\r\nthat end, the Commission has announced that it will formulate a set of core\r\nprinciples, for the purpose of State aid assessments, which a project will have\r\nto meet to be eligible for support under the EFSI. If a project meets these\r\ncriteria and receives support from the EFSI, the Commission has announced that\r\nany national complementary support, will be assessed under a simplified and\r\naccelerated State aid assessment whereby the only additional issue to be\r\nverified by the Commission will be the proportionality of public support\r\n(absence of overcompensation). The Commission has also announced that it will\r\nprovide further guidance on the set of core principles with a view to ensuring\r\nan efficient use of public funds.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the need for urgent\r\naction within the Union, the EIB and the EIF may have financed additional\r\nprojects, outside of their usual profile, in the course of 2015 before the\r\nentry into force of this Regulation. In order to maximise the benefit of the\r\nmeasures provided for in this Regulation, it should be possible for such\r\nadditional projects to be included within the EU guarantee coverage in the\r\nevent that they fulfil the substantive criteria set out in this Regulation.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EIB financing and\r\ninvestment operations supported by the EFSI should be managed in accordance\r\nwith the EIB\u2019s own rules and procedures, including appropriate control measures\r\nand measures taken to avoid tax evasion, as well as with the relevant rules and\r\nprocedures concerning the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the Court of\r\nAuditors, including the Tripartite agreement between the European Commission,\r\nthe European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EIB should regularly\r\nevaluate activities supported by the EFSI with a view to assessing their relevance,\r\nperformance and impact and to identifying aspects that could improve future\r\nactivities. Such evaluations should contribute to accountability and analysis\r\nof sustainability.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alongside the financing\r\noperations that will be conducted through the EFSI, a European Investment\r\nAdvisory Hub ('EIAH') should be created. The EIAH should provide strengthened\r\nsupport for project development and preparation across the Union, by building\r\non the expertise of the Commission, the EIB, national promotional banks and the\r\nmanaging authorities of the European Structural and Investment Funds. This\r\nshould establish a single point of entry for questions related to technical\r\nassistance for investments within the Union.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to cover the risks\r\nrelated to the EU guarantee to the EIB, a guarantee fund should be established.\r\nThe guarantee fund should be constituted by a gradual payment from the Union\r\nbudget. The guarantee fund should subsequently also receive revenues and\r\nrepayments from projects that benefit from EFSI support and amounts recovered\r\nfrom defaulting debtors where the guarantee fund has already honoured the\r\nguarantee to the EIB.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The guarantee fund is\r\nintended to provide a liquidity cushion for the Union budget against losses\r\nincurred by the EFSI in pursuit of its objectives. Experience on the nature of\r\ninvestments to be supported by the EFSI indicates that a ratio of 50% between\r\nthe payments from the Union budget and from the Union's total guarantee\r\nobligations would be adequate.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To partially finance the\r\ncontribution from the Union budget, the available envelopes of the Horizon 2020\r\n\u2013 the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014-2020, provided by\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council[2], and the Connecting Europe Facility, provided by Regulation (EU) No\r\n1316/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[3], should be reduced.\r\nThose programmes serve purposes that are not replicated by the EFSI. However,\r\nthe reduction of both programmes to finance the guarantee fund is expected to\r\nensure a greater investment in certain areas of their respective mandates than\r\nis possible through the existing programmes. The EFSI should be able to\r\nleverage the EU guarantee to multiply the financial effect within those areas\r\nof research, development and innovation and transport, telecommunications and\r\nenergy infrastructure compared to if the resources had been spent via grants\r\nwithin the planned Horizon 2020 and Connecting Europe Facility programmes. It\r\nis, therefore, appropriate to redirect part of the funding presently envisaged\r\nfor those programmes to the benefit of EFSI.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the nature of their\r\nconstitution, neither the EU guarantee to the EIB nor the guarantee fund are\r\n'financial instruments' within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 966/2012 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[4].\r\n\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Within the Union, there are\r\na significant number of potentially viable projects that are not being financed\r\ndue to a lack of certainty and transparency with respect to such projects.\r\nOften, this is because private investors are not aware of the projects or have\r\ninsufficient information to make an assessment of the investment risks. The\r\nCommission and the EIB, with support from the Member States, should promote the\r\ncreation of a transparent pipeline of current and future investment projects in\r\nthe Union suitable for investment. This 'project pipeline' should ensure that\r\ninformation is made publicly available regarding investment projects on a\r\nregular and structured basis to ensure that investors have reliable information\r\non which to base their investment decisions.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States have also\r\nbegun work at national level on establishing and promoting project pipelines\r\nfor projects of national significance. The information prepared by the\r\nCommission and the EIB should provide links to the accompanying national\r\nproject pipelines.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although the projects\r\nidentified under the project pipeline may be used by the EIB in the\r\nidentification and selection of EFSI supported projects, the project pipeline\r\nshould have a broader scope of identifying projects across the Union. This\r\nscope may include projects that are capable of being fully financed by the\r\nprivate sector or with the assistance of other instruments provided at European\r\nor national level. The EFSI should be able to support financing and investment\r\nto projects identified by the project pipeline, but there should be no\r\nautomaticity between inclusion on the list and access to EFSI support and the\r\nEFSI be conferred with discretion to select and support projects that are not\r\nincluded on the list.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure accountability to\r\nEuropean citizens, the EIB should regularly report to the European Parliament\r\nand the Council on the progress and impact of the EFSI.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure an\r\nappropriate coverage of the EU guarantee obligations and to ensure the\r\ncontinued availability of the EU guarantee, the power to adopt acts in\r\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion should be delegated to the Commission with respect to the adjustment of\r\nthe amounts to be paid in from the general budget of the Union and to amend\r\nAnnex I accordingly. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry\r\nout appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert\r\nlevel. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should\r\nensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\r\ndocuments to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of\r\nthis Regulation, namely to support investments in the Union and to ensure\r\nincreased access to financing for companies having up to 3000 employees, cannot\r\nbe sufficiently achieved by the Member States by reason of the disparities in\r\ntheir fiscal capacity to act but can rather, by reason of its scale and\r\neffects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in\r\naccordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of\r\nthe Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond\r\nwhat is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I -European Fund for Strategic\r\nInvestments \nArticle 1\r\nEuropean Fund for Strategic Investments\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall\r\nconclude an agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) on the\r\nestablishment of a European Fund for Strategic Investments ('EFSI'). \nThe purpose of the EFSI shall be to support\r\ninvestments in the Union and to ensure increased access to financing for\r\ncompanies having up to 3000 employees, with a particular focus on small and\r\nmedium enterprises, through the supply of risk bearing capacity to the EIB\r\n('EFSI Agreement'). \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EFSI Agreement shall\r\nbe open to accession by Member States. Subject to the consent of existing\r\ncontributors, the EFSI Agreement shall also be open to accession by other third\r\nparties, including national promotional banks or public agencies owned or\r\ncontrolled by Member States, and private sector entities.\nArticle 2\r\nTerms of the EFSI Agreement\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EFSI Agreement shall\r\ncontain, in particular, the following:\n(a)         \r\nprovisions governing the establishment of the\r\nEFSI as a distinct, clearly identifiable and transparent guarantee facility and\r\nseparate account managed by the EIB; \n(b)         \r\nthe amount and terms of the financial\r\ncontribution which shall be provided by the EIB through the EFSI;\n(c)         \r\nthe terms of the funding which shall be provided\r\nby the EIB through the EFSI to the European Investment Fund ('EIF'); \n(d)        \r\nthe governance arrangements concerning the EFSI,\r\nin accordance with Article 3, without prejudice to the Statute of the European\r\nInvestment Bank; \n(e)         \r\ndetailed rules on the provision of the EU\r\nguarantee, in accordance with Article 7, including its capped coverage of\r\nportfolios of specific types of instruments, calls on the EU\r\nguarantee, that \u2013 with the exception of possible losses on equity -\u00a0 shall\r\nonly occur once a year after profits and losses from operations have been\r\nnetted, and its remuneration and the requirement that remuneration for\r\nrisk-taking be allocated amongst contributors in proportion with their\r\nrespective risk share;\n(f)          \r\nprovisions and procedures relating to recovery\r\nof claims;\n(g)         \r\nrequirements governing the use of the EU\r\nguarantee, including within specific time frames and key performance\r\nindicators;\n(h)         \r\nprovisions on the financing necessary for the\r\nEIAH in accordance with the third subparagraph of paragraph 2;\n(i)           \r\nprovisions governing the manner in which third\r\nparties may co-invest with EIB financing and investment operations supported by\r\nthe EFSI;\n(j)           \r\nthe modalities of the EU guarantee coverage. \nThe EFSI Agreement shall provide that there is\r\na clear distinction between operations carried out with the EFSI support and\r\nother operations of the EIB.\nThe EFSI Agreement shall provide that EFSI\r\nactivities conducted by the EIF are to be governed by the EIF governing bodies.\r\n\nThe EFSI Agreement shall provide that\r\nremuneration attributable to the Union from EFSI supported operations shall be\r\nprovided following the deduction of payments due to calls on the EU guarantee\r\nand, subsequently, costs in accordance with the third subparagraph of paragraph\r\n2 and with Article 5(3). \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EFSI Agreement shall\r\nprovide for the creation of a European Investment Advisory Hub ('EIAH') within\r\nthe EIB. The EIAH shall have as its objective to build upon existing EIB and\r\nCommission advisory services in order to provide advisory support for\r\ninvestment project identification, preparation and development and act as a\r\nsingle technical advisory hub for project financing within the Union. This\r\nshall include support on the use of technical assistance for project\r\nstructuring, use of innovative financial instruments, use of public-private\r\npartnerships and advice, as appropriate, on relevant issues of EU legislation. \nTo meet that objective, the EIAH shall use the\r\nexpertise of the EIB, the Commission, national promotional banks and the\r\nmanaging authorities of the European Structural and Investment Funds. \nThe EIAH shall be partially financed by the\r\nUnion up to a maximum amount of EUR 20 000 000 per year during the period\r\nending on 31 December 2020 for the additional services provided for by the EIAH\r\nover existing EIB technical assistance.\u00a0 For the years after 2020 the financial\r\ncontribution from the Union shall be directly linked to the provisions included\r\nin the future multi-annual financial frameworks.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States that become\r\nparties to the EFSI Agreement shall be able to provide their contribution, in\r\nparticular, in the form of cash or a guarantee acceptable to the EIB.

These Instruments shall be\r\ngranted, acquired or issued for the benefit of operations carried out in the\r\nUnion, including cross-border operations between a Member State and a third\r\ncountry, in compliance with this Regulation and where EIB financing has been\r\ngranted in accordance with a signed agreement which has neither expired nor\r\nbeen cancelled; \n(b)                   \r\nEIB funding to the EIF enabling it to undertake\r\nloans, guarantees, counter-guarantees, any other form of credit enhancement\r\ninstrument, capital market instruments and equity or quasi-equity\r\nparticipations. These Instruments shall be granted, acquired or issued for the\r\nbenefit of operations carried out in the Union, in compliance with this\r\nRegulation and where EIF financing has been granted in accordance with a signed\r\nagreement which has neither expired nor been cancelled.\nArticle 7\r\nCoverage and terms of the EU guarantee\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EU guarantee to the\r\nEIB shall be of an amount equal to EUR 16 000 000 000, of which a maximum\r\namount of EUR 2 500 000 000 may be allocated for EIB funding to the EIF in\r\naccordance with paragraph 2. \u00a0Without prejudice to Article 8(9), aggregate\r\npayments from the Union under the guarantee to the EIB shall not exceed the\r\namount of the guarantee. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The coverage of the\r\nguarantee over a particular type of instrument portfolio, referred to in\r\nArticle 6, shall be determined by the risk of that portfolio.

In addition, the EIB, in\r\ncooperation with the EIF as appropriate, shall report annually to the European\r\nParliament and to the Council on EIB financing and investment operations.\u00a0 By\r\n30 June of each year, the Commission is required to send to the European\r\nParliament, the Council and the Court of Auditors an annual report on the\r\nsituation of the Guarantee Fund and the management thereof in the previous year.\nIn accordance with Article 12 of the proposal, the EIB shall\r\nevaluate the functioning of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI)\r\nand provide its evaluation to the European Parliament, the Council and the\r\nCommission. Moreover, the Commission shall evaluate the use of the EU guarantee\r\nand the functioning of the Guarantee Fund and provide into the European\r\nParliament and the Council. A comprehensive report on the functioning of the\r\nEFSI is required by 30 June 2018 and every three years thereafter, as well as a\r\ncomprehensive report on the use of the EU guarantee and the functioning of the\r\nGuarantee Fund.\n2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\r\nsystem\nArticle 14 of the proposal establishes that the EU guarantee and the\r\npayments and recoveries under it attributable to the general budget of the\r\nUnion shall be audited by the Court of Auditors.\nEIB financing and investment operations will be managed by the EIB\r\nin accordance with its own rules and procedures, including appropriate audit,\r\ncontrol and monitoring measures. As foreseen in the EIB Statute, the Audit\r\nCommittee of the EIB, which is supported by external auditors, is responsible\r\nfor verifying the regularity of the EIB operations and accounts. The EIB\r\naccounts are approved annually by its Board of Governors.\nFurthermore, the EIB Board of Directors, where the Commission is\r\nrepresented by a Director and an alternate Director, approves each EIB\r\nfinancing and investment operation and monitors that the EIB is managed in\r\naccordance with its Statute and with the general directives laid down by the\r\nBoard of Governors.\nThe existing tripartite agreement between the Commission, the Court\r\nof Auditors and the EIB of October 2003 details the rules under which the Court\r\nof Auditors is to carry out its audits on the EIB Financing Operations under EU\r\nguarantee.\n2.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThe EIB financing and investment operations covered by the Union\r\nguarantee carry a non-negligible financial risk. The probability of a call upon\r\nthe guarantee is tangible. However, it is estimated that the Guarantee Fund\r\nprovides the protection required for the Union budget. Projects themselves may\r\nbe subject to implementation delays and cost overruns.\nEven if based on conservative assumptions, the cost-efficiency of\r\nthe initiative could suffer from insufficient market-uptake of the instruments\r\nand changing market conditions over time reducing the assumed multiplier\r\neffect.\nIn accordance with Article 8(4) of the proposal, the resources of\r\nthe Guarantee Fund are to be invested. Those investments will bear an\r\ninvestment risk (e.g. market and credit risk) and some operational risk.\n2.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information concerning the\r\ninternal control system set up\nThe EFSI will be governed by a Steering Board, which shall determine\r\nthe strategic orientation, the strategic asset allocation and operating\r\npolicies and procedures, including the investment policy of projects that EFSI\r\ncan support and the risk profile of the EFSI. \nDecisions on the use of the EFSI support for infrastructure and\r\nlarger mid-cap projects are to be made by an Investment Committee. The\r\nInvestment Committee should be composed of independent experts who are\r\nknowledgeable and experienced in the areas of investment projects and will be\r\naccountable to the Steering Board, who supervises the fulfilment of the EFSI's\r\nobjectives. \nThere will also be a Managing Director responsible for the\r\nday-to-day management of the EFSI and preparation of the meeting of the\r\nInvestment Committee. The Managing Director shall be directly accountable to\r\nthe Steering Board and shall report every quarter on the activities of the EFSI\r\nto the Steering Board.
