Iceland and Norway should be included within this group. Therefore, adaptation (a) provides for their inclusion under Article 2(5).\n\n\nArticle 3(4):\n\n\nA novel procedure to produce renewable methanol has been developed in Iceland. Blending renewable methanol into petrol provides an option for replacing fossil fuels and decarbonising transport fuels in Iceland. Directive 98/70/EC, as amended by Directive 2009/30/EC, allows 3%, v/v, methanol content in petrol.\n\n\nBlending petrol with alcohols results in higher vapour pressure of the fuel. Directive 2009/30/EC accounts for this with respect to ethanol by providing a derogation to maximum vapour pressure limits. This derogation supports the development of a biofuels market. A similar derogation for petrol with 3%, v/v, methanol content is needed to allow placing petrol mixed with renewable methanol on the Icelandic market in the summer months.\n\n\nAccording to the Commission Staff Working Document accompanying the Proposal for Directive 2009/30/EC\n2\n, \u201c[t]he maximum summer vapour pressure of petrol is regulated by directive 98/70 to control emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Emissions of VOCs are a concern because (1) they are precursors of ozone formation which harms the environment and human health; and (2) certain hydrocarbons such as benzene pose a specific risk for health\u201d.\n\n\nEmissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (\u2018NMVOC\u2019) in Iceland have decreased; emissions in 2009 were 58% below the 1990 level. Target values for ozone with the objective of protecting human health (maximum daily 8-hour mean of 120 \u00b5g/m3) set in Directive 2002/3/EC and implemented by Icelandic regulation No. 745/2003, are not exceeded in Iceland in the summer period.\u00a0Blending methanol into petrol adds methanol to the VOC emissions from the fuel. The POCP index (Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential) for methanol (20,5) is lower than that of petrol (61), which can be expected to counteract the effect of increased vapour pressure on ozone formation.\n\n\nAs regards health risks, a critical review of peer-reviewed literature on the toxicity of inhaled methanol vapours produced no evidence upon which to base a conclusion that exposure to low levels of methanol vapours will result in adverse health effects. Mean temperature in Iceland during the three summer months is less than 11\u00b0C. A comparison of mean summer temperatures in European cities and adopted petrol volatility classes shows that petrol with vapour pressures above 80 kPa is used in European cities in months when average temperatures exceed 12\u00b0C.\n\n\nThe draft Joint Committee Decision (\u2018JCD\u2019) hence foresees an adaptation stating that Iceland may, during the summer period, permit the placing on the market of petrol containing ethanol or methanol with maximum vapour pressure of 70 kPa, on condition that the ethanol used is a biofuel or that the greenhouse gas emission saving from the use of methanol fulfils the criteria specified in Article 7b(2).\n\n\nArticle 7b(6):\n\n\nThis provision refers to a specific part of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (\u2018CAP\u2019). As the CAP is not part of the EEA Agreement, an adaptation text disapplying Article 7b(6) has been included in the draft JCD.\n\n\nApplication of Articles 7a to 7e to Liechtenstein:\n\n\n\n\nThere are no suppliers, as defined under Article 2(8) of the Directive, in Liechtenstein. According to the Swiss Mineral Oil Tax Act of 21 June 1996, which is applicable in Liechtenstein by virtue of the Liechtenstein-Swiss customs union, the importer or owner of fuel dumps has to pay the taxes for the import of fuels. There are no direct imports of petrol and diesel in Liechtenstein. For that reason, since no supplier can be assigned the obligations of Article 7a to 7e, these Articles can therefore not apply to Liechtenstein and a corresponding adaptation text has been included in the draft JCD.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nArticle 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 concerning arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement provides that the Council establishes the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf on such Decisions, on a proposal from the Commission. \n\n\nThe Commission submits the Draft Decision of the EEA Joint Committee for adoption by the Council as the Union\u2019s position. The Commission would hope to be able to present it in the EEA Joint Committee at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\n2015/0147 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position
