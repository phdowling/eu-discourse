In each meeting session new UN Regulations, amendments to existing UN Regulations or UN Global Technical Regulations (UN GTRs) are adopted in order to allow for technical progress. Prior to each WP29 meeting these amendments are adopted by one of the six working groups (GRs) active under WP29.\n\n\nSubsequently, in a WP29 meeting the final vote for adoption of the amendments, supplements and corrigenda takes place, provided the quorum is reached and there is a qualified majority among contracting parties. The EU is a contracting party to two Agreements (1958 and 1998 Agreements) under WP29. A Council Decision, referred to as \"mega decision\", containing the list of Regulations, amendments, supplements and corrigenda, is prepared each time and authorises the Commission to vote on behalf of the Union in each WP29 meeting.\n\n\nThis Council Decision defines the Union's position in the voting of the Regulations, amendments, supplements and corrigenda submitted for vote in the November 2015 WP29 meeting that will take place on 9 to 13 November 2015.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe Technical Committee - Motor Vehicles has been consulted and the comments from Member State experts have been taken into account.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\uf0b7Summary of the proposed action\n\n\nThe proposal defines the Union's position in the voting of the amendments to UN Regulations Nos 12, 16, 26, 39, 44, 46, 58, 61, 74, 83, 85, 94, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 106, 107, 110, 116 and 127, on a new UN Regulation on frontal impact, on amendments to the Consolidated Resolution on the Construction of Vehicles (R.E.3), and on a new Mutual Resolution No. 2 (M.R.2) on vehicle powertrain definitions.\n\n\n\uf0b7Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for this proposal is Article 114, in conjunction with Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n\uf0b7Subsidiarity principle\n\n\nThe vote in favour of international instruments like proposals for UN Regulations, amendments to UN Regulations and draft Global Technical Regulations and their incorporation into the Union system for the type-approval of motor vehicles can only be done by the Union. This does not only prevent fragmentation of the Internal Market, but also ensures equal health and safety standards across the Union. It also offers advantages of economies of scale: products can be made for the entire Union market and even the international market, instead of being customised to obtain national type-approval for every single Member State.\n\n\nThis proposal therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle.\n\n\n\uf0b7Proportionality principle\n\n\nThis Council Decision authorises the Commission to vote on behalf of Union and is the proportionate instrument in accordance with Article 5(1) of Council Decision 97/836/EC in order to define a unified EU position at the UNECE with respect to the vote on the working documents proposed on the agenda of the WP29 meeting. Therefore, this proposal complies with the proportionality principle as it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives of ensuring the proper functioning of the Internal Market, while at the same time providing for a high level of public safety and protection.\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Choice of instruments\n\n\nThe use of a Council Decision is required by Article 218(9) TFEU in order to establish the positions to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf in a body set up by an international agreement.\n\n\n2015/0253 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\nestablishing the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union in the relevant Committees of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe as regards the proposals for amendments to UN Regulations Nos 12, 16, 26, 39, 44, 46, 58, 61, 74, 83, 85, 94, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 106, 107, 110, 116 and 127, the proposal for a new UN Regulation on frontal impact, the proposals for amendments to the Consolidated Resolution on the Construction of Vehicles (R.E.3), and the proposal for a new Mutual Resolution No. 2 (M.R.2) on vehicle powertrain definitions\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114, in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)In accordance with Council Decision 97/836/EC\n1\n, the Union acceded to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (\u2018Revised 1958 Agreement\u2019).\n\n\n(2)In accordance with Council Decision 2000/125/EC\n2\n, the Union acceded to the Agreement concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles (\u2018Parallel Agreement\u2019).\n\n\n(3)Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n3\n\u00a0replaced the approval systems of the Member States with a Union approval procedure and established a harmonised framework containing administrative provisions and general technical requirements for all new vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units. That Directive incorporated UN regulations in the EU type-approval system, either as requirements for type-approval or as alternatives to Union legislation. Since the adoption of that Directive, UN regulations have increasingly been incorporated into Union legislation in the framework of the EU type-approval.\n\n\n(4)In the light of experience and technical developments, the requirements relating to certain elements or features covered by UN Regulations Nos 12, 16, 26, 39, 44, 46, 58, 61, 74, 83, 85, 94, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 106, 107, 110, 116 and 127, as well as Consolidated Resolution on the Construction of Vehicles (R.E.3) need to be adapted for technical progress.\n\n\n(5)In order to improve the relevant safety provisions for motor vehicles, a new UN Regulation on frontal impact should be adopted; in order to harmonise vehicle powertrain definitions, a new Mutual Resolution No. 2 (M.R.2) on vehicle powertrain definitions should also be adopted.\n\n\n(6)It is therefore necessary to establish the position to be adopted on behalf of the Union in the Administrative Committee of the Revised 1958 Agreement and in the Executive Committee of the Parallel Agreement, as regards the adoption of those UN acts,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position to be adopted on behalf of the Union in the Administrative Committee of the Revised 1958 Agreement and in the Executive Committee of the Parallel Agreement during the period from 9 to 13 November 2015 shall be to vote in favour of the proposals listed in the Annex to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nCouncil Decision 97/836/EC of 27 November 1997 with a view to accession by the European Community to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions ('Revised 1958 Agreement') (OJ L 346, 17.12.1997, p. 78).\n\n\n\n(2)\nCouncil Decision 2000/125/EC of 31 January 2000 concerning the conclusion of the Agreement concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles ('Parallel Agreement') (OJ L 35, 10.2.2000, p. 12).\n\n\n\n(3)\nDirective 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (Framework Directive) (OJ L 263, 9.10.2007, p. 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 22.10.2015\nCOM(2015) 537 final\nANNEX\nto the\nProposal for a Council Decision\nestablishing the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union in the relevant Committees of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe as regards the proposals for amendments to UN Regulations Nos.
