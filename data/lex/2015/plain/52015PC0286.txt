"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 27.5.2015\nCOM(2015) 286 final \n2015/125(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM \n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n1.1.European Agenda on Migration\n\n\nThe European Commission presented a comprehensive European Agenda on Migration\n1\n on 13 May 2015, outlining, on the one hand, the immediate measures that will be proposed by the Commission to respond to the crisis situation in the Mediterranean and, on the other, the medium and long terms initiatives that need to be taken to provide structural solutions for better managing migration in all its aspects.\n\n\nAs part of the immediate measures, the Commission announced that, by the end of May, it will propose a mechanism to trigger the emergency response system envisaged under Article 78(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Agenda acknowledged that today Member States\u2019 asylum systems face an unprecedented pressure and that with the volumes of arrivals in particular to frontline Member States, their reception and processing capacities are already stretched to their limits. The Agenda announced that the proposal to trigger Article 78(3) will include a temporary distribution scheme for persons in clear need of international protection to ensure a fair and balanced participation of all Member States to this common effort. A redistribution key was included in the Annex to the Agenda, based on the criteria referred to therein (GDP, size of population, unemployment rate and past numbers of asylum seekers and of resettled refugees).\n\n\nThe Agenda underlined that the swift response that will be taken to reply to the current crisis in the Mediterranean must serve as the blueprint for the EU\u2019s reaction to future crisis, whichever part of the common external border comes under pressure from East to West and from North to South.\n\n\n1.2.Triggering Article 78(3) of the Treaty in respect of Italy and Greece\n\n\nAs part of the common policy on asylum, Article 78(3) of the Treaty provides a specific legal basis to deal with emergency situations. Based on a proposal by the European Commission, it enables the Council, after consulting the European Parliament, to adopt provisional measures for the benefit of Member State(s) confronted with an emergency situation characterised by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries into one or more Member State(s). The provisional measures envisaged by Article 78(3) are exceptional in nature. They can only be triggered when a certain threshold of urgency and severity of the problems created in the Member State(s)\u2019 asylum system(s) by a sudden inflow of third country nationals is met. \n\n\nThe European Agenda on Migration, the recent statement of the European Council\n2\n and the European Parliament Resolution\n3\n presented in the wake of the recent tragedies in the Mediterranean, all concur on the specific and urgent needs frontline Member States are confronted with and on the need to reinforce internal solidarity and propose concrete measures to provide support to the most affected Member States.\n\n\nThe statistical information regarding the numbers of irregular arrivals of third-country nationals in the Member States in 2014 and 2015, including of those who appear to be in clear need of international protection confirms that, at present, two frontline Member States, namely Italy and Greece are confronted with an exceptional migratory pressure.\n\n\nAccording to Frontex data, the Central and Eastern Mediterranean route were indeed the main areas for irregular border crossing into the EU in 2014, representing more than 75% of the EU total irregular border crossing. In 2014, more than 170 000 migrants arrived in Italy alone in an irregular manner, representing an increase of 277% compared to 2013. A steady increase was witnessed also by Greece with more than 50 000 irregular migrants reaching the country, representing an increase of 153% compared to 2013. Statistics for the first months of 2015 confirm this clear trend in respect of Italy. In addition, Greece has faced in the first four months of 2015 a sharp increase in the number of irregular border crossings, corresponding to more than 50% of the total number of irregular border crossings in 2014 (almost 28 000 in the first four months of 2015 in comparison to a total number of almost 55 000 in 2014). A significant proportion of the total number of irregular migrants detected in these two regions included migrants of nationalities which, based on the Eurostat data, meet a high EU level recognition rate (in 2014, the Syrians and the Eritreans, for which the EU level recognition rate is more than 75%, represented more than 40% in Italy and more than 50% in Greece). \n\n\nAccording to Eurostat, 64 625 persons applied for international protection in Italy in 2014, compared to 26 920 in 2013 (an increase of 143%). A lesser increase in the number of applications was witnessed by Greece with 9 430 applicants (an increase of 15%).\n\n\nAccording to Frontex data, another important migration route into the EU in 2014 was the Western Balkan route with 43 357 irregular border crossings (15% of the EU total irregular border crossing). However, the majority of migrants using the Balkan route are not prima facie in need of international protection, with Kosovars accounting for 51% of the arrivals. \n\n\nItaly\u2019s and Greece\u2019s geographical situation, with the ongoing conflicts in the region of their immediate neighbourhood makes them more vulnerable than the other Member States in the immediate future with unprecedented flows of migrants expected to continue to reach their territories. These external factors of increased migratory pressure add to the existing structural shortcomings in their asylum systems, putting further into question their ability to deal in an adequate manner with this situation of high pressure.\n\n\nNone of the other Member States currently appear in an emergency situation like the one experienced by Italy and Greece with similar peaks in the numbers of irregular arrivals with a high proportion of persons in clear need of international protection, coupled with a serious vulnerability of their asylum systems.\n\n\nTherefore, the current migratory landscape in Italy and Greece is unique in the EU and the strain on their capacity to process applications for international protection and to provide adequate reception conditions and integration perspectives to persons in clear need of international protection requires all the other Member States to show solidarity.\n\n\nDevelopments in the migratory flows will continue to be closely monitored by the Commission with regard to all Member States, including Malta, which, due to its similar geographic situation to Italy and Greece, has handled similar emergencies in the past. Therefore, similar measures can be triggered in the future in respect of those Member States which may be confronted by an emergency situation characterised by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries.  \n\n\n2.CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES\n\n\nThis proposal is presented as result of a prevailing crisis in the area of asylum in Italy and Greece. To prevent further deterioration of the asylum situation in these two countries and provide them with effective support, the Commission had to react rapidly and present promptly its proposal based on Article 78(3) of the Treaty in view of its swift adoption by the Council and implementation of the provisional measures to the benefit of Italy and Greece by the Member States.\n\n\n\n\nEU institutions and key actors have already expressed their broad views on this topic. In its 23 April 2015 statement, the European Council committed to consider options for organising emergency relocation between all Member States on a voluntary basis. In its 28 April 2015 resolution, the European Parliament has called upon the Council to seriously consider the possibility of triggering Article 78(3) of the Treaty.\n\n\nThe UNHCR\n4\n has called the EU to commit to intra-EU solidarity tools to support in particular Greece and Italy, including by relocating Syrian refugees who are rescued at sea to different countries across Europe, based on a fair distribution system. The NGO sector has also expressed its views on the issue of relocation of persons in need of international protection.\n5\n\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n3.1.Summary of the proposed action \n\n\nThe objective of the proposal is to establish provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece, in order to enable them to deal in an effective manner with the current significant inflow of third country nationals in their territories, putting their asylum systems under strain.\n\n\nThe measures foreseen in this Decision entail a temporary derogation from the criterion laid down in Article 13(1) of Regulation (EU) 604/2013 and the procedural steps, including the time limits, laid down in Articles 21, 22 and 29 of that Regulation. The legal and procedural safeguards set out in Regulation (EU) No 604/2013, including the right to an effective remedy, remain applicable in respect of applicants covered by this Decision. \n\n\nIn line with Article 78(3), the measures which can be taken for the benefit of a Member State must be provisional. At the same time, in order to ensure that the measures taken have a real impact in practice and provide genuine support for Italy and Greece to cope with the influx of migrants, the duration of these measures should not be too short. It is therefore proposed to apply the provisional measures foreseen in this proposal for a period of 24 months from the entry into force of this Decision. \n\n\nThe provisional measures envisaged by this proposal relate first and foremost to the relocation of applicants for international protection who appear prima facie to be\u00a0in clear need of international protection from Italy and Greece to the other Member States.\n\n\nThe other Member States, defined in the proposal as the \u201cMember States of relocation\" become responsible for examining the application of the person to be relocated. The examination of the application will be carried out pursuant to the rules laid down in Directive 2011/95/EU and Directive 2005/85/EC, and, as from 20 July 2015, Directive 2013/32/EU which will replace Directive 2005/85/EC. The reception conditions will be provided pursuant to the rules laid down in Directive 2003/9/EC, and, as from 20 July 2015, Directive 2013/33/EU, which will replace Directive 2003/9/EC. \n\n\nThe proposal establishes a numerical target for the applicants to be relocated from Italy and Greece, namely 24 000 and 16 000 respectively and includes in its annexes two distribution keys which define the number of applicants that shall be relocated from Italy and Greece respectively to the other Member States. This allocation between Italy and Greece is based on their respective shares in the total number of the irregular border crossings in Italy and Greece of persons in clear need of international protection. This also takes into account the sharp increase in the number of irregular border crossing in Greece over the January-April 2015 period when comparing to the same period last year. It is proposed that Italy and Greece do not themselves contribute as relocating Member States. The total of 40 000 applicants that should be relocated from Italy and Greece corresponds to approximately 40% of the total number of persons in clear need of international protection who have entered irregularly in these two countries in 2014. Thus, the relocation measure proposed in this Decision constitutes fair burden sharing between Italy and Greece on the one hand and the other Member States on the other hand.\n\n\nThe scope of the relocation procedure set out in this Decision is limited in two respects.\n\n\nFirstly, it is proposed to apply this Decision only in respect of applicants who are, prima facie, in clear need of international protection. This proposal defines those applicants as those belonging to nationalities for which the EU average recognition rate as established by Eurostat is above 75%. \n\n\nSecondly, it is proposed to make this Decision applicable only in respect of those applicants for whom Italy or Greece would in principle be the Member State responsible, in line with the take charge criteria defined in Regulation (EU) No 604/2013. By doing so, it is ensured that Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 remains applicable in respect of those applicants present in Italy and Greece, including those with a recognition rate of above 75%, for which one of the objective criteria laid down in that Regulation (for instance the presence of family members in another Member State) indicates that another Member State would be responsible. These applicants will therefore be transferred to the other Member States in application of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 and not as part of the provisional measures envisaged in this proposal. At the same time, Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 remains applicable also in respect of those persons who have not been relocated under the present scheme and who can be sent back to Italy by the other Member States. In this last respect, the situation is different for Greece, where the status quo is that Member States have suspended the Dublin transfers to Greece, in implementation of the European Court of Human Rights M.S.S. vs. Belgium and Greece judgment, followed by the decision in N.S. v. UK of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which confirmed the existence of systemic deficiencies in the asylum procedure and in the reception conditions of asylum seekers in Greece. \n\n\nThe proposal sets out a simple relocation procedure, to ensure a quick transfer of the persons concerned to the Member State of relocation. Each Member State shall appoint a national contact point for the purpose of the implementation of this Decision and communicate it to the other Member States and to the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). Italy and Greece, with the assistance of EASO, and, where applicable, of Member States' liaison officers, shall, at regular intervals of time, identify the applicants who could be relocated. In doing so, priority should be given to the vulnerable applicants. Italy and Greece shall then communicate to the contact points of the other Member States and to EASO the precise numbers of applicants that could be relocated. The other Member States shall indicate the number of applicants that can be relocated immediately to their territory and any other relevant information, such as in respect of the reception of families or vulnerable applicants. A formal decision to relocate an applicant needs then to be taken by Italy or Greece and notified to the applicant. The proposal specifies that applicants whose fingerprints are required to be taken pursuant to the obligations set out in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 may not be relocated unless their fingerprints have been taken.The proposal also specifies that Member States retain the right to refuse to relocate an applicant for which it is likely that there are national security or public order concerns. The proposal foresees that all the procedural steps must be carried out as soon as possible and that, in any event, the transfer of the applicant needs to take place no later than one month from his/her identification as applicant to be relocated. Finally, the proposal also specifies that for the purpose of the relocation procedure, Member States may decide to send to Italy and Greece liaison officers.\n\n\nIt is clear that the full commitment and genuine cooperation of Member States, in the framework of the coordinated support to be provided by EASO, is essential for ensuring an effective implementation of the provisional measures envisaged.\n\n\nIn addition to relocation, the proposal lays down other measures of support to be provided to Italy and Greece sur place. In particular, the proposal envisages an increase in the support provided by other Member States to Italy and Greece under the coordination of EASO and other relevant Agencies. The aim is to assist Italy and Greece in particular in the screening and the initial stages of the processing of applications as well as in the implementation of the relocation procedure set out in this proposal (in particular provision of information and specific assistance to the persons concerned and practical arrangements for implementing the transfers).\n\n\nThe proposal also provides the obligation for Italy and Greece to present to the Commission a roadmap which shall include adequate measures in the area of asylum, first reception and return enhancing the capacity, quality and efficiency of their systems in these areas as well as measures to ensure a proper application of this Decision. The proposal foresees the possibility for the Commission to suspend, under certain circumstances, the application of this Decision.\n\n\nThe proposal includes specific guarantees and obligations for the applicants who are subject to relocation to another Member State. The proposal specifies the right to receive information on the relocation procedure, the right to be notified with the relocation decision which must specify the precise Member State of relocation and the right to be relocated with the family members in the same Member State of relocation. The proposal also recalls the obligation to give primary consideration to the best interests of the child when deciding the Member State of relocation. This implies inter alia the obligation for Italy and Greece to indicate to the other Member States when the applicant to be relocated is an unaccompanied minor and, together with the Member State who manifested an interest in relocating that minor, to ensure that before relocation takes place, a best interests of the child assessment is carried out, in line with General Comment No 14 (2013) of the UN Committee on the rights of the child to have his or her best interests taken as primary consideration\n6\n.\u00a0The proposal also recalls the consequences of the secondary movements of the applicants for or beneficiaries of international protection which were part of the relocation scheme based on the currently applicable EU law, i.e. where they enter without authorisation into the territory of another Member State than the responsible one (in this case, the Member State of relocation).\u00a0\n\n\nThe proposal recalls the possibility, which derives from Article 78 (3) of the Treaty, for the Council, based on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, to adopt provisional measures for the benefit of a Member State other than Italy or Greece which would be confronted with a similar emergency situation characterised by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries. In addition, the proposal foresees that such measures may include, where appropriate, a suspension of the obligations of that Member State provided for in this Decision.\n\n\nThe proposal specifies that the relocation measures provided for in this Decision will benefit from the financial support under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) set up by Regulation (EU) N\u00b0516/2014. To this end, Member States of relocation shall receive a lump sum of EUR 6 000 for each applicant for international protection relocated from Italy and Greece pursuant to this Decision. This financial support will be implemented by applying the procedures laid down in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 516/2014. \n\n\n\n\nThe proposal requires Italy and Greece to report every three months on the implementation of this Decision, including of the roadmaps, to the Council and the Commission.\n\n\nFinally, the proposal specifies that this Decision shall apply   to persons arriving on the territory of Italy and Greece as from the date of the entry into force of the Decision.  The Decision will also be applied to applicants having arrived on the territory of those Member States from 15 April 2015, date around which the tragic events occurred prompting the European Council to decide to reinforce internal solidarity and responsibility and committed in particular to increase emergency assistance to front line Member States.\n\n\n\n3.2.Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for the proposed Council Decision is Article 78(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. \n\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Protocol No 21 annexed to the TFEU on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part in the adoption by the Council of proposed measures pursuant to Title V of Part Three of the TFEU. The United Kingdom and Ireland may notify the Council, within three months after a proposal or initiative has been presented, or at any time after its adoption, that they wish to take part in the adoption and application of any such proposed measures.\n\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TFEU, Denmark does not take part in the adoption by the Council of proposed measures pursuant to Title V of Part Three of the TFEU. At any time Denmark may, in accordance with its constitutional requirements, notify the other Member States that it wishes to apply in full all relevant measures adopted on the basis of Title V of the TFEU.\n\n\nThe European Community has concluded agreements with Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein associating them to the \u201cDublin/Eurodac acquis\u201d (Regulation 343/2003 replaced by Regulation 604/2013 and Regulation 2725/2000 which will be replaced by Regulation 603/2014). This proposal does not constitute a development of the \u201cDublin/Eurodac acquis\u201d and there is therefore no obligation on behalf of the associated states to notify to the Commission their acceptance of this Decision, once approved by the Council. The associated states may nevertheless decide to voluntarily participate in the provisional measures established by this Decision. \n\n\n3.3.Subsidiarity principle\n\n\nTitle V of the TFEU on the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice confers certain powers on these matters to the European Union. These powers must be exercised in accordance with Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union, i.e. if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the European Union.\n\n\nThe emergency situation created by the sudden influx of third-country nationals in Italy and Greece as described above puts their asylum systems and resources under considerable strain. As a consequence of this, other Member States can become affected, due to the secondary movements of these persons from Italy and Greece to these other States. It is clear that actions of individual Member States cannot satisfactorily reply to the common challenges all Member States are confronted with in this area. EU action in this field is therefore essential. \n\n\n3.4.Proportionality principle\n\n\nThe different financial and operational measures taken so far by the European Commission and the EASO to support the asylum systems of Italy and Greece have not proven sufficient to address the current crisis situation in these two Member States. Given the urgency and the severity of the situation created by the influx described above, opting for further EU action in their respect does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective of addressing the situation effectively. In particular, the proposal envisages the relocation over a period of two years of 24 000 and 16 000 applicants who are in clear need of international protection from Italy and Greece respectively to the territory of the other Member States. Based on the statistical data in 2014 and the first four months of 2015, the number of persons to be relocated represents 12% in respect of Italy and 19% in respect of Greece out of the total number of irregular border crossing in Italy and Greece respectively.\n\n\nThe remaining third country nationals who have or who have not applied for international protection will fall outside the relocation scheme and remain under the responsibility of Italy and Greece or of the State which has been identified as the Member State responsible pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 604/2013. At the same time, the support provided by the Member States of relocation to Italy and Greece is linked to the submission by Italy and Greece respectively and the monitoring by the Commission of the respect for those roadmaps which shall include specific measures to be taken by Italy and Greece to ensure that, following the end of applicability of the relocation procedure provided for in this proposal, their asylum and migration sytems will be better equipped to deal with situations of particular pressure.\n\n\n3.5.Impact on fundamental rights\n\n\nAs a result of introducing provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece, the fundamental rights as provided for in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (\"the Charter\") of the applicants who are in clear need of international protection will be safeguarded. \n\n\nIn particular, by ensuring a swift access of the persons concerned to an adequate procedure for granting international protection, this Decision aims to protect the right to asylum and to ensure protection against non-refoulement, as provided for in Articles 18 and 19 of the Charter. In addition, by ensuring the transfer of the persons concerned to a Member State which is in a position to give them adequate reception conditions and integration perspectives, this Decision aims to ensure full respect for the right to dignity and protection against torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as provided for in Articles 1 and 4 of the Charter. This Decision also aims to protect the rights of the child, in line with Article 24 of the Charter and right to family unity, in line with Article 7 of the Charter.\n\n\n3.6.Budgetary impact\n\n\nThis proposal entails additional costs for the EU Budget for a total amount of EUR 240\u00a0000\u00a0000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015/125 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\nestablishing provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereafter \"the Treaty\"), and in particular Articles 78(3) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)In accordance with Article 78(3) of the Treaty, in the event of one or more Member States being confronted by an emergency situation characterised by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may adopt provisional measures to the benefit of the Member State(s) concerned.\n\n\n(2)In accordance with Article 80 of the Treaty, the policies of the Union in the area of border checks, asylum and immigration and their implementation should be governed by the principles of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility between Member States and Union acts adopted in this area must contain appropriate measures to give effect to this principle.\n\n\n(3)The recent crisis situation in the Mediterranean prompted the Union institutions to immediately acknowledge the exceptional migratory flows in this region and call for concrete measures of solidarity towards the frontline Member States. In particular, at a joint meeting of Foreign and Interior Ministers on 20 April 2015, the European Commission presented a ten-point plan of immediate actions to be taken in response to this crisis, including a commitment to consider options for an emergency relocation mechanism. \n\n\n(4)In its conclusions of 23 April 2015, the European Council decided, inter alia, to reinforce internal solidarity and responsibility and committed in particular to increase emergency assistance to frontline Member States and to consider options for organising emergency relocation between Member States on a voluntary basis as well as to deploy European Asylum Support Office (EASO) teams in frontline Member States for joint processing of applications for international protection, including registration and fingerprinting.\n\n\n(5)In its resolution of 28 April 2015, the European Parliament reiterated the need for the Union to base its response to the latest tragedies in the Mediterranean on solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility and to step up its efforts in this area towards Member States which receive the highest number of refugees and applicants for international protection in either absolute or proportional terms.\n\n\n(6)Several Member States were confronted with a significant increase in the total number of migrants, including applicants for international protection, arriving on their territories in 2014 and some continue to be so in the first months of 2015. Emergency financial assistance by the European Commission and operational support by EASO were provided to several Member States to help them cope with this increase. \n\n\n(7)Among the Member States witnessing situations of particular pressure and in light of the recent tragic events in the Mediterranean, Italy and Greece in particular have experienced unprecedented flows of migrants, including applicants for international protection who are in clear need of international protection, arriving on their territories, generating a significant pressure on their migration and asylum systems.\n\n\n(8)According to data of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex), the Central and Eastern Mediterranean route were the main areas for irregular border crossing into the Union in 2014. In 2014, more than 170 000 migrants arrived in Italy alone in an irregular manner, representing an increase of 277% compared to 2013. A steady increase was also witnessed by Greece with more than 50 000 irregular migrants reaching the country, representing an increase of 153% compared to 2013. Statistics for the first months of 2015 confirm this clear trend in respect of Italy. In addition, Greece has faced in the first months of 2015 a sharp increase in the number of irregular border crossings, corresponding to more than 50% of the total number of irregular border crossings in 2014 (almost 28 000 in the first four months of 2015 in comparison to a total number of almost 55 000 in 2014). A significant proportion of the total number of irregular migrants detected in these two regions included migrants of nationalities which, based on the Eurostat data, meet a high Union level recognition rate (in 2014, the Syrians and the Eritreans, for which the Union recognition rate is more than 75%, represented more than 40% of the irregular migrants in Italy and more than 50% of them in Greece). According to Eurostat, 30 505 Syrians were found to be irregularly present in Greece in 2014 compared to 8 220 in 2013.\n\n\n(9)According to Eurostat, 64 625 persons applied for international protection in Italy in 2014, compared to 26 920 in 2013 (that is to say an increase of 143%). A lesser increase in the number of applications was witnessed by Greece with 9 430 applicants (that is to say an increase of 15%).\n\n\n(10)According to Frontex data, another important migration route into the Union in 2014 was the Western Balkan route with 43 357 irregular border crossings. However, the majority of migrants using the Balkan route are not prima facie in need of international protection, with 51% of the arrivals being made up only of Kosovars.\n\n\n(11)Many actions have been taken so far to support Italy and Greece in the framework of the migration and asylum policy, including by providing to them substantial emergency assistance and EASO operational support. Italy and Greece have been the second and third largest beneficiary of funding disbursed during the period 2007-2013 under the General Programme \"Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows\" (SOLID) and received in addition substantial emergency funding. Italy and Greece will continue to be the main beneficiaries of the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) over 2014-2020. \n\n\n\n\n(12)Due to the on-going instability and conflicts in the immediate neighbourhood of Italy and Greece, it is very likely that a significant and increased pressure will continue to be put on their migration and asylum systems, with a significant part of the migrants who may be in need of international protection. This demonstrates the critical need to show solidarity towards Italy and Greece and to complement the actions taken so far to support them with provisional measures in the area of international protection.\n\n\n(13)At the same time, Italy and Greece should provide structural solutions to address the shortcomings in the functioning of their asylum and migration systems. The measures laid down in this Decision should therefore go hand in hand with the establishment by Italy and Greece of a solid and strategic framework for responding to the crisis situation and intensifying the ongoing reform process in these areas. In this respect, Italy and Greece should each within one month of entry into force of this Decision, present a roadmap to the Commission which should include adequate measures in the area of asylum, first reception and return enhancing the capacity, quality and efficiency of their systems in these areas, as well as measures to ensure appropriate implementation of this Decision with a view to enable them to better cope, after the end of the applicability of this decision, with a possible increased inflow of migrants on their territories. \n\n\n(14)The Commission should be entrusted with the power to suspend, where appropriate, the application of this Decision for a limited amount of time where Italy or Greece does not respect their commitments in this regard.\n\n\n(15)If a Member State other than Italy or Greece should be confronted with a similar emergency situation characterised by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, and after consulting the European Parliament, may adopt provisional measures for the benefit of the Member State concerned, in line with Article 78(3) of the Treaty. Such measures may include, where appropriate, a suspension of the obligations of that Member State provided for in this Decision.\n\n\n(16)In line with Article 78(3) of the Treaty, the measures envisaged for the benefit of Italy and Greece should be of a provisional nature. A period of 24 months is reasonable in view of ensuring that the measures provided for in this Decision have a real impact in respect of supporting Italy and Greece to deal with the significant migration flows on their territories.\n\n\n(17)The measures foreseen in this Decision entail\u00a0a temporary derogation from the criterion laid down in Article 13(1) of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013\u00a0of the European Parliament and of the Council\n7\n and the procedural steps, including the time limits, laid down in Articles 21, 22 and 29 of that Regulation. \n\n\n(18)A choice had to be made in respect of the criteria to be applied when deciding which and how many applicants are to be relocated from Italy and Greece. A clear and workable system is envisaged based on a threshold of the average rate at Union level of decisions granting international protection in the procedures at first instance as defined by Eurostat out of the total number at Union level of decisions on asylum applications for international protection taken at first instance, based on the latest available statistics. On the one hand, this threshold would have to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that all applicants who are most likely in need of international protection would be in a position to fully and swiftly enjoy their protection rights in the Member State of relocation. On the other hand, it would prevent, to the maximum extent possible, applicants who are likely to receive a negative decision to their application from being relocated to another Member State and therefore prolong unduly their stay in the Union. Based on Eurostat data for 2014 first instance decisions, a threshold of 75%, which corresponds in that year to decisions on applications for Syrians and Eritreans, should be used in this Decision. \n\n\n(19)The provisional measures are intended to relieve the significant asylum pressure from Italy and Greece, in particular by relocating an important number of applicants in clear need of international protection who have arrived in the territory of Italy and Greece following the date on which this Decision becomes applicable. Based on the overall number of third-country nationals who have entered irregularly Italy and Greece in 2014 and the number of those who are in clear need of international protection, a total of 40 000 applicants in clear need of international protection should be relocated from Italy and Greece. This number corresponds to approximately 40% of the total number of third country nationals in clear need of international protection who have entered irregularly in Italy and Greece in 2014. Thus, the relocation measure proposed in this Decision constitutes fair burden sharing between Italy and Greece on the one hand and the other Member States on the other hand. Based on the same overall available figures in 2014 and in the first four months of 2015 in Italy compared to Greece, 60% of these applicants should be relocated from Italy and 40% from Greece. \n\n\n(20)In line with the Annex to the Communication from the Commission on the European Agenda on Migration\n8\n, the proposed distribution key should be based on a) the size of the population (40% weighting), b) the total of the GDP (40% weighting), c) the average number of spontaneous asylum applications and the number of resettled refugees per one million inhabitants over the period 2010-2014 (10% weighting) and d) the unemployment rate (10% weighting). The distribution keys set out in Annex I and Annex II of this Decision take into account the fact that the Member States from which relocation will take place should not themselves contribute as a Member State of relocation.\n\n\n(21)The Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) set up by Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n9\n\u00a0provides support to burden-sharing operations agreed between Member States and is open to new policy developments in that field. Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 foresees the possibility for Member States to implement actions related to the transfer of applicants for international protection as part of their national programmes, while Article 18 of Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 foresees the possibility of a lump sum of EUR 6\u00a0000 for the transfer of beneficiaries of international protection from another Member State.\n\n\n(22)With a view to implementing the principle of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility, and taking into account that this Decision constitutes a further policy development in this field, it is appropriate to ensure that the Member States that relocate applicants who are in clear need of international protection from Italy or Greece pursuant to this Decision receive a lump sum for each relocated person which is identical to the lump sum foreseen in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 and implemented by applying the same procedures. This entails a limited, temporary derogation from Article 18 of Regulation 516/2014, because the lump sum should be paid in respect of relocated applicants rather than beneficiaries of international protection. Such a temporary extension of the scope of potential recipients of the lump sum appears indeed an integral part of the emergency scheme set up by the present Decision.\n\n\n(23)It is necessary to ensure that a swift relocation procedure is put in place and to accompany the implementation of the provisional measures by a close administrative cooperation between Member States and operational support provided by EASO. \n\n\n(24)National security and public order should be taken into consideration throughout the relocation procedure, until the transfer of the applicant is implemented. \n\n\n(25)When deciding which applicants in clear need of international protection should be relocated from Italy and Greece, priority should be given to vulnerable applicants within the meaning of Article 22 of Directive 2013/33/EU\u00a0of the European Parliament and of the Council\n10\n. In this respect, special needs of applicants, including health, should be of primary concern.\u00a0The best interests of the child should always be a\u00a0primary consideration. \n\n\n(26)In addition, in order to decide which specific Member State should be the Member State of relocation, specific account should be given to the specific qualifications of the applicants concerned which could facilitate their integration into the Member State of relocation, such as their language skills. In the case of particularly vulnerable applicants, consideration should be given to the capacity of the Member State of relocation to provide adequate support to those applicants.\n\n\n(27)The appointment by Member States of liaison officers in Italy and Greece should facilitate the effective implementation of the relocation procedure, including the appropriate identification of the applicants to be relocated, taking into account in particular their vulnerability and qualifications. \n\n\n(28)The legal and procedural safeguards set out in Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 remain applicable in respect of applicants covered by this Decision. In addition, applicants should be informed of the relocation procedure set out in this Decision and notified with the relocation decision. Considering that an applicant does not have the right under EU law to choose the Member State responsible for his/her application, the applicant, should have the right to an effective remedy against the relocation decision in line with Regulation (EU) No 604/2013, only in view of ensuring respect of his/her fundamental rights. \n\n\n(29)Before and after being transferred to the Member States of relocation, applicants should enjoy the rights and guarantees set up in Council Directive 2003/9/EC\n11\n and Council Directive 2005/85/EC\n12\n, and, as from 20 July 2015, Directive 2013/33/EU and Directive 2013/32/EU\n13\n\u00a0of the European Parliament and of the Council, including in relation to their special reception and procedural needs. In addition, Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000\n14\n and, as from 20 July 2015, Regulation (EU) No 603/2013\n15\n remains applicable in respect of applicants covered by this Decision.\n\n\n(30)Measures should be taken in order to avoid secondary movements of relocated persons from the Member State of relocation to other Member States. In particular, applicants should be informed of the consequences of onward movement within the Member States and of the fact that, if the Member State of relocation grants them international protection, in principle, they are only entitled to the rights attached to international protection in that Member State.\n\n\n(31)Since the objectives of this Decision cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. \n\n\n\n\n(32)This Decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter. \n\n\n(33)[In accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, those Member States have notified their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.] \n\n\nOR\n\n\n(34)[In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, those Member States are not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and are not bound by it or subject to its application.] \n\n\nOR\n\n\n(35)[In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, the United Kingdom is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n\n\n(36)In accordance with Article 3 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Ireland has notified (, by letter of ...,) its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.]\n\n\nOR\n\n\n(37)[In accordance with Article 3 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the United Kingdom has notified (, by letter of ...,) its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.\n\n\n(38)In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application.]\n\n\n(39)In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its\u00a0application.\n\n\n(40)In view of the urgency of the situation, this Decision should enter into force on the date following that of its publication\u00a0in the Official Journal of the European Union,\n\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\nSubject-matter\n\n\nThis Decision establishes provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece in view of enabling them to cope with an emergency situation characterised by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries in those Member States.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions apply:\n\n\n(a) \u2018application for international protection\u2019 means an application for international protection as defined in point (h) of Article 2\u00a0of Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n16\n;\n\n\n(b) \u2018applicant\u2019 means a third-country national or a stateless person who has made an application for international protection in respect of which a final decision has not yet been taken;

The EU should not wait until the pressure is intolerable to act: the volumes of arrivals mean that the capacity of local reception and processing facilities is already stretched thin. To deal with the situation in the Mediterranean, the Commission will, by the end of May, propose triggering the emergency response system envisaged under Article 78(3) TFEU. The proposal will include a temporary distribution scheme for persons in clear need of international protection to ensure a fair and balanced participation of all Member States to this common effort. The receiving Member State will be responsible for the examination of the application in accordance with established rules and guarantees. A redistribution key based on criteria such as GDP, size of population, unemployment rate and past numbers of asylum seekers and of resettled refugees can be found in the Annex.\"\n\n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\n\n\nSpecific objective No 4\n\n\nTo enhance solidarity and responsibility-sharing between the Member States, in particular with those most affected by migration and asylum flows, including through practical cooperation\n\n\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\n\n\n18.03 \u2013 Asylum and Migration\n\n\n\n1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\n\n\nRelocation of 40.000 applicants from Italy and Greece to the other Member States. \n\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nNumber of applicants relocated \n\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nThis proposal is presented as result of a prevailing crisis in the area of asylum in Italy and Greece. The proposal based on Article 78(3) of the Treaty aims at preventing further deterioration of the asylum situation in these two countries and at providing them with effective support.\n\n\nIn its 23 April 2015 statement, the European Council committed to consider options for organising emergency relocation between all Member States on a voluntary basis. In its 28 April 2015 resolution, the European Parliament has called upon the Council to seriously consider the possibility of triggering Article 78(3) of the Treaty.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nThe emergency situation created by the sudden influx of third-country nationals in Italy and Greece puts their asylum systems and resources under considerable strain. As a consequence of this, other Member States can become affected, due to the secondary movements of these persons from Italy and Greece to these other Member  States. It is clear that actions of individual Member States cannot satisfactorily reply to the common challenges all Member States are confronted with in this. EU action in this field is therefore essential. \n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThis is the first time that a proposal is made under Article 78(3) of the Treaty.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nThe AMIF foresees the possibility of transfer of applicants for international protection as part of the national programme of each Member State on a voluntary basis.\n\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\u2611\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u2611\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from 2015 to 2017 \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\u00a0\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u2611\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\nThis legislative financial statement shows the amounts which are necessary to cover the cost of relocation of applicants for international protection from Italy and Greece to other Member States. The commitments appropriations should be added to the current allocation of the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) on the budget ligne 18.030101. The calculation of the payment needs is based on Regulation (EU) N\u00b0514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management (Horizontal Regulation).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nFor shared management, a coherent and efficient reporting, monitoring and evaluation framework is in place. For each national programme, Member States are requested to set up a Monitoring Committee to which the Commission may participate.\n\n\nOn an annual basis Member States will report on the implementation of the multiannual programme. These reports are a precondition for annual payments in the framework of the clearance of accounts procedure, set out in Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 514/2014 (Horizontal Regulation). \n\n\nIn 2018, the Commission will also submit a report on the mid term review carried out of the national programmes which will include the implementation of the financial ressources made available by this Council Decision.\n\n\nMore globally, the Commission will submit an intermediate report on the implementation of the Funds by 31.12.2018 and an ex-post evaluation report by 30.06.2024, covering the whole implementation (i.e. not only national programmes under shared management). \n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified \n\n\n\n\n\nDG HOME has not been facing important risks of errors in its spending programmes. This is confirmed by the recurrent absence of significant findings in the annual reports of the Court of Auditors as well as by the absence of residual error rate above 2% in the past years in DG HOME annual activity reports.\n\n\nThe management and control system follows the general requirements set in the CSF Funds and fully complies with the requirements of the Financial Regulation.\n\n\nMulti-annual programming coupled with annual clearance based on the payments made by the Responsible Authority aligns the eligibility periods with the annual accounts of the Commission, without increasing the administrative burden compared to the current system.\n\n\nOn the spot checks will be carried out as part of the 1st level controls, i.e. by the Responsible Authority and will support its annual management declaration of assurance. \n\n\nThe use of lump sums (simplified cost option) shall further reduce mistakes made by the responsible authorities when implementing this Decision. \n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nIn addition to the application of all regulatory control mechanisms, DG HOME will devise an antifraud strategy in line with the Commission's new anti-fraud strategy (CAFS) adopted on 24 June 2011 in order to ensure inter alia that its internal anti-fraud related controls are fully aligned with the CAFS and that its fraud risk management approach is geared to identify fraud risk areas and adequate responses. Where necessary, networking groups and adequate IT tools dedicated to analysing fraud cases related to the Funds will be set up.\n\n\nAs regards shared management, the CAFS identifies clearly the need for the Commission proposals for 2014-2020 regulations to request Member States to put in place fraud prevention measures which are effective and proportionate to the identified fraud risks. The current proposal includes in Article 5 a clear requirement for the Member States to prevent, detect and correct irregularities and to report to the\n\n\nCommission. Further details as regards these obligations will be part of the detailed rules on the functions of the Responsible Authority as foreseen in Article 24(5)(c).\n\n\nIn addition, the re-use of funds coming from financial correction based on commission or Court of Auditors findings has been clearly indicated in Article 41.\n\n\n\n2.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \n\n\n\nNegligable control costs and very low error risk.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\nThe standard measures in DG HOME for the prevention of fraud and irregularities will apply.\n\n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE
