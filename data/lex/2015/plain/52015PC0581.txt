Council decision 2014/492/EU of 16 June 2014\n1\n approved the signing of the Agreement, on behalf of the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member\u00a0States, and the provisional application of certain provisions thereof. \n\n\nThe Agreement established the Association Council, which is to supervise and monitor the application and implementation, as well as periodically review the functioning of the Agreement in light of its objectives. The Association Council is to adopt a decision on when the full implementation and enforcement of the Agreement is ensured on the entire territory of the Republic of Moldova. \n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThis proposal implements the Union\u2019s common commercial policy toward an Eastern Partner country, based on the provisions of the above-mentioned Agreement. It aims to ensure that the economic benefits of the Deep and Comprehensiev Free Trade Area apply to the entire territory of the Republic of Moldova. \n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThis proposal is consistent with and complements the other external policies of the Union, notably the European Neighbourhood Policy and the development cooperation policy in relation to the Republic of Moldova.\n\n\n2.Legal basis, subsidiarity and proportionality\n\n\n\uf0b7Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for\u00a0establishing the Union position to be taken in the bodies set up by the Agreement between the Union and the Republic of Moldova is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular its Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof. \n\n\n\uf0b7Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\n\nThe common commercial policy, in accordance with Article 3 of the TFEU, is defined as an exclusive Union competence. Therefore, the subsidiarity principle does not apply.\n\n\n\uf0b7Proportionality\n\n\nThis proposal is necessary in order to implement the Union\u2019s international commitments set out in the Agreement with the Republic of Moldova. \n\n\n\uf0b7Choice of instrument\n\n\nThis proposal is in accordance with Article 218(9) TFEU, which envisages the adoption by Council of decisions. There exists no other legal instrument that could be used in order to achieve the objective expressed in this proposal. \n\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\uf0b7Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\uf0b7Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nStakeholder consultations are not applicable to this proposal.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThe Commission has taken into account the views of external experts and bodies assisting the Union in the implementation of the neighbourhood policy. \n\n\n\uf0b7Impact assessment\n\n\nThe proposal relates to the implementation of the Agreement on the entire territory of the Republic of Moldova, which has been subject to ex-ante impact assessment in 2009, followed by the Commission DG Trade's Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment of 2012, which fed into the DCFTA negotiation process.\n\n\n\uf0b7Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nThe Agreement between the Union and the Republic of Moldova is not subject to REFIT procedures. \n\n\n\uf0b7Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe proposal does not have negative consequences for the protection of fundamental rights. \n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\uf0b7Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe implementation of the Agreement is regularly reviewed by the EU-Republic of Moldova Association Council. The European Commission also committed to report annually on the implementation of Title V (Trade and trade-related matters) of the Agreement, to the European Parliament.\n\n\n\uf0b7Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nThe proposal aims to adopt a Union position in relation to the application of Title V (Trade and trade-related matters) of the Agreement on the entire territory of the Republic of Moldova. Article 462(2) of the Agreement provides that the application of Title V of the Agreement or of the entire Agreement on the entire territory of the Republic of Moldova is to start once the Republic of Moldova ensures full implementation and enforcement of Title V or of the Agrement in the areas over which the Government of the Republic of Moldova does not exercise effective control. The Republic of Moldova has informed the European Commission that it can ensure full implementation and enforcement of Title V of the Agreement starting on 1 January 2016.
