"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 22.4.2015\nCOM(2015) 175 final\n2015/0092(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union within the Association Council established by the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Tunisia, of the other part, as regards the replacement of Protocol 4 to that Agreement, concerning the definition of the concept of \u2018originating products\u2019 and methods of administrative cooperation, by a new protocol which, as regards the rules of origin, refers to the Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThe Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin\n1\n ('the Convention') lays down provisions on the origin of goods traded under relevant Agreements concluded between the Contracting Parties. The EU and Tunisia signed the Convention on 15 June 2011 and on 16 January 2013 respectively.\n\n\nThe EU and Tunisia deposited their instrument of acceptance with the depositary of the Convention on 26 March 2012 and 21 November 2014 respectively. As a consequence, in application of its Article 10(3), the Convention entered into force in relation to the EU and Tunisia on 1\u00a0May\u00a02012 and on 1 January 2015 respectively.\n\n\nArticle 6 of the Convention provides that each Contracting Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the Convention is effectively applied. To that effect, the Association Council established by the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Tunisia, of the other part\n2\n, should adopt a Decision replacing Protocol 4 concerning the definition of the concept of 'originating products' and methods of administrative cooperation by a new Protocol which, with regard to the rules of origin, refers to the Convention. The position to be taken by the EU within the Association Council should be established by the Council.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe EU Member States were informed on the draft Council Decision in the Customs Code Committee's Origin Section of 13 May 2013. The Contracting Parties to the Convention were last consulted at the meeting of the Pan-Euro-Med working group of 22 and 23 October 2014.\n\n\nNo recourse to external expertise has been necessary. Furthermore, it has not been necessary to conduct an impact assessment, since the proposed amendments are technical in nature and do not affect the substance of the protocol on rules of origin currently in effect.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThe legal basis for the Council Decision is Article\u00a0207 in conjunction with Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The principle of subsidiarity does therefore not apply.\n\n\nProposed instrument: Council Decision.\n\n\n2015/0092 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union within the Association Council established by the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Tunisia, of the other part, as regards the replacement of Protocol 4 to that Agreement, concerning the definition of the concept of \u2018originating products\u2019 and methods of administrative cooperation, by a new protocol which, as regards the rules of origin, refers to the Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Protocol 4 to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Tunisia, of the other part\n3\n (\u2018the Agreement\u2019), concerns the definition of the concept of \u2018originating products\u2019 and methods of administrative cooperation (\u2018Protocol 4\u2019).\n\n\n(2)The Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin\n4\n (\u2018the Convention\u2019) lays down provisions on the origin of goods traded under relevant agreements concluded between the Contracting Parties.\n\n\n(3)The Union and Tunisia\u00a0signed the Convention on 15 June 2011 and 16 January 2013 respectively.\n\n\n(4)The Union and Tunisia\u00a0deposited their instruments of acceptance with the depositary of the Convention on 26 March 2012 and 21 November 2014 respectively.
