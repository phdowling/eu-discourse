The Scheme of control and enforcement\r\ncontains such measures and applies to all vessels used or intended for use for\r\nfishing activities conducted on fishery resources in areas defined in the\r\nConvention.\nRegulation (EU) No 1236/2010 transposes\r\ninto Union law the Scheme of control and enforcement adopted by the NEAFC. This\r\nregulation lays down certain specific control measures to monitor fishing\r\nactivities in the area covered by the Convention on Future Multilateral\r\nCooperation in North East Atlantic Fisheries and supplements the control\r\nmeasures provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November\r\n2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the\r\nrules of the common fisheries policy,[1]\r\nand in Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 establishing a\r\nCommunity system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and\r\nunregulated fishing[2].\nAt its Annual Meetings in 2012 and 2013,\r\nNEAFC adopted recommendations amending the Scheme of control and enforcement.\r\nThe main change, operated by Recommendation 9/2014, is the alignment of the\r\nScheme with the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and\r\nEliminate IUU, approved by the EU in 2011. Contracting\r\nParties have agreed that this recommendation will enter into force on 1 July\r\n2015. The\r\nother change, made through Recommendation 15/2013, clarifies that vessels\r\ninvolved in a transhipment operation in the Regulatory Area as receiving vessel\r\nshall communicate the port of landing regardless of whether the landing is to\r\ntake place in a port inside or outside the Convention Area. At its Annual Meeting in November 2014, NEAFC adopted Recommendation\r\n12/2015 amending Recommendation 9/2014 with respect to notification procedures\r\non Port State Control of foreign fishing vessels with the aim to adapt them for the switch-over from a paper based system to a modern web-based\r\nICT application, operated by the NEAFC Secretary.\nRecommendation 15/2013 came into force in 2013 and Recommendation 9/2014 as amended by\r\nRecommendation 12/2015 will enter into force on 1 July\r\n2015. Both Recommendations are binding on the\r\nContracting Parties under the terms of the NEAFC Convention. The EU, as a\r\nContracting Party, should consequently apply them.\nThese Recommendations were adopted with the\r\nfull support of the EU in NEAFC. It is in the EU's interest therefore that they\r\nbe introduced in Union law by means of the proposed regulation.\n\u2022 Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\nRegulation (EU) No 1236/2010 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council laying down a scheme of control and\r\nenforcement applicable in the area covered by the Convention on future\r\nmultilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic fisheries transposes into\r\nUnion law the Scheme of control and enforcement adopted by the NEAFC. It should then be amended in order to incorporate into Union law\r\namendments to the Scheme which become obligatory for the Union.\nMeasures to implement Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 were adopted through Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 433/2012 of 23 May 2012\r\nlaying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council laying down a scheme of control\r\nand enforcement applicable in the area covered by the Convention on future\r\nmultilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic fisheries.\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008\r\nestablishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing (the \"IUU Regulation\") applies\r\nsince 1 January 2010.\n\u2022 Consistency\r\nwith the other policies and objectives of the Union\nThis proposal is, in keeping with the\r\ngeneral pattern of the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources, in\r\ncompliance with the objectives of the common fisheries policy and contributes\r\nto sustainable development.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u2022 Consultation\r\nof interested parties\nConsultation methods, main sectors\r\ntargeted and general profile of respondents\nNot applicable\nSummary of responses and how they\r\nhave been taken into account\nNot applicable\n\u2022 Collection\r\nand use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\n\u2022 Impact\r\nassessment\nNot applicable\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u2022 Summary\r\nof the proposed action\nTranspose into Union law amendments to the\r\nScheme of control and enforcement adopted by NEAFC.\n\u2022 Legal\r\nbasis\nArticle 43(2) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union\n\u2022 Subsidiarity\r\nprinciple\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\r\napply.\n\u2022 Proportionality\r\nprinciple\nThe proposal incorporates into Union law\r\namendments to the Scheme as adopted in NEAFC Recommendations 15/2013 and 9/2014\r\nas amended by Recommendation 12/2015. These recommendations are binding for the\r\nContracting Parties to NEAFC and consequently for the EU. Therefore, no concern\r\non the principle of proportionality arises.\n\u2022 Choice\r\nof instruments\nProposed instrument: regulation of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reason: Recommendations adopted by regional fisheries management\r\norganisations are transposed in European Parliament and Council regulations,\r\nunless the powers to transpose them have been delegated to the Commission,\r\nwhich is not the case for the concerned Recommendations. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nUnion budget.\n2015/0063 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council laying down a scheme of control and\r\nenforcement applicable in the area covered by the Convention on future\r\nmultilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic fisheries\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[3],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n1236/2010 incorporates into Union law the provisions of the Scheme of control\r\nand enforcement (the Scheme) established by a recommendation adopted by the\r\nNorth-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) at its Annual Meeting on 15\r\nNovember 2006, and subsequently amended by several recommendations at the\r\nAnnual Meetings in November 2007, 2008 and 2009.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its Annual Meeting in\r\nNovember 2012, NEAFC adopted Recommendation 15:2013 amending Article 13 of the\r\nScheme, concerning the communication of transhipments\r\nand of port of landing.

At its Annual Meeting in November 2014, NEAFC\r\nadopted Recommendation 12:2015 amending Recommendation 9:2014 with respect to\r\nArticles 22 and 23 of the Scheme on Port State Control of foreign fishing\r\nvessels.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under Articles 12 and 15\r\nof the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic\r\nfisheries approved by Council Decision 81/608/EEC, Recommendation 15:2013\u00a0 came\r\ninto force on 8 February 2013.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to its\r\nprovisions, Recommendation 9:2014 as amended by Recommendation 12:2015 will\r\nenter into force on 1 July 2015.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to\r\ntranspose those Recommendations into Union law.
