"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 5.8.2015\nCOM(2015) 390 final\n2015/0170(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the Association Committee in Trade configuration established by the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other part\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\uf0b7Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nThe attached proposal constitutes the legal instrument for establishing the Union position to be adopted on its behalf in a body set up by an association agreement between the Union and a third country. In particular, it relates to the implementation of the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other part ('the Agreement'). \n\n\nThe Agreement was signed on 27 June 2014, and is provisionally applied, pending ratification by the Member States, since 1 September 2014. Council decision 2014/492/EU of 16 June 2014\n1\n approved the signing of the Agreement, on behalf of the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member\u00a0States, and the provisional application of certain provisions thereof. \n\n\nThe Agreement established the Association Committee in Trade configuration, which monitors the implementation of Title V (Trade and Trade-related matters) of the Agreement and resolves related issues. This Committee has to establish a list of arbitrators to ensure the proper functioning of the dispute settlement mechanism, as provided for in Article 404 of the Agreement. \n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThis proposal implements the Union\u2019s common commercial policy toward an Eastern Partner country, based on the provisions of the above-mentioned Agreement. It aims to set up the necessary institutional instruments enabling the Union and the Republic of Moldova to effectively address bilateral disputes concerning the application and interpretation of the Agreement. It is consistent with the Union's approach to dispute settlement disciplines negotiated or implemented within free trade agreements with other trade partners. \n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency\u00a0with other Union policies\n\n\nThis proposal is consistent and complements the other external policies of the Union, notably the European Neighbourhood Policy and the development cooperation policy in relation to the Republic of Moldova.\n\n\n2.Legal basis, subsidiarity and proportionality\n\n\n\uf0b7Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for\u00a0establishing the Union position to be taken in the committees set up by the Agreement between the Union and the Republic of Moldova is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU'), and in particular its Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof. \n\n\n\uf0b7Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\n\nThe common commercial policy, in accordance with Article 3 of the TFEU, is defined as an exclusive Union competence. Therefore, the subsidiarity principle does not apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Proportionality\n\n\nThis proposal is necessary in order to implement the Union\u2019s international commitments set out in the Agreement with the Republic of Moldova. \n\n\n\uf0b7Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\n\nThis proposal is in accordance with Article 218(9) TFEU, which envisages the adoption by the Council of decisions. There exists no other legal instrument that could be used in order to achieve the objective expressed in this proposal.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\uf0b7Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\uf0b7Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nStakeholder consultations are not applicable to this proposal.\n\n\n\uf0b7Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThe Commission has taken into account input provided by Member States in recent years as regards Union nationals who are suitable and qualified to act as arbitrations in disputes brought under the Union's trade agreements.\n\n\n\uf0b7Impact assessment\n\n\nThe proposal relates to the implementation of institutional aspects of the Agreement, and in particular its Title V on Trade and trade-related matters, between the Union and the Republic of Moldova. The proposal does not have any impact on the economic, social or environmental policy of the Union. The Agreement has been provisionally applied since 1 September 2014, and its implementation is at a very early stage. \n\n\n\uf0b7Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nThe Agreement between the Union and the Republic of Moldova is not subject to REFIT procedures; it does not imply any costs for SMEs; and it does not raise any issues from the viewpoint of the digital environment. \n\n\n\uf0b7Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe proposal does not have consequences for the protection of fundamental rights. \n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\uf0b7Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe implementation of the Agreement is reviewed regularly by the EU-Republic of Moldova Association Council. The European Commission also committed to report annually on the implementation of Title V (Trade and trade-related matters) of the Agreement, including on the elements included in this proposal, to the European Parliament.\n\n\n\uf0b7Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\uf0b7Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nThe proposal aims to adopt a Union position in relation to the implementation of the trade part of the Agreement between the Union and the Republic Moldova. Title V (Trade and trade-related matters) of that Agreement includes Chapter 14 (Dispute Settlement), which provides for a mechanism to resolve trade-related disputes between the parties to the Agreement, concerning the application or interpretation of the trade part of that Agreement. The arbitration procedure set out in Chapter 14 provides that the complaining party may request establishment of an arbitration panel to resolve a bilateral dispute. Article 404 of the Agreement sets out the rules for the composition of the panel. The Agreement envisages the establishment of a list of qualified individuals who may serve as arbitrators. Accordingly, a draft list of arbitrators who are willing and able to serve on an arbitration panel has been discussed with the Government of the Republic of Moldova, providing for five candidate arbitrators from the Union, five candidate arbitrators from the Republic of Moldova and five third-country nationals who may serve as chairpersons of an arbitration panel. The list will be used in cases when an arbitration panel needs to be established. \n\n\n2015/0170 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the Association Committee in Trade configuration established by the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other part\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Article 464(3) and (4) of the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other part (\u02bbthe Agreement\u02bc), provide for the provisional application of the Agreement in part, as specified by the Union.\n\n\n(2)Article 3 of Council Decision 2014/492/EU\n2\n specifies the provisions of the Agreement to be applied provisionally, including the provisions on the establishment and functioning of the Association Committee in Trade configuration and on dispute settlement.
