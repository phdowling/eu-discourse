In each meeting session new amendments to\r\nexisting UN Regulations or UN Global Technical Regulations (UN GTRs) are\r\nadopted in order to allow for technical progress. Prior to each WP29 meeting\r\nthese amendments were adopted by one of the six working groups (GRs) that are\r\nactive under WP29.\nSubsequently, in a WP29 meeting the final\r\nvote for adoption of the amendments, supplements and corrigenda takes place,\r\nprovided the quorum is reached and there is a qualified majority among\r\ncontracting parties. The EU is a contracting party to two Agreements (1958 and\r\n1998 Agreements) under WP29. A Council Decision, referred to as \"mega\r\ndecision\", containing the list of amendments, supplements and corrigenda,\r\nis prepared each time and authorises the Commission to vote on behalf of the Union\r\nin each WP29 meeting.\nThis Council Decision defines the Union's\r\nposition in the voting of the amendments, supplements and corrigenda submitted\r\nfor vote in the March 2015 WP29 meeting that will take place on 10 to 13 March\r\n2015.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Technical Committee - Motor Vehicles\r\nhas been consulted and the comments from Member State experts have been taken\r\ninto account.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \r\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal defines the Union's position\r\nin the voting of the amendments to UN Regulations Nos. 7, 13, 23, 37, 38, 41,\r\n43, 45, 51, 55, 59, 75, 78, 98, 99, 106, 107, 110, 112, 113, 117, 119, 123,\r\n128, 129, on Amendment 2 to UN GTR No. 3 with regard to motorcycle braking, on\r\nAmendment 3 to UN GTR No. 4 with regard to the Worldwide Heavy-Duty Certification\r\nprocedure.\n\u00b7                        \r\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis for this proposal is\r\nArticle 114, in conjunction with Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union.\n\u00b7                        \r\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe vote in favour of international\r\ninstruments like proposals for amendments to UN Regulations and draft Global\r\nTechnical Regulations and their incorporation into the Union system for the\r\ntype-approval of motor vehicles can only be done by the Union. This does not\r\nonly prevent fragmentation of the Internal Market, but also ensures equal\r\nhealth and safety standards across the Union. It also offers advantages of\r\neconomies of scale: products can be made for the entire Union market and even\r\nthe international market, instead of being customised to obtain national\r\ntype-approval for every single Member State.\nThis proposal therefore complies with the\r\nsubsidiarity principle.\n\u00b7                        \r\nProportionality principle\nThis Council Decision authorises the\r\nCommission to vote on behalf of Union and is the proportionate instrument in\r\naccordance with Article 5(1) of Council Decision 97/836/EC in order to define a\r\nunified EU position at the UNECE with respect to the vote on the working\r\ndocuments proposed on the agenda of the WP29 meeting. Therefore, this proposal\r\ncomplies with the proportionality principle as it does not go beyond what is\r\nnecessary in order to achieve the objectives of ensuring the proper functioning\r\nof the Internal Market, while at the same time providing for a high level of\r\npublic safety and protection.\n\u00b7                        \r\nChoice of instruments\nThe use of a Council Decision is required\r\nby Article 218(9) TFEU in order to establish the positions to be adopted on the\r\nUnion\u2019s behalf in a body set up by an international agreement.\n2015/0033 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be adopted on\r\nthe Union's behalf in the relevant Committees of the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Europe as regards the proposals for amendments to UN Regulations\r\nNos. 7, 13, 23, 37, 38, 41, 43, 45, 51, 55, 59, 75, 78, 98, 99, 106, 107, 110,\r\n112, 113, 117, 119, 123, 128, 129, on Amendment 2 to UN GTR No. 3 with regard\r\nto motorcycle braking, on Amendment 3 to UN GTR No. 4 with regard to the\r\nWorldwide Heavy-Duty Certification procedure\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114, in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Council Decision 97/836/EC[3], the Union acceded to\r\nthe Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)\r\nconcerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled\r\nvehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled\r\nvehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on\r\nthe basis of these prescriptions (\u2018Revised 1958 Agreement\u2019).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Council Decision 2000/125/EC[4], the Union acceded to\r\nthe Agreement concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for\r\nwheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on\r\nwheeled vehicles (\u2018Parallel Agreement\u2019).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[5]\r\nreplaced the approval systems of the Member States with a Union approval\r\nprocedure and established a harmonised framework containing administrative provisions\r\nand general technical requirements for all new vehicles, systems, components\r\nand separate technical units. That Directive incorporated UN regulations in the\r\nEU type-approval system, either as requirements for type-approval or as\r\nalternatives to Union legislation. Since the adoption of that Directive, UN\r\nregulations have increasingly replaced Union legislation in the framework of\r\nthe EU type-approval.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of experience and technical developments, the\r\nrequirements relating to certain elements or features covered by UN Regulations\r\nNos. 7, 13, 23, 37, 38, 41, 43, 45, 51, 55, 59, 75, 78, 98, 99, 106, 107, 110,\r\n112, 113, 117, 119, 123, 128, 129, by UN GTR No. 3 with regard to motorcycle\r\nbraking and by UN GTR No. 4 with regard to the Worldwide Heavy-Duty\r\nCertification procedure, need to be adapted.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore necessary to establish the position to be\r\nadopted on the Union's behalf in the Administrative Committee of the Revised\r\n1958 Agreement and in the Executive Committee of the Parallel Agreement, as\r\nregards the adoption of those UN acts,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe position to be adopted on the Union's\r\nbehalf in the Administrative Committee of the Revised 1958 Agreement and in the\r\nExecutive Committee of the Parallel Agreement on 10 to 13\r\nMarch 2015 shall be to vote in favour of the UN acts listed in the Annex to\r\nthis Decision.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\ndate of its adoption.\nDone at
