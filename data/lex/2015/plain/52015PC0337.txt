As an important step in these efforts, the European Council agreed in October 2014 the 2030 policy framework for climate and energy.\n\n\nThe implementation of this 2030 energy and climate policy framework is a key element for building a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate policy which is an overarching priority for the Commission over the coming years. At the same time, with the agreement on the 2030 policy framework and its implementation through this proposal, the EU has taken an important step towards a strong international climate agreement to be adopted in Paris in December 2015. \n\n\nA centrepiece of the 2030 policy framework is the binding target to reduce overall EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% domestically below 1990 levels by 2030. To achieve this target cost-effectively, the sectors covered by the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) will have to reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005 while\u00a0non-ETS sectors will have to reduce their emissions by 30% compared to 2005. The European Council outlined the main principles to achieve the reduction in the EU ETS\n1\n. This proposal creates the necessary legal framework implementing these principles set out by the European Council, addressing three main issues:\n\n\n(1) The proposal translates the 43% greenhouse gas reduction target in 2030 in the ETS into a cap declining by 2.2% annually from 2021 onwards, corresponding to an additional reduction of around 556 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in the period 2021-2030 compared to the current annual decline of 1.74%.\n\n\n(2) The proposal builds on the positive experience with the harmonised rules implemented since 2013, by further developing predictable, robust and fair rules for free allocation of allowances to industry to address the potential risk of carbon leakage in an adequate manner. The proposed rules aim at safeguarding the international competitiveness of the EU energy intensive industries in the gradual transition to a low-carbon economy as long as no comparable efforts are undertaken in other major economies, and maintain incentives for long-term investment in low-carbon technologies. Given that the European Council has decided that the share of allowances auctioned should not reduce, the number of allowances for free for industry is limited, necessitating well-targeted rules. This targeting is mainly achieved by three means: A more frequent alignment of the free allocation to production data will ensure that support is provided to growing companies and sectors. Updating the benchmarks used to calculate the free allocation will reflect industries' technological capacities and progress over the previous decade. The list of sectors receiving the highest share of free allocation will be more targeted to those most exposed to the potential risk of carbon leakage. While carbon leakage rules mainly address compensation for direct carbon costs, the proposal also addresses indirect carbon costs.\n\n\nBearing in mind the different energy mixes of Member States, proceeds from the EU ETS should be used for compensation of indirect carbon costs in line with State aid rules. Member States should partially compensate certain installations in sectors or sub-sectors which have been determined to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage because of costs related to greenhouse gas emissions passed on in electricity prices, where such support is necessary and proportionate and the incentive to save energy and to stimulate a shift in demand from \"grey\" to \"green\" electricity is maintained.\n\n\nThe Protocol and accompanying decisions adopted by the Conference of the Parties in Paris need to provide for the dynamic mobilisation of climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building for eligible Parties, particularly those with least capabilities. Public sector climate finance will continue to play an important in mobilising resources after 2020. Therefore, auction revenues should also be used for climate financing actions in vulnerable third countries, including adaptation to the impacts of climate. The amount of climate finance to be mobilised will also depend on the ambition and quality of the proposed Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of Parties, subsequent investment plans and national adaptation planning processes. \n\n\nProceeds from the EU ETS should also be used to promote skill formation and reallocation of labour affected by the transition of jobs in a decarbonising economy, in close coordination with the social partners.\n\n\n(3) The proposal contains several funding mechanisms to support economic actors in the power sector and industry in the innovation and investment challenges they face in the transition to a low-carbon economy. More specifically, the proposal supplements existing support for demonstration of innovative technologies and extends this to breakthrough innovation in industry. Free allocation of allowances continues to be available to modernise the power sector in lower-income Member States and a dedicated fund is established to facilitate investments in modernising the energy systems and improve energy efficiency so as to contribute to emission reductions. This additional funding builds on existing experience with the cooperation between the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) in the context of the EU ETS and, where relevant, draws on features of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI).\n\n\nThis proposal also adapts the Directive and all powers previously delegated to the Commission for exercise through the Regulatory Procedure with scrutiny, to the system of delegated and implementing acts agreed pursuant to the Treaty of Lisbon\n2\n. In the light of the EU's commitment to Better Regulation, delegations and implementing acts are maintained only where they are essential for the effective operation of the EU ETS.\n\n\nThis proposal does not address issues relating to aviation's coverage in the EU ETS. Adjustments to the Directive's application to aviation activities should take effect after an international agreement has been reached at the ICAO Assembly in 2016 on a global-market based measure for implementation by 2020.\n\n\nConsistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nIn terms of coherence with other policies in the area of climate action, renewables and energy efficiency policies are the most relevant. Both policies fully support the environmental effectiveness of the EU ETS and synergies between these policies and the EU ETS have been strengthened through the recently agreed Market Stability Reserve. In particular, as analysed in the impact assessment accompanying the 2030 climate and energy framework, cost-effectively achieving the overall emission reduction target of 40% compared to 1990 requires substantial contributions from renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.\n\n\nIn terms of coherence with international climate policy, it is important to note that the EU ETS has effectively put a price on carbon and is widely used as a model for emissions trading systems around the world, benefitting from the EU's learning effects.\n\n\nConsistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe proposal provides for implementation of part of the 2030 climate and energy policy framework as a key element in the context of building a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecarbonisation requires adjustments. EU policies and funds actively accompany those adjustments. In addition to the measures directly related to the EU ETS, EU instruments such as the European Fund for Strategic Investments or the Horizon 2020 programme as well as the European Structural and Investment Funds (EFSI) also offer potential funding for low-carbon innovation investments, leading to a perceived risk of funding duplication. The expansion of renewable energy and resource efficiency as well R&D are priority areas of the European Fund for Strategic Investment that will generate \u20ac315 billion of additional investment in the EU in the next three years. EFSI will work through financial instruments only, lending to existing projects ready to start within three years and will have a wider scope covering variety of sectors such as the digital economy and education. EU ETS funding is designed in accordance with State aid rules so as to ensure the effectiveness of public spending and to prevent market distortions. EU employment, social and skills policies accompany the transition of jobs in a decarbonising economy, including through the European Social Fund.\n\n\n\n 2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\nLegal basis\n\n\nArticles 191 to 193 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) confirm and specify EU competencies in the area of climate change. The legal basis for this proposal is Article 192 TFEU. \n\n\nSubsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe EU ETS Directive is an existing EU policy instrument that continues after 2020. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, the objectives of the proposal amending this instrument can only be achieved through a proposal from the Commission at EU level. \n\n\nClimate change is a trans-boundary problem, so coordination is necessary of climate action at European level and, where possible, at global level. More specifically, action at EU level will most effectively deliver the post-2020 carbon market reform, incentivising industry to invest in low-carbon technologies while preserving their international competitiveness and the EU's internal market.\n\n\nThe objectives of this Directive therefore cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting unilaterally, but can rather, by reasons of the scale and effects of the Directive, be better achieved at Union level.\n\n\nProportionality\n\n\nAs set out in the impact assessment, the proposal complies with the proportionality principle because it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives of implementing the EU's greenhouse gas emission reduction target for 2030 in a cost-effective manner while at the same time ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choice of the instrument\n\n\nThe objectives of the present proposal can best be pursued through a Directive. This is the most appropriate legal instrument to make amendments to the existing EU ETS Directive (Directive 2003/87/EC).\n\n\nA Directive requires Member States to achieve the objectives and implement the measures into their national substantive and procedural law systems. This approach gives the Member States more freedom when implementing an EU measure than does a Regulation, in that Member States are left the choice of the most appropriate means of implementing the measures in the Directive. This allows Member States to ensure that the amended rules are consistent with their existing substantive and procedural legal framework implementing the EU ETS, in particular regulating the permitting of installations as well as enforcement measures and penalties.\n\n\nFinally, the choice of a Directive as the appropriate instrument is also in line with the principle that there should be as little intervention as possible, so long as the objectives are achieved.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nEx-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nThe preliminary findings of a study evaluating the existing ETS Directive in terms of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, EU-added value and coherence with other Union policies indicate that overall the EU ETS as a policy tool combining environmental regulation with a market instrument is working in practice and delivering on its targets. It is highly relevant for meeting the EU's climate targets, as it represents a cost-effective way for emission reductions. Emissions in the covered sectors have decreased steadily, and even though not all emission reductions can be attributed to the EU ETS alone, there is evidence that the system does contribute effectively to emission reductions. \n\n\nThe EU ETS facilitates the internalisation of CO2 costs. It plays a role when investment decisions are taken, even though with the current low carbon price, the CO2 costs are often included in the general envelope of energy costs. Smaller improvements in terms of GHG efficiency have become regular practice, but larger investments in GHG efficiency still remain the exception. \n\n\nMoreover, the EU ETS has a clear EU value added since different systems or other climate policies at Member State level would lead to a fragmented and costly situation for the regulated entities, as well as different ambition levels and carbon prices throughout the EU, leading also to administrative complexity. The EU ETS with an EU-wide carbon price and its harmonised infrastructure takes advantages of the synergies that EU action can provide. \n\n\nHowever, the implementation of the emission reduction target for 2030 and setting the cap at the emission level leading to a reduction of 43% compared to 2005 requires changes to the existing framework. This mainly includes the change of the annual linear reduction factor reducing the EU ETS cap from 2021 onwards, free allocation and carbon leakage, the share of allowances to be auctioned as well as low-carbon funding mechanisms. \n\n\n\n\nStakeholder consultations\n\n\nAt various steps in developing this proposal, Member States, industry representatives, NGOs, research and academic institutions, trade unions and citizens were involved. Complementing the public consultation for the 2030 framework, an extensive follow-up stakeholder consultation was carried out on various technical aspects of the post-2020 carbon leakage provisions, as well as aspects related to innovation support. The Commission gained important insights from a written consultation open for comments from May to July 2014\n3\n and three stakeholder meetings convened in June, July and September 2014\n4\n focussing on carbon leakage. The findings of this consultation are publicly available on the following website:\n\n\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/cap/leakage/documentation_en.htm\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis was followed by an online consultation open for comments from December 2014 to March 2015 focussing mainly on other EU ETS aspects, such as the continuation of the free allocation for the power sector, lessons learnt from the NER300 applicable to the future Innovation Fund and its extension to industrial innovation projects, the governance structure of the Modernisation Fund, experience with the optional exclusion of small emitters from the ETS in phase 3, fees for the Union registry and the general evaluation of the EU ETS. The Commission received over 500 contributions from a wide spectrum of stakeholders. The results of this second consultation are reported in section 1.3.2. and Annex 3 of the Impact Assessment accompanying this proposal\n5\n and have been taken into account for the current proposal to the extent possible.\n\n\nIn general, the public consultations showed broad support for the EU ETS as a policy instrument.\n\n\nOn free allocation and addressing the risk of carbon leakage, a number of industry stakeholders favour limited changes to the current system, while other stakeholders, including Member States and civil society, believe that more targeting or further harmonisation is needed. Taking into account these comments, the proposal provides for limited changes to the existing rules, but a more targeted approach to free allocation, updating benchmarks based on technological progress achieved over time while ensuring an adequate protection of industry's international competitiveness. At the same time, the proposal allows for a better alignment of the free allocation with current production levels by a more frequent calculation of individual allocations.\n\n\nWith regard to the Innovation Fund, energy and industry stakeholders generally welcome continued support for low-carbon innovation and the expansion of scope to include industry reflected in the proposal. Views differed on how the risk sharing approach could be tailored for industry or CCS to improve the effectiveness compared to the current NER 300 mechanism. The proposal addresses such concerns by allowing support at an earlier stage in the project life cycle and a higher rate of support. \n\n\nOn the Modernisation Fund, views on the appropriate governance structure also differed to a certain extent. Some stakeholders support a key role for the beneficiary Member States in managing the Fund, while others ask for a stronger role for all Member States, the Commission and the European Investment Bank. The proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the need to ensure efficient funding of projects in the beneficiary Member States on the one hand, and to ensure that the interests of all Member States and the expertise of the EIB on the other hand, are brought together to modernise the energy systems.\n\n\nRegarding the optional free allocation to the energy sector, market participants generally support streamlined and simplified rules, as well as harmonised reporting guidelines to enhance the transparency of the mechanism. This need for increased transparency and clearer rules is duly reflected in the proposal, in particular, by enabling the Commission to publish information on investments received from the Member States.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nIn terms of external expertise, the Commission bases itself on the growing body of peer-reviewed empirical research on the EU ETS. In addition it gathered expertise from a study on evaluation of the ETS, commissioned in 2014 and carried out by a consortium led by ICF International\n6\n. Furthermore, in 2014, a study\n7\n was commissioned to assess the issue of costs being passed through from industrial sectors to their downstream customers and to determine the factors influencing such ability to pass through costs quantifying it for major energy intensive industry sectors. Another study\n8\n was commissioned to evaluate the experience gathered with the harmonised benchmark-based allocation process, and in particular to evaluate whether the benchmarks have achieved the intended objectives. In 2013, a study\n9\n was commissioned to assess the evidence for carbon leakage in the period 2005-2012 for ten major energy intensive industry sectors. The findings of these studies are discussed in the impact assessment accompanying the proposal.\n\n\nVerified data received from the Member States to determine the free allocation in phase 3 were also used for the analysis carried out in the impact assessment.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nThe proposed Directive is accompanied by an impact assessment, which built largely on the findings of the comprehensive impact assessment on the 2030 framework\n10\n , focusing on certain ETS-specific methodological elements not already assessed.\u00a0\n\n\nA summary sheet for the impact assessment, an executive summary, and the positive opinion of the Impact Assessment Board will be made publically available. The impact assessment was carried out for a number of aspects on which the European Council gave strategic guidance in its conclusions on the 2030 framework. This includes addressing the potential risk of carbon leakage, the establishment of a Modernisation and an Innovation Fund, optional free allocation to modernise the electricity sector in lower income Member States, as well as aspects building on the lessons learnt since 2013, such as the validity of emission allowances, guaranteeing a robust and secure registry and the continuation of the optional exclusion of small emitters.\n\n\nFor addressing the potential risk of carbon leakage, a range of options were considered concerning the update of benchmarks, production level adjustments, classification of sectors into carbon leakage groups and indirect cost compensation. For the Innovation Fund, options focussed on the way projects are screened and selected, and the way in which financial support is provided. For the Modernisation Fund, options were considered on its governance. Regarding the optional free allocation to the energy sector, options are developed for improving its modalities and enhance transparency compared to the current practice.\n\n\n\nIn terms of impacts, the environmental ambition of the EU ETS is determined by the cap and the proposed change of the linear reduction factor ensures that the agreed headline target of a 43% reduction compared to 2005 for sectors under the EU ETS is achieved. The fact that the contribution the EU ETS has to make to the overall EU 2030 reduction target has already been set contributes to the fact that the overall impact was independent of the assessed policy choices.\n\n\nBusinesses covered by the EU ETS are directly affected. Sectoral impacts in major industrial sectors covered by the EU ETS vary to some degree depending on the options. However, policy choices that lower the costs and impacts on some industrial sectors typically result in higher costs and impacts for other industrial sectors because the total number of allowances that are available for free is limited. The proposal also provides opportunities for producers of renewable energy, and manufacturers of equipment for low-carbon technologies. In particular, additional funding for innovative technologies will generate new business opportunities.\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nIn line with the Commission commitment to Better Regulation, the proposal has been prepared inclusively, based on full transparency and continuous engagement with stakeholders, listening to external feedback and taking into account external scrutiny to ensure the proposal strikes the right balance (see also section on the collection and use of expertise). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the majority of installations under the EU ETS are in the energy-intensive industries with market structures characterised by large enterprises, the proposal also caters for small emitters, which may be owned by SMEs or micro enterprises: In addition to existing rules alleviating the administrative burden and costs of monitoring and reporting emissions, such installations with low emissions benefit from the proposed continuation of the possibility for Member States to exclude them from the EU ETS if they are subject to national measures leading to an equivalent contribution to emission reductions.\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nThe proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, it contributes to the objective of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n11\n\n\n\n\n 4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe EU ETS generates significant revenues for Member States' budgets. The proposal affects national budgets and administrations primarily because of this link. The secure operation of the Union registry is funded from the Union budget. There is also a small and limited impact on the EU budget which is, however, fully covered by the current MFF 2014-2020.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\nImplementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nThe delivery of the 2030 energy and climate framework will be included in the integrated governance and monitoring process under the Energy Union.\n\n\nArticle 10(5) of the current Directive requires the Commission to monitor the functioning of the European carbon market and to submit each year a corresponding report to the European Parliament and the Council. In the context of the monitoring process, the Commission will also continue its dialogue with all relevant stakeholders.\n\n\nOnce the proposed Directive has been adopted, the Commission will continue to monitor the legal framework transposing obligations under the EU ETS in the Member States as well the implementation of specific obligations. To this end, Article 21 foresees that each year, the Member States submit to the Commission a report on the application of the Directive.\n\n\nThe proposal does not change any of the above reporting requirements. However, it foresees further specific reporting requirements for Member States, for example, for the free allocation of allowances to the power sector and the funding provided through the Modernisation Fund to modernise the energy systems in low-income Member States. These reporting requirements are designed to improve and guarantee the transparency of the implementation of the supported investments.\n\n\nFinally, an ex-post evaluation will be made once the measures put forward by the proposal are being fully implemented in the Member States and have been operating for a significant period of time.\n\n\n\nExplanatory documents \n\n\n\nThe proposed Directive sets out specific measures amending the existing modalities of the EU ETS. There are several legal obligations stemming from the proposed Directive. Its effective transposition will therefore require that specific and targeted amendments are made to the relevant national rules. However, in order for the Commission to monitor the correct implementation, it may in certain cases be insufficient for Member States to transmit the text of the amended national implementing provisions. Where appropriate, the proposal may therefore require Explanatory Documents on its transposition.\n\n\n\nDetailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nThe main elements of the EU ETS Directive which are amended through the proposal are the following:\n\n\nLinear reduction factor (Art. 9)\n\n\nThe linear reduction factor is changed to 2.2% from 2021 onwards. It ensures that the overall quantity of allowances ('cap') will decline at an increased annual pace resulting in an overall emission reduction of sectors under the EU ETS of 43% by 2030.\n\n\nAuction share (Art. 10)\n\n\nIn line with the guidance from European Council of October 2014 that the share of allowances auctioned should not decline, the proposal sets out the relevant share as a percentage figure, taking into account the different elements determining this share in 2013 to 2020. In terms of distribution, 10% of the EU ETS allowances to be auctioned by the Member States will continue to be distributed to the benefit of certain lower-income Member States for the purposes of solidarity, growth and interconnections, while the rest of the allowances will be shared out among all Member States.\n\n\n\n\nFree allocation and carbon leakage provisions (Art. 10a and 10b)\n\n\nThe proposal provides that the benchmarks for the determination of the free allocation to industry will be updated to reflect the technological progress realised over time in the relevant sectors. To this end, a standard rate will be applied with the possibility of applying a modified rate in case that the actual rate of technological progress in a sector is shown to deviate substantially from this standard rate.\n\n\nSectors deemed to be exposed to a risk of carbon leakage will continue to receive a higher allocation than others who have a higher ability to pass on relevant costs in product prices. The revised methodology to identify the sectors and sub-sectors at a genuine risk of carbon leakage is based on two combined criteria: emissions intensity and trade intensity. \n\n\nFurthermore, free allocation will be better aligned with actual production levels of sectors. To this end, free allocations will be periodically updated, while incentives to innovate are fully maintained and the administrative burden and costs for Member States, operators and the Commission remain reasonable.\n\n\nAllocations for new entrants and significant increases in production will be provided from a dedicated reserve. This new entrants' reserve will be created with 250 million of unallocated allowances from the Market Stability Reserve and supplemented by allowances that remain unused due to the closure of installations or significant changes in production in the period from 2021 onwards. Allowances not allocated for free from the industry's share up to 2020 and not placed in the Market Stability Reserve will also be added to this new entrants' reserve.\n\n\nIndirect carbon costs (Art. 10a(6))\n\n\nWith regard to indirect carbon costs that arise due to carbon costs being passed on in the price of electricity, the proposal foresees that Member States should provide compensation in line with the rules on State aid and that the revenues from auctioning should be used in this regard.\n\n\nInstallations with low emissions (small emitters) (Art. 27 and 11(1))\n\n\nWith regard to installations with low emissions, considering their relative higher administrative costs under the EU ETS, it is appropriate that the possibility to exclude such installations from the system is continued. The proposal thus foresees that installations excluded today may remain excluded provided they make an equivalent contribution to emission reductions. Member States may also exclude further installations as of 2021.\n\n\nInnovation support (Art. 10a (8))\n\n\nExisting EU-level support for innovation is supplemented through dedicating 400 million allowances for these purposes. An extra 50 million allowances is added to this amount from the allowances that remain unused in 2013 to 2020 and would otherwise be placed in the Market Stability Reserve in 2020. While such innovation support is currently limited to carbon capture and storage and renewable energy projects, the proposal broadens the support to industry with the aim to boost low-carbon innovation incentives.\n\n\nModernisation of the energy systems in lower income Member States (Art. 10c and 10d)\n\n\nTo support the modernisation of energy systems in lower income Member States and fully exploit the power sectors potential to contribute to cost-effective emission reductions, the proposal foresees two measures: the continuation of the free allocation to the power sector and the creation of a Modernisation Fund.\n\n\nAs often pointed out by stakeholders, a major hurdle to assessing the effectiveness of the transitional free allocation to the power sector in certain Member States is a lack of transparency with regard to the applicable rules as well as the realisation of investments. The proposal enhances the transparency by requiring Member States to select investments above a certain monetary threshold on the basis of a competitive bidding process. It also sets clear publication requirements for the Member States and provides the Commission with the possibility to render important information on investments carried out public.\n\n\nThe Modernisation Fund is created with 2% of the overall quantity of allowances. These will be auctioned in accordance with the rules provided for in the EU ETS Auctioning Regulation to generate the necessary funds for projects to be carried out. The funds will be distributed between eligible Member States according to a predetermined key set out in the Annex of the proposal. Particular attention will be paid to the funding of small-scale projects.\n\n\nValidity of allowances (Art. 13)\n\n\nIn order to ease administrative costs, the proposal foresees that allowances issued for one trading period remain valid for later periods.\n\n\nTransition to the system of delegated and implementing acts ('Lisbonisation')\n\n\nImportant implementing legislation, including a regulation on auctioning, a regulation on the Union Registry as well as decisions on the rules for free allocation and carbon leakage has been adopted. To align the Directive with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, the proposal empowers the Commission to adopt delegated and implementing acts in line with the relevant procedure where such powers were previously granted to the Commission.\n\n\n2015/148 (COD)\n\n\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\u00a0192(1) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission\n12\n,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n13\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n14\n,\u00a0\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n15\n established a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union in order to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner.\n\n\n(2)The European Council of October 2014 made a commitment to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions of the Union by at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. All sectors of the economy should contribute to achieving these emission reductions and the target will be delivered in the most cost-effective manner through the Union emission trading system (EU ETS) delivering a reduction of 43% below 2005 levels by 2030. This was confirmed in the intended nationally determined reduction commitment of the Union and its Member States submitted to the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change on 6 March 2015\n16\n.\n\n\n(3)The European Council confirmed that a well-functioning, reformed EU ETS with an instrument to stabilise the market will be the main European instrument to achieve this target, with an annual reduction factor of 2.2% from 2021 onwards, free allocation not expiring but existing measures continuing after 2020 to prevent the risk of carbon leakage due to climate policy, as long as no comparable efforts are undertaken in other major economies, without reducing the share of allowances to be auctioned. The auction share should be expressed as a percentage figure in the legislation, to enhance planning certainty as regards investment decisions, to increase transparency and to render the overall system simpler and more easily understandable.\n\n\n(4)It is a key Union priority to establish a resilient Energy Union to provide secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy to its citizens. Achieving this requires continuation of ambitious climate action with the EU ETS as the cornerstone of Europe\u2019s climate policy, and progress on the other aspects of Energy Union\n17\n. Implementing the ambition decided in the 2030 framework contributes to delivering a meaningful carbon price and continuing to stimulate cost-efficient greenhouse gas emission reductions. \n\n\n(5)Article 191(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union requires that Union policy is based on the principle that the polluter should pay and, on this basis, Directive 2003/87/EC provides for a transition to full auctioning over time. Avoiding carbon leakage is a justification to postpone full transition, and targeted free allocation of allowances to industry is justified in order to address genuine risks of increases in greenhouse gas emissions in third countries where industry is not subject to comparable carbon constraints as long as comparable climate policy measures are not undertaken by other major economies.\n\n\n(6)The auctioning of allowances remains the general rule, with free allocation as the exception. Consequently, and as confirmed by the European Council, the share of allowances to be auctioned, which was 57% over the period 2013-2020, should not be reduced. The Commission's Impact Assessment\n18\n provides details on the auction share and specifies that this 57% share is made up of allowances auctioned on behalf of Member States, including allowances set aside for new entrants but not allocated, allowances for modernising electricity generation in some Member States and allowances which are to be auctioned at a later point in time because of their placement in the Market Stability Reserve established by Decision (EU) 2015/\u2026 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n19\n.\n\n\n(7)To preserve the environmental benefit of emission reductions in the Union while actions by other countries do not provide comparable incentives to industry to reduce emissions, free allocation should continue to installations in sectors and sub-sectors at genuine risk of carbon leakage. Experience gathered during the operation of the EU ETS confirmed that sectors and sub-sectors are at risk of carbon leakage to varying degrees, and that free allocation has prevented carbon leakage. While some sectors and sub-sectors can be deemed at a higher risk of carbon leakage, others are able to pass on a considerable share of the costs of allowances to cover their emissions in product prices without losing market share and only bear the remaining part of the costs so that they are at a low risk of carbon leakage. The Commission should determine and differentiate the relevant sectors based on their trade intensity and their emissions intensity to better identify sectors at a genuine risk of carbon leakage. Where, based on these criteria, a threshold determined by taking into account the respective possibility for sectors and sub-sectors concerned to pass on costs in product prices is exceeded, the sector or sub-sector should be deemed at risk of carbon leakage. Others should be considered at a low risk or at no risk of carbon leakage. Taking into account the possibilities for sectors and sub-sectors outside of electricity generation to pass on costs in product prices should also reduce windfall profits.\n\n\n(8)In order to reflect technological progress in the sectors concerned and adjust them to the relevant period of allocation, provision should be made for the values of the benchmarks for free allocations to installations, determined on the basis of data from the years 2007-8, to be updated in line with observed average improvement. For reasons of predictability, this should be done through applying a factor that represents the best assessment of progress across sectors, which should then take into account robust, objective and verified data from installations so that sectors whose rate of improvement differs considerably from this factor have a benchmark value closer to their actual rate of improvement. Where the data shows a difference from factor reduction of more than 0.5% of the 2007-8 value higher or lower per year over the relevant period, the related benchmark value shall be adjusted by that percentage. To ensure a level playing field for the production of aromatics, hydrogen and syngas in refineries and chemical plants, the benchmark values for aromatics, hydrogen and syngas should continue to be aligned to the refineries benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\n(9)Member States should partially compensate, in accordance with state aid rules, certain installations in sectors or sub-sectors which have been determined to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage because of costs related to greenhouse gas emissions passed on in electricity prices. The Protocol and accompanying decisions adopted by the Conference of the Parties in Paris need to provide for the dynamic mobilisation of climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building for eligible Parties, particularly those with least capabilities. Public sector climate finance will continue to play an important role in mobilising resources after 2020. Therefore, auction revenues should also be used for climate financing actions in vulnerable third countries, including adaptation to the impacts of climate. The amount of climate finance to be mobilised will also depend on the ambition and quality of the proposed Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), subsequent investment plans and national adaptation planning processes. Member States should also use auction revenues to promote skill formation and reallocation of labour affected by the transition of jobs in a decarbonising economy.\n\n\n(10)The main long-term incentive from this Directive for the capture and storage of CO2 (CCS), new renewable energy technologies and breakthrough innovation in low-carbon technologies and processes is the carbon price signal it creates and that allowances will not need to be surrendered for CO2 emissions which are permanently stored or avoided. In addition, to supplement the resources already being used to accelerate demonstration of commercial CCS facilities and innovative renewable energy technologies, EU ETS allowances should be used to provide guaranteed rewards for deployment of CCS facilities, new renewable energy technologies and industrial innovation in low-carbon technologies and processes in the Union for CO2 stored or avoided on a sufficient scale, provided an agreement on knowledge sharing is in place. The majority of this support should be dependent on verified avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions, while some support may be given when pre-determined milestones are reached taking into account the technology deployed. The maximum percentage of project costs to be supported may vary by category of project.\n\n\n(11)A Modernisation Fund should be established from 2% of the total EU ETS allowances, and auctioned in accordance with the rules and modalities for auctions taking place on the Common Auction Platform set out in Regulation 1031/2010. Member States who in 2013 had a GDP per capita at market exchange rates of below 60% below the Union average should be eligible for funding from the Modernisation Fund and derogate up to 2030 from the principle of full auctioning for electricity generation by using the option of free allocation in order to transparently promote real investments modernising their energy sector while avoiding distortions of the internal energy market. The rules for governing the Modernisation Fund should provide a coherent, comprehensive and transparent framework to ensure the most efficient implementation possible, taking into account the need for easy access by all participants. The function of the governance structure should be commensurate with the purpose of ensuring the appropriate use of the funds. That governance structure should be composed of an investment board and a management committee and due account should be taken of the expertise of the EIB in the decision-making process unless support is provided to small projects through loans from a national promotional banks or through grants via a national programme sharing the objectives of the Modernisation Fund. Investments financed from the fund should be proposed by the Member States. To ensure that the investment needs in low income Member States are adequately addressed, the distribution of funds will take into account in equal shares verified emissions and GDP criteria. The financial assistance from the Modernisation Fund could be provided through different forms.\n\n\n(12)The European Council confirmed that the modalities, including transparency, of the optional free allocation to modernise the energy sector in certain Member States should be improved. Investments with a value of \u20ac10 million or more should be selected by the Member State concerned through a competitive bidding process on the basis of clear and transparent rules to ensure that free allocation is used to promote real investments modernising the energy sector in line with the Energy Union objectives. Investments with a value of less than \u20ac10 million should also be eligible for funding from the free allocation. The Member State concerned should select such investments based on clear and transparent criteria. The results of this selection process should be subject to public consultation. The public should be duly kept informed at the stage of the selection of investment projects as well as of their implementation.\n\n\n(13)EU ETS funding should be coherent with other Union funding programmes, including European Structural and Investment Funds, so as to ensure the effectiveness of public spending.\n\n\n(14)The existing provisions which are in place for small installations to be excluded from the EU ETS allow the installations which are excluded to remain so, and it should be made possible for Member States to update their list of excluded installations and for Member States currently not making use of this option to do so at the beginning of each trading period.\n\n\n(15)The European Council of October 2014 agreed that 10% of the EU ETS allowances to be auctioned by Member States are to be distributed among certain Member States for the purpose of solidarity, growth and interconnections while the rest of the allowances are distributed among all Member States in shares that are identical to the shares applicable in 2013-20, including for Member States which joined the Union during this period. Member States with a GDP per capita below 90% of the Union average in 2013 should benefit from this solidarity and the corresponding Annex to this Directive should be updated accordingly. The derogation from contributions to this distribution in 2013-20 for certain Member States with an average level of income per capita more than 20% higher than the average in the Union should expire.\n\n\n(16)Decision (EU) 2015/\u2026 establishes a Market Stability Reserve for the EU ETS in order to make auction supply more flexible and make the system more resilient. This decision also provides for allowances not allocated to new entrants up to 2020 and not allocated because of cessations and partial cessations to be placed in the Market Stability Reserve.\n\n\n(17)In order to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of Article 3d(3), Article 10(4), Article 10a(1) and (8), Article 10b, Article 10d, Article 14(1), Article 15, Article 19(3), Article 22, Article 24, Article 24a and Article 25a of Directive 2003/87/EC. In order to reduce delegations to the minimum, the existing powers in respect of the operation of the special reserve, for attributing quantities of international credits which may be exchanged and placing further standards for what may be exchanged and for further rules on double counting in Article 3f(9), Article 11a(9) and Article 11b(7) of Directive 2003/87/EC are deleted. Acts adopted pursuant to those provisions continue to apply. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council. As regards the delegation in respect of Article 10(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC, those Member States which do not use the common platform for auctioning may continue not to do so.\n\n\n(18)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the third subparagraph of Article 10a(2) and Article 16(12) of Directive 2003/87/EC, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those necessary implementing powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n20\n. In order to reduce implementing acts to the minimum, the existing power in Article 11a(8) of Directive 2003/87/EC in respect of further specifying quantities of international credits for exchange should be deleted. Acts adopted pursuant to that provision continue to apply.\n\n\n(19)In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September 2011 on explanatory documents\n21\n, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers, where appropriate, the transmission of such documents to be justified. \n\n\n(20)This Directive seeks to contribute to the objective of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development in the most economically efficient manner while providing installations adequate time to adapt and providing for more favourable treatment of specially affected persons in a proportionate manner to the maximum extent compatible with the other objectives of this Directive.\n\n\n(21)This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. \n\n\n(22)Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty of the European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nArticle 1\nAmendments to Directive 2003/87/EC\n\n\nDirective 2003/87/EC is amended as follows:\n\n\n(1)In Article 3d(3), the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\u201cThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 23\u201d.\n\n\n(2)In Article 3f, paragraph (9) is deleted.\n\n\n\n\n(3)In Article 9, the second and third paragraphs are replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"Starting in 2021, the\u00a0linear factor shall be 2.2%.\"\n\n\n(4)Article 10 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(a) three new subparagraphs are added to paragraph 1:\n\n\n\"From 2021 onwards, the share of allowances to be auctioned by Member States shall be 57%. \n\n\n2% of the total quantity of allowances between 2021 and 2030 shall be auctioned to establish a fund to improve energy efficiency and modernise the energy systems of certain Member States as set out in Article 10d of this Directive (\u201cthe Modernisation Fund\u201d).\n\n\nThe total remaining quantity of allowances to be auctioned by Member States shall be distributed in accordance with paragraph 2.\";\n\n\n(b) paragraph 2 is amended as follows:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i)\u00a0in point (a), \"88%\" is replaced by \"90%\"; \n\n\n(ii) point (b) is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"(b) 10% of the total quantity of allowances to be auctioned being distributed amongst certain Member States for the purpose of solidarity and growth within the Community, thereby increasing the amount of allowances that those Member States auction under point (a) by the percentages specified in Annex IIa.\"; and\n\n\n(iii) point (c) is deleted; \n\n\n(iv) the third subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"If necessary, the percentage referred to in point (b) shall be adapted in a proportional manner to ensure that the distribution is 10%.\".\n\n\n(c) in paragraph 3, the following points (j), (k) and (l) are added: \n\n\n\"(j)to fund financial measures in favour of sectors or subsectors that are exposed to a genuine risk of carbon leakage due to significant indirect costs that are actually incurred from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in electricity prices, provided that these measures meet the conditions set out in Article 10a(6);\n\n\n(k)for climate financing actions in vulnerable third countries, including adaptation to the impacts of climate change.;\n\n\n(l)to promote skill formation and reallocation of labour affected by the transition of jobs in a decarbonising economy in close coordination with the social partners.\"\n\n\n(d) the third subparagraph of paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\u201cThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 23.\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n(5)Article 10a is amended as follows:\n\n\n(a) the second paragraph of paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"The Commission shall be empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 23. This act shall also provide for additional allocation from the new entrants reserve for significant production increases by applying the same thresholds and allocation adjustments as apply in respect of partial cessations of operation.\"\n\n\n(b) a new third subparagraph is added to paragraph 2 as follows:\n\n\n\"The benchmark values for free allocation shall be adjusted in order to avoid windfall profits and reflect technological progress in the period between 2007-8 and each later period for which free allocations are determined in accordance with Article 11(1). This adjustment shall reduce the benchmark values set by the act adopted pursuant to Article 10a by 1% of the value that was set based on 2007-8 data in respect of each year between 2008 and the middle of the relevant period of free allocation, unless:\n\n\n(i) On the basis of information submitted pursuant to Article 11, the Commission shall identify whether the values for each benchmark calculated using the principles in Article 10a differ from the annual reduction referred to above by more than 0.5% of the 2007-8 value higher or lower annually. If so, that benchmark value shall be adjusted either 0.5% or 1.5% in respect of each year between 2008 and the middle of the period for which free allocation is to be made;\n\n\n(ii) By way of derogation regarding the benchmark values for aromatics, hydrogen and syngas, these benchmark values shall be adjusted by the same percentage as the refineries benchmarks in order to preserve a level playing field for producers of these products.\n\n\nThe Commission shall adopt an implementing act for this purpose in accordance with Article 22a.\" \n\n\n(c) paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"In order to respect the auctioning share set out in Article 10, the sum of free allocations in every year where the sum of free allocations does not reach the maximum level that respects the Member State auctioning share, the remaining allowances up to that level shall be used to prevent or limit reduction of free allocations to respect the Member State auctioning share in later years. Where, nonetheless, the maximum level is reached, free allocations shall be adjusted accordingly. Any such adjustment shall be done in a uniform manner.\";\n\n\n(d) the first subparagraph of paragraph 6 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"Member States should adopt financial measures in favour of sectors or sub-sectors which are exposed to a genuine risk of carbon leakage due to significant indirect costs that are actually incurred from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in electricity prices, taking into account any effects on the internal market. Such financial measures to compensate part of these costs shall be in accordance with state aid rules. \"\n\n\n(e) paragraph 7 is amended as follows\n\n\n(i) The first and second sentences of the first subparagraph are replaced by the following: \n\n\n\"Allowances from the maximum amount referred to Article 10a(5) of this Directive which were not allocated for free up to 2020 shall be set aside for new entrants and significant production increases, together with 250 million allowances placed in the market stability reserve pursuant to Article 1(3) of Decision (EU) 2015/\u2026 of the European Parliament and of the Council(*).\n\n\nFrom 2021, allowances not allocated to installations because of the application of paragraphs 19 and 20 shall be added to the reserve.\"\n\n\n _____\n\n\n(*) [insert the full title of the Decision and the OJ reference].\"\n\n\n(ii) The fifth subparagraph is deleted.\n\n\n(f) in paragraph 8, the first, second and third subparagraphs of paragraph 8 are replaced by the following:\n\n\n\n\n\"400 million allowances shall be available to support innovation in low-carbon technologies and processes in industrial sectors listed in Annex I, and to help stimulate the construction and operation of commercial demonstration projects that aim at the environmentally safe capture and geological storage (CCS) of CO2 as well as demonstration projects of innovative renewable energy technologies, in the territory of the Union.\n\n\nThe allowances shall be made available for innovation in low-carbon industrial technologies and processes and support for demonstration projects for the development of a wide range of CCS and innovative renewable energy technologies that are not yet commercially viable in geographically balanced locations. In order to promote innovative projects, up to 60% of the relevant costs of projects may be supported, out of which up to 40% may not be dependent on verified avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions provided that pre-determined milestones are attained taking into account the technology deployed.\n\n\nIn addition, 50 million unallocated allowances from the market stability reserve established by Decision (EU) 2015/\u2026 shall supplement any existing resources remaining under this paragraph for projects referred to above, with projects in all Member States including small-scale projects, before 2021.

The present initiative:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- amends the level of annual emission reductions so that the Union-wide quantity of allowances issued each year starting in 2021 decrease by a higher linear factor of 2.2%. \n\n\n- guarantees that free allocation to industry will continue after 2020 to address the potential risk of carbon leakage, as long as comparable climate policies are not undertaken by other major economies. \n\n\n- maintains the Innovation Fund as a stepped-up effort to rapidly introduce new low-carbon technologies to the market enabling the EU to reach its long-term decarbonisation goals. \n\n\n- establishes the Modernisation Fund and optional free allocation to the energy sector to contribute to the modernisation of the energy systems in lower income Member States.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nIndicator nr 1: level of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU.\n\n\nIndicator nr 2: level of emission for the sectors in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).\n\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nMember States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive and the Commission is to develop the relevant implementing measures for the period after 2020.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nThe EU ETS Directive exists and continues being in force post-2020. Climate change is a trans-boundary problem. Since the objective of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting individually, coordination of climate action at European level and, where possible, at global level is necessary and EU action is justified on grounds of subsidiarity. Moreover, many of the policy elements have an important internal market dimension and many of the required investments have an important European dimension. Therefore, the objectives can be better achieved by an EU framework for action.\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThe Commission has gained valuable experience during the 10 years for which the EU ETS has been in operation. Experience shows that there is still potential for improving efficiency thanks to reinforced research, development and innovation efforts. Reinforced investment efforts should help modernising the energy system (modernisation fund) in lower income Member States.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nSynergies will be exploited by making use of existing Commission expertise in the management of financial resources and experience acquired under existing EU-EIB financing instruments.\n\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from YYYY to YYYY\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\n\n\u2713Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n24\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u2713 by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u2713\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u2713the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\nThe management of EU ETS allowances is done through legislation for which the Commission departments are responsible.\n\n\nThe Modernisation Fund is to be governed by an investment board and a management committee, which shall be composed of representatives from the Member States, the Commission and the EIB. The management committee is to be chaired by the Commission. \n\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nModernisation Fund: In accordance with Article 10d of Directive 2003/87/EC as introduced by the proposal, the beneficiary Member States shall report annually to the management committee on investments financed by the funds. The management committee shall report to the Commission on experience with evaluation and selection of investments within six months of completion of the selection process. \n\n\nIn relation to Article 10c, Member States are eligible to use optional free allocation to promote investments for modernising the energy sector and are to report on the investments to the Commission.\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 21 of Directive 2003/87/EC as it applies now, each year the Member States shall submit to the Commission a report on the application of this Directive. The Commission shall publish a report on the application of this Directive between three months of receiving the reports from the Member States.\n\n\nFinally, the Commission shall submit a report on the functioning of the European Carbon market in accordance with Article 10(5) to the European Parliament and the Council.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified \n\n\n\nThe EU ETS is the flagship policy mechanism to achieve the EU's emission reductions from around half the economy. Since 2013, the Commission is tasked to provide a Union Registry, an online database that provides an accurate accounting for all allowances transaction, a common auctioning platform for the auctioning of Member States allowances and the relevant support infrastructure for both. The Union Registry in which allowances are held under the EU ETS is threathened by a risk of fraudulent cyber-attacks that could result in theft or misappropration of allowances leading to significant financial loss (up to several billion euros), legal litigation and considerable impact on Commission's reputation and credibility. The risk is cross-cutting and, alongside DG CLIMA, involves DG DIGIT, HR-DS, BUDG and LS. Mitigating measures have been put in place. The financial risk would increase in line with increases in the value of the carbon market. The distribution of free allowances at a very high total value also requires strict policies on how these allowances can be distributed, and assurance of respect of the rules in place. This involves management and control system at the level of the Member States and at the level of the Commission.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nA High-level Steering Committee involving the lead DG and associated DGs is in place since 2011. A fully-fledged risk assessment has been conducted in 2014 which has identified new IT security measures taken as from 2015. As a result of the recommendations put forward by the IAS in its audit report on the EU ETS Registry (IT security), measures to further improve the security of the registry system as well as measures on governance, quality assurance and testing have been implemented. Additional mitigating actions are being implemented since 2014. This is an ongoing process.\n\n\n\n2.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \n\n\n\n\n\nThe risk of error is not applicable. \n\n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\nIn response to the specific fraud risks for the EU ETS, DG CLIMA reinforced the Commission-wide guidelines regarding professional ethics and integrity by a dedicated \"Code of Ethics and Conduct in relation to insider trading, fraud and disclosure of sensitive information\", specific trainings, awareness raising initiatives. It also developed the EU ETS Sensitive Information Classification Policy and the related handling instructions with 3 levels of sensitivity. The related three ETS markings are approved by DG HR-DS (as referenced in Security Notice 1 in its revision 10). DG HR-DS considers this marking policy should serve as an example to other DGs. Appropriate training sessions for newcomers are organised on a regular basis. DG CLIMA plans to extend this policy to users in Member States. \n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and

the staff, meetings and missions budget needed to perform two data collections per trading period (instead of one currently), and the management of the Innovation and Modernisation funds. See details in the tables under 3.2.3.
