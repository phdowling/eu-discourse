The Basic Regulation contains an exception from the general ban\r\nfor seal products derived from hunts traditionally conducted by Inuit and other\r\nindigenous communities that contribute to their subsistence (\"the IC\r\nexception\"). It also contains exceptions for the import of seal products\r\nderived from seals hunted for the sole purpose of the sustainable management of\r\nmarine resources on a not-for profit basis and not for commercial reasons\r\n(\"the MRM exception\") as well as for imports of an occasional nature and which consist\r\nexclusively of goods for the personal use of travellers or their families. An\r\nImplementing Regulation, Commission Regulation (EU) No 737/2010 of 10 August\r\n2010, lays down detailed rules for the implementation of the Basic Regulation\r\n(\u201cImplementing Regulation\u201d). \nBoth acts (\u201cthe EU seal regime\u201d) were challenged by Canada and Norway in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in the dispute on EC \u2013 Measures\r\nProhibiting the Importation and Marketing of Seal Products (DS400 and\r\nDS401).\u00a0 On 18 June 2014, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) adopted the\r\npanel and Appellate Body reports. While the WTO reports concluded that the ban\r\non seal products can, in principle, be justified for moral concerns regarding\r\nthe welfare of seals, they took issue with the two exceptions, the IC exception\r\nand the MRM exception. The MRM exception was found not to be justified as the\r\npossible difference in the commercial dimension of commercial hunts and MRM\r\nhunts (small scale, non-profit) was not sufficient to justify the distinction.\r\nWith regard to the IC exception, while in principle reflecting a legitimate\r\ndistinction, the Appellate body ruled, that some elements of its design and\r\napplication amounted to \u201carbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination\u201d.\nOn 10 July 2014 the European Union notified the DSB that\r\nit intends to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in this\r\ndispute in a manner that respects its WTO obligations. \nOn 5 September 2014, the European Union, Canada and Norway agreed that the reasonable period for implementing the DSB recommendations and\r\nrulings would be 16 months. Accordingly, the reasonable period of time will\r\nexpire on 18 October 2015. \nThe purpose of this legislative proposal is to implement\r\nthe DSB recommendations and rulings with regard to the Basic Regulation. It\r\nalso creates the legal basis for bringing Regulation (EU) No 737/2010 in\r\ncompliance with the said rulings. The concerns regarding the MRM exception are\r\nremedied by removing the MRM exception from the Basic Regulation. The concerns\r\nrelating to the design and application of the IC exception are addressed by\r\nmodifying the exception, in particular by linking its use to the respect of\r\nanimal welfare and providing for a limit to the placing of the market of seal\r\nproducts if the scale of the hunt or other circumstances are such as to\r\nindicate that the hunt is being conducted primarily for commercial purposes. In\r\naddition, experts from the Commission are working together with experts from Canada in order to set up the necessary attestation system to enable Canadian Inuit to make\r\nuse of the Inuit exception under the EU seal regime.\nIn addition, it is also necessary to use\r\nthis initiative to align the reference to the regulatory procedure with\r\nscrutiny in Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 to Article 290 of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU). Given the\r\ntight timeframe for compliance with the WTO rulings and to allow for a swift\r\nadoption of the proposal by the legislator, the Commission exceptionally took\r\non board in this proposal an amendment of the Parliament proposed in the\r\ncontext of proposal COM (2013)451 (this proposal also covered the alignment of\r\nRegulation 1007/2009) in relation to the duration of the delegation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH\r\nTHE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNo impact assessment was carried out as\r\nthis action does not present a new policy initiative but is required to bring\r\nthe EU\u2019s current legislation into compliance with the WTO ruling thereby\r\nensuring fulfilment of Union's international obligations.\u00a0 The limited\r\nmodifications introduced by this proposal did not call for a new impact\r\nassessment as compared to the impact assessment undertaken before the adoption\r\nof the Basic Regulation in 2009.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7              \r\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis for this proposal is Article 114 of the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which was the legal\r\nbasis for the Basic Regulation which is being modified by the present proposal.\r\nAccording to Article 114 TFEU the European Parliament and the Council shall,\r\nacting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after\r\nconsulting the Economic and Social Committee, adopt the measures for the\r\napproximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative\r\naction in Member States which have as their object the establishment and\r\nfunctioning of the internal market. The Basic Regulation was adopted with the\r\nobjective of eliminating obstacles to the functioning of the internal market\r\ndue to differences in national measures regulating trade in seal products.\n\u00b7              \r\nPrinciples of Subsidiarity and Proportionality\nBringing the Basic Regulation into compliance with the\r\nrecommendations and rulings adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body can only\r\nbe achieved by modifying the Basic Regulation with regard to the contested\r\naspects. The proposal is limited to what is necessary to achieve the WTO\r\ncompatibility of the contested measure. \n\u00b7              \r\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: Regulation of the European Parliament\r\nand the Council\nOther means would not be adequate as a regulation can\r\nonly be modified by the same instrument, i.e. a regulation. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThis proposal has no implications for the\r\nbudget of the European Union.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nNot applicable\n2015/0028 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 on\r\ntrade in seal products \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE\r\nEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to\r\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\r\n114 thereof,\nHaving regard to\r\nthe proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission\r\nof the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to\r\nthe opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[1], \nActing in\r\naccordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n1007/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council[2] was adopted with the\r\nobjective of eliminating obstacles to the functioning of the internal market\r\ndue to differences in national measures regulating trade in seal products.\r\nThose measures were adopted in response to public moral concerns about the\r\nanimal welfare aspects of the killing of seals and the possible presence on the\r\nmarket of products obtained from animals killed in a way that causes excessive pain,\r\ndistress, fear and other forms of suffering. Such concerns were supported by\r\nscientific evidence showing that a genuinely humane killing method cannot be\r\nconsistently and effectively applied and enforced in the specific conditions in\r\nwhich seal hunting takes place. In order to achieve that objective, Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1007/2009 introduced, as a general rule, a prohibition of placing on\r\nthe market of seal products.\u00a0 \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time, seal\r\nhunting is an integral part of the culture and identity of the Inuit and other\r\nindigenous communities and makes a major contribution to their subsistence. For\r\nthose reasons, seal hunts traditionally conducted by Inuit and other indigenous\r\ncommunities do not raise the same public moral concerns as the hunts conducted\r\nprimarily for commercial purposes. Moreover, it is broadly recognised that the\r\nfundamental and social interests of Inuit and other indigenous communities\r\nshould not be adversely affected, in accordance with United Nations Declaration\r\non the rights of Indigenous Peoples and other relevant international\r\ninstruments. For those reasons, by way of exception, Regulation (EC) No\r\n1007/2009 allows the placing on the market of seal products which result from\r\nhunts traditionally conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities and\r\nwhich contribute to their subsistence. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A genuinely humane killing\r\nmethod cannot be effectively and consistently applied in the hunts conducted by\r\nthe Inuit and other indigenous communities, just like in the other seal hunts. Nonetheless,\r\nit is appropriate, in light of the objective pursued by Regulation (EC) No\r\n1007/2009, to make the placing in the Union market of products resulting from\r\nhunts by the Inuit and other indigenous communities conditional upon those\r\nhunts being conducted in a manner which reduces pain,\r\ndistress, fear or other forms of suffering of the animals hunted to the extent\r\npossible, while having regard to the traditional way of life and the\r\nsubsistence needs of the Inuit and other indigenous communities. The exception granted in respect of seal products resulting from\r\nhunts conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities should\u00a0 be limited to\r\nhunts that contribute to the subsistence need of those communities and are therefore\r\nnot conducted primarily for commercial purposes. Thus, the Commission should be\r\nenabled to limit, if necessary, the quantity of seal products placed on the\r\nmarket under \u00a0that exception in order to prevent the use of the exception by\r\nproducts resulting from hunts which are conducted primarily for commercial\r\npurposes.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n1007/2009 also allows, by way of exception, the placing on the market of seal\r\nproducts where the hunt is conducted with the sole purpose of sustainable\r\nmanagement of marine resources. While recognizing the importance of hunts for\r\nthe purpose of sustainable management of marine resources, in practice,\r\nhowever, these hunts may be difficult to distinguish from the large hunts\r\nconducted primarily for commercial purposes. This may lead to unjustified\r\ndiscrimination between the seal products concerned. Therefore, this exception should\r\nno longer be provided for. This is without prejudice to the right of\r\nMember States to continue regulating hunts conducted for the purposes of\r\nmanagement of marine resources.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to provide for\r\ndetailed rules as regards placing on the market of seal\r\nproducts, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be\r\ndelegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out\r\nappropriate consultations, including at expert level. The\r\nCommission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a\r\nsimultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the\r\nEuropean Parliament and to the Council.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n1007/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 1007/2009 is amended as\r\nfollows: \n(1)                   \r\nArticle 3 is replaced by the following:\n\"Article 3\nConditions\r\nfor placing on the market\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nplacing on the market of seal products shall be allowed only where the seal\r\nproducts result from hunts conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities,\r\nprovided that the following conditions are all satisfied:\n(a)         \r\nthe hunt has been traditionally conducted by the\r\ncommunity;\n(b)         \r\nthe hunt contributes to the subsistence of the\r\ncommunity and is not conducted primarily for commercial reasons;\n(c)         \r\nthe hunt is conducted in a manner which reduces\r\npain, distress, fear or other forms of suffering of the animals hunted to the extent\r\npossible taking into consideration the traditional way of life and the\r\nsubsistence needs of the community.\nThe above\r\nconditions shall apply at the time or point of import for imported products.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The import of seal products shall also\r\nbe allowed where it is of an occasional nature and consists exclusively of\r\ngoods for the personal use of travellers or their families. The nature and\r\nquantity of such goods shall not be such as to indicate that they are being\r\nimported for commercial reasons.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The application of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall\r\nnot undermine the achievement of the objective of this Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall be empowered to\r\nadopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 4a in order to lay down\r\ndetailed rules for the placing on the market of seal products in accordance\r\nwith paragraphs 1 and 2.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the number of seals hunted, the\r\nquantity of seal products being placed on the market pursuant to paragraph 1 or\r\nother circumstances are such as to indicate that a hunt is conducted primarily\r\nfor commercial purposes, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated\r\nacts in accordance with Article 4 in order to limit the quantity of products resulting\r\nfrom that hunt that may be placed on the market.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall issue technical\r\nguidance notes setting out an indicative list of the codes of the Combined\r\nNomenclature which may cover seal products subject to this Article.\" \n(2)                   \r\nThe following Article 4a is inserted:\n\"Article 4a\nExercise of the delegation\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The power to adopt\r\ndelegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid\r\ndown in this Article. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The power to adopt\r\ndelegated acts referred to in Article 3 shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of five years\r\nfrom \u2026 [insert date - the date of entry into force of this Regulation].\r\nThe Commission shall draw up a report in respect of the delegation of power not\r\nlater than nine months before the end of the five-year period.
