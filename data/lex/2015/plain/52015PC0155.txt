Consequently, neither a separate consultation with interested parties\r\nnor any impact assessment is necessary.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe attached proposal for a Regulation of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council constitutes the legal instrument for\r\nthe implementation of the anti-circumvention mechanism of the Agreement already\r\nconcluded with Georgia.\nLegal basis\nArticle 207(2) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union.\n2015/0080 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nimplementing the anti-circumvention\r\nmechanism providing for the temporary suspension of tariff preferences of the\r\nAssociation Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy\r\nCommunity and their Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other\r\npart\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission, \nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national parliaments, \nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure[1],\r\n\nWhereas: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 10 May 2010, the\r\nCouncil authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Georgia for the\r\nconclusion of a new agreement between the Union and Georgia. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those negotiations have\r\nbeen concluded and the Association Agreement between the European Union and the\r\nEuropean Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and\r\nGeorgia, of the other part[2]\r\n(\u2018the Agreement\u2019) was signed on 27 June 2014 and has been provisionally applied\r\nfrom 1 September 2014. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to lay\r\ndown the procedures to guarantee the effective application of the\r\nanti-circumvention mechanism for the temporary suspension of tariff preferences\r\ncontained in the Agreement.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There should be a\r\npossibility to suspend the preferential customs duties for a maximum period of\r\nsix months when the imports of certain agricultural products and processed\r\nagricultural products reach the defined annual import volumes.\u00a0 \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For reasons of\r\ntransparency, the Commission should submit an annual report to the European\r\nParliament and to the Council on the implementation of the Agreement and the\r\napplication of the anti-circumvention mechanism.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The implementation of the\r\nanti-circumvention mechanism for the temporary suspension of tariff preferences\r\nprovided for in the Agreement requires uniform conditions.
