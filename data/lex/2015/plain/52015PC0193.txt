General Principles\n\n\nThe categories and areas of Union competence are set out in Articles 2 to 6 TFEU. When the Treaties confer on the EU exclusive competence in a specific area, only the EU may legislate and adopt legally binding acts, the Member States being able to do so themselves only if so empowered by the EU or for the implementation of EU acts. When the Treaties confer on the EU a competence shared with the Member States in a specific area, the EU and the Member States may legislate and adopt legally binding acts in that area. The Member States shall exercise their competence to the extent that the EU has not exercised its competence. The Member States shall again exercise their competence to the extent that the EU has decided to cease exercising its competence. \n\n\nAs regards the conclusion of international agreements, for the policy areas listed in Article 3(1) TFEU, only the EU has the competence to act. For the policy areas listed in Article 4(2) TFEU the EU and its Member States share competence, but only the EU has the competence to act when the envisaged action is necessary to enable the Union to exercise its internal competence, or insofar as the provisions in the agreement may affect common rules or alter their scope within the meaning of Article 3(2) TFEU; insofar as this is not the case (i.e. the conditions of Article 3(2) TFEU are not met), Member States may exercise their competence to act in these policy areas. \n\n\nCompetences not attributed to the EU by the Treaties fall within the competences of the Member States of the EU. \n\n\nThe EU will duly notify any substantial modification of the extent of its competences, in accordance with Article 44 of the Protocol, without this constituting a prerequisite for the exercise of its competence in matters covered by the FCTC Protocol.\n\n\n2. Competences of the EU\n\n\n2.1Only the EU has the competence to act with respect to the matters covered by the FCTC Protocol in policy areas listed in Article 3(1) TFEU, namely the common commercial policy. \n\n\n2.2In addition, in certain other policy areas only the EU has the competence to conclude an international agreement. This is so when the envisaged action is necessary to enable the Union to exercise its internal competence, or insofar as the provisions in the FCTC Protocol may affect common rules already adopted by the EU in the relevant area or alter their scope within the meaning of Article 3(2) TFEU. These policy areas are notably the internal market, including measures with the aim of establishing or ensuring the functioning of the internal market (Article 26(1) TFEU), the approximation of laws, in particular money laundering (Articles 114 to 118 TFEU), free movement of goods (Article 28 TFEU) and customs cooperation (Article 33 TFEU). \n\n\n3. Competences of the EU and its Member States\n\n\nIn all other policy areas not mentioned in sections 2.1 and 2.2, the EU only has shared competence, and both the EU and its Member States have competences to act with respect to matters covered by the FCTC Protocol. The Member States shall exercise their competence to the extent that the Union has not exercised its competence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 4.5.2015\nCOM(2015) 193 final\n2015/0100(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, in so far as the provisions of the Protocol which fall under Title V of Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union are concerned\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThe World Health Assembly adopted in 2003 the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which aims at reducing tobacco-related deaths and diseases around the world in a comprehensive manner. The EU concluded the FCTC by Council Decision 2004/513/EC of 2 June 2004 (\n1\n).\n\n\nThe FCTC recognises in its Article 15 that the elimination of illicit trade in tobacco products, including smuggling, illicit manufacturing and counterfeiting, is an essential component of tobacco control, and obliges Parties to adopt and implement effective measures to eliminate illicit trade. Article 33 of the FCTC provides for the possibility for the Conference of the Parties to adopt protocols to the Convention. On the basis of these Articles, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the FCTC, at its second session in June-July 2007 decided to establish an Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) to draft and negotiate a Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the FCTC Protocol\u2019 or \u201cthe Protocol\u201d). The INB concluded its work successfully, and the Conference of the Parties to the FCTC at its fifth meeting on 12 November 2012 in Seoul, Republic of Korea, adopted the Protocol.\n\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products and in particular cigarette smuggling into the EU and within the EU is a criminal activity causing huge losses in revenue for the EU and the Member States in terms of unpaid taxes and customs duties. Estimates indicate more than \u20ac10 billion losses of revenue annually to the EU and Member States. Most of the EU Member States are affected by the illicit tobacco trade, either as points of entry or transit or destination countries. Since the illicit products mostly originate from countries outside the EU, international cooperation, in particular also based on clear legislative procedures, is key to addressing the problem of illicit trade. The FCTC Protocol is an international agreement building upon and complementing, Article 15 of the FCTC, and currently constitutes the only multilateral regulatory initiative in the area. The Commission has participated in the negotiations of the FCTC Protocol on behalf of the European Union. \n\n\nThe EU has signed the FCTC Protocol on 20 December 2013.\n2\n The present proposal concerns the second step by which the EU will establish at international level its consent to be fully bound by the FCTC Protocol. \n\n\nThe Protocol consists of core provisions on the control of the supply chain of tobacco products and of equipment for manufacturing those products (Part III: Supply Chain Control). In  particular, it requires the introduction of a licensing, equivalent approval or control system by a competent authority for any natural or legal person involved in the manufacturing and in the import and export of tobacco products and manufacturing equipment (Article 6 \u2013 Licensing). It, furthermore, requires all natural and legal persons engaged in the supply chain of tobacco, tobacco products and manufacturing equipment to conduct customer due diligence (Article 7 \u2013 Due diligence). It also provides for the establishment of a global tracking and tracing regime, within five years of the entry into force of the Protocol, consisting of national and/or regional tracking and tracing systems controlled by the Parties for all tobacco products manufactured in or imported into their territory (Article 8 \u2013 Tracking and tracing).\n\n\nThose articles are complemented by provisions on record-keeping and security and preventive measures, including anti-money-laundering measures, and reporting of suspicious transactions (Articles 9 and 10). Further provisions concern sales by Internet, telecommunication or any other evolving technology (Article 11), duty free sales of tobacco products and the obligation to implement effective controls on tobacco and tobacco products in the free zones, including not mixing tobacco products with non-tobacco products at the time of removal from a free zone (Article 12). \n\n\nPart IV of the Protocol defines the conduct to be established as unlawful under the Parties\u2019 legislation (Article 14) and obliges the Parties to ensure that natural and legal persons are held liable for such unlawful conduct, including criminal offences (Articles 15 and 16). Further provisions concern seizure payments (Article 17), the handling of confiscated tobacco (Article 18) and special investigative techniques (Article 19). Part V of the Protocol contains provisions for the exchange of relevant information between the Parties (Articles 20 to 22), cooperation and mutual assistance (both administrative and legal in relation to criminal matters \u2013 Articles 23 and 24, and Articles 27 to 29), jurisdiction (Article 26) and extradition (Articles 30 and 31).  \n\n\n2.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThe Protocol contains a complex set of measures, rules and policy in the field of fighting illicit trade in tobacco products as summarised under setion 1. The main obligations which would have to be applied or implemenented in the EU and/or the Member States as of the entry into force of the Protocol or, at a later stage, within the periods indicated in the Protocol are in Articles 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 and 27 of the Protocol. Of these provisions Articles 7, 14 and 27 of the Protocol partly or fully fall within the areas of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, the definition of criminal offences and police cooperation, which are covered by Articles 83 and 87 TFEU \n\n\nThe Protocol contains provisions on the definition of unlawful conduct that may be established by the Parties as a non-criminal or a criminal offence, including establishing the liability of both natural and legal persons. As regards criminal offences, the EU has competence in this area on the basis of Article 83 of the TFEU. The list of unlawful conducts also includes the laundering of proceeds of the unlawful conduct established as a criminal offence. Under Council Framework Decision 2001/500/JHA\n3\n of 26 June 2001 on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of crime, Member States shall ensure that certain money laundering offences are sanctioned by criminal penalties.\n\n\nThe Protocol contains measures concerning judicial cooperation in criminal matters (mutual legal assistance and extradition). The EU has competence in this area based on Article 82 (1) of the TFEU, and a number of EU measures already exist in this area, which will facilitate the implementation of the relevant provisions of the Protocol.\n\n\nThe Protocol provides for measures on police and customs cooperation in criminal matters that fall under EU competence based on Article 87 (2) of the TFEU, and a number of EU measires already exist in this area, which will facilitate the implementation of the relevant provisions of the Protocol.\n\n\n Article 82 (1), Article 83 and Article 87 (2) therefore constitute the legal basis under Title V of Part III of the TFEU for the EU to sign the Protocol.\n\n\n2015/0100 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, in so far as the provisions of the Protocol which fall under Title V of Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union are concerned\n\n\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 82(1), Article 83 and Article 87(2), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The conclusion of the a Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) was approved on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 2004/513/EC concerning the conclusion of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\n4\n.\n\n\n(2)In accordance with Council Decisions 2013/744/EU\n5\n and 2013/745/EU\n6\n, the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was signed on 20 December 2013, subject to its conclusion at a later date. \n\n\n(3) The Protocol represents a significant contribution to the international efforts to eliminate all forms of illicit trade in tobacco products and to thereby fight the cirumvention of tax and customs duties obligations and to reduce the supply of tobacco products in line with Article 15 of the WHO FCTC. The Protocol also contributes to the smooth functioning of the internal market for tobacco products whilst ensuring a high level of public health.\u00a0\n\n\n(4)The Protocol should be approved on behalf of the European Union.\n\n\n(5)In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 21) on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, those Member States are not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and are not bound by it or subject to its application.\n\n\n(6)In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 22) on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n\n\n(7)Council Decision \u2026/\u2026/EU\n7\n [on the conclusion of Protocol\u2026 s regards the provisions which do not fall under Title V of Part III TFEU] concerns the conclusion of

Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, in so far as the provisions of the Protocol which fall under Title V of Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union are concerned\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreamble\n\n\nThe Parties to this Protocol,\n\n\nConsidering that on 21 May 2003, the Fifty-sixth World Health Assembly adopted by consensus the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which came into force on 27 February 2005;\n\n\nRecognizing that the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is one of the United Nations\u2019 most rapidly ratified treaties and a fundamental tool for attaining the objectives of the World Health Organization;\n\n\nRecalling the Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization, which states that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition;\n\n\nDetermined also to give priority to their right to protect public health;\n\n\nDeeply concerned that the illicit trade in tobacco products is contributing to the spread of the tobacco epidemic, which is a global problem with serious consequences for public health that calls for effective, appropriate and comprehensive domestic and international responses;\n\n\nRecognizing further that illicit trade in tobacco products undermines price and tax measures designed to strengthen tobacco control and thereby increases the accessibility and affordability of tobacco products;\n\n\nSeriously concerned by the adverse effects that the increase in accessibility and affordability of illicitly traded tobacco products has on public health and the well-being, in particular of young people, the poor and other vulnerable groups;\n\n\nSeriously concerned about the disproportionate economic and social implications of illicit trade in tobacco products on developing countries and countries with economies in transition;\n\n\nAware of the need to develop scientific, technical and institutional capacity to plan and implement appropriate national, regional and international measures to eliminate all forms of illicit trade in tobacco products;\n\n\nAcknowledging that access to resources and relevant technologies is of great importance for enhancing the ability of Parties, particularly in developing countries and countries with economies in transition, to eliminate all forms of illicit trade in tobacco products;\n\n\nAcknowledging also that, although free zones are established to facilitate legal trade, they have been used to facilitate the globalization of illicit trade in tobacco products, both in relation to the illicit transit of smuggled products and in the manufacture of illicit tobacco products;\n\n\nRecognizing also that illicit trade in tobacco products undermines the economies of Parties and adversely affects their stability and security;\n\n\nAlso aware that illicit trade in tobacco products generates financial profits that are used to fund transnational criminal activity, which interferes with government objectives;\n\n\nRecognizing that the illicit trade in tobacco products undermines health objectives, imposes additional strain on health systems and causes losses of revenue to the economies of the Parties;\n\n\nMindful of Article 5.3 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in which Parties agree that in setting and implementing their public health policies with respect to tobacco control, Parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry in accordance with national law;\n\n\nEmphasizing the need to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to undermine or subvert strategies to combat illicit trade in tobacco products and the need to be informed of activities of the tobacco industry that have a negative impact on strategies to combat illicit trade in tobacco products;\n\n\nMindful of Article 6.2 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which encourages Parties to prohibit or restrict, as appropriate, sales to and/or importation by international travellers of tax- and duty-free tobacco products;\n\n\n\n\nRecognizing in addition that tobacco and tobacco products in international transit and transhipment find a channel for illicit trade;\n\n\nTaking into account that effective action to prevent and combat illicit trade in tobacco products requires a comprehensive international approach to, and close cooperation on, all aspects of illicit trade, including, as appropriate, illicit trade in tobacco, tobacco products and manufacturing equipment;\n\n\nRecalling and emphasizing the importance of other relevant international agreements such as the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and the obligation that Parties to these Conventions have to apply, as appropriate, the relevant provisions of these Conventions to illicit trade in tobacco, tobacco products and manufacturing equipment and encouraging those Parties that have not yet become Parties to these agreements to consider doing so;\n\n\nRecognizing the need to build enhanced cooperation between the Convention Secretariat of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the World Customs Organization and other bodies, as appropriate;\n\n\nRecalling Article 15 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, in which Parties recognize, inter alia, that the elimination of all forms of illicit trade in tobacco products, including smuggling and illicit manufacturing, is an essential component of tobacco control;\n\n\nConsidering that this Protocol does not seek to address issues concerning intellectual property rights; and\n\n\nConvinced that supplementing the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control by a comprehensive protocol will be a powerful, effective means to counter illicit trade in tobacco products and its grave consequences,\n\n\nHereby agree as follows:\n\n\nPART I: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nUse of terms\n\n\n1 \u201cBrokering\u201d

Parties shall carry out their obligations under this Protocol in a manner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and that of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States.\n\n\n2. Nothing in this Protocol entitles a Party to undertake in the territory of another State the exercise of jurisdiction and performance of functions that are reserved exclusively for the authorities of that other State by its domestic law.\n\n\nArticle 26\n\n\n\n\nJurisdiction\n\n\n1. Each Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the criminal offences established in accordance with Article 14 when:\n\n\n(a) the offence is committed in the territory of that Party; or\n\n\n(b) the offence is committed on board a vessel that is flying the flag of that Party or an aircraft that is registered under the laws of that Party at the time that the offence is committed.\n\n\n2. Subject to Article 25, a Party may also establish its jurisdiction over any such criminal offence when:\n\n\n(a) the offence is committed against that Party;\n\n\n(b) the offence is committed by a national of that Party or a stateless person who has his or her habitual residence on its territory; or\n\n\n(c) the offence is one of those established in accordance with Article 14 and is committed outside its territory with a view to the commission of an offence established in accordance with Article 14 within its territory.\n\n\n3. For the purposes of Article 30, each Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the criminal offences established in accordance with Article 14 when the alleged offender is present on its territory and it does not extradite such person solely on the ground that he or she is one of its nationals.\n\n\n4. Each Party may also adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the criminal offences established in accordance with Article 14 when the alleged offender is present on its territory and it does not extradite him or her.\n\n\n5. If a Party exercising its jurisdiction under paragraph 1 or 2 has been notified, or has otherwise learnt, that one or more other Parties are conducting an investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding in respect of the same conduct, the competent authorities of those Parties shall, as appropriate, consult one another with a view to coordinating their actions.\n\n\n6. Without prejudice to norms of general international law, this Protocol does not exclude the exercise of any criminal jurisdiction established by a Party in accordance with its domestic law.\n\n\nArticle 27\n\n\nLaw enforcement cooperation\n\n\n1. Each Party shall adopt, consistent with their respective domestic legal and administrative systems, effective measures to:\n\n\n(a) enhance and, where necessary, establish channels of communication between the competent authorities, agencies and services in order to facilitate the secure and rapid exchange of information concerning all aspects of the criminal offences established in accordance with Article 14;\n\n\n(b) ensure effective cooperation among the competent authorities, agencies, customs, police and other law enforcement agencies;\n\n\n(c) cooperate with other Parties in conducting enquiries in specific cases with respect to criminal offences established in accordance with Article 14 concerning:\n\n\n(i) the identity, whereabouts and activities of persons suspected of involvement in such offences or the location of other persons concerned;\n\n\n(ii) the movement of proceeds of crime or property derived from the commission of such offences; and\n\n\n\n\n(iii) the movement of property, equipment or other instrumentalities used or intended for use in the commission of such offences;\n\n\n(d) provide, when appropriate, necessary items or quantities of substances for analytical or investigative purposes;\n\n\n(e) facilitate effective coordination among its competent authorities, agencies and services and promote the exchange of personnel and other experts, including, subject to bilateral agreements or arrangements between the Parties concerned, the posting of liaison officers;\n\n\n(f) exchange relevant information with other Parties on specific means and methods used by natural or legal persons in committing such offences, including, where applicable, routes and conveyances and the use of false identities, altered or false documents or other means of concealing their activities; and\n\n\n(g) exchange relevant information and coordinate administrative and other measures taken as appropriate for the purpose of early identification of the criminal offences established in accordance with Article 14.\n\n\n2. With a view to giving effect to this Protocol, Parties shall consider entering into bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements on direct cooperation between their law enforcement agencies and, where such agreements or arrangements already exist, amending them accordingly. In the absence of such agreements or arrangements between the Parties concerned, the Parties may consider this Protocol as the basis for mutual law enforcement cooperation in respect of the offences covered by this Protocol. Whenever appropriate, Parties shall make full use of agreements or arrangements, including international or regional organizations, to enhance the cooperation between their law enforcement agencies.\n\n\n3. Parties shall endeavour to cooperate within their means to respond to transnational illicit trade of tobacco products committed through the use of modern technology.\n\n\nArticle 28\n\n\nMutual administrative assistance\n\n\nConsistent with their respective domestic legal and administrative systems, Parties shall provide each other, either on request or on their own initiative, with information to ensure proper application of customs and other relevant law in the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution and combating of illicit trade in tobacco, tobacco products or manufacturing equipment. The Parties shall deem the said information to be confidential and for restricted use, unless otherwise stated by the transmitting Party. Such information may include:\n\n\n(a) new customs and other enforcement techniques of demonstrated effectiveness;\n\n\n(b) new trends, means or methods of engaging in illicit trade in tobacco, tobacco products and manufacturing equipment;\n\n\n(c) goods known to be the subject of illicit trade in tobacco, tobacco products and manufacturing equipment as well as details of description, packaging, transport and storage and methods used in respect of those goods;\n\n\n(d) natural or legal persons known to have committed or to be a party to an offence established in accordance with Article 14; and\n\n\n(e) any other data that would assist designated agencies in risk assessment for control and other enforcement purposes.\n\n\nArticle 29\n\n\nMutual legal assistance\n\n\n1. Parties shall afford one another the widest measure of mutual legal assistance in investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to criminal offences established in accordance with Article 14 of this Protocol.\n\n\n2. Mutual legal assistance shall be afforded to the fullest extent possible under relevant laws, treaties, agreements and arrangements of the requested Party with respect to investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to the offences for which legal persons may be held liable in accordance with Article 15 of this Protocol in the requesting Party.\n\n\n3. Mutual legal assistance to be afforded in accordance with this Article may be requested for any of the following purposes:\n\n\n\n\n(a) taking evidence or statements from persons; \n\n\n(b) effecting service of judicial documents;\n\n\n(c) executing searches and seizures, and freezing; \n\n\n(d) examining objects and sites;\n\n\n(e) providing information, evidentiary items and expert evaluations;\n\n\n(f) providing originals or certified copies of relevant documents and records, including government, bank, financial, corporate or business records;\n\n\n(g) identifying or tracing proceeds of crime, property, instrumentalities or other things for evidentiary purposes;\n\n\n(h) facilitating the voluntary appearance of persons in the requesting Party; and\n\n\n(i) any other type of assistance that is not contrary to the domestic law of the requested Party.\n\n\n4. This Article shall not affect the obligations under any other treaty, bilateral or multilateral, which governs or will govern, in whole or in part, mutual legal assistance.\n\n\n5. Paragraphs 6 to 24 shall, on the basis of reciprocity, apply to requests made pursuant to this Article if the Parties in question are not bound by a treaty or intergovernmental agreement of mutual legal assistance. If the Parties are bound by such a treaty or intergovernmental agreement, the corresponding provisions of that treaty or intergovernmental agreement shall apply unless the Parties agree to apply paragraphs 6 to 24 in lieu thereof. Parties are strongly encouraged to apply these paragraphs if they facilitate cooperation.\n\n\n6. Parties shall designate a central authority that shall have the responsibility and power to receive requests for mutual legal assistance and either to execute them or to transmit them to their respective competent authorities for execution. When a Party has a special region or territory with a separate system of mutual legal assistance, it may designate a distinct central authority that shall have the same function for that region or territory. Central authorities shall ensure the speedy and proper execution or transmission of the requests received. Where the central authority transmits the request to a competent authority for execution, it shall encourage the speedy and proper execution of the request by the competent authority. Each Party shall notify the Head of the Convention Secretariat at the time of accession, acceptance, approval, formal confirmation or ratification of this Protocol of the central authority designated for this purpose. Transmission of requests for mutual legal assistance and any communication related thereto shall be effected between the central authorities designated by the Parties. This requirement shall be without prejudice to the right of a Party to require that such requests and communications be addressed to it through the diplomatic channel and, in urgent circumstances, where the Parties agree, through appropriate international organizations, if possible.\n\n\n7. Requests shall be made in writing or, where possible, by any means capable of producing a written record, in a language acceptable to the requested Party under conditions allowing the Party to establish authenticity. The language or languages acceptable to each Party shall be notified to the Head of the Convention Secretariat at the time of accession, acceptance, approval, formal confirmation or ratification of this Protocol. In urgent circumstances, and where agreed by the Parties, requests may be made orally, but shall be confirmed in writing forthwith.\n\n\n8. A request for mutual legal assistance shall contain:\n\n\n(a) the identity of the authority making the request;\n\n\n(b) the subject matter and nature of the investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding to which the request relates, and the name and the functions of the authority conducting such investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding;\n\n\n(c) a summary of the relevant facts, except in respect of requests for the purpose of service of judicial documents;\n\n\n(d) a description of the assistance sought and details of any particular procedure that the requesting Party wishes to be followed;\n\n\n(e) where possible, the identity, location and nationality of any person concerned; \n\n\n(f) the purpose for which the evidence, information or action is sought; and\n\n\n\n\n(g) the provisions of the domestic law relevant to the criminal offence and the punishment therefore.\n\n\n9. The requested Party may request additional information when it appears necessary for the execution of the request in accordance with its domestic law or when it can facilitate such execution.\n\n\n10. A request shall be executed in accordance with the domestic law of the requested Party and, to the extent not contrary to the domestic law of the requested Party and where possible, in accordance with the procedures specified in the request.\n\n\n11. The requesting Party shall not transmit or use information or evidence furnished by the requested Party for investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings other than those stated in the request without the prior consent of the requested Party. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the requesting Party from disclosing in its proceedings information or evidence that is exculpatory to an accused person. In the latter case, the requesting Party shall notify the requested Party prior to the disclosure and, if so requested, consult with the requested Party. If, in an exceptional case, advance notice is not possible, the requesting Party shall inform the requested Party of the disclosure without delay.\n\n\n12. The requesting Party may require that the requested Party keep confidential the fact and substance of the request, except to the extent necessary to execute the request. If the requested Party cannot comply with the requirement of confidentiality, it shall promptly inform the requesting Party.\n\n\n13. Wherever possible and consistent with fundamental principles of domestic law, when an individual is in the territory of a Party and has to be heard as a witness or expert by the judicial authorities of another Party, the first Party may, at the request of the other, permit the hearing to take place by video conference if it is not possible or desirable for the individual in question to appear in person in the territory of the requesting Party. Parties may agree that the hearing shall be conducted by a judicial authority of the requesting Party and attended by a judicial authority of the requested Party.\n\n\n14. Mutual legal assistance may be refused:\n\n\n(a) if the request is not made in conformity with this Article;\n\n\n(b) if the requested Party considers that execution of the request is likely to prejudice its sovereignty, security, ordre public or other essential interests;\n\n\n(c) if the authorities of the requested Party would be prohibited by its domestic law from carrying out the action requested with regard to any similar offence, had it been subject to investigation, prosecution or judicial proceedings under their own jurisdiction;\n\n\n(d) where the request involves a crime where the maximum penalty in the requested Party is less than two years of imprisonment or other forms of deprivation of liberty or, if, in the judgment of the requested Party, the provision of the assistance would impose a burden on its resources that is disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime; or\n\n\n(e) if it would be contrary to the legal system of the requested Party relating to mutual legal assistance for the request to be granted.\n\n\n15. Reasons shall be given for any refusal of mutual legal assistance.\n\n\n16. A Party shall not decline to render mutual legal assistance under this Article on the ground of bank secrecy.\n\n\n17. Parties may not refuse a request for mutual legal assistance on the sole ground that the offence is also considered to involve fiscal matters.\n\n\n18. Parties may decline to render mutual legal assistance pursuant to this Article on the ground of absence of dual criminality. However, the requested Party may, when it deems appropriate, provide assistance, to the extent it decides at its discretion, irrespective of whether the conduct would constitute an offence under the domestic law of the requested Party.\n\n\n19. The requested Party shall execute the request for mutual legal assistance as soon as possible and shall take as full account as possible of any deadlines suggested by the requesting Party and for which reasons are given, preferably in the request. The requested Party shall respond to reasonable requests by the requesting Party regarding progress in its handling of the request. The requesting Party shall promptly inform the requested Party when the assistance sought is no longer required.\n\n\n20. Mutual legal assistance may be postponed by the requested Party on the ground that it interferes with an on-going investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding.\n\n\n21. Before refusing a request pursuant to paragraph 14 or postponing its execution pursuant to paragraph 20, the requested Party shall consult with the requesting Party to consider whether assistance may be granted subject to such terms and conditions as it deems necessary. If the requesting Party accepts assistance subject to those conditions, it shall comply with the conditions.\n\n\n22. The ordinary costs of executing a request shall be borne by the requested Party, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties concerned. If expenses of a substantial or extraordinary nature are or will be required to fulfil the request, the Parties shall consult to determine the terms and conditions under which the request will be executed as well as the manner in which the costs shall be borne.\n\n\n\n\n23. In the event of a request, the requested Party:\n\n\n(a) shall provide to the requesting Party copies of government records, documents or information in its possession that under its domestic law are available to the general public; and\n\n\n(b) may, at its discretion, provide to the requesting Party in whole, in part or subject to such conditions as it deems appropriate, copies of any government records, documents or information in its possession that under its domestic law are not available to the general public.\n\n\n24. Parties shall consider, as may be necessary, the possibility of concluding bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements that would serve the purposes of, give practical effect to, or enhance the provisions of this Article.\n\n\nArticle 30\n\n\nExtradition\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This\u00a0Article\u00a0shall\u00a0apply\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0criminal\u00a0offences\u00a0established\u00a0in\u00a0accordance\u00a0with\u00a0Article\u00a014\u00a0of this\u00a0Protocol\u00a0when:\n\n\n(a) the person who is the subject of the request for extradition is located in the territory of the requested Party;\n\n\n(b) the criminal offence for which extradition is sought is punishable under the domestic law of both the requesting Party and the requested Party; and\n\n\n(c) the offence is punishable by a maximum period of imprisonment or other forms of deprivation of liberty of at least four years or by a more severe penalty or such lesser period as agreed by the Parties concerned pursuant to bilateral and multilateral treaties or other international agreements.\n\n\n2. Each of the criminal offences to which this Article applies shall be deemed to be included as an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty existing between Parties. The Parties undertake to include such offences as extraditable offences in every extradition treaty to be concluded between them.\n\n\n3. If a Party that makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another Party with which it has no extradition treaty, it may consider this Protocol as the legal basis for extradition in respect of any criminal offence to which this Article applies.\n\n\n4. Parties that do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize the criminal offences to which this Article applies as extraditable offences between themselves.\n\n\n5. Extradition shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the domestic law of the requested Party or by applicable extradition treaties, including, inter alia, conditions in relation to the minimum penalty requirement for extradition and the grounds upon which the requested Party may refuse extradition.\n\n\n6. Parties shall, subject to their domestic law, endeavour to expedite extradition procedures and to simplify evidentiary requirements relating thereto in respect of any criminal offences to which this Article applies.\n\n\n7. A Party in whose territory an alleged offender is present, if it does not extradite such person in respect of a criminal offence to which this Article applies solely on the ground that he or she is one of its nationals, shall, at the request of the Party seeking extradition, be obliged to submit the case without undue delay to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. Those authorities shall take their decision and conduct their proceedings in the same manner as in the case of any other offence of a similar nature under the domestic law of that Party. The Parties concerned shall cooperate with each other, in particular on procedural and evidentiary aspects, to ensure the efficiency of such prosecution.\n\n\n8. Whenever a Party is permitted under its domestic law to extradite or otherwise surrender one of its nationals only upon the condition that the person will be returned to that Party to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or proceedings for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought and that Party and the Party seeking the extradition of the person agree with this option and other terms that they may deem appropriate, such conditional extradition or surrender shall be sufficient to discharge the obligation set forth in paragraph 7.\n\n\n9. If extradition, sought for purposes of enforcing a sentence, is refused because the person sought is a national of the requested Party, the requested Party shall, if its domestic law so permits and in conformity with the requirements of such law, upon application of the requesting Party, consider the enforcement of the sentence that has been imposed under the domestic law of the requesting Party or the remainder thereof.\n\n\n10. Any person regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in connection with any of the criminal offences to which this Article applies shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings, including enjoyment of all the rights and guarantees provided by the domestic law of the Party in the territory of which that person is present.\n\n\n11. Nothing in this Protocol shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person\u2019s sex, race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinions or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that person\u2019s position for any one of these reasons.\n\n\n\n\n12. Parties may not refuse a request for extradition on the sole ground that the offence is also considered to involve fiscal matters.\n\n\n13. Before refusing extradition, the requested Party shall, where appropriate, consult with the requesting Party to provide it with ample opportunity to present its opinions and to provide information relevant to its allegation.\n\n\n14. Parties shall seek to conclude bilateral and multilateral agreements or arrangements to carry out or to enhance the effectiveness of extradition. Where Parties are bound by an existing treaty or intergovernmental arrangement the corresponding provisions of that treaty or intergovernmental arrangement shall apply unless the Parties agree to apply paragraph 1 to 13 in lieu thereof.\n\n\nArticle 31\n\n\nMeasures to ensure extradition\n\n\n1. Subject to its domestic law and its extradition treaties, the requested Party may, upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant and are urgent and at the request of the requesting Party, take a person whose extradition is sought and who is present in its territory into custody or take other appropriate measures to ensure his or her presence at extradition proceedings.\n\n\n2. Measures taken in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be notified, in conformity with national law, as appropriate and without delay, to the requesting Party.\n\n\n3. Any person regarding whom the measures in accordance with paragraph 1 are being taken, shall be entitled to:\n\n\n(a) communicate without delay with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which that person is a national or, if that person is a stateless person, the State in the territory of which that person habitually resides; and\n\n\n(b) be visited by a representative of that State.\n\n\nPART VI: REPORTING\n\n\nArticle 32\n\n\nReporting and exchange of information\n\n\n1. Each Party shall submit to the Meeting of the Parties, through the Convention Secretariat, periodic reports on its implementation of this Protocol.\n\n\n2. The format and content of such reports shall be determined by the Meeting of the Parties. These reports shall form part of the regular WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control reporting instrument.\n\n\n3. The content of the periodic reports referred to in paragraph 1, shall be determined having regard, inter alia, to the following:\n\n\n(a) information on legislative, executive, administrative or other measures taken to implement this Protocol;\n\n\n(b) information, as appropriate, on any constraints or barriers encountered in the implementation of this Protocol and on the measures taken to overcome those barriers;\n\n\n(c) information, as appropriate, on financial and technical assistance provided, received, or requested for activities related to the elimination of illicit trade in tobacco products; and\n\n\n(d) the information specified in Article 20.\n\n\n\n\nIn those cases when relevant data are already being collected as part of the Conference of the\n\n\nParties reporting mechanism, the Meeting of the Parties shall not duplicate these efforts.\n\n\n4. The Meeting of the Parties, pursuant to Articles 33 and 36, shall consider arrangements to assist developing-country Parties and Parties with economies in transition, at their request, in meeting their obligations under this Article.\n\n\n5. The reporting of information under those Articles shall be subject to national law regarding confidentiality and privacy. Parties shall protect, as mutually agreed, any confidential information that is reported or exchanged.\n\n\nPART VII: INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES\n\n\nArticle 33\n\n\nMeeting of the Parties\n\n\n1. A Meeting of the Parties is hereby established. The first session of the Meeting of the Parties shall be convened by the Convention Secretariat immediately before or immediately after the next regular session of the Conference of the Parties following the entry into force of this Protocol.\n\n\n2. Thereafter, regular sessions of the Meeting of the Parties shall be convened by the Convention Secretariat, immediately before or immediately after regular sessions of the Conference of the Parties.\n\n\n3. Extraordinary sessions of the Meeting of the Parties shall be held at such other times as may be deemed necessary by the Meeting or at the written request of any Party, provided that, within six months of the request being communicated to them by the Convention Secretariat, it is supported by at least one third of the Parties.\n\n\n4. The Rules of Procedure and the Financial Rules of the Conference of the Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the Meeting of the Parties unless the Meeting of the Parties decides otherwise.\n\n\n5. The Meeting of the Parties shall keep under regular review the implementation of the Protocol and take the decisions necessary to promote its effective implementation.\n\n\n6. The Meeting of the Parties shall decide on the scale and mechanism of the voluntary assessed contributions from the Parties to the Protocol for the operation of this Protocol as well as other possible resources for its implementation.\n\n\n7. At each ordinary session, the Meeting of the Parties shall by consensus adopt a budget and workplan for the financial period until the next ordinary session, which shall be distinct from the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control budget and workplan.\n\n\nArticle 34\n\n\nSecretariat\n\n\n1. The Convention Secretariat shall be the Secretariat of this Protocol.\n\n\n2. The functions of the Convention Secretariat with regard to its role as the secretariat of this Protocol shall be to:\n\n\n(a) make arrangements for sessions of the Meeting of the Parties and any subsidiary bodies as well as working groups and other bodies established by the Meeting of the Parties and provide them with services as required;\n\n\n(b) receive, analyse, transmit and provide feedback to Parties concerned as needed and to the Meeting of the Parties on reports received by it pursuant to this Protocol and facilitate the exchange of information among Parties;\n\n\n\n\n(c) provide support to the Parties, particularly developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition, on request, in the compilation, communication, and exchange of information required in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol, and assistance in the identification of available resources to facilitate implementation of the obligations under this Protocol;\n\n\n(d) prepare reports on its activities under this Protocol under the guidance of and for submission to the Meeting of the Parties;\n\n\n(e) ensure, under the guidance of the Meeting of the Parties, the necessary coordination with the competent international and regional intergovernmental organizations and other bodies;\n\n\n(f) enter, under the guidance of the Meeting of the Parties, into such administrative or contractual arrangements as may be required for the effective discharge of its functions as secretariat to this Protocol;\n\n\n(g) receive and review applications by intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations wishing to be accredited as observers to the Meeting of the Parties, while ensuring that they are not affiliated with the tobacco industry, and present the reviewed applications to the Meeting of the Parties for its consideration; and\n\n\n(h) perform other secretariat functions specified by this Protocol and such other functions as may be determined by the Meeting of the Parties.\n\n\nArticle 35\n\n\nRelations between the Meeting of the Parties and intergovernmental organizations\n\n\nIn order to provide technical and financial cooperation for achieving the objective of this Protocol, the Meetings of the Parties may request the cooperation of competent international and regional intergovernmental organizations, including financial and development institutions.\n\n\nArticle 36\n\n\nFinancial resources\n\n\n1. Parties recognize the important role that financial resources play in achieving the objective of this Protocol, and acknowledge the importance of Article 26 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in achieving the objectives of the Convention.\n\n\n2. Each Party shall provide financial support in respect of its national activities intended to achieve the objective of this Protocol, in accordance with its national plans, priorities and programmes.\n\n\n3. Parties shall promote, as appropriate, the utilization of bilateral, regional, subregional and other multilateral channels to provide funding for strengthening the capacity of developing-country Parties and Parties with economies in transition in order to meet the objectives of this Protocol.\n\n\n4. Without prejudice to Article 18, Parties are encouraged, subject to national laws and policies and where appropriate, to use any confiscated proceeds of crime deriving from the illicit trade in tobacco, tobacco products and manufacturing equipment to achieve the objectives set out in this Protocol.\n\n\n5. Parties represented in relevant regional and international intergovernmental organizations and financial and development institutions shall encourage these entities to provide financial assistance for developing-country Parties and for Parties with economies in transition to assist them in meeting their obligations under this Protocol, without limiting the rights of participation within these organizations.\n\n\n6. Parties agree that:\n\n\n(a) to assist Parties in meeting their obligations under this Protocol, all relevant potential and existing resources available for activities related to the objective of this Protocol should be mobilized and utilized for the benefit of all Parties, especially developing-country Parties and Parties with economies in transition; and\n\n\n(b) the Convention Secretariat shall advise developing-country Parties and Parties with economies in transition, upon request, on available sources of funding to facilitate implementation of their obligations under this Protocol.\n\n\n7. Parties may require the tobacco industry to bear any costs associated with a Party\u2019s obligations to achieve the objectives of this Protocol, in compliance with Article 5.3 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.\n\n\n\n\n8. Parties shall endeavour, subject to their domestic law, to achieve self-financing of the implementation of the Protocol including through the levying of taxes and other forms of charges on tobacco products.\n\n\nPART VIII: SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES\n\n\nArticle 37\n\n\nSettlement of disputes\n\n\nThe settlement of disputes between Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Protocol is governed by Article 27 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.\n\n\nPART IX: DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROTOCOL\n\n\nArticle 38\n\n\nAmendments to this Protocol\n\n\n1. Any Party may propose amendments to this Protocol.\n\n\n2. Amendments to this Protocol shall be considered and adopted by the Meeting of the Parties. The text of any proposed amendment to this Protocol shall be communicated to the Parties by the Convention Secretariat at least six months before the session at which it is proposed for adoption. The Convention Secretariat shall also communicate proposed amendments to the signatories of this Protocol and, for information, to the Depositary.\n\n\n3. The Parties shall make every effort to reach agreement by consensus on any proposed amendment to this Protocol. If all efforts at consensus have been exhausted and no agreement reached, the amendment shall as a last resort be adopted by a three-quarters majority vote of the Parties present and voting at the session. For purposes of this Article, \u201cParties present and voting\u201d means Parties present and casting an affirmative or negative vote. Any adopted amendment shall be communicated by the Convention Secretariat to the Depositary, who shall circulate it to all Parties for acceptance.\n\n\n4.
