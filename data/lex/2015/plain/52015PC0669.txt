"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nStrasbourg, 15.12.2015\nCOM(2015) 669 final\n2015/0308(COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 establishing a Community Fisheries Control Agency \n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\n\nThere are currently more than 300 civilian and military authorities in the Member States responsible for carrying out coastguard functions in a wide range of areas such as maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental protection. A number of EU agencies, in particular the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency and the European Fisheries Control Agency, support the national authorities in the exercise of these functions.\n\n\nIn 2014, the Commission finalised a feasibility study to examine the need for improved co-operation and co-ordination between national bodies and agencies carrying out coastguard functions. This study identifies a range of issues for closer collaboration, in particular in the areas of operational surveillance and data sharing which underpins all these functions.\n\n\nThe need to enhance collaboration and co-ordination between authorities carrying out coastguard functions has subsequently been acknowledged in the Union maritime transport legislation, the European Union Maritime Security Strategy with an Action Plan adopted by the Council in 2014 and in the European Agenda on Migration adopted by the Commission in 2015.\n\n\nThe purpose of this legislative proposal reinforcing European co-operation on coastguard functions is to improve co-operation and co-ordination between the relevant EU agencies in order to enhance synergies between their respective services, thus allowing them to provide more efficient and cost effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coastguard functions.\n\n\nThis legislative proposal forms part of a set of measures proposed by the Commission to reinforce the protection of Europe's external borders, including European cooperation on coastguard function, which also includes a proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and a proposal for a Council Regulation establishing a European Border and Coast Guard Agency. .The substantive amendments in this proposal are identical to the proposed amendments to the Regulation establishing EMSA and the proposed provisions on European coastguard co-operation in the proposal for a Regulation establishing European Border and Coast Guard Agency.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThis Proposal is consistent with the fisheries control policy which aims at fostering the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy by stepping up the fight against Illegal, Undeclared, and Unreported (IUU) fishing and an effective Union fisheries control system. It is also consistent with the development and implementation of the Union's Integrated Maritime Policy in a complementary manner to the Common Fisheries Policy. Finally, it is consistent with the EFCA's competencies, which include the implementation of the EU Integrated Maritime Policy and the fight against IUU fishing.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe objective of this initiative is to improve co-operation and co-ordination between relevant Member State authorities, EU agencies and other bodies performing coastguard functions, with a view to move towards a European coastguard capacity/system. The underlying problem is that coastguard functions, such as border control, search and rescue operations, fisheries control, pollution control etc., are currently carried out by more than 300 authorities in Member States, which are not always well coordinated even at national level. By promoting collaboration and co-ordination between authorities carrying out coastguard functions, this proposal is fully consistent with Union policies on migration as well as on transport and mobility.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nThe proposal is based on Article 43(2) of the TFEU on establishing provisions for the pursuit of the objectives of the CFP.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nThe proposal deals with support to national authorities carrying out coastguard functions at national and Union level, and where appropriate at international level. It therefore forms part of the control policy aiming at implementing an effective system of control so as to ensure compliance with all the rules of the CFP, which is an exclusive competence of the Union. So the subsidiarity principle does not apply in this context.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe proposal aims at reinforcing the EU's Coast Guards capacity to response to threats and risks in the maritime domain by inter alia improving co-operation between all relevant civilian and military actors. This will avoid duplication of effort while ensuring that the main actors (in particular EU agencies) act in a coherent and efficient manner and develop synergies together. It takes into account the need to have more control in the maritime area while limiting the workload for national and EU administrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nAs the purpose of the proposal is to modify the Regulation establishing a Community Fisheries Control Agency, it is necessary to propose a Regulation.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nN/A (this initiative aims at implementing commitments contained in the European Agenda on migration referring to Coastguard activities).\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nN/A: specific action on Coastguard capacities has not been subject to any previous action at EU level. There is consequently no existing policy to evaluate.\n\n\nThere was however a feasibility study\n1\n commissioned by DG MOVE and carried out in 2014. This study identified some 316 civilian and military Member States' authorities, which are responsible for coastguard functions and collaborating via 70 different structures. It highlighted key shortcomings with the existing co-operation such as the lack of information on the remit, powers and capabilities of other authorities; the limited number of operational assets; the lack of interoperability of systems, processes and assets; the limited joint planning and joint operations.\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nThe initiative is not part of the REFIT agenda but should apply its main principles.\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThis initiative will imply an increase in the EU contribution to the EFCA of around 7,5 million per year (that is 30.148 million for the 2017 to 2020 period) and the recruitment of 13 TA staff (see the legislative financial statement attached).\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this measure will be implemented by the EFCA, its evaluation will be included in the 5-year evaluation of the agency, which findings and recommendations shall be forwarded by the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council and shall be made public.  \n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nThe EFCA is currently in charge of contributing to the fight against IUU. EFCA's experience in the fight against IUU fishing in the international dimension is instrumental to European coastguard capacity and border control because IUU fishing is frequently related to other criminal maritime activities. EFCA has developed expertise in risk management strategies, identification of possible IUU interests through the analysis of thousands of catch certificates, operational coordination and inspection including in the international dimension. In this regard, the Agency actively assists third countries through the delivering of training and capacity-building activities. Thanks to its international mandate, the EFCA has, so far, developed robust expertise in implementing common inspection platforms and maintains privileged network with EU and third countries. In a recent past, EFCA exchanged inspectors with Turkey in the Mediterranean Sea and regularly provides training seminars mustering EU inspectors and inspectors of Albania, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. \n\n\n\n1.The regulation covers sharing information generated by fusing and analysing data available in ship reporting systems and other information systems hosted by or accessible to the Agencies. It will foster intelligence sharing amongst the Agencies. This will permit the EFCA to implement systems for inter-agency exchange, to launch all related feasibility studies and establish permanent service for data, and EU data node. By taking stock of its experience in the Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) measures applying to fisheries through the concepts of Joint Deployment Plans and Union inspectors and by enlarging the scope and organising joint operations with inspectors having empowerments relating to different policies (human trafficking, migrant smuggling, fisheries, border guard, environment, drug trafficking, weapon trafficking, vessel safety, etc.), the EFCA will be in capacity to better support the exchange of data collected on the occasion of its control and inspection activities which include, inter alia, Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) and Electronic Reporting Systems (ERS). VMS data are satellite-based monitoring systems. They make it possible to have a real-time position as well as the history of the movements at sea of any vessel and at any time. These data are very useful in the context of the migration control as they enable border control as well as search and rescue operations. They may enable the detection of a fishing vessel stopping in a port to embark immigrants. As these data also include the speed of the vessel, it is possible to detect for instance a vessel sailing at a slower pace because it is heavy loaded with migrants or because it tracks another vessel behind it. ERS systems are used by fishermen to electronically record and report data on their fishing activities. They consequently permit the detection of any abnormal or illegal activities by comparison with similar data related to similar activities in a given area. As these data also include a landing declaration, they make it possible to know where a vessel has landed and eventually embarked illegal migrants. \n\n\n2.The regulation covers providing surveillance and communication services based on state-of-the-art technology, including space-based and ground infrastructure and sensors mounted on any kind of platform. This will permit the Agency to institutionalise cooperation between national, European and international partners. The Agency will thus be in a capacity of developing a high-level Monitoring Control and Surveillance risk framework which displays the national and regional frameworks currently in place. In particular, it will allow the implementation of activities aiming at detecting any irregular activities in coordination with the other Agencies. Over the past years, EFCA, through its participation in relevant FP7 projects and its cooperation with EMSA for the development of the EFCA MARSURV IMDatE, has gained a significant experience with the correlation, analysis and interpretation of maritime information. Today EFCA has a renowned capacity to perform detailed behaviour monitoring, which in turn leads to a more efficient deployment of available patrol means. Being listed as a future Copernicus Security Services end-user, EFCA intends to further develop and share this capacity and its outputs with other Agencies.\n\n\n3.The regulation covers capacity building at national and Union level by elaborating guidelines, recommendations and best practices as well as by supporting the training and exchange of staff, with a view to enhance the exchange of information and cooperation on coastguard functions. This will permit the EFCA to raise awareness of maritime safety, security, search and rescue and border and fishery control. It will permit the Agency enhancing expertise through the establishment and diffusion of training materials and handbooks. EFCA can also provide expert recommendations on efficient enforcement methods relating to control surveillance and monitoring regulations.\n\n\n4.The regulation covers capacity sharing, including the planning and implementation of multipurpose operations and the sharing of assets and other capabilities across sectors and borders. It will permit the EFCA to increase its control and inspection activities and conduct new type of operations aiming at detecting criminal activities, disrupt trafficking routes and ensure the enforcement of EU and national legislations. Chartering a patrol vessel will make possible and effective a multipurpose approach to detect not only illegal fishing activities and other criminal activities, but also support a more effective management of the EU's external borders in general.\n\n\n\n2015/0308 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Council Regulation (EC) No

situational awareness and intelligence through the elaboration of a EU common recognised operational surface picture shared by the EU Agencies and the Member States;\n\n\nAchieve a high probability of detection, identification, classification and tracking of  vessels and boats proceeding towards and within the EU waters and of their activities;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAchieve versatility, responsivity, effiency and effectiveness in the deployment of operational capacities including remotely piloted aerial systems in a cross sectoral approach;\n\n\nAchieve a level playing field in ensuring that operational personnels involved in coastguard functions of the Member States, EU agencies and where appropriate of the third countries work towards the objectives of the policy, cooperate, exchange personnel,  information and intelligence and comply with common methodologies through the development of common guidelines, best practice doctrine training and other capacity building undertakings.\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nEfficient situational awareness: % of EU Agencies and Member States bodies involved in the coastguard functions accessing and feeding the EU common recognised operational surface picture;\n\n\nHigh probability of detection: % of detected tracks obtained with cooperative systems randomly compared to non cooperative systems;\n\n\nHigh probability of identification, identification, classification and tracking: % of each compared to the number of detected tracks;\n\n\nDeployment of operational capacities: % operational capacities deployed versus planned;\n\n\nLevel playing field: % cross sectoral training of operational personnels involved in coastguard functions of the Member States, EU Agencies and where appropriate of the third countries\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nThe modalities of the cooperation on coastguard functions of the European Fisheries Control Agency with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency shall be determined in a working arrangement, in accordance the financial rules applicable to the Agencies. \n\n\nThe Commission may adopt implementing rules in accordance with Article 110 of Council Regulation 1224/2009.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nThe EU involvement will be instrumental because the action of the Member States do not allow to achieve the objectives of the policy:\n\n\nThe responsibility for carrying out Coastguard Functions is distributed across 316 public authorities in the coastal Member States of the EU. \n\n\nWhilst already cooperating and developing synergies, some silo mentality effects remain in the EU Agencies.\n\n\nAn improved capacity sharing between Coastguard authorities and EU agencies will contribute to achieve versatility, responsivity, effiency and effectiveness.\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThe coordination of Member States involved in the control regime applicable to the Common Fisheries Policy through the principle of the Joint Deployment Plans demonstrated relevance, effectivity and effectiveness to improve the sustainability of some fishing stocks as the Bluefin Tuna or the Cod, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nMember States can beneficiate from the appropriations of the European
