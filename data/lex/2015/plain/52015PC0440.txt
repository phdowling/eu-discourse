Regulation (EC) No\u00a0539/2001 is applied by all Member\u00a0States, with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom. \n\n\nRegulation (EU) No\u00a0509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n2\n amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 by transferring 19 countries to Annex II, which lists the third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement. Those 19 countries are: Colombia, Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Peru, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. The reference to each of those countries in Annex II is accompanied by a footnote which specifies that \"the exemption from the visa requirement shall apply from the date of entry into force of an agreement on visa exemption to be concluded with the European Union\". \n\n\nRegulation (EU) No\u00a0509/2014 was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu\n3\n. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission.\n\n\nThe first series of visa waiver agreements were signed on 6 May 2015 (United Arab Emirates), 26 May 2015 (Timor-Leste) and 28 May 2015 (Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and Vanuatu) and provisionally apply from the date of signature pending their entry into force. \n\n\nThe negotiations with Kiribati were opened on 17 December 2014 and conducted by exchange of letters. During further exchanges agreement was reached on all aspects. The agreement was initialled by an exchange of letters between the chief negotiators on 6 May 2015 (Kiribati) and 10 June 2015 (Union). The Member States were informed during a meeting of the Visa Working Party of the Council held on 15 June 2015.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS\n\n\nOn the part of the Union, the legal basis for the agreement is point (a) of Article 77(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjunction with Article 218 thereof.\n\n\nThe attached proposal constitutes the legal instrument for the signature of the agreement. The Council will decide by qualified majority. \n\n\nTaking into account the fact that Kiribati will be able to complete its internal ratification procedure quickly and the long period of time since the Commission first proposed to exempt citizens of Kiribati from the visa requirement (November 2012), the proposed decision on the signature sets out the provisional application of the agreement as from the day following the date of its signature in accordance with Article 218(5) TFEU. Considering the need for the European Parliament\u2019s consent before the agreement is concluded, the Commission will inform the European Parliament of the provisional application of the agreement.\n\n\n3.OUTCOME OF THE NEGOTIATIONS\n\n\nThe Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union.\n\n\nThe final content of it can be summarised as follows:\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nThe agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Kiribati when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. \n\n\nIn order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Kiribati may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States.\n\n\nThe specific situation of the United Kingdom and Ireland is reflected in the preamble. \n\n\nScope\n\n\n\n\nThe visa waiver covers all categories of persons (holders of ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passports) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Kiribati remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity.\n\n\nDuration of stay\n\n\nThe agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Kiribati when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. A joint declaration on the interpretation of this period of 90 days in any 180-day period is attached to the agreement. \n\n\nThe agreement takes into account the situation of the Member\u00a0States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Kiribati to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member\u00a0States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area.\n\n\nTerritorial application\n\n\nThe agreement contains provisions related to its territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Kiribati to stay only in those Member States\u2019 European territories.\n\n\nDeclarations\n\n\nIn addition to the joint declarations referred to above, two other joint declarations are attached to the agreement:\n\n\n\u2013on the association of Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis;\n\n\n\u2013on the full dissemination of information about the content and consequences of the visa waiver agreement and related issues, such as the entry conditions.\n\n\n4.CONCLUSION\n\n\nIn the light of the above-mentioned results, the Commission proposes that the Council\n\n\n\u2013decide that the agreement be signed on behalf of the Union and authorise the President of the Council to appoint the person(s) duly empowered to sign on behalf of the Union;\n\n\n\u2013approve the provisional application of the agreement pending its entry into force.\n\n\n2015/0202 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Kiribati on the short-stay visa waiver\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular point (a) of Article 77(2) in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council\n4\n transferred from Annex I to Annex\u00a0II of Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001\n5\n the reference to Kiribati. \n\n\n(2)The reference to that country is accompanied by a footnote indicating that the exemption from the visa requirement shall apply from the date of entry into force of an agreement on visa exemption to be concluded with the European Union.\n\n\n(3)By decision of 9 October 2014, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate an agreement between the European Union and Kiribati on the short-stay visa waiver. Negotiations on the agreement were opened on 17 December 2014 and conducted by exchange of letters.\n\n\n(4)The Agreement initialled by exchange of letters of 6 May 2015 (Kiribati) and 10 June 2015 (Union) should be signed and the attached declarations be approved. The Agreement should be applied on a provisional basis, pending the completion of the procedures for its formal conclusion. \n\n\n(5)In accordance with the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice and the Protocol on the Schengen acquis integrated into the framework of the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and confirming that the provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe signing of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Kiribati on the short-stay visa waiver (hereinafter referred to as the Agreement) is hereby approved on behalf of the Union, subject to its conclusion.\n\n\nThe text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe declarations attached to this Decision shall be approved on behalf of the Union.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThe President of the Council is hereby authorised to designate the person(s) empowered to sign the Agreement on behalf of the Union, subject to its conclusion.\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nThe Agreement shall be applied on a provisional basis as from the day following the date of signature thereof pending the completion of the procedures for conclusion.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 listing the

Council Decision\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Kiribati on the short-stay visa waiver\n\n\n\n\nAGREEMENT\n\n\nbetween the European Union and the Republic of Kiribati on the short-stay visa waiver\n\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION, hereinafter referred to as \"the Union\" or \"the EU\", and\n\n\n\nTHE REPUBLIC OF KIRIBATI, hereinafter referred to as \"Kiribati\", \n\n\n\nhereinafter referred to jointly as the \"Contracting Parties\",\n\n\n\nWITH A VIEW TO further developing friendly relations between the Contracting Parties and desiring to facilitate travel by ensuring visa-free entry and short stay for their citizens,\n\n\n\nHAVING REGARD to Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement\n1\n by, inter alia, transferring 19 third countries, including Kiribati, to the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement for short stays in the Member States,\n\n\n\nBEARING IN MIND that Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 states that for those 19 countries, the exemption from the visa requirement shall apply from the date of entry into force of an agreement on visa exemption to be concluded with the Union,\n\n\n\n\n\nDESIRING to safeguard the principle of equal treatment of all EU citizens,\n\n\n\nTAKING INTO ACCOUNT that persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity during their short stay are not covered by this Agreement and therefore for that category

apply,\n\n\n\nTAKING INTO ACCOUNT the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice and the Protocol on the Schengen acquis integrated into the framework of the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and confirming that the provisions of this

Inter alia, it means that an absence for an uninterrupted period of 90 days allows for a new stay for up to 90 days.\n\n\n\n\nJOINT DECLARATION ON INFORMING CITIZENS\nABOUT THE VISA WAIVER AGREEMENT\n\n\n\nRecognising the importance of transparency for the citizens of the European Union and the citizens of Kiribati, the Contracting Parties agree to ensure full dissemination of information about the content and consequences of the visa waiver agreement and related issues, such as the entry conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJEU L 149, 20.5.2014, p. 67.\n\n\n\n(2)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (OJEU L 81, 21.3.2001, p. 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
