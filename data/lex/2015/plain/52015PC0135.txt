This \"aggressive\" form of tax planning can take a multitude of forms,\r\nsuch as taking advantage of the technicalities of a tax\r\nsystem or of mismatches between two or more tax systems for the purpose of\r\nreducing or avoiding tax liabilities. Its consequences\r\ninclude double deductions (e.g. the same expense is deducted in both the state\r\nof source and the state of residence) and double non-taxation (e.g. income is\r\nnot taxed in either its state of source or in the recipient\u2019s state of\r\nresidence).[1] Such practices are in many cases assisted by the rulings issued by\r\nnational administrations, which confirm to a company how a specific transaction\r\nwill be taxed under existing legislation and therefore provide legal certainty\r\nfor the structure put in place. Even though Member\r\nStates are obliged to ensure that they issue tax rulings in compliance with\r\nexisting EU and national law, a lack of transparency regarding such rulings may\r\nimpact on other countries which have links with the\r\nbeneficiaries of the rulings. \nTax avoidance, as well as tax fraud and tax\r\nevasion, have an important cross-border dimension. Globalisation and the increasing mobility of taxpayers can make it\r\ndifficult for Member States to assess tax bases properly.\u00a0 This phenomenon can\r\naffect the functioning of taxation systems and entail tax avoidance and tax\r\nevasion and thus jeopardise the functioning of the Internal Market. \nTherefore Member States can only address\r\nthis problem effectively if they agree to take common action. For this reason,\r\nimproving administrative cooperation between Member States' tax administrations is a key objective of the\r\nCommission's strategy.\nCouncil Directive 2011/16/EU was adopted to\r\nreplace an earlier Directive dealing with assistance between Member States\r\n(Council Directive 77/799/EEC), as a response to Member States\u2019 need for enhanced administrative\r\ncooperation in the field of taxation.\nThe purpose of the present proposal is to\r\nensure that Directive 2011/16/EU provides for comprehensive and effective\r\nadministrative co-operation between tax administrations by providing for the\r\nmandatory automatic exchange of information regarding advance cross-border rulings\r\nand advance pricing arrangements, a particular type of advance cross border\r\nruling used in the area of transfer pricing. Tax driven structures which lead\r\nto a low level of taxation of income in the Member State issuing the ruling may\r\nleave only low amounts of income to be taxed in other Member States involved\r\nthus eroding their tax bases. \nThe proposal requires Member States to\r\nautomatically exchange basic information about advance cross-border rulings and\r\nadvance pricing arrangements with all other Member States. This is based on the\r\nprinciple that it is other Member States which are best placed to assess the\r\npotential impact and relevance of such rulings, rather than the Member State\r\ngiving the ruling. In appropriate cases the Member States receiving the\r\ninformation can request further more detailed information. \nThe proposal has been specifically designed\r\nto allow the automatic information exchange on rulings to build on the existing\r\nrules in Directive 2011/16/EU relating to the practical arrangements for\r\nexchanging information including the use of standard forms. It is also in line\r\nwith international developments at the level of the OECD and its work on BEPS.\nDuring 2012, the Code of Conduct Group for\r\nBusiness Taxation[2]\r\nreviewed developments in Member States\u2019 procedures regarding tax rulings. The\r\nGroup identified the types of cross-border rulings on which information should\r\nbe exchanged spontaneously and recommended the development of a \"Model\r\nInstruction\" that could be used as a reference by the Member States for\r\ninternal application.[3]\r\nThe Model Instruction specified that information on cross-border rulings should\r\nbe sent spontaneously in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 2011/16/EU,\r\nusing standard electronic forms, by the electronic means provided for in the\r\nDirective, at the latest one month after the ruling is issued in line with the\r\ndeadline in Article 10 of the Directive. It also required Member States to\r\nensure proper communication channels on this subject between Member States and\r\ngood quality training and guidance for those issuing rulings. It also provided\r\nguidance on the content of the information to be provided spontaneously.\r\nHowever, this Model Instruction is not legally binding. There is, in practice,\r\nlittle information exchange between Member States on their advance tax rulings\r\nor transfer pricing arrangements even where these have an impact on other\r\ncountries. \nTherefore a more systematic and binding\r\napproach to information exchange on rulings appears necessary within the EU so\r\nas to ensure that, where one Member State issues an advance tax ruling or\r\ntransfer pricing arrangement, any other Member State affected is in a position\r\nto take any necessary corresponding action. \nThe Commission committed to making such a\r\nproposal for the automatic exchange of information on cross-border rulings on\r\n16 December 2014 and this is reflected in the Commission's 2015 Work Programme.[4]\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultations in the\r\ncontext of the Action Plan on tax fraud and tax evasion and of the\r\nRecommendations (COM (2012) 722) and other fora\nThe European Parliament adopted a\r\nresolution on 21 May 2013,[5]\r\nwhereby it welcomed the Commission's Action Plan and its Recommendations, urged\r\nMember States to follow up their commitments and embrace the Action Plan, and\r\nemphasised that the EU should take a leading role in global discussions on the\r\nfight against tax fraud, tax avoidance and tax havens, in particular in\r\nrelation to promoting the exchange of information.\nThe European Economic and Social Committee\r\nadopted an opinion on 17 April 2013.[6]\u00a0\r\nThe Committee endorsed the Commission's Action Plan and supported its efforts\r\nto find practical solutions aimed at reducing tax fraud and tax evasion. \nOver recent years, Member States have\r\nworked in the Code of Conduct Group to improve the exchange of information\r\nregarding cross-border rulings and in the area of transfer pricing. Conclusions\r\nof this Code of Conduct Group have been communicated to the Council on a regular\r\nbasis in the form of reports.[7]\r\n\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States\nThis Directive is based on the Model\r\nInstruction agreed among the Member States in 2014 and therefore reflects work\r\nalready done by Member States\u2019 delegates in several European fora. Member States have been discussing the principle of information\r\nexchange on tax rulings for some time; however this has not so far led to an\r\neffective framework for such an exchange. \n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\r\nProportionality\nThis proposal complies with the principles\r\nof Subsidiarity and Proportionality as set out in Article 5, paragraphs 3 and\r\n4, respectively, of the Treaty on European Union.\nArticle 115 TFEU provides for the\r\napproximation of such laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the\r\nMember States which directly affect the establishment or functioning of the\r\ninternal market and make the approximation of laws necessary. \nThe objective of ensuring that all Member\r\nStates have sufficient information on advance CBRs and APAs cannot be\r\nsufficiently achieved through non-coordinated action implemented by each Member\r\nState individually. Thus, the exchange of information on rulings that\r\npotentially affect the tax bases of more than one Member State requires a\r\ncommon and compulsory approach. Moreover, the cross-border element is inherent\r\nin the proposed action. Effective information on advance cross-border rulings\r\nand advance pricing arrangements can therefore only be achieved through action\r\nat Union level.\nWhile the Model\r\nInstruction may be regarded as improving matters, a legislative basis is\r\nregarded as more effective. Moreover, as long as the issuing Member State is\r\nthe one having to assess, based on its own legal framework, the relevance of a\r\ngiven ruling for other Member States, a lack of transparency will remain. Taxpayers\r\nmay take advantage of the absence of common rules for the exchange of\r\ninformation to set up structures that shift profits to low-tax countries, which\r\nmay not be the countries where economic activities generating the profits are\r\nperformed and where value is created. [8]\r\nAs tax rulings are often granted for cross-border structures, Member States\r\ndepend on each other to get the complete picture. For this reason Member States\r\nworking together are in a better position than each Member State acting individually\r\nto ensure the effectiveness and completeness of the system of exchange of\r\ninformation on tax rulings. A harmonized EU approach would be more effective to\r\nensure tax transparency and cooperation between tax administrations in fighting\r\ntax avoidance. \nThe specific problem identified as the object\r\nof a policy response is the lack of transparency on tax rulings with\r\ncross-border relevance, which has negative effects, notably on the proper\r\nfunctioning of the Internal Market. The policy response is limited to\r\naddressing the rulings with a cross-border element. It consists of a two-step\r\napproach according to which a basic set of information as defined in the\r\nDirective would have to be provided to all EU Member States. The information to\r\nbe shared has to strike the balance between being on the one hand as concise as\r\npossible and on the other hand providing sufficient information for the\r\nreceiving Member State to judge whether it should request more information. In\r\na second step, those Member States that can demonstrate that the information is\r\nforeseeably relevant to them can request more detailed information under the\r\nexisting provisions of the Directive. Thus, the proposal\r\nrepresents the most proportionate answer to the identified problem because it\r\nlimits itself to advance tax rulings and advance pricing arrangements with a\r\ncross-border element.\u00a0 It is also based on the automatic exchange of basic\r\ninformation intended to allow each Member State to determine whether further\r\nmore detailed information should be requested. The proposed amendments\r\nconsequently do not go beyond what is necessary to address the issues at stake\r\nand, in that way, to achieve the Treaties' objectives of a proper and effective\r\nfunctioning of the Internal Market. \n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Staff Working Document\nThe accompanying Staff Working Document\r\nevaluates the policy options on the basis of the criteria of effectiveness,\r\nefficiency, coherence and social impacts and fundamental rights. An analysis of\r\noptions has been prepared by the Commission to support the policy option\r\nchosen. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe objective of this proposal is to ensure\r\nthat information on advance cross-border rulings and advance pricing\r\narrangements is automatically exchanged between Member States when the\r\nconditions laid down in the new Article 8a are fulfilled. \nFor this purpose, the proposal modifies\r\nDirective 2011/16/EU as amended by Directive 2014/107/EU[9] by introducing a\r\nspecific requirement for the automatic exchange of information on advance\r\ncross-border rulings and advance pricing arrangements.\u00a0 \nIn particular, Article 1(3) of the proposed\r\nDirective inserts a new Article 8a into the existing Directive, which sets out\r\nthe scope and conditions for the mandatory automatic exchange of information on\r\ntypes of tax rulings and transfer pricing arrangements as defined in the\u00a0\r\nproposed Directive, inserted by Article 1(1) of the proposal. Article 8a(1)\r\nprovides that the competent authorities of a Member State shall, by automatic\r\nexchange, communicate information about defined tax rulings that they issue or\r\namend to the competent authorities of all other Member States. This obligation\r\nis extended to rulings issued in the ten years before the date on which the\r\nproposed Directive takes effect that are still valid on the date of entry into\r\nforce of the Directive (Article 8a(2)).\nArticle 1(6) of the proposed Directive\r\nenables the possible creation by the Commission of a secure central directory\r\nconcerning information communicated in the framework of this proposal. This\r\ncentral directory would both facilitate the exchange of information and support\r\nMember States in their job of studying and reacting to rulings exchanged\r\nbetween Member States. \nThe proposed Directive also updates the\r\nrules in the 2011 Directive concerning the provision of feedback, the practical\r\narrangements for information exchange and the evaluation of the administrative\r\ncooperation so as to extend them to the automatic information exchange on\r\nadvance cross-border rulings and advance pricing arrangements.\nThe subject-matter of these modifications\r\nfalls within the same legal basis as Directive 2011/16/EU, i.e. Article 115 of\r\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which aims to\r\nensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe impact of the proposal on the EU Budget\r\nis presented in the financial statement accompanying the proposal, and will be\r\nmet within available resources. The costs of the additional IT tools and the\r\npossible central directory that the Commission may develop in the future to\r\nfacilitate the communication of information between Member States as well as to\r\nprovide for its storage would be funded out of the FISCALIS 2020 programme\r\nprovided for in Regulation (EU) 1286/2013 which provides financial support for\r\nactivities to improve administrative cooperation between tax authorities in the\r\nEU.\n2015/0068 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\namending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards\r\nmandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 115 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[10], \nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[11],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[12],\r\n\nActing in accordance with a special legislative\r\nprocedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The challenge posed by cross-border tax avoidance,\r\naggressive tax planning and harmful tax competition has increased considerably\r\nand has become a major focus of concern within the Union and at global level.\r\nTax base erosion is considerably reducing national tax revenues, which hinders\r\nMember States in applying growth-friendly tax policies. In particular, rulings\r\nconcerning tax-driven structures lead to a low level of taxation of\r\nartificially high amounts of income in the country giving the advance ruling\r\nand may leave artificially low amounts of income to be taxed in any other\r\ncountries involved. An increase in transparency is therefore urgently required.\r\nThe tools and mechanisms established by Council Directive 2011/16/EU[13] need to be enhanced in order to achieve this. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Council, in\r\nits conclusions of 18 December 2014, underlined the urgent need to advance\r\nefforts in the fight against tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning, both at\r\nthe global and Union levels. Stressing the importance of transparency, the\r\nEuropean Council welcomed the Commission\u2019s intention to submit a proposal on\r\nthe automatic exchange of information on tax rulings in the Union. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2011/16/EU\r\nprovides for mandatory spontaneous exchange of information between Member\r\nStates in five specific cases and within certain deadlines. The spontaneous exchange of information in cases where the competent\r\nauthority of one Member State has grounds for supposing that there may be a\r\nloss of tax in another Member State already applies to tax rulings that a\r\nMember State gives to a specific taxpayer regarding the interpretation or\r\napplication of tax provisions in the future and that have a cross-border\r\ndimension.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the efficient\r\nspontaneous exchange of information in respect of advance cross-border rulings\r\nand advance pricing arrangements is hindered by several important practical\r\ndifficulties such as the discretion permitted to the issuing Member State to\r\ndecide which other Member States should be informed.\u00a0\u00a0 \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The possibility that the\r\nprovision of information may be refused where it would lead to the disclosure\r\nof a commercial, industrial or professional secret or of a commercial process,\r\nor of information whose disclosure would be contrary to public policy should\r\nnot apply to provisions of mandatory automatic exchange of information on\r\nadvance cross-border rulings and advance pricing arrangements in order not to\r\nreduce the effectiveness of these exchanges. The limited nature of the information\r\nthat is required to be shared with all Member States should ensure sufficient\r\nprotection of those commercial interests.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reap the\r\nbenefits of the mandatory automatic exchange of advance cross-border rulings\r\nand advance pricing arrangements, the information should be communicated\r\npromptly after they are issued and therefore regular intervals for the\r\ncommunication of the information should be established. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mandatory automatic\r\nexchange of advance cross-border rulings and advance pricing arrangements\r\nshould in each case include communication of a defined set of basic information\r\nto all Member States. The Commission should adopt any measures necessary to\r\nstandardise the communication of such information under the procedure laid down\r\nin Directive 2011/16/EC for establishing a standard form to be used for the\r\nexchange of information. That procedure should also be used in the adoption of\r\nany necessary measures and practical arrangements for the implementation of the\r\ninformation exchange. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\r\nexchange the basic information to be communicated also with the Commission.\r\nThis would enable the Commission at any point in time to monitor and evaluate\r\nthe effective application of the automatic exchange of information on advance\r\ncross-border rulings and advance pricing arrangements. Such communication will\r\nnot discharge a Member State from its obligations to notify any state aid to\r\nthe Commission. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Feedback by the receiving\r\nMember State to the Member State sending the information is a necessary element\r\nof the operation of an effective system of automatic information exchange. It\r\nis therefore appropriate to provide for measures enabling the provision of\r\nfeedback in cases where the information has been used and where no feedback can\r\nbe provided under other provisions of Directive 2011/16/EU.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Member State should be\r\nable to rely on Article 5 of Directive 2011/16/EU as regards the exchange of\r\ninformation on request to obtain additional information, including the full\r\ntext of advance cross-border rulings or advance pricing arrangements, from the\r\nMember State having issued such rulings or arrangements.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should take\r\nall measures necessary to remove any obstacle that might hinder the effective\r\nand widest possible mandatory automatic exchange of information on advance\r\ncross-border rulings and advance pricing arrangements. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to enhance the\r\nefficient use of resources, facilitate the exchange of information and avoid\r\nthe need for Member States each to make similar developments to their systems\r\nto store information, specific provision should be made for the establishment\r\nof a central directory accessible to all Member States and the Commission where\r\nMember States would upload and store information instead of exchanging it by\r\nemail. The practical arrangements necessary for the establishment of such a\r\ndirectory should be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure\r\nreferred to in Article 26(2) of Directive 2011/16/EU.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to the nature\r\nand extent of the changes introduced by Directive 2014/107/EU and this\r\nDirective, the timeframe for the submission of information, statistics and\r\nreports provided for under Directive 2011/16/EU should be extended. Such an\r\nextension should ensure the information to be provided can take into account\r\nthe experience resulting from those changes. The extension should apply both to\r\nthe statistics and other information to be submitted by Member States before 1\r\nJuly 2016 and to the report and, if appropriate, the proposal to be submitted\r\nby the Commission before 1 July 2017.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the spirit of the\r\nincremental approach advocated in Directive 2011/16/EU, it is appropriate to\r\nadapt the time limits for the existing mandatory automatic exchange of\r\ninformation provided for in Article 8(1) of Directive 2011/16/EU in order to\r\nensure that the available information on the categories is communicated within\r\nnine months after the end of the tax year to which it relates. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The existing provisions\r\nregarding confidentiality should be amended to reflect the extension of\r\nmandatory automatic exchange of information to advance cross-border rulings and\r\nadvance pricing arrangements.\u00a0 \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects the\r\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the\r\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, this\r\nDirective seeks to ensure full respect for the right to the protection of\r\npersonal data and the freedom to conduct a business. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nDirective, namely the efficient administrative cooperation between Member\r\nStates under conditions compatible with the proper functioning of the Internal\r\nMarket, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by\r\nreason of the uniformity and effectiveness required, be better achieved at\r\nUnion level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of\r\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In\r\naccordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article,\r\nthis Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that\r\nobjective. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nJoint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September\r\n2011 on explanatory documents[14],\r\nMember States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the\r\nnotification of their transposition measures with one or more documents\r\nexplaining the relationship between the components of a Directive and the\r\ncorresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this\r\nDirective, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be\r\njustified.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2011/16/EU should\r\ntherefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nDirective 2011/16/EU is amended as follows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 3 is amended as\r\nfollows:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\r\nPoint 9 is replaced by the following:\n\"9.\u00a0\r\n'automatic exchange' means, \n(a) for the\r\npurposes of Article 8(1) and Article 8a, the systematic communication of\r\npredefined information to another Member State, without prior request, at\r\npre-established regular intervals. For the purposes of\u00a0 Article 8(1), reference\r\nto available information relates to information in the tax files of the Member\r\nState communicating the information, which is retrievable in accordance with\r\nthe procedures for gathering and processing information in that Member State.\n(b) for the\r\npurposes of Article 8(3a), the systematic communication of predefined\r\ninformation on residents in other Member States to the relevant Member State of\r\nresidence, without prior request, at pre-established regular intervals. In the\r\ncontext of Article 8(3a), Article 8(7a), Article 21(2) and Article 25(2) and\r\n(3) any capitalised term shall have the meaning that it has under the\r\ncorresponding definitions set out in Annex I;\n(c) for the\r\npurposes of all provisions other than Article 8(1), 8(3a) and 8a, the\r\nsystematic communication of predefined information provided in accordance with\r\npoints (a) and (b) of this point.\"\n(b) The\r\nfollowing points 14, 15 and 16 are added:\n\"14.\r\n'advance cross-border ruling' means any agreement, communication, or any other\r\ninstrument or action with similar effects, including one issued in the context\r\nof a tax audit, which:\n(a) is given by,\r\nor on behalf of, the government or the tax authority of a Member State, or any\r\nterritorial or administrative subdivisions thereof, to any person; \n(b) concerns the\r\ninterpretation or application of a legal or administrative provision concerning\r\nthe administration or enforcement of national laws relating to taxes of the\r\nMember State, or its territorial or administrative subdivisions;\n(c) relates to a\r\ncross-border transaction or to the question of whether or not activities\r\ncarried on by a legal person in the other Member State create a permanent\r\nestablishment, and; \n(d) is made in\r\nadvance of the transactions or of the activities in the other Member State\r\npotentially creating a permanent establishment or of the filing of a tax return\r\ncovering the period in which the transaction or series of transactions or activities\r\ntook place. \nThe cross-border\r\ntransaction may involve, but is not restricted to, the making of investments,\r\nthe provision of goods, services, finance or the use of tangible or intangible\r\nassets and does not have to directly involve the person receiving the advance\r\ncross-border ruling;\n15.

Automatic exchange of information on tax rulings may also deter\r\ncompanies from aggressive tax planning on the basis of tax rulings, since other\r\nMember States will now have the information needed to detect and react to\r\nartificial arrangements and profit shifting. \n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\r\nimpact \nSpecify the\r\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nThe proposal will be governed by the requirements in the Directive\r\nthat it is amending (i.e. Directive 2011/16) for i) the provision by Member\r\nStates on an annual basis of statistics of information exchange, ii) the\r\nsubmission of a report by the Commission on the basis of those statistics, and\r\niii) the provision by Member States on an annual basis of an evaluation of the\r\neffectiveness of the automatic exchange of information.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nWhile, under the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (2011/16),\r\nthere is a requirement on a Member State which issues a tax ruling to disclose\r\ninformation to any other Member States concerned, it is left to the Member\r\nState issuing the ruling to decide to which other Member States the information\r\nmight be relevant. However, the Member State issuing the ruling may not always\r\nbe in a position to know which other Member States might be affected.\r\nFurthermore, there are currently several exemptions from the disclosure\r\nrequirement. This proposal would require a Member State issuing rulings to\r\nprovide information automatically to all other Member States, so that the\r\ndecision on relevance would be made by a receiving rather than issuing Member\r\nState, and would eliminate the current exemptions from the disclosure\r\nrequirement.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nMember States acting individually might not be able to obtain full\r\ninformation on rulings issued by other Member States even where those rulings\r\nconcern their tax base. A binding EU approach is the only way to ensure\r\ncomplete transparency and cooperation in this matter.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe present non-automatic approach to exchange of information on\r\nrulings has not, so far, led to transparency in this field. Currently, some\r\ntaxpayers are taking advance of the lack of transparency to set up structures\r\nthat shift profits to low-tax countries, which may not be the countries where\r\neconomic activities generating the profits are performed and where value is\r\ncreated. The automatic exchange of information between tax administrations\r\nwhich applies in other tax fields, such as for savings income, has led to good\r\nresults. Automatic exchange is now accepted at global level as the best tool\r\navailable to tax administrations to tackle tax avoidance and evasion.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nAs the proposal is designed to amend the Directive on Administrative\r\nCooperation (2011/16), the procedures, arrangements and IT tools already\r\nestablished or under development under that Directive will be available for use\r\nfor the purposes of this proposal. \n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\u00fd Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\r\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \r\nThe proposal will take effect from 1 January\r\n2016\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) planned[17] \n\u00fd Direct management by the Commission\n\u2013     \r\n\u00fd by its departments, including by its staff in the Union\r\ndelegations; \u00a0 \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Fiscalis 2020\r\nprogramme is managed in direct mode\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 by the executive agencies \n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial\r\nRegulation;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the\r\nextent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\r\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic\r\nact.\n\u2013       If more than one management mode is\r\nindicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\nComments \nNothing as\r\nregards management would change under this proposal.

The input is collected via\r\nstandardised forms and feeds in indicators established in the Fiscalis 2020\r\nprogramme performance measurement framework (PMF). Other expenditure related to\r\nthe exchange of information is monitored according to the mechanism described\r\nunder section 1.4.4 and also consolidated under PMF.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\r\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThe potential risks for the implementation of the initiative with\r\nthe Fiscalis 2020 support relate to:\nImplementation of the grant agreement signed with the consortium of\r\nthe Member States and Candidate Countries\nImplementation of the procurement contracts concluded under the programme.\r\n\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information concerning the\r\ninternal control system set up\nThe set up of internal control system is identical to the Fiscalis\r\n2020 programme, which will be covering all operational expenditures of the\r\ninitiative.\nThe main elements of the control strategy applied are:\nFor procurement contracts: \nThe control procedures for procurement defined in the Financial\r\nRegulation are applied. Any procurement contract is established following the\r\nestablished procedure of verification by the services of the Commission for\r\npayment, taking into account contractual obligations and sound financial and\r\ngeneral management. Anti-fraud measures (controls, reports, etc.) are foreseen\r\nin all contracts concluded between the Commission and the beneficiaries. Detailed\r\nterms of reference are drafted and form the basis of each specific contract.\r\nThe acceptance process follows strictly the TAXUD TEMPO methodology:\r\ndeliverables are reviewed, amended if necessary and finally explicitly accepted\r\n(or rejected). No invoice can be paid without an \"acceptance letter\".\r\n\nTechnical verification for procurement\nDG TAXUD performs controls of deliverables and supervises operations\r\nand services carried out by contractors. It also conducts quality and security\r\naudits of their contractors on a regular basis. Quality audits verify the\r\ncompliance of the contractors' actual processes against the rules and\r\nprocedures defined in their quality plans. Security audits focus on the\r\nspecific processes, procedures and set-up. \nIn addition to the above controls, DG TAXUD performs the traditional\r\nfinancial controls: \nEx-ante verification of commitments: \nAll commitments in DG TAXUD are verified by the head of the HR and\r\nFinances Unit. Consequently, 100% of the committed amounts are covered by the\r\nex-ante verification. This procedure gives a high level of assurance as to the\r\nlegality and regularity of transactions.\nEx-ante verification of payments: \n100% of pyaments are verified ex-ante. Moreover, at least one\r\npayment (from all categories of expenditures) per week is randomly selected for\r\nadditional ex-ante verification performed by the head of the HR and Finances\r\nUnit. There is no target concerning the coverage, as the purpose of this\r\nverification is to check payments \"randomly\" in order to verify that\r\nall payments were prepared in line with the requirements. The remaining\r\npayments are processed according to the rules in force on a daily basis.\nDeclarations of the AOSD: \nAll the Authorising Officers by Sub-Delegations sign declarations\r\nsupporting the Annual Activity Report for the year concerned. These\r\ndeclarations cover the operations under the programme. The AOSD declare that\r\nthe operations connected with the implementation of the budget have been\r\nexecuted in accordance with the principles of the sound financial management,\r\nthat the management and control systems in place provided satisfactory\r\nassurance concerning the legality and regularity of the transactions and that\r\nthe risks associated to these operations have been properly identified,\r\nreported and that mitigating actions have been implemented. \n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimate of the costs and\r\nbenefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \nThe controls established enable DG TAXUD to have sufficient\r\nassurance of the quality and regularity of the expenditure and reduce the risk\r\nof non-compliance. The above control strategy measures reduce the potential\r\nrisks bellow the target of 2% and it reaches all beneficiaries Any additional\r\nmeasures for further risk reduction would result in disproportionate high costs\r\nand are therefore not envisaged. \nThe overall costs\u00a0 entailed to implement the above control strategy\r\n\u2013 for all expenditures under Fiscalis 2020 programme \u2013 are limited to 1.6 % of\r\nthe total payments made. It is expected to remain at the same ratio for this\r\ninitiative.\nThe programme control strategy is deemed efficient to limit the risk\r\nof non-compliance to virtually zero and to be proportionate with the risks\r\nentailed.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\r\nand irregularities \nSpecify existing or\r\nenvisaged prevention and protection measures.\nThe European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out investigations,\r\nincluding on-the-spot checks and inspections, in accordance with the provisions\r\nand procedures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council ( 1 ) and Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No\r\n2185/96 ( 2 ) with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud,\r\ncorruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of\r\nthe Union in connection with a grant agreement or grant decision or a contract\r\nfunded under this Regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL\r\nIMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      Existing budget lines \u2013 fully covered by the Fiscalis 2020 programme\nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number 1A Competitiveness for growth and jobs || Diff./Non-diff.[18] || from EFTA countries[19]   || from candidate countries[20]   || from third countries || within the meaning of Article 21(2)(b) of the Financial Regulation \n   || 14.0301 (Improving the proper functioning of the taxation systems) || Diff. || NO || NO || NO || NO \n\u00b7      New budget lines requested \nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Heading\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026] || Diff./Non-diff. || from EFTA countries || from candidate countries || from third countries || within the meaning of Article 21(2)(b) of the Financial Regulation \n   || [XX.YY.YY.YY]   ||   || YES/NO || YES/NO || YES/NO || YES/NO \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimated impact on\r\nexpenditure \n[This section should\r\nbe filled in using the spreadsheet on budget data of an\r\nadministrative nature (second\r\ndocument in annex to this financial statement) and uploaded to CISNET for\r\ninterservice consultation purposes.]\n3.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of estimated impact\r\non expenditure \nThe applications mentioned below are\r\nincluded in the financial envelope of the FISCALIS 2020 programme.
