Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the\r\nCommission decided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten\r\namendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments\r\nshould endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they\r\nare responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily\r\nunderstandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a\r\ngiven matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament, the\r\nCouncil and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the\r\nfast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1340/2008\r\nof 8 December 2008 on trade in certain steel products between the European\r\nCommunity and the Republic of Kazakhstan[3].\r\nThe new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the\r\ncodification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of\r\na preliminary consolidation, in 23 official languages, of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1340/2008 and the instruments amending it, carried out by the\r\nPublications Office of the European Union, by means of a data-processing\r\nsystem. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between\r\nthe old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex VII to\r\nthe codified Regulation.\n\u00ea 1340/2008\r\n(adapted)\n2015/0082 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non trade in certain steel products between\r\nthe European \u00d6 Union \u00d5 and\r\nthe Republic of Kazakhstan (codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL\r\nOF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the Functioning of the European Union \u00d5, and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00ea \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1340/2008[6]\r\nhas been substantially amended several times[7].\r\nIn the interests of clarity and rationality, that Regulation should be codified.\n\u00ea 1340/2008\r\nrecital 1 (adapted)\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 17(1) of the\r\nPartnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and\r\ntheir Member States and the Republic of Kazakhstan[8] provides that trade in\r\ncertain steel products \u00d6 is \u00d5 to be subject\r\nto a specific agreement on quantitative arrangements.\n\u00ea 1340/2008\r\nrecital 2 (adapted)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement between the\r\nEuropean Community and the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan on trade in\r\ncertain steel products[9]\r\nconcluded on 19 July 2005 expired on 31 December 2006.\n\u00ea 1340/2008\r\nrecital 3 (adapted)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pending the signature and\r\nentry into force of a new agreement or Kazakhstan\u2019s accession to the World\r\nTrade Organisation (WTO), quantitative limits starting in  \u00d6 2007 were\r\nlaid down by Council Regulation (EC) No 1870/2006[10], Council Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1531/2007[11]\r\nand Regulation (EC) No 1340/2008 \u00d5.\n\u00ea 1340/2008\r\nrecital 5 (adapted)\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to provide\r\nthe means to administer this regime within the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 in such a way\r\nas to facilitate the implementation of the new agreement by envisaging as much\r\nas possible similar provisions.\n\u00ea 1340/2008\r\nrecital 6 (adapted)\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to ensure\r\nthat the origin of the products in question is checked and appropriate methods\r\nof administrative cooperation are \u00d6 specified \u00d5 to this end.\n\u00ea 1340/2008\r\nrecital 7 (adapted)\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Products placed in a free\r\nzone or imported under the arrangements governing customs warehouses, temporary\r\nimportation or inward processing (suspension system) should not be counted\r\nagainst the \u00d6 quantitative \u00d5 limits\r\nestablished for the products in question.\n\u00ea 1340/2008\r\nrecital 8 (adapted)\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The effective application\r\nof this Regulation \u00d6 requires\r\nthe use \u00d5 of a \u00d6 Union \u00d5 import licence\r\nfor the entry into free circulation in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 of the\r\nproducts in question.\n\u00ea 1340/2008\r\nrecital 9 (adapted)\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\r\nthe \u00d6 applicable \u00d5 quantitative\r\nlimits are not exceeded, it is necessary to \u00d6 lay\r\ndown \u00d5 a procedure\r\nwhereby the competent authorities of the Member States do not issue import\r\nlicences before obtaining confirmation from the Commission that appropriate\r\namounts remain available within the quantitative limit in question.\n\u00ea 38/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .7 (adapted)\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  In order to permit the\r\neffective administration of certain restrictions, the power to adopt acts in\r\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the\r\nCommission in respect of amendments to Annex V to \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation. It\r\nis of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate\r\nconsultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.

The products \u00d6 referred\r\nto in paragraph 1 \u00d5 shall be\r\nclassified in product groups as set out in Annex I.\n3. The classification of products listed in\r\nAnnex I shall be based on the Combined Nomenclature (CN) established by\r\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87[12].\n4. The origin of the products referred to\r\nin paragraph 1 shall be determined in accordance with the rules in force\r\nin the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\nArticle 2\n1. The importation into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 of the steel\r\nproducts listed in Annex I originating in the Republic of Kazakhstan shall\r\nbe subject to the quantitative limits laid down in Annex V. The release\r\nfor free circulation in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 of the\r\nproducts \u00d6 listed \u00d5 in\r\nAnnex I originating in the Republic of Kazakhstan shall be subject to the\r\npresentation of a certificate of origin, set out in Annex II, and of an\r\nimport licence issued by the Member States\u2019 authorities in accordance with\r\nArticle 4.\n2. In order to ensure that quantities for\r\nwhich import licences are issued do not exceed at any moment the total\r\nquantitative limits for each product group, the competent authorities listed in\r\nAnnex IV shall issue import licences only upon confirmation by the\r\nCommission that there are still quantities available within the quantitative\r\nlimits for the relevant product group of steel products in respect of the\r\nsupplier country, for which an importer or importers have submitted\r\napplications to the said authorities.\n3. The authorised imports shall be counted\r\nagainst the relevant quantitative limit \u00d6 laid\r\ndown \u00d5 in\r\nAnnex V. \u00d6 The \u00d5 shipment of\r\nproducts shall be considered as having taken place on the date on which they\r\nwere loaded onto the exporting means of transport.\nArticle 3\n1.

For the purpose of applying\r\nArticle 2(2), before issuing import licences, the competent authorities\r\nlisted in Annex IV shall notify the Commission of the amounts of the\r\nrequests for import licences, supported by original export licences, which they\r\nhave received. By return, the Commission shall notify whether the requested\r\namount(s) of quantities are available for importation in the chronological\r\norder in which the notifications of the Member States are received (first-come,\r\nfirst-served basis).\n2. The requests included in the\r\nnotifications to the Commission shall be valid if they establish clearly in\r\neach case the exporting country, the product code concerned, the amounts to be\r\nimported, the number of the export licence, the quota year and the Member State\r\nin which the products are intended to be put into free circulation.\n3. As far as possible, the Commission shall\r\nconfirm to the \u00d6 competent \u00d5 authorities \u00d6 listed in\r\nAnnex IV \u00d5 the full\r\namount indicated in the requests notified for each group of products.\n4. The competent authorities \u00d6 listed in\r\nAnnex IV \u00d5 shall notify\r\nthe Commission immediately after being informed of any quantity that is not used\r\nduring the duration of validity of the import licence.

However, if the Commission or the competent authorities\r\nof a Member State have been informed by the competent authorities of the Republic\r\nof Kazakhstan of the withdrawal or cancellation of an export licence after the\r\nrelated products have been imported into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , the\r\nquantities in question shall be set off against the relevant quantitative limit\r\n\u00d6 laid\r\ndown \u00d5 in\r\nAnnex V.\nArticle 5\n1. Where the Commission has indications\r\nthat products listed in Annex I originating in the Republic of Kazakhstan\r\nhave been transhipped, re-routed or otherwise imported into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 through\r\ncircumvention of the quantitative limits referred to in Article 2 and that\r\nthere is a need for the necessary adjustments to be made, it shall request that\r\nconsultations be opened so that agreement may be reached on the necessary\r\nadjustment of the corresponding quantitative limits to be made.\n2. Pending the outcome of the consultations\r\nreferred to in paragraph 1, the Commission may ask the Republic of\r\nKazakhstan to take the necessary precautionary steps to ensure that adjustments\r\nto the quantitative limits agreed following such consultations may be carried\r\nout.\n\u00ea 38/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .7(1) (adapted)\n3. Should the Union and the Republic of\r\nKazakhstan fail to arrive at a satisfactory solution and should the Commission\r\nnote that there is clear evidence of circumvention, the Commission shall be\r\nempowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 17 in order\r\nto deduct from the quantitative limits an equivalent volume of products\r\noriginating in the Republic of Kazakhstan and to amend Annex V\r\naccordingly.\nWhere a delay in action to address clear\r\nevidence of circumvention in a sufficiently expedient way would cause damage\r\nwhich would be difficult to repair, and therefore imperative grounds of urgency\r\nso require, the procedure provided for in Article 18 shall apply to\r\ndelegated acts adopted pursuant to the first subparagraph.\n\u00ea 1340/2008\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 6\n1. An export licence, to be issued by the\r\ncompetent authorities of the Republic of Kazakhstan, shall be required in\r\nrespect of any consignment of steel products subject to the quantitative limits\r\nlaid down in Annex V up to the level of the said limits.\n2.
