At the end of those negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled by the negotiators on 10\u00a0July 2015. It covers a period of four years from the date of provisional application laid down in Article\u00a014 \u2013 i.e. from the date of its signature.\n\n\nThe main aim of the Protocol is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in Mauritanian waters taking into account available scientific assessments, in particular those of the Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF), and in accordance with scientific advice and the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), within the limits of the available surplus. The Commission based its position in part on the results of a forward-looking assessment, carried out by external experts, of whether a new Protocol should be concluded. \n\n\nThe objective is to also enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the fishing zone of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, in the interests of both parties.\n\n\nThe Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories:\n\n\n\u2013Category\u00a01 \u2013 Vessels fishing for crustaceans other than spiny lobster and crab: 5\u00a0000 tonnes and 25 vessels;\n\n\n\u2013Category 2 - Black hake (non-freezer) trawlers and bottom longliners: 6\u00a0000 tonnes and 6 vessels;\n\n\n\u2013Category 3 - Vessels fishing for demersal species other than black hake with gear other than trawls: 3\u00a0000 tonnes and 6 vessels;\n\n\n\u2013Category 4 - Tuna seiners: 12\u00a0500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 25 vessels;\n\n\n\u2013Category\u00a05 - Pole-and-line tuna vessels and longliners: 7\u00a0500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 15 vessels;\n\n\n\u2013Category\u00a06 - Pelagic freezer trawlers: 247\u00a0500 and 19 vessels;\n\n\n\u2013Category\u00a07 - Non-freezer pelagic vessels: 15\u00a0000 tonnes (deducted from volume under category 6 if used) and 2 vessels. \n\n\nThe Commission proposes, on this basis, that the Council, with the consent of the Parliament, adopt by Decision the conclusion of this new Protocol.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe interested parties were consulted during the evaluation of the Protocol for the period 2012-14. Experts from the Member States were also consulted in technical meetings. These consultations led to the conclusion that it would be beneficial to maintain a fishing protocol with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThis procedure is being initiated in parallel with the procedures relating to the Council Decision on the provisional application of the Protocol itself, as well as with the Council Regulation concerning the allocation of the fishing opportunities between EU Member States.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n\nThe annual financial contribution has been set at EUR\u00a059\u00a0125\u00a0000 per year, on the basis of:\n\n\na) a total allowable catch of 261\u00a0500 tonnes for fishing categories 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 and a reference tonnage of 20\u00a0000 tonnes for fishing categories 4 and 5 of the Protocol, corresponding to an amount linked to access to EUR\u00a055\u00a0000\u00a0000 per year, and \n\n\nb) support for the development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania amounting to EUR\u00a04\u00a0125\u00a0000 per year. This support meets the aims of national fishing policy and in particular the needs of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania as regards supporting scientific and technical cooperation, training, fisheries monitoring, protecting the environment and development infrastructure.\n\n\n\n2015/0229 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for a period of four years\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) in conjunction with Article 218(6) second subparagraph, point (a)(v) and Article 218(7) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament\n1\n,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)On 30\u00a0November 2006, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1801/2006 on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania (\u2018the Partnership Agreement\u2019)\n2\n.\n\n\n(2)On 10\u00a0July 2015, the Union and Mauritania initialled a new Protocol to the partnership agreement (hereinafter \u2018the Protocol\u2019). The Protocol grants EU vessels fishing opportunities in the fishing zone over which the Islamic Republic of Mauritania exercises its jurisdiction.\n\n\n(3)On  [...], the Council adopted Decision No\u00a0 \u2026/2015/EU\n3\n, authorising the signature, on behalf of the Union, of the Protocol and of its provisional implementation subject to its conclusion.\n\n\n(4)Article\u00a010 of the Partnership Agreement establishes a Joint Committee whose responsibilities include supervising the execution, implementation, interpretation and smooth running of the application of the partnership agreement and re-examining, where appropriate, the level of fishing possibilities on the basis of the financial contribution.\n\n\n(5)Article\u00a06 of the Protocol states that the Joint Committee may also approve certain amendments to the Protocol. In order to facilitate the approval of such amendments, it is appropriate to empower the Commission, subject to specific conditions, to approve these amendments under a simplified procedure,\n\n\n(6)The Protocol should be approved,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for a period of four years (\u2018the Protocol\u2019) is hereby approved on behalf of the Union.\n\n\nThe text of the Protocol is attached to this Decision as Annex\u00a0I.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe President of the Council shall, on behalf of the Union, give the notification provided for in Article\u00a017 of the Protocol with a view to expressing the Union\u2019s consent to be bound by the Protocol.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nIn accordance with the provisions and conditions laid down in Annex\u00a0II to this Decision, the Commission is authorised to approve, on behalf of the Union, any amendments made to the Protocol adopted by the Joint Committee provided for in Article\u00a010 of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Commission and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n\n\n1.FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n1.1.Title of the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.2.Policy area(s) concerned in the ABM/ABB structure\n\n\n1.3.Nature of the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.4.Objective(s) \n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\n\n1.7.Management method(s) envisaged \n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\n\n3.2.Estimated impact on expenditure\u00a0\n\n\n3.2.1.Summary of estimated impact on expenditure \n\n\n3.2.2.Estimated impact on operational appropriations \n\n\n3.2.3.Estimated impact on appropriations of an administrative nature\n\n\n3.2.4.Compatibility with the current multiannual financial framework\n\n\n3.2.5.Third-party contributions \n\n\n3.3.Estimated impact on revenue\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n\n\n5.FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n5.1.Title of the proposal/initiative \n\n\n\nProposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania\n\n\n\n5.2.Policy area(s) concerned in the ABM/ABB structure\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n11. \u2013 Maritime affairs and fisheries policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.03 -

The fishing activities of the European fleet in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania\u2019s fishing zone have therefore been interrupted pending the signature and provisional application of the new Protocol.\n\n\nThe new Protocol will make it possible to authorise and provide a framework for the fishing activities of the European Union\u2019s fleet within the Islamic Republic of Mauritania\u2019s fishing zone. In addition, the new Protocol enhances cooperation between the EU and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, with a view to promoting the development of a sustainable fishing policy. The sectoral support has been increased since the previous period, in order to help the Islamic Republic of Mauritania to implement its new national sectoral policy for ensuring the sustainable development of fishing activities.\n\n\n\n5.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nAs regards this new Protocol, failure to act by the EU would allow private agreements to spring up which would not guarantee sustainable fisheries. The European Union also hopes that, with this Protocol, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania will continue to cooperate effectively with the EU particularly as regards the fight against illegal fishing.\n\n\n\n5.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nAn analysis of recent catches in Mauritania and also the scientific advice and assessments available have led the parties to set an authorised catch volume for fishing categories 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 (261\u00a0500 tonnes) and a reference tonnage for tuna (20\u00a0000 tonnes per year). The sectoral support takes account of the priorities contained in the national fisheries strategy and requirements in terms of building the capacity of the Mauritanian fishing authorities.\n\n\n\n5.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nFunds paid out under SFPAs constitute fungible revenue in the budgets of the third-country partners. However, allocating some of those funds for implementing measures as part of the country\u2019s sectoral policy is a condition for the conclusion and monitoring of SFPAs. These financial resources are compatible with other sources of funding from other providers of international funding for carrying out projects and/or programmes at national level in the fisheries sector.\n\n\n\n5.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\nX Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013X\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in force from the date of signature and for a duration of four years. \n\n\n\u2013X\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from 2015 to 2019\n\n\n\u25fb Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n5.7.Management method(s) envisaged:\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\nFrom the 2015 budget\n\n\nX Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013X by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies\n\n\n\u25fb Shared management with Member States\n\n\n\u25fb Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (please specify);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n6.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions\n\n\n\nThe Commission (DG\u00a0MARE, in collaboration with its fisheries counsellor in Mauritania and the European Union\u2019s Delegation in Nouakchott) will ensure regular monitoring of the implementation of this Protocol, particularly as regards operators\u2019 use of fishing opportunities and in terms of catch data. \n\n\nThe Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement also provides for at least one annual meeting of the Joint Committee, at which the Commission and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania review the implementation of the Agreement and the Protocol thereto and, if necessary, adjust the programming and, if applicable, the financial contribution.\n\n\n\n6.2.Management and control system \n\n\n6.2.1.Risk(s) identified \n\n\n\nThere is some risk in setting up a fisheries protocol, particularly with regard to the amounts intended to finance the sectoral fisheries policy (under-programming).\n\n\n\n6.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nExtensive dialogue is planned on the programming and implementation of the sectoral policy laid down in the Agreement and the Protocol. Joint analysis of results, as referred to in Article 3 of the Protocol, also forms part of these control methods.\n\n\nIn addition, the Agreement and the Protocol contain specific clauses for their suspension, on certain conditions and in given circumstances.\n\n\n\n6.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures\n\n\n\nThe Commission undertakes to establish political dialogue and regular coordination with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania with a view to improving the management of the Agreement and the Protocol and strengthening the EU\u2019s contribution to the sustainable management of resources. In any case, any payment which the Commission makes under an SFPA is subject to the Commission\u2019s standard rules and budgetary and financial procedures. This makes it possible, in particular, to fully identify the bank accounts of the third countries into which the financial contribution is paid. Article 2(8) and Article 3, paragraph 3.10 of the Protocol stipulate that the financial contribution to access and the sectoral support must be paid to an account held by the Public Treasury with the Mauritanian Central Bank. \n\n\n\n7.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n7.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected

The fishing opportunities allocated to European Union fleets, as set out in Annex 1 to the Protocol, shall come from the available surpluses and shall have priority over fishing opportunities allocated to other foreign fleets authorised to fish in Mauritanian fishing zones.\n\n\n5.All technical measures regarding the conservation, development and management of resources, as well as the financial arrangements, fees, public financial contribution and other rights also included relating to the issuing of fishing authorisations as specified for each fishery in Annex 1 to this Protocol, shall apply to all foreign industrial fleets operating in the Mauritanian fishing zones under technical conditions similar to those applicable to the European Union fleets.\n\n\n6.Mauritania undertakes to make public any public or private agreement granting access to its EEZ by foreign vessels, including:\n\n\n\u2013Countries or other entities participating in the agreement;\n\n\n\u2013The period(s) covered by the agreement;\n\n\n\u2013The number of vessels and types of gears authorised;\n\n\n\u2013The species or stocks authorised for fishing, including any catch limit applicable;\n\n\n\u2013The measures concerning reporting, monitoring, inspection and surveillance which are required;\n\n\n\u2013A copy of the written agreement.\n\n\n7.For the purposes of the implementation of paragraphs 4 and 5 above, Mauritania shall each year provide the European Union with a detailed report indicating the number of fishing authorisations for each fishing category granted to fishing vessels flying the flag of other third countries, the corresponding volume of catches authorised, actual catch numbers and the financial and technical arrangements for providing such vessels with access to Mauritania\u2019s fishing zone. This report is to be examined by the Joint Committee and may be made available to the Independent Joint Scientific Committee referred to in Article\u00a04. \n\n\n8.Under Article\u00a06 of the Agreement, vessels flying the flag of a Member State of the European Union may fish in Mauritania\u2019s fishing zone only if they are in possession of a fishing authorisation issued under this Protocol in accordance with Annex\u00a01 hereto.\n\n\n9.The two Parties shall comply with the recommendations and resolutions issued by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and consult each other ahead of the annual meetings of that organisation.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 2\n\nFinancial contribution regarding access\n\n\n1.The annual financial contribution for the access by European Union vessels to the Mauritanian fishing zones referred to in Article\u00a07 of the Agreement is set at fifty-five (55) million euro. This paragraph shall apply subject to Articles\u00a05 to 10 and Article\u00a016 of this Protocol.\n\n\n2.Payment by the European Union of the financial contribution referred to in paragraph 1 regarding access by European Union vessels to the Mauritanian fishing zone shall take place no later than three (3) months after the date of provisional application in the first year and in the following years no later than the anniversary date of the provisional application of the Protocol. European Union vessels may only begin fishing activities in the Mauritanian fishing zone from the date of provisional application.\n\n\n3.The total allowable catches (categories 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8) and the reference tonnages (categories 4 and 5) are set out in the datasheets contained in Annex 1 to this Protocol They are established on the basis of the calendar year (1 January-31 December of the year concerned). If the first and the last period of the application of the Protocol do not correspond to a calendar year, the total allowable catches shall be fixed pro rata temporis and taking account, for each fishing category, of trends in terms of the distribution of catches throughout the year.\n\n\n4.With the exception of categories 4 and 5 (reference tonnage) and specific provisions applicable to the total allowable catch in category 6, the total catches made by European Union fishing vessels in Mauritania\u2019s fishing zone may not exceed the total allowable catches If the total allowable catches are exceeded, the rules relating to the deduction of quotas applicable in accordance with European Union rules shall be applied\n\n\n5.In accordance with paragraph 3, Mauritania and the European Union shall jointly monitor the activity of Union fishing vessels in the Mauritanian fishing zone in order to ensure that the total allowable catches mentioned above are appropriately managed In the course of this monitoring, Mauritania and the European Union shall inform each other as soon as the Union vessels operating in the Mauritanian fishing zone have caught 80\u00a0% of the total allowable catch for the corresponding fishing category. The European Union shall accordingly inform Member States thereof.\n\n\n6.Once catch levels have reached 80\u00a0% of the relevant total allowable catch, Mauritania and the European Union shall monitor catches made by Union fishing vessels on a monthly basis. This monitoring shall be carried out on a daily basis once the Electronic Reporting System (ERS) described in chapter\u00a0IV, paragraph 4, of the Annex to this Protocol is in operation. Mauritania and the European Union shall inform each other as soon as the relevant total allowable catch has been reached. The European Union shall accordingly inform the Member States thereof in order to ensure that fishing activity is discontinued.\n\n\n7.For fishing categories 4 and 5, if catches made by tuna vessels from the European Union in the Mauritanian fishing zone exceed the reference tonnage stipulated for each of these categories, the financial contribution of EUR\u00a055 million shall be increased, for each additional tonne caught, by the amount of the fee stated in the relevant datasheets for the year in question. However, the amount paid by the European Union in respect of the exceeding may not exceed an amount equivalent to twice the corresponding reference tonnage. If the quantities of catches made by European Union vessels are more than twice the total corresponding reference tonnage, the amount due in respect of the quantity exceeding that limit shall be paid the following year. \n\n\n8.The financial contribution referred to in paragraph\u00a01 of this article shall be paid to an account held by the Public Treasury with the Central Bank of Mauritania. The Mauritanian authorities shall notify the European Union of the details of that account on an annual basis six (6) months prior to the date on which payment is due.\n\n\nArticle 3 \n\nFinancial support for promoting sustainable fishing\n\n\n1.Subject-matter, amount and arrangements \n\n\n1.1.In order to strengthen the strategic partnership between both parties, and in addition to the financial contribution referred to Article 2(1) above, provision is made for financial support to help promote sustainable fisheries in the sum of a total of sixteen million five hundred thousand (16.5) euros for the period of the Protocol.\n\n\n1.2. The financial support referred to in paragraph 1.1 above is intended to help develop sustainable fishing in Mauritania, regardless of the arrangements for access by European Union vessels to the Mauritanian fishing zone, and also to contribute to the implementation of sectoral national strategies as regards sustainable development of the fishing sector and the protection of protected marine and coastal areas, in conjunction with the poverty reduction strategy in force.\n\n\n1.3.The financial support referred to in paragraph 1 above shall be paid by the European Union in tranches. The decision to disburse tranches shall be made as the objectives jointly established and assessed by the Joint Committee in accordance with Article\u00a07(2) and Article 10(1)(b) of the Agreement are met. The practical implementing arrangements shall be defined in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article and also in Annex\u00a02 to this Protocol. If appropriate, these practical arrangements may be laid down in more detail or reviewed by the Joint Committee.\n\n\n1.4.The financial support referred to in paragraph 1.1 above is intended for specific projects and measures which have been jointly identified. It cannot be used to cover the operating expenses of beneficiaries, with the exception of the allocations referred to in Article 2(2) on the functioning of the implementation unit and Article 2(3) on external audits.\n\n\n2.Conditions for implementation\n\n\n2.1.The sectoral support is implemented by an implementation unit which is responsible for implementing the decisions of the Joint Committee. The implementation unit is appointed by the minister responsible for fisheries and works under the minister's authority.\n\n\n2.2.The implementation unit referred to in paragraph 2.1 above is financed by a specific budget for sectoral aid, the annual amount for which shall be established by the Joint Committee. Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles\u00a08, 9 and 10 of this Protocol, this allocation shall be transferred by the European Union each year to ensure that the implementation unit can operate on a continuous basis for a specific period of time separately from the rest of the sectoral support, the transfer of which remains subject to the provisions of this article and Article\u00a02. \n\n\n2.3.The composition of the implementation unit and the rules governing its operation shall be approved by the Joint Committee.

In accordance with paragraph 4 of Annex\u00a02, the unit shall prepare a multi-annual programme for sectoral aid which shall be subject to the approval of the Joint Committee. This multiannual programme is to be broken down into annual programmes which will include detailed projects and measures which must be submitted to the minister and then approved by the Joint Committee before the Mauritanian authorities are sent the tranches of the relevant sectoral support, subject to the limits available under this support. \n\n\n\n\n2.5.The implementation unit is responsible for coordinating implementation in conjunction with the beneficiaries, irrespective of their supervising authority, and monitors that the measures and projects have been implemented. All measures taken by the implementation unit which have a financial implication must be agreed by the minister beforehand, after hearing the opinion of the European Union\u2019s representative and, if appropriate, the relevant supervisory body. In the absence of agreement, the implementation unit will be asked to amend its proposed decision before re-submitting it for the minister\u2019s approval.\n\n\n2.6.The implementation unit shall send the minister calls for tender, the minutes of the meetings of the selection boards and signed contracts relating to projects financed under this support no more than 48 hours after they have been published and signed. \n\n\n2.7.While a project is being carried out, any changes to the measures financed, guidelines, objectives, criteria and evaluation indicators may be initiated by the minister and must be approved by both parties within the Joint Committee. This approval is an essential condition for the transfer by the European Union of the tranche following the modification. \n\n\n2.8.The implementation unit, in agreement with the minister, may ask the technical and financial partners for a technical and financial contribution to the implementation of projects prior to approval by the Joint Committee. One or several technical and financial partners may also be delegated responsibility for the performance of projects by the Joint Committee in accordance with jointly established rules.\n\n\n3.Supervision and visibility\n\n\n3.1.Monthly meetings to monitor the implementation of the sectoral support shall be organised between the implementation unit, the minister\u2019s representative and the representative of the European Union.

The report shall be adopted by the two parties at the meeting of the Joint Committee following its submission.\n\n\n3.3.The implementation unit shall also submit to the Joint Committee a final report for each of the measures and projects which have been completed under the sectoral support provided for by this Protocol, including an indication of likely economic and social benefits, particularly the impact on fisheries resources, employment and investment. The report will must be adopted by both parties at the first meeting of the Joint Committee after the end of the project\u2019s activities.\n\n\n3.4.The implementation unit shall also provide the Joint Committee, prior to the expiry of this Protocol, with a final report on the implementation of all the sectoral support provided for under this Protocol, including the information referred to in paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 above.\n\n\n3.5.If necessary, the two parties shall continue to monitor the implementation of the sectoral support beyond the expiry of this Protocol or, as the case may be, in the event of its suspension in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol.\n\n\n3.6.Mauritania and the European Union shall jointly ensure the visibility of measures financed by the sectoral support under the protocols for 2008-12 and 2013-14 and also by this Protocol, if necessary with operational support from the implementation unit.\n\n\n3.7.The main institutional and non-institutional beneficiaries of the support shall be invited by the two parties, once a year, to participate in a workshop presenting and scheduling the measures financed under the sectoral support. \n\n\n3.8.The reports referred to in paragraphs 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, as well as the workshop referred to in paragraph 3.7 are essential conditions for the transfer by the European Union of subsequent tranches of the financial support referred to in paragraph 1\n\n\n3.9.With the exception of the allocation referred to in Article\u00a02(2) earmarked for the operations of the implementation unit, the financial support under this Protocol may only be released once all unused financial support from 2013-14 (the amount of which is to be approved following a review by the Parties) has been transferred to the account referred to in paragraph 3.10 and used in accordance with the schedule approved by the Joint Committee. However, unused sectoral support for 2013-14 shall be used no later than fifteen (15) months after the date of the provisional application of this Protocol, failing which it shall be deemed to be exhausted and may not be paid.\n\n\n3.10.The financial support referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be transferred to an account held by the Public Treasury with the Central Bank of Mauritania and to be opened in the name of the Ministry of Fisheries and used only for sectoral support.

European Union vessels may perform their fishing activities subject to the limits laid down for each category in the technical datasheets contained in Appendix 1. \n\n\n3.Vessel identification \n\n\n3.1.The identification marks of all European Union vessels must conform to the relevant European Union legislation. The ministry must be notified of such legislation before the provisional application of the Protocol. The ministry must further be notified of any amendment to the legislation at least one month before its entry into force.\n\n\n3.2.Any vessel which conceals its markings, name or registration shall be liable to the penalties provided for by Mauritanian law. \n\n\n0.Accounts with banks\n\n\nMauritania shall notify the European Union before the entry into force of this Protocol of the details of the bank account(s) (BIC and IBAN codes) into which the financial sums payable by European Union vessels under the Agreement shall be paid. The associated bank transfer costs shall be borne by the vessel owners.\n\n\n1.Methods of payment\n\n\n1.1.Payments shall be made in euro as follows:\n\n\n\u2013fees: by transfer to one of the bank accounts held by the Mauritanian Public Treasury referred to in paragraph 4;\n\n\n\u2013fees relating to the parafiscal charge: by transfer to one of the bank accounts held by the Mauritanian coast guard, referred to in paragraph 4;\n\n\n\u2013fines: by transfer to one of the bank accounts held by the Mauritanian Public Treasury referred to in paragraph 4;\n\n\n1.2.The amounts referred to in point 5.1 above shall be considered as actually received on receipt of confirmation from the Treasury or the ministry following notification by the Central Bank of Mauritania. \n\n\n2.Designation of an agent\n\n\nAn EU vessel must be represented by a local agent if it intends to land or tranship in a Mauritanian port and for any other obligation or practical matters resulting from this Agreement.\n\n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 Licences\n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Annex, the licence issued by Mauritania to European Union vessels shall be equivalent to the fishing authorisation provided for by the European Union legislation in force.\n\n\nThe two parties agree to promote the introduction of an electronic licence system.\n\n\n1.Licence applications\n\n\n1.1.The European Union shall submit to the ministry lists of the vessels, broken down by fishing category, wishing to engage in fishing activities within the limits specified in the fishing datasheets included in the Protocol, twenty (20) calendar days before the start of the period of validity of the licences requested. These lists shall be accompanied by the requisite documentation and proof of payment and be communicated preferably by electronic means. Licence applications failing to arrive within the deadline need not be processed.\n\n\n1.2.This documentation shall specify, for each fishing category:\n\n\n(a)the number of vessels,\n\n\n(b)for each vessel, its main technical characteristics as they appear in the fishing vessel register of the European Union;\n\n\n(c)fishing gears;\n\n\n(d)the amount of payments due, broken down by heading,\n\n\n(e)the number of Mauritanian seamen to be taken on board in accordance with Chapter IX of this Annex.\n\n\n1.3.During the renewal of a licence under this Protocol every two months, quarterly or yearly for a vessel whose technical characteristics have not been changed, the renewal application shall only be accompanied by proof of payment of the fees and the parafiscal charge.\n\n\n2.Documents required for licence applications\n\n\n2.1.On each vessel\u2019s first licence application, the European Union shall submit to the ministry a licence application form duly completed in respect of each vessel for which a licence is requested in accordance with the model in Appendix 3 to this annex. This form shall state, in particular, the number of Mauritanian fishermen taken on board in accordance with Chapter IX of this Annex.\n\n\n2.2.On a first licence application, the shipowner shall include the following documents with the application, preferably in electronic format:\n\n\n(a)a copy, certified by the flag State, of the international tonnage certificate specifying the tonnage of the vessel in GT as certified by recognised international bodies;\n\n\n(b)a recent (less than one year old) colour photograph certified by the competent authorities of the flag State showing a side view of the vessel in its current state, in which the name of the vessel appears and, where appropriate, the vessel\u2019s international radio call sign. If sent in electronic format, the photograph must have a minimum resolution of 72 dpi (1400 x 1050 pixels). If sent in paper format, it must have a minimum size of 15 x 10 cm.\n\n\n(c)the documents required for inclusion in the Mauritanian National Ship Register. Such inclusion shall not entail any registration fee. The inspection provided for in connection with inclusion in the National Ship Register is of a purely administrative nature.\n\n\n2.3.Any alteration to the tonnage of a vessel shall oblige the shipowner concerned to submit a copy, certified by the flag State, of the new GT tonnage certificate and any relevant supporting documents, in particular the copy of the application lodged by the shipowner with the competent authorities, the agreement of those authorities and the details of the changes made. Where the structure or external appearance of the vessel is changed, a new photograph certified by the competent authorities of the flag State must also be submitted.\n\n\n3.Eligibility to fish\n\n\n3.1.Applications for fishing licences shall be lodged only for those vessels for which the documents required under points 2.1 and 2.2 above have been sent.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.Each vessel wishing to engage in fishing activities under this Protocol must be entered in the European Union fishing vessels register and be eligible for fishing in the Mauritanian fishing zone. The vessel must not be listed as an IUU vessel.\n\n\n3.3.For a vessel to be eligible, neither the owner, the master nor the vessel itself must be prohibited from fishing in Mauritania. They must be in order vis-\u00e0-vis the Mauritanian authorities insofar as they must have met all prior obligations arising from their fishing activities in Mauritania.\n\n\n4.Issue of licences\n\n\n4.1.The ministry shall issue licences to the vessels following submission, by the shipowner\u2019s agent, of\u00a0individual proofs of payment for each vessel (receipt of payment issued by the Public Treasury), as specified in Chapter I, at least ten (10) calendar days before the start of their period of validity. \n\n\n4.2.The originals of the licences may be obtained from the offices of the ministry in Nouadhibou (Regional Maritime Directorate). A scanned photocopy of these originals shall be sent electronically by the ministry to the European Union.\n\n\n4.3.The licences also mention the period of validity, the vessel\u2019s technical characteristics, the number of Mauritanian seamen and the payment references of the fees.\n\n\n4.4.Vessels receiving a licence shall be entered on the list of vessels authorised to fish which shall be sent simultaneously and without delay to the Mauritanian coast guard and the European Union.\n\n\nThe European Union shall be notified of licence applications refused by the ministry. Where appropriate, the ministry shall provide a credit note against payments relating to such applications after deduction of the balance of any outstanding unpaid fines.\n\n\n4.5.A fishing licence must be held on board the vessel to which it was issued at all times and presented to the inspection authorities for inspection. On a transitional basis, for a maximum period of 30 calendar days after the date of issue of the licence, the vessel shall be authorised to keep a copy of this licence, provided that the ship is included in the list of authorised vessels referred to in Article 4.4. This copy shall therefore be considered to be equivalent to the original.\n\n\n5.Validity and utilisation of licences\n\n\n5.1.A licence shall be valid only for the period covered by the fee paid under the terms laid down in the Fishing Datasheet.\n\n\nLicences shall be issued for periods of two months for shrimp fishing and for three or twelve months for other categories. They shall be renewable.\n\n\nThe validity of the licences starts to run on the first day of the period requested.\n\n\nThe period of validity of licences shall be determined on the basis of annual calendar periods, from 1 January until 31 December. The first period of the Protocol shall start on the date of its provisional application and shall end on 31 December of the same year. The last period of the Protocol shall end at the end of its period of application. Licences may not start to run during one annual period and expire during the next.\n\n\nTuna seiners, pole-and-line tuna vessels and surface longliners holding fishing licences for neighbouring countries may indicate in their licence applications the country and species concerned and the period of validity of such licences to facilitate their multiple entries into and exits from the fishing zone.\n\n\n5.2.The issuing of a licence does not automatically mean the vessel will be present in the Mauritanian fishing zone during the period of validity of the licence.\n\n\n5.3.Licences are issued for a given vessel. They shall be non-transferable. However, in the event of the loss or prolonged immobilisation of a vessel due to a serious technical failure, the licence of the initial vessel shall be replaced by a licence for another vessel of the same fishing category, on condition that the tonnage authorised for that category is not exceeded.\n\n\n5.4.The owner of a vessel which has been damaged, or the owner\u2019s agent, shall return the cancelled fishing licence to the ministry.\n\n\n5.5.Additional adjustments in the amounts paid as a result of the replacement of the licence shall be effected before the replacement licence is issued.\n\n\n6.Technical inspection\n\n\n\n\n6.1.Once a year, and after any alteration in tonnage or changes to the fishing category necessitating the use of a different type of gear, all European Union vessels shall report to the port of Nouadhibou to undergo the inspections required by the legislation in force. Such inspections shall take place within 48 hours of the vessel\u2019s arriving in port.\n\n\nIn the case of tuna seiners, pole and line vessels and surface longliners, each vessel operating under the Agreement for the first time must be presented for the inspections required by the legislation in force. Such inspections may be carried out in a foreign port to be agreed. All expenses linked to such inspection shall therefore be borne by the shipowner.\n\n\n6.2.Once the technical inspection has been completed satisfactorily, the master of the vessel shall be issued with a certificate of conformity having the same period of validity as the licence, which shall be automatically extended, free of charge, in the case of vessels renewing their licence in the course of the year. This certificate must be kept on board at all times. It must also specify the transhipment capacity of pelagic vessels.\n\n\n6.3.The purpose of the technical inspection is to check the conformity of the vessel\u2019s technical characteristics and gear and to ensure that the provisions relating to its Mauritanian crew have been complied with.\n\n\n6.4.The cost of the inspection, at the rates laid down by Mauritanian law, shall be borne by the shipowner and communicated to the European Union. It may not be greater than the amount normally paid by other vessels for the same services. \n\n\n6.5.Failure to comply with the provisions of points 6.1 or 6.2 above shall entail automatic suspension of the fishing licence until the shipowner has met such obligations.\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Fees\n\n\n1.Fees \n\n\n1.1.Fees shall be calculated for each vessel under the conditions and on the basis of the annual rates laid down in the Fishing Datasheets included in the Protocol. The amounts of such licence fees shall include all related fees and taxes, with the exception of the parafiscal charge, port taxes and service charges. \n\n\n1.2.The fees shall be calculated by the ministry, taking into account the catches made during the period of validity of the licences, after deducting the advances paid for the issuing of those licences. \n\n\n1.3.The statement of fees shall be forwarded by the ministry to the vessel owners or to their agents within one month following the period of validity of the licences. A copy of the statement shall also be sent to the European Union at the same time.\n\n\n1.4.The fees shall be paid by transfer to one of the bank accounts referred to in paragraph 4 of Chapter I In the event of overpayment, the Public Treasury of Mauritania shall issue a credit note to the shipowner or the shipowner\u2019s agent, which may be deducted from a subsequent payment. \n\n\n1.5.In the event of a dispute concerning the amount of fees established, both Parties shall consult each other without delay, including within the Joint Committee if necessary, and verify the catch declarations and the calculation of the relevant charges.\n\n\n2.Fees in kind\n\n\n2.1.European Union shipowners of pelagic freezer trawlers and shrimp-fishing vessels (in the case of by-catches) engaged in fishing activities under this Protocol shall contribute to the policy of fish distribution to people in need, at the rate of 2\u00a0% of their pelagic catches which have been transhipped or unloaded following a voyage.\n\n\n2.2.The 2\u00a0% shall be calculated on the basis of all catches, regardless of species and irrespective of commercial value, and shall be added to the total allowable catch. Catches which fall under the fee in kind should reflect the species composition of the total catches held on board the vessel at the time of the transhipment of these 2\u00a0%. \n\n\nHowever, for vessels targeting horse mackerel and mackerel, the 2\u00a0% shall be levied on catches of horse mackerel (size L or otherwise size M) or otherwise on catches of sardinella (size L or otherwise size M). For vessels targeting sardine, the 2\u00a0% shall be levied in equal proportions on catches of horse mackerel and sardinella kept on board or otherwise on catches of sardine kept on board.\n\n\n2.3.Catches under the fee concerned will be handed over to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Distribution de Poisson (National Company for the Distribution of Fish). A form attesting to the receipt of this fee in kind is systematically drawn up and signed by a representative of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Distribution de Poisson, a copy of which is provided to the captain of the vessel. \n\n\n2.4.Catches falling under the fee in kind may be handed over by means of disembarking at a dock or transhipment. In the case of transhipment, the vessels used for landing such catches must be fully adapted to the operations required in order to ensure their smooth performance. The master of the pelagic vessel, in consultation with its agent and with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Distribution de Poisson, may choose the Mauritanian boat best suited to the performance of these operations. \n\n\n2.5.In the event of a manifest risk to or breach of the safety of the fishing vessel, the Mauritanian vessel or their crew, the captain of the fishing vessel may refuse to land the catches using the aforementioned Mauritanian vessel: he shall then refer the matter to the representative of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Distribution de Poisson, who shall assign another vessel.\n\n\n\n\n2.6.The landing of catches under the fee in kind must be planned and organised in such a way so as not to affect abnormally the smooth operation of the fishing vessel\u2019s activities.\n\n\n2.7.If there is insufficient storage capacity at the point where catches are landed, the captain of the fishing vessel shall be released from the obligation to land the fee in kind, completely and definitively for the relevant voyage. A certificate will then be issued by the representative of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Distribution de Poisson certifying that the fish could not be landed owing to a lack of storage space onshore. Catches not landed owing to insufficient storage capacity and kept on board must be deducted from the total allowable catch.\n\n\n2.8.The fee in kind specifically excludes any other form of imposed contribution. Under no circumstances may it give rise to a conversion in the form of a monetary equivalent nor may it be the subject of the constitution of a debt. \n\n\n2.9.Catches corresponding to the fee in kind are taken over by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Distribution de Poisson and passed to the people in need in accordance with Mauritanian legislation.\n\n\n2.10.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Distribution de Poisson shall draw up a report each year on the use of this fee in kind, its recipients, the quantities disposed of and the conditions for distributing these quantities. That report shall be examined by the Joint Committee.\n\n\n2.11.In the event of difficulty in implementing these provisions, both Parties shall consult each other, including within the Joint Committee, in order to share all relevant information concerning implementation and in order to identify the most appropriate solutions in order to address these difficulties.\n\n\n3.Parafiscal charge \n\n\n3.1.Under the decree establishing the parafiscal charge, the rates of this charge for industrial fishing vessels, payable in local currency, are as follows:\n\n\nFishing category: crustaceans, cephalopods and demersal species:\n\n\nTonnage (GT)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amount per quarter (MRO)\n\n\n<99\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a050\u00a0000\n100-200\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0100\u00a0000\n200-400\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0200\u00a0000\n400-600\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0400\u00a0000\n<600\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0600\u00a0000\n\n\nFishing category (highly migratory and pelagic):\n\n\nTonnage\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amount per month (MRO)\n\n\n<2\u00a0000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a050\u00a0000\n2\u00a0000-3\u00a0000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0150\u00a0000\n3\u00a0000-5\u00a0000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0500\u00a0000 \n5\u00a0000-7\u00a0000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0750\u00a0000 \n7\u00a0000-9\u00a0000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01\u00a0000\u00a0000 \n9\u00a0000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01\u00a0300\u00a0000\n\n\n3.2.With the exception of categories 4 and 5, the parafiscal charge shall be payable on the basis of a full quarter or multiple thereof, irrespective of whether a biological recovery period falls within that period.\n\n\n3.3.The exchange rate (MRO/EUR) to be used for payment of the parafiscal charge for a calendar year shall be the average rate for the previous year, as calculated by the Central Bank of Mauritania and transmitted by the ministry not later than 1\u00a0December of the year preceding the application thereof.\n\n\n3.4.A quarter shall consist of one of the three-month periods beginning 1\u00a0October, 1\u00a0January, 1\u00a0April or 1\u00a0July, except for the first and the last period of the Protocol.\n\n\n4.Specific conditions applicable to tuna vessels\n\n\n4.1.The catch declarations drawn up by each captain of a tuna vessel are processed and verified by the scientific institutes responsible for verifying catch data in the Member States, such as the IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppement), IEO (Instituto Espa\u00f1ol de Oceanograf\u00eda), INIAP (Instituto Nacional de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Agr\u00e1ria e das Pescas), with copies of all fishing logbooks being sent to the IMROP (Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Oc\u00e9anographiques et des P\u00eaches).\n\n\n4.2.For each tuna-fishing vessel the European Union shall draw up, on the basis of the catch reporting verified by the above scientific institutes, a final statement of fees owed by the vessel in respect of its annual season for the previous calendar year. \n\n\n\n\n4.3.The European Union shall notify this final statement to Mauritania and to the shipowner before 30\u00a0June of the year following the year in which the catches were made.

Daily catch declarations (FAR) shall be made available automatically and without delay to the FMC in Mauritania.\n\n\n5.The flag State and Mauritania shall ensure that their CSCPs have the necessary IT equipment and software to automatically transmit ERS data in XML format, available on the website of DG\u00a0Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, and shall have a backup procedure in place capable of saving and storing ERS data in a format which will be computer-readable for at least three years. \n\n\n6.Any change or update to this format shall be identified and dated and must be operational six months after its introduction.\n\n\n7.ERS data must be transmitted using the electronic means of communication operated by the European Commission on behalf of the EU, referred to as the DEH (Data Exchange Highway).\n\n\n8.The flag State and Mauritania shall each designate an ERS correspondent who will act as the point of contact. \n\n\n9.ERS correspondents shall be designated for a minimum period of six months. \n\n\n10.The FMC of the flag State and that of Mauritania shall notify each other of the contact details (name, address, telephone and telex numbers and emails) of their ERS correspondents, once the ERS system is operational. Any changes to the contact details of the ERS correspondent must be notified immediately.\n\n\nProducing and sending ERS data\n\n\n11.EU fishing vessels must:\n\n\n(a)draw up ERS data on a daily basis for each day spent in the Mauritanian fishing zone;\n\n\n(`)record, for each seine or trawl tow or set of a longline, the quantities of each species caught and retained on board as a target species and bycatch, or rejected;\n\n\n(a)for each species identified in the fishing authorization issued by Mauritania, also declare zero catches;\n\n\n(b)identify each species using its FAO alpha-3 code;\n\n\n(c)express the quantities in kilograms of live weight or, where necessary, the number of individual fish;\n\n\n(d)record by species in the ERS data the quantity transhipped and/or unloaded; \n\n\n(e)record, in the ERS data, a specific message declaring the quantities held on board of each species specified in the fishing authorisation issued by Mauritania at each entry into (COE) or exit from (COX) the Mauritania fishing zone;\n\n\n(f)provide daily transmissions of ERS data to the FMC of the flag State as referred to in paragraph 4, electronically and in XML format, at 23:59 hours UTC at the latest.\n\n\n12.The master is responsible for the accuracy of the ERS data recorded and sent.\n\n\n\n\n13.The FMC of the flag State shall provide the Mauritanian FMC automatically and as soon as possible with the ERS data, in the XML format referred to in paragraph 4.\n\n\n14.The Mauritanian FMC shall confirm that it has received the ERS data by means of a return message.\n\n\n15.It shall also handle all ERS data confidentially. \n\n\n\n\nFailure of the on-board ERS and/or transmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State\n\n\n16.The flag State shall without delay inform the master and/or owner of a vessel flying its flag, or their representative, of any technical failure of the ERS installed on board or breakdown in transmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State. \n\n\n17.The flag State shall inform Mauritania of the failure detected and the corrective measures taken. \n\n\n18.In the event of a breakdown in the on-board ERS, the master and/or owner shall ensure the ERS is repaired or replaced within ten\u00a0working days. If the vessel makes a call at a Mauritanian port within those 10 days, it may only resume fishing activity in the Mauritanian fishing zone once its ERS is in perfect working order, unless Mauritania authorises otherwise. \n\n\n19.Following a technical failure in its ERS, a fishing vessel may only leave port: \n\n\n(a)when the system is once again operational, to the satisfaction of the flag State, or \n\n\n(b)beforehand, if it receives authorisation from the flag State. In the latter case, the flag State shall inform Mauritania of its decision before the vessel leaves.\n\n\n20.Any EU vessel operating in the Mauritanian fishing zone using a defective ERS system shall transmit its ERS data, on a daily basis and by 23:59 hours UTC, to the FMC of the flag State by any other electronic communication means available.\n\n\n21.The ERS data referred to in paragraph 11 which could not be made available to Mauritania owing to a failure shall be transmitted to by the FMC of the flag State to the Mauritanian flag State by another mutually agreed form of electronic communication, This alternative transmission shall be considered priority, it being understood that it may not be possible to comply with the transmission deadlines usually applicable.\n\n\n22.If the Mauritanian FMC does not receive ERS data from a vessel for three consecutive days, Mauritania may instruct the vessel to immediately call at a port of its choosing in order to investigate, \n\n\nFMC failure \u2013 ERS data not received by Mauritanian FMC\n\n\n23.If a FMC does not receive ERS data, its ERS correspondent shall inform the ERS correspondent of the other FMC without delay and, if necessary, cooperate for as long as is needed to resolve the problem.\n\n\n24.The FMC of the flag State and the FMC of Mauritania shall mutually agree on the alternative electronic means to be used in order to transmit ERS data in the event of a FMC failure, and shall immediately inform one another of any changes.\n\n\n25.If the Mauritanian FMC reports that ERS data have not been received, the FMC of the flag State shall identify the causes of the problem and take appropriate measures in order to resolve it. The FMC of the flag State shall inform the Mauritanian FMC and the EU of the outcome of its analysis and measures taken within 24 hours. \n\n\n26.If more than 24\u00a0hours are required to resolve the problem, the FMC of the flag State shall transmit the missing ERS data to the Mauritanian CSCP without delay via the alternative electronic means referred to in point 24.\n\n\n27.Mauritania shall inform its competent inspection services so that EU vessels are not considered to be in breach of their obligation to transmit ERS data owing to the technical failure of a FMC.\n\n\nFMC maintenance\n\n\n\n\n28.Planned maintenance of an FMC (maintenance programme) which may affect the exchange of ERS data must be notified at least 72\u00a0hours in advance to the other FMC, indicating, where possible, the date and duration of the maintenance work. Information on unplanned maintenance work shall be sent to the other FMC as soon as possible.\n\n\n29.During the maintenance work, the provision of ERS data may be put on hold until the system is operational again. The relevant ERS data shall be made available immediately after the maintenance work has been completed.\n\n\n30.If the maintenance work takes more than 24\u00a0hours, the ERS data shall be sent to the other FMC using the alternative means of electronic communication referred to in point 24.\n\n\n31.Mauritania shall inform its competent inspection services so that EU vessels are not considered to be in breach of their obligation to transmit ERS data owing to the maintenance of a FMC.\n\n\nAPPENDIX 11\u00a0\n\n\nREPORT OF THE SCIENTIFIC OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\nName of observer: .............................................................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVessel: .............................................

The programme will then be approved jointly by the Joint Committee. With a view to ensuring this approval, the Joint Committee shall ensure that the funds allocated to the various projects and their distribution year on year are consistent with the nature of these projects and the conditions and restrictions relating to their implementation.\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Monitoring indicators and impact indicators \n\n\n\n\u2022 Monitoring indicators\n\n\n\nThe implementation unit referred to in Article 3 of the Protocol shall identify, for each project included in the programming, a monitoring indicator, by specifying the end objective, the target to be achieved at the end of each year (N+1, 2, 3) and an amount assigned to this indicator per year as a proportion of the annual tranche paid under the sectoral aid. The indicator must be quantitatively verifiable.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Indication of the impact on the Mauritanian fishing sector\u00a0\n\n\n\n The implementation unit referred to in Article\u00a03 of the Protocol will communicate for each project included in its programming a series of indicators showing the impact on the fisheries sector. These indicators are based on statistical data, whether publicly available or not, which are verifiable in quantitative or qualitative terms, and are presented for the purpose of assessing the likely economic and social impact of each project funded by the sectoral support. \n\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annual programming and reporting\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Article\u00a03 of the Protocol, the sectoral support is to be the subject of an annual programme, ongoing monitoring and annual reporting of results.\n\n\n\n\n\nPursuant to Article\u00a03 (paragraph\u00a03.2) of the Protocol, the implementation unit shall forward, by 31\u00a0December each year, a progress report on the projects implemented in the past year and the programme for the next year, using the standard model contained in this Annex. The report is to include in particular: \n\n\n\n\u2022 A reminder of the programming for year N of the sectoral support with the objectives for completed year N, for each project; \n\n\n\n\u2022 Indicators of results and targets set, reached and otherwise, stating the difficulties identified and the corrective measures taken and the use made of the tranche paid by the EU;\n\n\n\n\u2022 An assessment of the annual tranche to be transferred by the EU on the basis of the amount to be paid for each indicator achieved. For each objective established for each project and achieved during year N, a portion of the annual allocation as stated in the annual programming;\n\n\n\n\u2022 A description of the annual programming for year N+1 and an update of the multiannual programme. \n\n\n\nNo later than 30 days after sending, the progress report for year N and the programme for year N+1 will be the subject of joint approval by the Joint Committee. If a Joint Committee meeting cannot be held during this time, the approval may be given by written procedure, by means of an exchange of letters.  \n\n\n\nBoth parties are to encourage joint technical missions, which may be organised at the request of either party, for the purpose of providing any additional information necessary to ensuring the effective management of funds. \n\n\n\n7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arrangements for transferring the sectoral support by the European Union\n\n\n\nOnce the programming for year N+1 has been approved, the European Union will transfer the tranche of sectoral support. The arrangements for the European Union transferring tranches of sectoral support will follow a procedure based on the results of the implementation of projects, such as, for example:\n\n\n \n\n\n(i) The amount of sectoral support transferred during the first year of the Protocol corresponds to the amount approved by the Joint Committee in the multi-annual programming and annual programming;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Tranches of the sectoral support for subsequent years will be transferred as follows: \n\n\n\n\u2022 Full transfer: 100% of the annual funds (EUR X million) for year N+1 is transferred by the European Union if all monitoring indicators for each project, as established in the annual programme, have been achieved for year N. \n\n\n\n\u2022 Part transfer: For a given project, if a monitoring indicator has not been achieved in its entirety, the transfer for year N + 1 shall correspond to the sum of (i) a percentage reflecting the degree to which the indicator has been achieved and (ii) the portion of the annual allocation for sectoral support allocated to the project concerned. The percentage indicating the degree to which the indicator has been achieved corresponds to the ratio between (i) the level of the indicator actually performed and (ii) the target level of the indicator to be achieved during the year concerned. The non-transferred balance of the proportion of the annual allocation earmarked for the project may be transferred within a period of no more than six months after the initial date of the release of funds if the result indicator set for year N has been achieved in full. Otherwise, the non-transferred balance of the proportion of the annual allocation earmarked for the project will be carried over to the review exercise for the next year.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022 No transfer: if the extent to which the indicator of a project has been achieved is not stated or justified in the progress report, the proportion of the annual allocation for the project in question cannot be the subject of a transfer by the EU for year N+1. The nontransferred balance of the annual allocation earmarked for the project may be the subject of a subsequent transfer no more than six months after the initial date of the release of funds if the result indicator set for year N has been achieved in full.\n\n\n\n(iii) At the time of the approval of the programming for year N + 1, the Joint Committee will take account of the actual level of use in year N of the annual allocations for each of the projects. \n\n\n\n(iv) Where circumstances beyond the control of the project promoter have disrupted the implementation as originally planned, the Joint Committee may decide, when approving the programming for the year N + 1, to apply a level of transfer which is different from that which would result from applying the rules referred to in paragraph (ii), in exceptional cases and where adequate justification is provided by the project promoter.\n\n\n\n8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Review and suspension\n\n\n\nIn case of difficulties in the implementation of the provisions of this Annex and Article 3 of the Protocol, the two parties will discuss as soon as possible any corrective measures to overcome the obstacles.\n\n\n\nIn the event of non-compliance with the rules laid down in this Annex and Article\u00a03 of the Protocol, the two parties shall discuss as soon as possible the corrective measures to be taken in order to ensure compliance with the implementation of the sectoral support. Where appropriate, the European Union reserves the right to suspend any further payment in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol. \n\n\n\n9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Visibility\n\n\n\n\n\nMauritania will ensure the visibility of the measures implemented with financial support. To this end, the beneficiaries shall coordinate with the Delegation of the European Union at Nouakchott their work on implementing the visibility guidelines defined by the European Commission. In particular, each project shall be subject to a clause ensuring visibility for the support of the European Union, notably through use of the logo (EU flag).
