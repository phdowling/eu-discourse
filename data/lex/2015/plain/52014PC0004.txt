It is also intended\r\nto incorporate certain of the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004\r\nand in those Directives, with the necessary adaptions. However, the breeding of\r\nanimals is not intended to fall within its scope.\nIt was thus necessary to include provisions on\r\nofficial controls on breeding animals in the proposed Regulation of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council on the zootechnical and genealogical conditions\r\nfor trade in and imports from third countries of breeding animals and their\r\ngerminal products.\nHowever, the rules hereby proposed mirror those\r\nlaid down in the Commission proposal for a new Regulation on official controls\r\nthat is currently discussed in the European Parliament and in the Council. In\r\norder to prevent inconsistencies between the two texts and to ensure a\r\nharmonised approach in the field of controls, the Commission will closely\r\nfollow the evolution of the discussions on the two texts, and will make the\r\nnecessary proposals in due time in order to ensure that the provisions on\r\nofficial controls in the field of zootechnics are included in the forthcoming\r\nRegulation on official controls.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nFor legal clarity and certainty and pending the\r\nrepeal of Directives 89/608/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 91/496/EEC by the new\r\nRegulation referred to in recital 5 of this Directive, it is necessary to\r\ndelete the references to \"zootechnical\" from Directives 89/608/EEC,\r\n90/425/EEC and 91/496/EEC.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nNone.\n2014/0033 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF
