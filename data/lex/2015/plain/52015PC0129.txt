This Directive served two main purposes: avoiding\r\ndistortions to the movement of capital and allowing effective taxation of\r\ninterest payments made from paying agents established in one Member State to\r\nindividuals resident in another Member State. The Savings Directive facilitates\r\nthe taxation of this type of interest payment in accordance with the laws of\r\nthe Member State of residence of the individual receiving the savings income,\r\nby way of requesting automatic exchange of information on the interest payments\r\nbeing made to those individuals. The provisions of the Directive became\r\napplicable on 1 July 2005, were extended to Bulgaria and Romania as an effect\r\nof the accession of these countries on 1 January 2007, and to Croatia as an\r\neffect of the accession of this country on 1 July 2013.\nThe Directive was the result of the\r\nPresidency Conclusions of the European Council of 19-20 June 2000, when Member\r\nStates agreed that, in order to implement the principle that all citizens\r\nshould pay tax due on all their savings income, exchange of information, \u201con as\r\nwide a basis as possible\u201d, shall be the ultimate objective of the EU in line\r\nwith international developments.\nThe Directive, as adopted in 2003, covered\r\nindividuals\u2019 savings income resulting from debt claims (either classical\r\ninterest income or capital gains on debt securities) received either directly\r\nor through investment funds, or through some other intermediary untaxed\r\nentities. It introduced provisions on the automatic exchange of information on\r\nthis savings income paid by paying agents established in one Member State to\r\nindividuals resident in another Member State. All Member States except Belgium,\r\nLuxembourg and Austria immediately introduced systems for reporting information\r\nautomatically. Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria were allowed during a\r\ntransitional period to levy a withholding tax instead of providing information,\r\nat a rate of 15 % for the first three years following the entry into force\r\nof the Directive (until 30 June 2008), at a rate of 20 % for the following\r\nthree years (until 30 June 2011), and at a rate of 35 % thereafter. The\r\nrules stipulated that 75 % of the revenue from this withholding tax be\r\ntransferred to the investor\u2019s Member State of residence. Belgium decided to\r\nstop applying the transitional withholding tax as of 1 January 2010 and to\r\nexchange information in the same way as other Member States. Luxembourg has\r\ndone the same as of 1 January 2015.\nEquivalent measures to those of the Savings\r\nDirective have been applied, from 1 July 2005, in five non-EU European\r\ncountries, including Switzerland, in regard to savings income paid there to EU\r\nresident individuals. Measures identical to those of the Directive have been\r\napplied, from the same date, in ten dependent or associated territories of EU\r\nMember States (twelve following the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles)\r\nthrough the implementation of bilateral agreements that each of these\r\njurisdictions signed with each of the Member States. Following\r\nSaint-Barth\u00e9lemy\u2019s change of status, France has undertaken that\r\nSaint-Barth\u00e9lemy will apply both the current and future provisions of both the\r\nSavings Directive and the Directive on Administrative Cooperation.\nFollowing the first review of the Savings\r\nDirective, the Commission proposed a number of amendments in November 2008,\r\nwith a view to closing existing loopholes and more effectively preventing tax\r\nevasion. The proposed amendments sought to improve the Directive by\r\nstrengthening measures to ensure that interest payments were subject to\r\ntaxation. The scope of the provisions on intermediate structures was therefore\r\nextended. The proposal also extended the scope of the Directive to income from\r\ninstruments equivalent to debt instruments, i.e. innovative financial products\r\nand certain life insurance products. The amendments were adopted by the Council\r\nunder Directive 2014/48/EU of 24 March 2014[1]\r\n(the Amending Savings Directive). Article 2 of this Directive stipulates that\r\nMember States must adopt and publish the laws, regulations and administrative\r\nprovisions necessary to comply with the Directive by 1 January 2016. Member\r\nStates would be obliged to apply these provisions from 1 January 2017.\nWhile asking the Council to proceed to the\r\nformal adoption of the Amending Savings Directive, the European Council of 21\r\nMarch 2014 concluded that the Global Standard being developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shall be the method for automatic exchange of information\r\nthat the EU will apply within its borders. The European Council did so by\r\ninviting the Council to ensure that, with the further adoption by the end of\r\n2014 of an amended text for the Directive on Administrative Cooperation, EU law\r\nis fully aligned with the new global standard. \nOn 12 June 2013, the Commission had\r\nactually proposed amendments to Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative\r\nCooperation in the field of Taxation. The main purpose of the proposal was to\r\nprovide Member States with an appropriate EU-level legal basis for implementing\r\nthe global standard on automatic exchange of information (the global standard)\r\nbeing developed by the OECD. The scope of the proposed Amending Directive is\r\nvery broad, as it covers all types of financial products (with specific\r\nexemptions) held directly or indirectly by individuals or by \u201cnon-public\u201d\r\nentities. This Amending Directive was adopted on 9 December 2014 \u2013 Council\r\nDirective 2014/107/EU[2] (the Amending Directive on Administrative Cooperation). Article 2\r\nof this Directive stipulates that Member States must adopt and publish the\r\nlaws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the\r\nDirective by 31 December 2015. They are required to apply these provisions from\r\n1 January 2016 and to start exchanging information by September 2017. Austria\r\nreceived a derogation under Article 2(2), on the grounds of structural\r\ndifferences, and is allowed to start applying the Directive up to one year\r\nlater than other Member States. At the time of adopting the Directive, Austria\r\nannounced that it would not make full use of the derogation. It would start\r\nexchanging information by September 2017 on a limited set of accounts (only new\r\naccounts opened during the period 1 October 2016 - 31 December 2016), while\r\nmaking use of the derogation for other accounts.\nThe last subparagraph of the new Article\r\n8(3a) introduced by the Amending Directive on Administrative Cooperation states\r\nclearly that the provisions contained in this paragraph (paragraph 3a) will\r\ntake precedence over the revised Savings Directive. Since there is significant\r\noverlap between the two Directives, there would thus be only a few cases where\r\nthe revised Savings Directive would still apply.\nThis small number of cases arises in\r\nessence for three reasons. Firstly, the Amending Directive on Administrative\r\nCooperation sets reporting obligations on Financial Institutions that are\r\nentities as defined therein. Therefore, unlike the Savings Directive, it does\r\nnot set reporting obligations on individuals (e.g. brokers) that may pay\r\nfinancial income. Secondly, there are some exemptions in the Amending Directive\r\non Administrative Cooperation with regard to certain pension/retirement funds,\r\ncredit card issuers, regulated tax-favoured accounts and similar financial\r\ninstitutions and products that pose a low risk for tax evasion. Thirdly, the\r\npaying agent on receipt approach in Article 4(2) of the Savings Directive\r\ncovers also interest paid by a non-participating jurisdiction through a Member\r\nState\u2019s paying agent on receipt; in addition, the look-through approach under\r\nArticle 2(3) and enhanced paying agent on receipt approach under Article 4(2)\r\nof the revised Savings Directive cover also income paid through\r\n\"Active\" non-financial entities, as long as they are tax-exempt.\r\nThese residual cases exist as a result of slight differences in the approaches\r\ntaken by the Savings Directive and the Amending Directive on Administrative\r\nCooperation, and specific exemptions included in the two Directives. The effect\r\nof these residual cases being covered or not by the EU legislation under\r\ndiscussion here is marginal in the context of the overall scope of the Amending\r\nDirective on Administrative Cooperation. The international application of the\r\nglobal standard and the close supervision of its implementation by the Global\r\nForum on Transparency and Exchange of Information will minimise any risks\r\nassociated with these residual cases.\nIt follows that the benefit to be gained\r\nfrom keeping the two legal instruments operating in parallel would be minimal.\r\nWhile the above-mentioned carve-out provided for by the new Article 8(3a)\r\nintroduced by the Amending Directive on Administrative Cooperation could have\r\nserved to avoid the reporting under the Savings Directive in most of the cases,\r\nthe co-existence of two legal instruments with a substantially similar scope is\r\nnot in line with better regulation principles and the interest of clarity and\r\nlegal certainty. In addition, keeping the two legal systems operating in\r\nparallel would mean having two sets of similar, but not fully aligned, customer\r\ndue diligence rules, procedures and reporting systems \u2014 both in respect of\r\nfinancial institutions reporting to competent authorities, and of competent\r\nauthorities exchanging information between themselves. The cost of this would\r\ngreatly outweigh the benefits of the additional coverage given by the Savings\r\nDirective.\nIn order to make sure that there is only\r\none applicable standard for automatic exchange of information within the EU,\r\nand to avoid situations where two standards are applied in parallel, the\r\nSavings Directive should be repealed. \nIn order not to leave any gaps in the\r\nreporting, the repeal of the Savings Directive needs to be well coordinated\r\nwith the timing of the application of the Amending Directive on Administrative\r\nCooperation, taking particular account of the extension of the timeline for\r\napplication granted to Austria.\nSince the objective of this proposal for a\r\nDirective, namely the repeal of the Savings Directive with the temporary\r\nexceptions necessary to protect the acquired rights and to take account of the\r\nderogation allowed to Austria under the Amending Directive on Administrative\r\nCooperation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can\r\ntherefore, by reason of the uniformity and effectiveness required, be better\r\nachieved at the level of the Union, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance\r\nwith the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the\r\nEuropean Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out\r\nin that Article, this proposal for a Directive does not go beyond what is\r\nnecessary in order to achieve that objective.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe European Council Conclusions of 21\r\nMarch 2014 and the Economic and Financial Affairs Council Statement of 9\r\nDecember 2014 demonstrate Member States clear preference for having only one\r\nstandard for the automatic exchange of information on financial income. This\r\nstandard has now been fully implemented through the Amending Directive on\r\nAdministrative Cooperation.\nIn meetings of the Commission expert group\r\non the taxation of savings income, experts stressed the importance of having\r\none system by which information is reported automatically for the purpose of\r\ndirect taxation. They explained that the parties they represent \u2014 EU financial\r\ninstitutions and intermediaries \u2014 wished to avoid duplication of reporting\r\nsystems. The export group also reported that the sector was already introducing\r\nnew or adapting existing IT systems in preparation for US\u00a0 Foreign Account Tax\r\nCompliance Act (FATCA) reporting and emphasised the need for future EU\r\nlegislation on the automatic exchange of financial account information to be\r\naligned with the OECD global standard on automatic exchange of information\r\n(which is itself based on customer due diligence principles developed in\r\nFATCA), in order to reduce compliance and administrative burdens.\nAs outlined above, repealing the Savings\r\nDirective will have a very marginal effect, if any, on the effectiveness of\r\nautomatic exchange of information as resulting from the Amending Directive on\r\nAdministrative Cooperation and essentially constitutes a measure of better\r\nregulation. Consequently, no impact assessment has been prepared.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 1 enacts the repeal of the\r\nDirective. It coordinates the repeal with the application of the Amending\r\nDirective on Administrative Cooperation by Member States. \nArticle 1(1)(a) and Article 1(1)(b)\r\nencompass the core reporting and information exchange obligations foreseen in\r\nArticle 4(2) and, respectively, in Article 8 and Article 9 of the Savings Directive.\nArticle 1(1)(a) provides that economic\r\noperators and the Member States where those are established shall report and\r\nexchange the information that has been collected for 2015. That information\r\nrelates to paying agents on receipt under Article 4(2) of the Savings Directive\r\nestablished in other Member States, to be reported under the same deadline as\r\nforeseen in Article 9, \u201cwithin six months following the end of the tax year\u201d.\r\nThis deadline is 30 June 2016 for most Member States, but it is 5 October 2016\r\nin the case of the United Kingdom. The extension of the application is\r\ntherefore fixed to encompass also the United Kindom deadline. The timeline is\r\nleft open for any follow-ups and corrections after that date.\nArticle 1(1)(b) provides that economic operators\r\nand paying agents and the Member States where those are established shall\r\nreport and exchange the information that has been collected for 2015, as\r\nprovided in Article 9 \u201cwithin six months following the end of the tax year\u201d,\r\nwhich is 30 June 2016 for most Member States, but it is 5 October 2016 in the\r\ncase of the United Kingdom. The extension of the application is therefore fixed\r\nto 5 October 2016 with a view to encompass also the United Kindom deadline. The\r\ntimeline is left open for any complements of information and corrections needed\r\nafter that date.\nArticle 1(2) contains specific provisions\r\nto be implemented by Austria.\nAustria will apply the Amending Directive\r\non Administrative Cooperation with a delay that will in most cases be one year.\r\nNevertheless, at the time of the adoption of the Directive on 9 December 2014,\r\nAustria committed to exchanging information already in 2017, albeit only on a\r\nlimited set of accounts (only new accounts opened in the period 1 October 2016\r\n\u2013 31 December 2016), while retaining the derogation in other cases.\u00a0 Therefore,\r\nAustria will in general have to apply the Savings Directive for an additional\r\nyear, except for the limited set of accounts that will be reported in 2017\r\nunder the Directive on Administrative Cooperation. Unlike Luxembourg, Austria\r\nhas not indicated that it will apply automatic exchange of information under\r\nthe Savings Directive before the end of the transitional period indicated in\r\nArticle 10 therein. It is also not expected that the conditions for the end of\r\nthat transitional \nperiod will be fulfilled by the date of\r\napplication by Austria of the Amending Directive on Administrative Cooperation.\r\nTherefore, for the purposes of Article 1 paragraph 2 it is assumed that Austria\r\nwill continue to apply the transitional withholding tax under the Savings\r\nDirective during 2016, with the exception of the limited set of accounts that\r\nwill be reported by Austria in 2017 under the Amending Directive on\r\nAdministrative Cooperation. \nAccordingly, there is a reference in Article\r\n1(2)(a) to the obligations of Austria and the underlying obligations of paying\r\nagents established therein to transfer the withholding tax on interest payments\r\nwithheld in 2016, in accordance with Article 12 of the Savings Directive.\nAustria will also have to fulfil its\r\nobligations with regard to the reporting by its economic operators under the\r\nlast subparagraph of Article 4(2) of the Savings Directive, in cases where the\r\nentity receiving an interest payment from those economic operators and referred\r\nto in Article 11(5) of the same Directive has formally agreed to its name,\r\naddress and the total amount of interest paid to it or secured for it being\r\ncommunicated in accordance with the last subparagraph of Article 4(2) of that\r\nDirective. The relevant provision ensuring this is in Article 1(2)(b) of this\r\nProposal.\nIn addition, should Austria provide for the\r\nprocedure under Article 13(1)(a) of the Savings Directive, the obligations on\r\nAustria and the underlying obligations of the paying agents established therein\r\nto report under Chapter II of the Savings Directive would also have to be\r\nrespected. The relevant provision ensuring this is in Article 1(2)(c) of this\r\nProposal.\nAll the obligations foreseen in Article\r\n1(2) should be fulfilled within six months of the end of the tax year in\r\nAustria, i.e. 30 June 2017. \nFor the limited set of accounts that will\r\nbe subject to customer due diligence as of 1 October 2016 and will be reported\r\nin 2017 under the Directive on Administrative Cooperation as amended by the\r\nrelated Amending Directive, an exception to the extension of the application of\r\nthe Savings Directive is added in Article 1(3).\nThe 27 Member States that will apply the\r\nAmending Directive on Administrative Cooperation as of 1 January 2016 will\r\nstill have to grant to beneficial owners resident therein the certificate under\r\nArticle 13(2) of the Savings Directive. Since the last date where that\r\ncertificate would be applicable is the last date where Austria would apply\r\nwithholding tax under the Savings Directive, the date is fixed in Article\r\n1(1)(c) of this Proposal at 31 December 2016. As Luxembourg will apply the\r\nSavings Directive without levying a withholding tax as of 1 January 2015,\r\nAustria is the only Member State that will apply the withholding tax under the Savings\r\nDirective in 2015 and 2016.\nThe rules for the elimination of any double\r\ntaxation that might result from the application of the transitional withholding\r\ntax levied under the Savings Directive would also have to extend beyond the\r\ndate of application of the Amending Directive on Administrative Cooperation.\r\nSubject to the domestic rules in the specific Member State that is to provide\r\nthe credit or refund according to Article 14 of the Savings Directive, the\r\napplication of that provision may have to extend well beyond the last date when\r\nthe withholding will be applied, which is 31 December 2016 for the withholding\r\ntax levied in Austria (see Article 1(1)(d) of this Proposal). This is a\r\ntransitional measure protecting acquired rights of beneficial owners under\r\nArticle 14 of the Savings Directive with regard to their Member State of\r\nresidence.\nArticle 2 provides that the Directive shall\r\nenter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\r\nOfficial Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 3 provides that the Directive is\r\naddressed to the Member States.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal does not have any budgetary\r\nimplications. \n2015/0065 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\nrepealing Council Directive 2003/48/EC\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 115 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament, \nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee, \nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Building\r\non the consensus reached at the European Council of 20 June 2000 that relevant\r\ninformation should be exchanged for tax purposes on as wide a basis as\r\npossible, Council Directive 2003/48/EC[3]\r\nhas been applied in Member States since 1 July 2005 with the aim of enabling\r\nsavings income in the form of interest payments made in one Member State to\r\nbeneficial owners who are individuals resident in another Member State to be\r\nmade subject to effective taxation in accordance with the laws of the latter\r\nMember State, thus eliminating distortions in capital movements between Member\r\nStates incompatible with the internal market.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nworldwide aspect of the challenges posed by cross-border tax fraud and evasion\r\nis a major focus of concern at a global level and within the Union. Unreported\r\nand untaxed income considerably reduces national tax revenues. The European\r\nCouncil on 22 May 2013 welcomed ongoing efforts made in the G8, G20 and the\r\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to develop a\r\nglobal standard.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2011/16/EU[4]\u00a0 provides for mandatory\r\nautomatic exchange of certain information between Member States and for a\r\nstep-by-step extension of its scope into new categories of income and capital,\r\nfor the purpose of combating cross-border tax fraud and evasion. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 9 December 2014, the\r\nCouncil adopted Directive 2014/107/EU[5]\r\namending Directive 2011/16/EU that extended automatic exchange of information\r\nto a full range of income in accordance with the Global Standard released by\r\nthe OECD Council in July 2014 and ensured a coherent, consistent and\r\ncomprehensive Union-wide approach to the automatic exchange of financial\r\naccount information in the Internal Market.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2014/107/EU is\r\ngenerally broader in scope than Directive 2003/48/EC and provides that in cases\r\nof overlap of scope, Directive 2014/107/EU prevails. There are still residual\r\ncases in which only Directive 2003/48/EC would otherwise apply. These residual\r\ncases are a consequence of slight differences in approach between the two\r\ndirectives and of different specific exemptions. Where, in those limited\r\ninstances, the scope of Directive 2003/48/EC lies outside the scope of\r\nDirective 2014/107/EU, the relevant provisions of Directive 2003/48/EC would\r\ncontinue to apply, resulting in dual reporting standards within the Union. The\r\nminor benefits of retaining such dual reporting would be outweighed by the\r\ncosts.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 21 March 2014, the\r\nEuropean Council invited the Council to ensure that relevant Union law is fully\r\naligned with the new single Global Standard of automatic exchange of\r\ninformation developed by the OECD. In addition, when adopting Directive\r\n2014/107/EU, the Council\u00a0 invited the Commission to present a proposal to\r\nrepeal Directive 2003/48/EC and to coordinate the repealing of that Directive\r\nwith the date of application set forth in Article 2 of Directive 2014/107/EU\r\nwith due regard to the derogation provided therein for Austria. Therefore,\r\nDirective 2003/48/EC should continue to apply to Austria during an additional\r\none-year period. In the light of the position taken by the Council, the repeal\r\nof Directive 2003/48/EC would be needed in order to avoid dual reporting\r\nobligations and to save costs both for tax administrations and economic\r\noperators.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under Article 2 of Directive 2014/48/EU[6] amending Directive 2003/48/EC, Member\r\nStates would have to adopt and publish, by 1 January 2016, the laws,\r\nregulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with that\r\nDirective. They would have to apply those provisions as of 1 January 2017. With\r\nthe repeal of Directive 2003/48/EC, Directive\r\n2014/48/EU would no longer have to be transposed.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure the seamless\r\ncontinuation of automatic reporting of financial account information, the\r\nrepeal of Directive 2003/48/EC should enter into effect on the same day as the\r\ndate of application set forth in Article 2 of Directive 2014/107/EU.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding the repeal\r\nof Directive 2003/48/EC, information gathered by paying agents, economic\r\noperators and by Member States until the date of the repeal should be processed\r\nand transferred as originally envisaged and obligations which arose prior to\r\nthat date should be met.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nrelation to withholding tax levied under the transitional period referred to in\r\nArticle 10 of Directive 2003/48/EC, Member States\r\nshould, in order to protect the acquired rights of beneficial owners, continue\r\nto give credit or refunds as originally envisaged and should issue certificates\r\non request which would enable beneficial owners to ensure that withholding tax\r\nis not levied.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Account should be taken of\r\nthe fact that, in view of structural differences, Austria has been allowed a\r\nderogation under Article 2(2) of Directive 2014/107/EU with a maximum delay of\r\none year. On the adoption of that Directive, Austria announced that it would\r\nnot make full use of the derogation. Instead, Austria will exchange information\r\nby September 2017, albeit on a limited set of accounts, while retaining the\r\nderogation in other cases. Therefore, specific provision should be made to\r\nensure that Austria and the paying agents and economic operators established\r\ntherein continue to apply the provisions of Directive 2003/48/EC during the\r\nperiod of derogation, except for those accounts which have been made subject to\r\nDirective 2014/107/EU amending Directive 2011/16/EU.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects the\r\nfundamental rights and observes the principles which are recognised in\r\nparticular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\r\nincluding the right to the protection of personal data, and nothing in this\r\nDirective shall reduce or eliminate those rights.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nDirective, namely the repeal of Directive 2003/48/EC with the temporary\r\nexceptions necessary to protect the acquired rights and to take account of the\r\nderogation allowed to Austria under Directive 2014/107/EU, cannot be\r\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the\r\nuniformity and effectiveness required, be better achieved at the level of the\r\nUnion, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of\r\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union. In\r\naccordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article,\r\nthis Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that\r\nobjective.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2003/48/EC should\r\ntherefore be repealed,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2003/48/EC is\r\nrepealed with effect from 1 January 2016.\nHowever, the\r\nfollowing obligations under Directive
