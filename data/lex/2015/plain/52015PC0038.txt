However, oils in which the weight of aromatic\r\nconstituents exceeds that of non-aromatic are to be classified since\r\nApril 2013 under heading 2707 (CN 2707 99 9) and are, thus, subject to a\r\nduty rate of 1,7 %.\nThe technical characteristics of the products\r\nconcerned are listed in the Explanatory Notes to the Combined Nomenclature[1] of subheadings 2707 99\r\n91 and 2707 99 99; those notes were amended in April 2013 in order to clarify\r\nthe scope of the products covered by heading 2710 and to remove a contradiction\r\nbetween the Explanatory Notes to the Combined Nomenclature and Note 2 to\r\nChapter 27. Therefore, such oils are classified under different subheadings\r\nbecause of the proportion of aromatic constituents they contain and,\r\nconsequently, obtain different tariff treatment. As a consequence, those oils\r\nwere subject to a duty of 1,7% since April 2013. \nHowever, in the interest of the economic\r\noperators, both such oils, independently of their aromatic content, when they\r\nare intended to undergo a 'specific process' as defined in the Additional Note\r\n5 to Chapter 27 (vacuum distilation, cracking, reforming and etc.) and subject\r\nto end-use procedure laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93[2], should autonomously be\r\nexempted from customs duty, provided the process has taken place. It also has\r\nto be noted that, since 1 July 2014, a temporary suspension of the autonomous\r\ncommon customs tariff duties for these products has been granted by Council\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1387/2013 of 17 December 2013[3].\r\n\nHence, this draft aims at proposing the\r\nsame tariff treatment for the same categories of products, independently of\r\ntheir respective classification at the date of the publication of the above\r\nmentioned Explanatory Note to the Combined Nomenclature, in order to provide a fair\r\ntreatment for all economic operators and to avoid a gap in the duty free\r\ntreatment of such products which they enjoyed since 1968.\nThe attached proposal is considered to be a\r\nbalanced approach taking into account the legal context and the interests of the\r\ndifferent stakeholders, as it is providing, without any interuption, the same\r\ntariff treatment over the times.\nThe proposal is in line with the Union's external trade and industry policies. \nIn the light of the foregoing it is\r\nproposed to amend Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 accordingly.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Tariff and Statistical Nomenclature\r\nSection of the Customs Code Committee (CN sector) was consulted on 23 May 2014\r\nand on 17-18 July 2014.\nThe Tariff and Statistical Nomenclature\r\nSection of the Customs Code Committee (Agriculture/Chemistry sector) was\r\nconsulted on 4-6 June 2014.\nThe Economic Tariff Questions Group was\r\nconsulted on 19-21 May 2014, 18 June 2014 and on 14-15 July 2014.\nStakeholders have already asked for the\r\nsuspension of the autonomous common customs tariff duties for these products which\r\nwas granted by Council Regulation (EU) No 722/2014. The aim of the present\r\nregulation is to allow the repayment of duties paid between April 2013 and June\r\n2014.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis of this proposal is Article\r\n31 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe subsidiarity principle does not apply,\r\nas the proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union.\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle given that, as foreseen in the Treaty, it promotes\r\ntrade between Member States and third countries and balances the commercial\r\ninterests of economic operators without changing the EU WTO schedule.\nBy virtue of Article 31 of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union the autonomous tariff rate is fixed by\r\nthe Council acting by qualified majority on the basis of a Commission proposal.\r\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nIt is difficult to estimate the loss of own\r\nresources involved because of the lack of detailed statistics on imports of\r\nthese products during the period when they were not exempted from duties. Loss\r\nof revenue in Traditional Own Resources is estimated to be in the range of 29,4\r\nMillion Euros on an annual basis (based on the import statistics under the\r\nconcerned TARIC code during July-August 2014). For the period of 15 months\r\n(between 04/04/2013 and 31/06/2014), the amount is estimated to be in a range\r\nof 36,7 Million Euros having in mind that no duties were paid untill 04/04/2013\r\nand that no duties are paid since 01/07/2014.\n2015/0024 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non the suspension of customs duties\r\napplicable to imports of certain heavy oils and other similar products \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Combined\r\nNomenclature laid down in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87[4], under heading 2710,\r\ncustoms duties are suspended, autonomously, on certain oils for which the\r\nweight of non-aromatic constituents exceeds that of the aromatic constituents when\r\nthose oils are intended for undergoing specific processes, provided that those\r\nproducts are subject to the end-use procedure laid down in Commission\r\nRegulation (EEC) No 2454/93[5].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain oils and other\r\nproducts in which the weight of the aromatic constituents exceeds that of the\r\nnon-aromatic constituents were, until April 2013, also classified under heading\r\n2710, thus enjoying a duty free treatment for an indefinite period. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, since 4 April\r\n2013, those oils and other products have been classified under heading 2707, without\r\nany duty free treatment. With effect from 1 July 2014, Council Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 1387/2013[6]\r\ngranted them a temporary autonomous suspension of duties.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As, in the Union, there is\r\nno supply of such oils and other products in which the weight of the aromatic\r\nconstituents exceeds that of the non-aromatic constituents, that favourable tariff\r\ntreatment should have been applied without any interruption as long as those\r\nproducts were intended to undergo specific processes and the end-use procedures\r\nwere met.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, with a view to adequately\r\nensuring the benefit of the suspension of customs duties in respect of those\r\nproducts falling under CN code 2707 99 99, the suspension should apply with\r\nretroactive effect from 4 April 2013 to 30 June 2014, \nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nFrom 4 April 2013 to 30 June 2014, the\r\ncustoms duties on goods falling under CN code 2707 99 99 destined for use as\r\nrefinery feedstock to undergo one of the specific processes described in\r\nadditional note 5 to Chapter 27 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature laid\r\ndown in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 are autonomously suspended subject to the condition that the\r\nend-use procedures laid down in Articles 291 to 300 of Regulation (EEC) No\r\n2454/93 are met.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the\r\ntwentieth day following that of its publication in the Official\r\nJournal of the European Union. \nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at
