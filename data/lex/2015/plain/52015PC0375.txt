The Agreement established, on the basis of reciprocity, legally binding rights and obligations for the purpose of simplifying the visa issuing procedures for Armenian citizens.

According to paragraph 4 of this provision, the Committee establishes its rules of procedures.\n\n\nThe Rules of Procedure specify the organisational practicalities related to the Committee meetings and its work.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe Rules of Procedure annexed to this proposal for a Council Decision were agreed with the Armenian side during the first meeting of the Committee. On 10 November 2014, the Commission officially consulted the Visa Working Party on the draft Rules of Procedure for the EU-Armenia Visa Facilitation Joint Committee, which did not render any comments. The text of the Rules of Procedure was prepared on the basis of similar documents already adopted by the Commission in the context of other EU Visa Facilitation Agreements in force (in particular with Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia).\n\n\n\n3.
