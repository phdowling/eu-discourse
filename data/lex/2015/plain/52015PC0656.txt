According to Principle 11 of the European Statistics Code of Practice, European statistics are to meet the needs of users; priority needs are to be met and reflected in the work programmes for Eurostat and of the national statistical offices. Conversely, this means that statistical data that do not meet the needs of users should not be gathered.\n\n\nHC.1.2, HC.2.2, HC.3.2 \u2013 Data on day care (curative, rehabilitative, long-term):\n\n\nMedical providers in Liechtenstein only register data on their activities under the categories inpatient or outpatient care. The distinction between outpatient and day care is not common there is therefore no data available. However, day curative care (HC.1.2) is included in outpatient curative care (HC.1.3), day rehabilitative care (HC.2.2) is included in outpatient rehabilitative care (HC.2.3) and day long-term care (health) (HC.3.2) is included in outpatient long-term care (health) (HC.3.3).\n\n\nTherefore, the following adaptation is proposed:\n\n\n\u201cLiechtenstein is exempted from providing separate data on day curative care (HC.1.2), day rehabilitative care (HC.2.2) and day long-term care (health) (HC.3.2), which shall be included in the data provided on outpatient curative care (HC.1.3), outpatient rehabilitative care (HC.2.3) and outpatient long-term care (health) (HC.3.3), respectively.\u201d\n\n\n\nHF.2.3 \u2013 Enterprise financing schemes: \n\n\nInformation about enterprise financing schemes is not available in Liechtenstein. In addition health expenditure in enterprises represents a very small part of the total health expenditure, and the burden to collect this information is therefore disproportionate. Liechtenstein's exemption from providing data for HF.2.3 shall be subject to continuous reconsideration by the EEA Contracting Parties, on the basis of information provided by the Statistical Office of Liechtenstein which will inform Eurostat in case expenditure on enterprise financing schemes can no longer be considered negligible.\n\n\nTherefore, the following adaptation is proposed:\n\n\n\u201cLiechtenstein is exempted from providing data on enterprise financing schemes (HF.2.3). This exemption shall be subject to review by the EEA Joint Committee whenever figures provided by Liechtenstein demonstrate that the expenditure on enterprise financing schemes in Liechtenstein is no longer negligible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nArticle 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 concerning arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement provides that the Council establishes the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf on such Decisions, on a proposal from the Commission. \n\n\nThe Commission submits the Draft Decision of the EEA Joint Committee for adoption by the Council as the Union\u2019s position. The Commission would hope to be able to present it in the EEA Joint Committee at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\n2015/0299 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, in the EEA Joint Committee concerning an amendment to Annex XXI (Statistics)\nto the EEA Agreement\n(health care expenditure statistics)\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\u00a0338(1) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 of 28 November 1994\n2\n concerning arrangements for implementing the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 1(3) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Agreement on the European Economic Area\n3\n ('the EEA Agreement') entered into force on 1 January 1994.\n\n\n(2)Pursuant to Article 98 of the EEA Agreement, the EEA Joint Committee may decide to amend, inter alia, Annex XXI (Statistics) to the EEA Agreement.\n\n\n(3)Commission Regulation 2015/359/EU\n4\n is to be incorporated into the EEA Agreement. Information regarding day care and enterprise financing schemes as well as outpatient and day care is not available in Liechtenstein, it should therefore be exempted from providing this data.\n\n\n(4)Annex XXI (Statistics) to the EEA Agreement should therefore be amended accordingly. \n\n\n(5)The position of the Union within the EEA Joint Committee should therefore be based on the attached draft Decision,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position to be adopted, on behalf of the Union, within the EEA Joint Committee on the proposed amendment to Annex XXI (Statistics) to the EEA\u00a0Agreement shall be based on the draft decision of the EEA\u00a0Joint Committee attached to this\u00a0Decision.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ L 62, 6.3.2015, p. 6.\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ L 305, 30.11.1994, p. 6. \n\n\n\n(3)\nOJ L 1, 3.1.1994, p. 3. \n\n\n\n(4)\nCommission Regulation (EU) 2015/359 of 4 March 2015 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards statistics on healthcare expenditure and financing (OJ L 62, 6.3.2015, p. 6).\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 16.12.2015\nCOM(2015) 656 final\nANNEX\nDECISION OF THE EEA JOINT COMMITTEE No .../2015of amending Annex XXI (Statistics) to the EEA Agreement\nto the\nCouncil Proposal\non the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union, within the EEA Joint Committee concerning an amendment to Annex XXI (Statistics) to the EEA Agreement  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX\n\n\nDECISION OF THE EEA JOINT COMMITTEE No .../2015\nof \namending Annex XXI (Statistics) to the EEA Agreement\n\n\n\n\nTHE EEA JOINT COMMITTEE,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (\u201cthe EEA Agreement\u201d), and in particular Article 98 thereof,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/359 of 4 March 2015 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards statistics on healthcare expenditure and financing\n1\n is to be incorporated into the EEA Agreement.\n\n\n(2)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annex XXI to the EEA Agreement should therefore be amended accordingly,\n\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe following point is inserted after point 18z5 (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 205/2014) of Annex XXI to the EEA Agreement:\n\n\n\u201818z6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a032015 R 0359: Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/359 of 4 March 2015 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards statistics on healthcare expenditure and financing (OJ L 62, 6.3.2015, p. 6).\n\n\nThe provisions of the Regulation shall, for the purposes of this Agreement, be read with the following adaptations:\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Liechtenstein is exempted from providing separate data on day curative care (HC.1.2), day rehabilitative care (HC.2.2) and day long-term care (health) (HC.3.2), which shall be included in the data provided on outpatient curative care (HC.1.3), outpatient rehabilitative care (HC.2.3) and outpatient long-term care (health) (HC.3.3), respectively.\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Liechtenstein is exempted from providing data on enterprise financing schemes (HF.2.3).
