PROCEDURES\n\n\n\n\nSECTION I\n\n\n\nARBITRATION PROCEDURE\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 3\n\n\n\nInitiation of the arbitration procedure\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the Parties have failed to resolve the dispute, the complaining Party may under the conditions of Article\u00a0137 of this Agreement, submit a request in writing for the establishment of an arbitration panel to the Party complained against as well as to the Stabilisation and Association Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The complaining Party shall state in its request the subjectmatter of the dispute and, as the case may be, the measure adopted by the other Party, or the failure to act, which it considers to be in breach of the provisions referred to in Article\u00a02.\n\n\n\nARTICLE 4\n\n\n\nComposition of the arbitration panel\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An arbitration panel shall be composed of three arbitrators.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Within ten days of the date of the submission of the request for the establishment of an arbitration panel to the Stabilisation and Association Committee, the Parties shall consult in order to reach an agreement on the composition of the arbitration panel.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that the Parties are unable to agree on the composition of the arbitration panel within the time frame referred to in paragraph\u00a02, either Party may request the chairperson of the Stabilisation and Association Committee, or his delegate, to select all three members by lot from the list established under Article\u00a015, one among the individuals proposed by the complaining Party, one among the individuals proposed by the Party complained against and one among the arbitrators selected by the Parties to act as chairperson.\n\n\n\nIn case the Parties agree on one or more of the members of the arbitration panel, any remaining members shall be appointed in accordance with the same procedure.\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The selection of the arbitrators by the chairperson of the Stabilisation and Association Committee, or his delegate, shall be done in the presence of a representative of each Party.\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The date of establishment of the arbitration panel shall be the date on which the chairperson of the panel is informed of the appointment in common agreement between the Parties of the three arbitrators or, as the case may be, the date of their selection in accordance with paragraph\u00a03.\n\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where a Party considers that an arbitrator does not comply with the requirements of the Code of Conduct referred to in Article\u00a018, the Parties shall consult and, if they so agree, replace the arbitrator and select a replacement pursuant to paragraph\u00a07. Where the Parties fail to agree on the need to replace an arbitrator, the matter shall be referred to the chairperson of the arbitration panel, whose decision will be final.\n\n\n\nWhere a Party considers that the chairperson of the arbitration panel does not comply with the Code of Conduct referred to in Article\u00a018, the matter shall be referred to one of the remaining members of the pool of arbitrators selected to act as chairperson, his name being drawn by lot by the chairperson of the Stabilisation and Association Committee, or his delegate, in the presence of a representative of each Party, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If an arbitrator is unable to participate in the proceeding, withdraws or is replaced pursuant to paragraph\u00a06, a replacement shall be selected within five days in accordance with the selection procedures followed to select the original arbitrator.

Under no circumstances should the ruling be issued later than\u00a0120 days from the date of the establishment of the panel.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In cases of urgency, including those involving perishable goods, the arbitration panel shall make every effort to issue its ruling within\u00a045 days from the date of the establishment of the panel. Under no circumstance should it take longer than\u00a0100 days from the date of the establishment of the panel. The arbitration panel may give a preliminary ruling within ten days of its establishment on whether it deems the case to be urgent.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ruling shall set out the findings of fact, the applicability of the relevant provisions of this Agreement and the basic rationale behind any findings and conclusions that it makes. The ruling may contain recommendations on the measures to be adopted for compliance with it.\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The complaining Party may withdraw its complaint by written notification to the chairperson of the arbitration panel, the Party complained against and the Stabilisation and Association Committee, at any time before the ruling is notified to the Parties and the Stabilisation and Association Committee.

Both parties shall endeavour to agree on the reasonable period of time.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If there is disagreement between the Parties on the reasonable period of time to comply with the arbitration panel ruling, the complaining Party may request the Stabilisation and Association Committee, within\u00a020 days of the notification made under paragraph\u00a01, to reconvene the original arbitration panel to determine the length of the reasonable period of time. The arbitration panel shall notify its ruling within\u00a020 days from the date of the submission of the request.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event of the original panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the procedures set out in Article\u00a04 shall apply. The timelimit for notifying the ruling remains\u00a020 days from the date of the panel\u2019s establishment.\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 8\n\n\n\nReview of any measure taken to comply \nwith the arbitration panel ruling\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Party complained against shall notify the other Party and the Stabilisation and Association Committee before the end of the reasonable period of time of any measure that it has taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that there is disagreement between the Parties concerning the compatibility of any measure notified under paragraph\u00a01 of this Article, with the provisions referred to in Article\u00a02, the complaining Party may request the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall explain why the measure is not in conformity with this Agreement. Once reconvened, the arbitration panel shall issue its ruling within\u00a045 days of the date of its reestablishment.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event of the original arbitration panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the procedures laid down in Article\u00a04 shall apply. The timelimit for notifying the ruling remains\u00a045 days from the date of the panel\u2019s establishment.\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 9\n\n\n\nTemporary remedies in case of noncompliance\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Party complained against fails to notify any measure taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling before the expiry of the reasonable period of time, or if the arbitration panel rules that the measure notified under Article\u00a08(1) is not in conformity with that Party's obligations under this Agreement, the Party complained against shall, if so requested by the complaining Party, present an offer for temporary compensation.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If no agreement on compensation is reached within\u00a030 days of the end of the reasonable period of time, or of the arbitration panel ruling under Article\u00a08 that a measure taken to comply is not in conformity with this Agreement, the complaining Party shall be entitled, upon notification to the other Party and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee, to suspend the application of benefits granted under the provisions referred to in Article\u00a02 of this Protocol at a level equivalent to the adverse economic impact caused by the violation. The complaining Party may implement the suspension ten days after the date of the notification, unless the Party complained against has requested arbitration under paragraph\u00a03.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Party complained against considers that the level of suspension is not equivalent to the adverse economic impact caused by the violation, it may request, in writing and before the expiry of the tenday period referred to in paragraph\u00a02, that the chairperson of the original arbitration panel reconvene the original arbitration panel. The arbitration panel shall notify its ruling on the level of the suspension of benefits to the Parties and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee within\u00a030 days of the date of the submission of the request. Benefits shall not be suspended until the arbitration panel has issued its ruling, and any suspension shall be consistent with the ruling of the arbitration panel.\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The suspension of benefits shall be temporary and shall be applied only until any measure found to violate this Agreement has been withdrawn or amended so as to bring it into conformity with this Agreement, or until the Parties have agreed to settle the dispute.\n\n\n\nARTICLE 10\n\n\n\nReview of any measure taken to comply \nafter the suspension of benefits\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Party complained against shall notify the other Party and the Stabilisation and Association Committee of any measure it has taken to comply with the ruling of the arbitration panel and of its request for an end to the suspension of benefits applied by the complaining Party.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Parties do not reach an agreement on the compatibility of the notified measure with this Agreement within\u00a030 days of the date of the submission of the notification, the complaining Party may request, in writing, that the chairperson of the original arbitration panel rule on the matter. Such request shall be notified simultaneously to the other Party and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee. The arbitration panel ruling shall be notified within\u00a045 days of the date of the submission of the request. If the arbitration panel rules that any measure taken to comply is not in conformity with this Agreement, the arbitration panel will determine whether the complaining party can continue the suspension of benefits at the original or at a different level. If the arbitration panel rules that any measure taken to comply is in conformity with this Agreement, the suspension of benefits shall be terminated.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event of the original arbitration panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the procedures laid down in Article\u00a04 shall apply.

Any information obtained in this manner shall be disclosed to both Parties and shall be open for comments by both of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterested parties shall be authorised to submit amicus curiae briefs to the arbitration panel under the conditions laid down in the Rules\u00a0of\u00a0Procedure referred to in Article\u00a018.\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 13\n\n\n\nInterpretation principles\n\n\n\nThe arbitration panel shall apply and interpret this Agreement in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law, including the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The arbitration panel shall not provide any interpretation of the EU acquis. The fact that a provision is identical in substance to a provision of the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union shall not be decisive in the interpretation of that provision.\n\n\n\nARTICLE 14\n\n\n\nArbitration panel decisions and rulings\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All decisions of the arbitration panel, including the adoption of the ruling, shall be taken by majority vote.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All rulings of the arbitration panel shall be binding on the Parties.

for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and of Kosovo*, of the other part \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nIn June 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Kosovo\n1*\u00a0on an EU-only Stabilisation and Association Agreement and adopted negotiating directives. There were three formal rounds of negotiations. The first round was held on 28 October 2013, the second on 27 November 2013 and the third on 2 May 2014. The chief negotiators initialled the draft text of the agreement on 25 July 2014. \n\n\nIn the attachment to this proposal, the Commission presents the initialled text of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo. The draft agreement is modelled on similar examples from the region, while taking into consideration the EU-only nature of the agreement and the specificities of Kosovo. In this context, it is important to underline that a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Kosovo can be signed in a way that respects the positions of Member States on the status of Kosovo.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThis proposal is the result of extensive negotiations between the Union, on one side, and Kosovo, on the other. The Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo provides for wide-ranging cooperation. It provides for a framework for political dialogue with Kosovo, both at a bilateral and regional level. The agreement promotes regional cooperation and Kosovo makes a strong commitment in the agreement to the normalisation of relations with Serbia. \n\n\nThe deepening of economic and trade relations is one of the main goals of the agreement. The agreement sets out the perspective of establishing a free trade area covering goods and services, consistent with the relevant WTO principles, after a transitional period in specific areas. The length of the transitional period was established during the negotiations in light of the state of preparation of Kosovo. \n\n\nThe agreement also includes provisions on establishment, supply of services, current payments and movement of capital. It includes the commitment by Kosovo to progressively harmonise its legislation with that of the EU, notably in key areas of the internal market. It establishes relations covering almost all areas of EU interest and provides a basis for wide-ranging cooperation. Overall, the cooperation is underpinned by EU financial and technical assistance, which provides Kosovo with the necessary support and assistance in the implementation of certain aspects of the agreement.\n\n\nDuring all stages of the negotiations, the negotiator regularly consulted the special committee designated by the Council (COWEB). \n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThe legal basis for the signature of this agreement is Article 217, in conjunction with Article 218(5) and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. \n\n\nFollowing the judgement in case C-377/12 Commission v. Council, the Commission considers that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement can be signed in one single act.\n\n\nA separate legal instrument applies to the European Atomic Energy Community.\n\n\n2015/0095 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and of Kosovo\n2*, of the other part \n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\u00a0\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 217, in conjunction with Article 218(5) and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) thereof,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas: \n\n\n(1)On 21 June 2013 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Kosovo for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The negotiations were successfully concluded by the initialling of the Agreement on 25 July 2014.\n\n\n(2)The EU and Kosovo have strong links and share values and a desire to strengthen those links and establish a close and lasting relationship based on reciprocity and mutual interest, which should allow Kosovo to further strengthen and extend its relations with the EU.\n\n\n(3)The \"First agreement on principles governing the normalisation of relations\" was reached on 19 April 2013 in the framework of the EUfacilitated dialogue.\n\n\n(4)The Agreement as initialled provides for the establishment of an association between the EU and Kosovo involving reciprocal rights and obligations, common actions and special procedure. The decision to sign this Agreement should therefore be based on the legal basis providing for the establishment of an association allowing the Union to enter into commitments in all areas covered by the Treaties.\n\n\n(5)This is an EU-only agreement. Next to setting up an association and providing for a framework of political dialogue, the agreement as initialled envisages the granting of rights and obligations in the area of common commercial policy. Furthermore, it contains provisions regarding various policies in which the Union shares competence with Member States and which fall within areas already largely covered by common Union rules. In addition, it provides for wide-ranging cooperation in various policy areas, including in justice and home affairs, which is limited to what is characteristic for technical, financial and economic cooperation. \n\n\n(6)The signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is without prejudice to Member\u00a0States' position on the status of Kosovo, which will be decided in accordance with their national practice and international law.\n\n\n(7)In addition, none of the terms,  wording or definitions used in this  Decision and the attached text of the Agreement, nor any recourse to all the necessary legal bases for the signature of the Agreement constitute recognition of Kosovo by the Union as an independent State nor does it constitute recognition by individual Member\u00a0States of Kosovo in that capacity where they have not taken such a step. It is appropriate, in that context that a declaration is issued in that regard by the Union at the moment of signing of this Agreement. \n\n\n(8)The signature of the Agreement as regards matters falling under the competence of the European Atomic Energy Community is subject to a separate procedure.\n\n\n(9)The Agreement should therefore be signed on behalf of the European Union, subject to its conclusion at a later date,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and of Kosovo*, of the other part, is hereby approved for the parts falling under the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union subject to the conclusion of the said Agreement. \n\n\nThe text of the Agreement to be signed is attached to this Decision.\n\n\nThe signature of the Agreement as regards matters falling under the competence of the European Atomic Energy Community is subject to a separate procedure.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe Declaration on behalf of the European Union attached to this Decision is hereby approved on behalf of the Union. \n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThe present Decision is without prejudice to Member States' and the Union's position on the status of Kosovo. \n\n\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nThe Council Secretariat General shall establish the instrument of full powers to sign the Agreement, subject to its conclusion, for the person(s) indicated by the negotiator of the Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on [\u2026].\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The
