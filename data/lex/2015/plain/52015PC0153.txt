Grounds for and objectives of the\r\nproposal\nThe Convention on a common transit\r\nprocedure (\"the Convention\") was concluded on 20 May 1987 between the\r\nEuropean Community and the EFTA countries.\nThe accession of the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia to the Convention involves the introduction of new\r\nlinguistic references concerning this country into the text of the Convention.\r\nFurthermore, guarantee documents where Contracting Parties to the Convention\r\nare mentioned need to be changed accordingly.\nThe purpose is to adopt the common EU\r\nposition on the draft Decision No 3/2015 of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on\r\ncommon transit amending the Convention. \n1.2. General context\nThe Convention establishes the measures\r\nfacilitating the movement of goods between the European Union, the Republic of\r\nIceland, the Kingdom of Norway, the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of\r\nTurkey.\nThe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\r\nwishes formally to accede to the Convention and has fulfilled the legal,\r\nstructural and information technology requirements, which are preconditions for\r\naccession.\nOnce all preconditions have been met by the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the country has been invited to\r\naccede and deposited its instrument of accession, it is necessary to amend the\r\nConvention with new linguistic references in the Macedonian language and the\r\nappropriate adaptations of guarantee documents. These amendments are to be\r\nintroduced and applied as of the first day the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia starts using the common transit system.\n1.3. Existing provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nThere are no existing provisions in the\r\narea of the proposal.\n1.4. Consistency with other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nNot applicable.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1. Consultation of interested parties\nConsultation methods, main sectors targeted\r\nand general profile of respondents\nConsultation with approval on the draft\r\nDecision No 3/2015 of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit amending\r\nthe Convention were carried out with the Member States within the Customs Code\r\nCommittee \u2013 Customs Status and Transit Section and with Contracting Parties to\r\nthe Convention within the\u00a0 EU-EFTA working group on \"Common transit\".\nSummary of responses and how they have been\r\ntaken into account\nFavourable opinion.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\n2.2. Impact assessment\nThe accession to the Convention can be seen\r\nwithin the framework of the pre-accession strategy of the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia to the European Union. It will lead to an alignment to\r\nthe 'acquis communautaire' in the transit area. The introduction of common\r\ntransit in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an alternative to the\r\nTIR procedure will bring further facilitation of transit, reduction in costs\r\nand a possible increase in trade.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1. Summary of the proposed action\nThe accession of the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia involves the introduction of new linguistic references\r\nconcerning this country, allowing the implementation of the common transit\r\nprocedure between the Contracting Parties.\nThis draft decision was approved by the\r\nCustoms Code Committee - Customs Status and Transit Section and by the EU/EFTA\r\nWorking Group on Common transit.\nThe Commission is invited to approve this\r\ndraft Decision by the written procedure, in order to submit it to the Council\r\nto establish a common position for its final adoption by the EU-EFTA Joint\r\nCommittee on common transit.\n3.2. Legal basis\nArticle 15 of the Convention of 20 May 1987\r\non a common transit procedure.\n3.3. Subsidiarity principle\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the European Union (common commercial policy) and therefore does\r\nnot deserve an examination with regard to the principle of subsidiarity\r\n(Article 5(3) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union).\n3.4. Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The form of proposed action is\r\nthe only one possible.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The form of proposed action\r\ndoes not involve any financing cost.\n3.5.
