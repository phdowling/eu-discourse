In 2013, total waste generation in the EU amounted to approximately 2.5 billion tons of which 1.6 billion tons were not reused or recycled and therefore lost for the European economy. It is estimated that an additional 600 million tons could be recycled or reused. By way of example, only a limited share (43%) of the municipal waste generated in the Union was recycled, with the rest being landfilled (31%) or incinerated (26%). The Union thus misses out on significant opportunities to improve resource efficiency and create a more circular economy. \n\n\nWith respect to waste management, the Union also faces large differences amongst its Member States. In 2011, while six Member States landfilled less than 3% of their municipal waste, 18 landfilled over 50%, with some exceeding 90%. This uneven situation needs to be redressed as a matter of urgency.\n\n\nThe proposals to amend Directive 2008/98/EC on waste\n1\n, Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste\n2\n, Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste\n3\n, Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles\n4\n, Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators\n5\n and Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment\n6\n form part of a Circular Economy Package which also includes a Commission Communication \"Closing the loop \u2013 An EU action plan for the Circular Economy\".\n\n\n1.2Grounds for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nRecent trends suggest that further progress on resource efficiency is possible and that it can bring major economic, environmental and social benefits. Turning waste into a resource is an essential part of increasing resource efficiency and closing the loop in a circular economy.\n\n\nThe legally binding targets in EU waste legislation have been a key driver to improve waste management practices, stimulate innovation in recycling, limit the use of landfilling, and create incentives to change consumer behaviour. Taking waste policy further can bring significant benefits: sustainable growth and job creation, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, direct savings linked with better waste management practices, and a better environment.\n\n\nThe proposal to amend Directive 2008/98/EC responds to the legal obligation to review the waste management targets in that Directive. The proposals which form part of the Circular Economy Package and amend the six Directives mentioned above build in part on the proposal that the Commission tabled in July 2014 and subsequently withdrew in February 2015. They are in line with the objectives of the Resource Efficiency Roadmap\n7\n and the 7th Environment Action Programme\n8\n, including full implementation of the waste hierarchy\n9\n in all Member States, decline in absolute and per capita waste generation, ensuring high quality recycling and the use of recycled waste as a major, reliable source of raw materials for the Union. They also contribute to the implementation of the EU Raw Materials Initiative\n10\n and address the need to prevent food waste. In addition, these proposals simplify the reporting requirements included in all six Directives.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\n\n2.1Studies\n\n\nThe proposals and the accompanying impact assessment assess technological, socio-economic and cost-benefit aspects related to the implementation and further development of EU waste legislation. A supplement to the Impact Assessment was produced to analyse the potential effects of additional variants of the main policy options defined in the Impact Assessment.\n\n\n2.2Internal consultation\n\n\nWithin the Commission an Impact Assessment Steering Group composed of various Commission services (SG, ECFIN, GROW, CLIMA, JRC, and ESTAT) followed the preparation of the legislative proposals. \n\n\n2.3External consultation\n\n\nAn indicative list of issues to be tackled was developed by the Commission and the first interviews with key stakeholders started in February 2013. An online public consultation in line with the minimum standards for consultation was launched in June 2013, closing in September 2013. 670 responses were submitted, reflecting high public concern about the waste management situation in the EU and high expectations for EU action in this area. A specific consultation of Member States was held between June and September 2015 as well as a broader consultation on the circular economy. \n\n\n2.4Impact assessment\n\n\n\n\nAn impact assessment report and an executive summary were published together with the proposal adopted in July 2014\n11\n. The impact assessment, which remains valid as the main analytical basis for the revised legislative proposals, evaluates the main environmental, social and economic impacts of various policy options to improve waste management in the EU. Various levels of ambition are assessed and compared to a \"baseline scenario\" in order to identify the most appropriate instruments and targets while minimizing costs and maximizing benefits.\n\n\nThe Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment Board delivered a positive opinion on the impact assessment on 8 April 2014, while making a number of recommendations to fine-tune the report. The Board requested to further clarify the problem definition and the need for new mid-term targets, strengthen the arguments in favour of a landfill ban from a subsidiarity and proportionality point of view and of uniform targets for all Member States, and explain in more detail how the varying performances of Member States are taken into account in the proposal.\n\n\nThe impact assessment led to the conclusion that a combination of Options will bring the following benefits: \n\n\n\u2013Administrative burden reduction in particular for small establishments or undertakings, simplification and better  implementation including by keeping targets \u2018fit for purpose\u2019;\n\n\n\u2013Job creation \u2013 more than 170.000 direct jobs could be created by 2035, most of them impossible to delocalize outside the EU; \n\n\n\u2013GHG emission reduction \u2013 more than 600 millions of tons of green house gas could be avoided between 2015 and 2035;\n\n\n\u2013Positive effects on the competitiveness of the EU waste management and recycling sectors as well as on the EU manufacturing sector (better extended producer responsibility schemes, reduced risks associated with raw material access);\n\n\n\u2013Reinjection into the EU economy of secondary raw materials which in turn will reduce the dependency of the EU on raw materials imports.\n\n\nAn analytical note supplementing the impact assessment was issued together with the legislative proposal. In this note, a number of additional options and variants were analysed with the aim to better take into account the different starting positions of each Member State.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSALS\n\n\n3.1Summary of the proposed action\n\n\nThe main elements of the proposals to amend EU waste legislation are: \n\n\n\u2013Alignment of definitions;\n\n\n\u2013Increase of the preparing for re-use and recycling target for municipal waste to 65% by 2030; \n\n\n\u2013Increase of the preparing for reuse and recycling targets for packaging waste and the simplification of the set of targets;\n\n\n\u2013Gradual limitation of the landfilling of municipal waste to 10% by 2030; \n\n\n\u2013Greater harmonisation and simplification of the legal framework on by-products and end-of-waste status;\n\n\n\u2013New measures to promote prevention, including for food waste, and re-use; \n\n\n\u2013Introduction of minimum operating conditions for Extended Producer Responsibility;\n\n\n\u2013Introduction of an Early Warning System for monitoring compliance with the recycling targets;\n\n\n\n\n\u2013Simplification and streamlining of reporting obligations;\n\n\n\u2013Alignment to Articles 290 and 291 TFEU on delegated and implementing acts.\n\n\n3.2Legal basis and right to act\n\n\nThe proposals amend six Directives addressing the management of different wastes. The proposals to amend Directive 2008/98/EC, Directive 1999/31/EC, Directive 2000/53/EC, Directive 2006/66/EC and Directive 2012/19/EU are based on Article 192(1) TFEU, whilst the proposal to amend Directive 94/62/EC is based on Article 114 TFEU. \n\n\nArticle 11(2) of Directive 2008/98/EC sets down a 50% target for preparing for re-use and recycling of household and similar waste and a 70% target for preparing for re-use, recycling and other material recovery of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste by 2020. Pursuant to Article 11(4), by 31 December 2014 at the latest, the Commission had to examine those targets with a view to, if necessary, reinforcing them and considering the setting of targets for other waste streams, taking into account the relevant environmental, economic and social impacts of setting the targets. According to Article 9(c), the Commission had to set, by the end of 2014, waste prevention and decoupling objectives for 2020, based on best available practices including, if necessary, a revision of the indicators referred to in Article 29(4). Finally, pursuant to Article 37(4), in the first report that intervenes by 12 December 2014, the Commission had to assess a number of measures including producer responsibility schemes for specific waste streams, targets, indicators and measures related to recycling, as well as material and energy recovery operations that may contribute to fulfilling the objectives set in Articles 1 and 4 more effectively.\n\n\nArticle 5(2) of Directive 1999/31/EC sets down three targets for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfills and bans the landfilling of certain waste streams. The last target for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfills has to be met by the Member States by 16 July 2016. Pursuant to Article 5(2), it shall be re-examined by 16 July 2014 with a view to confirming or amending it in order to ensure a high level of environmental protection and in light of the practical experience gained by Member States in the pursuance of the two previous targets.\n\n\nArticle 6(1) of Directive 94/62/EC sets down targets for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste which, pursuant to Article 6(5), shall be fixed every five years based on the practical experience gained in Member States and the findings of scientific research and evaluation techniques such as life-cycle assessments and cost-benefit analysis.\n\n\n3.3Subsidiarity and proportionality principle\n\n\nThe proposals are in conformity with the subsidiarity and proportionality principles set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union. They are limited to amending the abovementioned Directives by providing a framework establishing shared objectives, while leaving Member States free to decide about precise implementation methods.\n\n\n3.4Explanatory documents\n\n\nThe Commission considers that documents explaining Member States' measures transposing the Directives are necessary in order to improve the quality of information on the transposition of the Directives.\n\n\nWaste legislation is often transposed in a highly decentralised manner in the Member States, including on the regional or local level and in multiple legal acts, depending on the administrative structure of a Member State. As a result, in transposing the amended Directives Member States may have to amend a wide variety of legislative acts at national, regional and local levels.\n\n\nThe proposals amend six different waste Directives and affects an important number of legally binding obligations, including a comprehensive amendment of the targets contained in Directive 2008/98/EC, Directive 1999/31/EC and Directive 94/62/EC and a simplification of Directive 2000/53/EC, Directive 2006/66/EC and Directive 2012/19/EU. This is a complex review of waste legislation that will potentially affect a number of pieces of national legislation.\n\n\nThe revised targets for waste management contained in the amended Directives are inter-connected, and should be carefully transposed into national legislation and later on incorporated into national waste management systems.\n\n\nThe proposed provisions will affect a wide range of private and public stakeholders in the Member States and will have an important impact on future investments in waste management infrastructure. The complete and correct transposition of the new legislation is essential to guarantee that their objectives (i.e. protecting human health and the environment, increased resource efficiency, and ensuring the functioning of the internal market and avoiding obstacles to trade and restriction of competition within the EU) are achieved.\n\n\nThe requirement to provide explanatory documents may create an additional administrative burden on some Member States. However, explanatory documents are necessary to allow effective verification of complete and correct transposition, which is essential for the reasons mentioned above, and there are no less burdensome measures to allow efficient verification. Moreover, explanatory documents can contribute significantly to reducing the administrative burden of compliance monitoring by the Commission; without them, considerable resources and numerous contacts with national authorities would be required to track the methods of transposition in all Member States. \n\n\nIn view of the above it is appropriate to ask Member States to accompany the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the provisions of the Directives amending EU waste legislation and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.\n\n\n3.5Delegated and implementing powers of the Commission\n\n\nThe delegated and implementing powers of the Commission are identified and the corresponding procedures for adoption of these acts are established in paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 21, 22 of Article 1 of the proposal concerning Directive 2008/98/EC, paragraphs 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 of Article 1 of the proposal concerning Directive 94/62/EC, paragraphs 6 and 7 of Article 1 of the proposal concerning Directive 1999/31/EC and the amendments proposed in Articles 1 and 3 of the proposal concerning Directives 2000/53/EC and 2012/19/EU.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\n\n\n\n\nThe proposals will not have an impact on the European Union budget and is therefore not accompanied by the financial statement provided for under Article 31 of the Financial Regulation (Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No1605/2002).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015/0275 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n12\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n13\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Waste management in the Union should be improved, with a view to protecting, preserving and improving the quality of the environment, protecting human health, ensuring prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources and promoting a more circular economy. \n\n\n(2)The targets laid down in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n14\n for preparing for re-use and recycling of waste should be amended to make them better reflect the Union's ambition to move to a circular economy.\n\n\n(3)Many Member States have yet to develop the necessary waste management infrastructure. It is therefore essential to set long-term policy objectives in order to guide measures and investments, notably by preventing the creation of structural overcapacities for the treatment of residual waste and lock-ins of recyclable materials at the bottom of the waste hierarchy.\n\n\n(4)Municipal waste constitutes approximately between 7 and 10% of the total waste generated in the Union; however, this waste stream is amongst the most complex ones to manage, and the way it is managed generally gives a good indication of the quality of the overall waste management system in a country. The challenges of municipal waste management result from its highly complex and mixed composition, direct proximity of the generated waste to citizens, and a very high public visibility. As a result, its management involves a need for a highly complex waste management system including an efficient collection scheme, a need to actively engage citizens and businesses, a need for infrastructure adjusted to the specific waste composition, and an elaborate financing system. Countries which have developed efficient municipal waste management systems generally perform better in overall waste management.\n\n\n(5)Definitions of municipal waste, construction and demolition waste, the final recycling process, and backfilling need to be included in Directive 2008/98/EC so that the scope of these concepts is clarified.\n\n\n\n\n(6)To ensure that recycling targets are based on reliable and comparable data and to enable more effective monitoring of progress in attaining those targets, the definition of municipal waste in Directive 2008/98/EC should be in line with the definition used for statistical purposes by the European Statistical Office and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, on the basis of which Member States have been reporting data for several years. The definition of municipal waste in this Directive is neutral with regard to the public or private status of the operator managing waste.\n\n\n(7)Member States should put in place adequate incentives for the application of the waste hierarchy, in particular, by means of financial incentives aimed at achieving the waste prevention and recycling objectives of this Directive, such as landfill and incineration charges, pay as you throw schemes, extended producer responsibility schemes and incentives for local authorities.\n\n\n(8)In order to provide operators in markets for secondary raw materials with more certainty as to the waste or non-waste status of substances or objects and promote a level playing field, it is important to establish at the Union level harmonized conditions for substances or objects to be recognised as by-products and for waste that has undergone a recovery operation to be recognised as having ceased to be waste. Where necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market or a high level of environmental protection across the Union, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts establishing detailed criteria on the application of such harmonized conditions to certain waste, including for a specific use.\n\n\n(9)Extended producer responsibility schemes form an essential part of efficient waste management, but their effectiveness and performance differ significantly between Member States. Thus, it is necessary to set minimum operating requirements for extended producer responsibility. Those requirements should reduce costs and boost performance, as well as ensure a level-playing field, including for small and medium sized enterprises, and avoid obstacles to the smooth functioning of the internal market. They should also contribute to the incorporation of end-of-life costs into product prices and provide incentives for producers to take better into account recyclability and reusability when designing their products. The requirements should apply to both new and existing extended producer responsibility schemes. A transitional period is however necessary for existing extended producer responsibility schemes to adapt their structures and procedures to the new requirements. \n\n\n(10)Waste prevention is the most efficient way to improve resource efficiency and to reduce the environmental impact of waste. It is important therefore that Member States take appropriate measures to prevent waste generation and monitor and assess progress in the implementation of such measures. In order to ensure a uniform measurement of the overall progress in the implementation of waste prevention measures, common indicators should be established.\n\n\n(11)Plant based substances from the agri-food industry and food of non-animal origin no longer intended for human consumption, which are destined to be used as feed are subject to Regulation (EC) No 767/2009\n15\n and are not regarded as waste for the purposes of that Regulation. Directive 2008/98/EC should therefore not apply to those products and substances when used for feed, and the scope of that Directive needs to be clarified accordingly. \n\n\n(12)Member States should take measures to promote prevention of food waste in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015, and in particular its target of halving food waste by 2030. These measures should aim to prevent food waste in primary production, in processing and manufacturing, in retail and other distribution of food, in restaurants and food services as well as in households. Having regard to the environmental and economic benefits of preventing food waste, Member States should establish specific food waste prevention measures and should measure progress in food waste reduction. To facilitate exchange of good practice across the EU both between Member States and between food business operators, uniform methodologies for such measurement should be established. Reporting on food waste levels should take place on a biennial basis. \n\n\n(13)Industrial, certain parts of commercial waste and extractive waste are extremely diversified in terms of composition and volume, and very different depending on the economic structure of a Member State, the structure of the industry or commerce sector that generates the waste and the industrial or commercial density in a given geographical area. Hence, for most industrial and extractive waste, an industry-oriented approach using Best Available Techniques reference documents and similar instruments to address the specific issues related to the management of a given type of waste is a suitable solution\n16\n. However, industrial and commercial packaging waste should continue to be covered by the requirements of Directive 94/62/EC and Directive 2008/98/EC, including their respective improvements.\n\n\n(14)The targets for preparation for re-use and recycling of municipal waste should be increased in order to deliver substantial environmental, economic and social benefits.\n\n\n(15)Through a progressive increase of the existing targets for preparation for re-use and recycling of municipal waste, it should be ensured that economically valuable waste materials are re-used and effectively recycled, and that valuable materials found in waste are channelled back into the European economy, thus advancing the Raw Materials Initiative\n17\n and the creation of a circular economy.\n\n\n(16) Large differences exist between Member States with respect to their waste management performance, particularly as regards recycling of municipal waste. In order to take account of those differences, those Member States which in 2013 recycled less than 20% of their municipal waste according to Eurostat data should be given additional time to comply with the preparing for re-use and recycling targets established for 2025 and 2030. In light of average annual progression rates observed in Member States over the past fifteen years, those Member States would need to increase their recycling capacity at levels that are well-above past averages\u00a0to meet those targets. In order to ensure that steady progress towards the targets is made and that implementation gaps are tackled in due time, Member States that are given additional time should meet interim-targets and establish an\u00a0implementation plan.\n\n\n(17)In order to ensure the reliability of the data gathered on preparation for re-use it is essential to establish common rules for reporting. Similarly, it is important to lay down more precise rules on how Member States should report what is effectively recycled and can be counted towards the attainment of the recycling targets. To that effect, as a general rule, the reporting on the attainment of the recycling targets must be based on the input to the final recycling process. In order to limit administrative burdens, Member States should be allowed, under strict conditions, to report recycling rates on the basis of the output of sorting facilities. Losses in weight of materials or substances due to physical and/or chemical transformation processes inherent to the final recycling process should not be deducted from the weight of the waste reported as recycled.\n\n\n(18)Member States should, for the purposes of calculating whether the preparation for re-use and recycling targets are achieved, be able to take into account products and components that are prepared for re-use by recognised re-use operators and by deposit-refund schemes and the recycling of metals that takes place in conjunction with incineration. In order to ensure a uniform calculation of this data, the Commission will adopt detailed rules on the determination of recognised preparation for re-use operators and deposit-refund schemes, on the quality criteria for recycled metals and on the collection, verification and reporting of data.\n\n\n(19)In order to ensure better, timelier and more uniform implementation of this Directive and anticipate implementation weaknesses, an early warning system should be established to detect shortcomings and allow taking action ahead of the deadlines for meeting the targets.\n\n\n(20)Compliance with the obligation to set up separate collection systems for paper, metal, plastic and glass is essential in order to increase preparing for re-use and recycling rates in Member States. In addition bio-waste should be collected separately to contribute to an increase in preparing for re-use and recycling rates and the prevention of contamination of dry recyclable materials.\n\n\n(21)Proper management of hazardous waste still presents a problem in the Union, and data on its treatment are partly missing. It is therefore necessary to strengthen record keeping and traceability mechanisms through the establishment of electronic registries for hazardous waste in the Member States. Electronic data collection should be extended to other types of waste, where appropriate, in order to simplify record-keeping for businesses and administrations and improve the monitoring of waste flows in the Union.\n\n\n(22)This Directive sets long-term objectives for the Union\u2019s waste management and gives economic operators and Member States a clear direction for the investments needed to attain the objectives of this Directive. In developing their national waste management strategies and planning investments in waste management infrastructure, Member States should make a sound use of the European Structural and Investment Funds by promoting prevention, re-use and recycling, in line with the waste hierarchy.\n\n\n(23)Certain raw materials are of a high importance to the economy of the Union and their supply is associated with a high risk. In order to ensure security of supply of those raw materials and in line with the Raw Materials Initiative and the objectives and targets of the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials, Member States should take measures to achieve the best possible management of waste containing significant amounts of those raw materials, taking economic and technological feasibility and environmental benefits into account. The Commission has established a list of critical raw materials for the EU\n18\n. This list is subject to regular review by the Commission.\n\n\n(24)To further support effective implementation of the Raw Materials Initiative, Member States should also promote the reuse of products constituting the main sources of raw materials. They should also include in their waste management plans nationally appropriate measures regarding collection and recovery of waste containing significant amounts of these raw materials. The measures should be included in the waste management plans when they are updated for the first time following the entry into effect\u00a0of this Directive. The Commission will provide information about the relevant product groups and waste streams at EU level. This provision does not preclude the Member States to take measures for other raw materials considered as important to their national economy.\n\n\n(25)Littering has direct detrimental impacts on the environment and the wellbeing of citizens, and high clean-up costs are an unnecessary economic burden for society. The introduction of specific measures in waste management plans and proper enforcement by competent authorities should help eradicate this problem.\n\n\n\n\n(26)To reduce regulatory burdens on small establishments or undertakings, simplification of registration requirements for small establishments or undertakings collecting or transporting small quantities of non-hazardous waste should be introduced. The threshold for quantities of such waste may need to be adapted by the Commission.\n\n\n(27)Implementation reports prepared by Member States every three years have not proved to be an effective tool for verifying compliance and ensuring good implementation, and are generating unnecessary administrative burdens. It is therefore appropriate to repeal provisions obliging Member States to produce such reports. Instead  compliance monitoring should be exclusively based on the statistical data which Member States report every year to the Commission.\n\n\n(28)Statistical data reported by Member States are essential for the Commission to assess compliance with waste legislation across the Member States. The quality, reliability and comparability of statistics should be improved by introducing a single entry point for all waste data, deleting obsolete reporting requirements, benchmarking national reporting methodologies and introducing a data quality check report. Therefore, when reporting on the achievement of the targets set out in waste legislation, Member States shall use the most recent methodology developed by the Commission and the national statistical offices of the Member States.\n\n\n(29)In order to supplement or amend Directive 2008/98/EC, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of Articles 5(2), 6(2), 7(1), 11a(2), 11a(6), 26, 27(1), 27(4), 38(1), 38(2) and 38(3). It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and the Council.\n\n\n(30)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Directive 2008/98/EC, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of Articles 9(4), 9(5), 33(2), 35(5) and 37(6). Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n19\n.\n\n\n(31)Directive 2008/98/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n\n(32)In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents\n20\n, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified.\n\n\n(33)Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to improve waste management in the Union, and thereby contributing to the protection, preservation and improvement of the quality of the environment, the health of the oceans and the safety of seafood by reducing marine litter, and to the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources across the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can, by reason of the scale or effects of the measures, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.
