Due to the security situation in Cote d'Ivoire, the implementation of the relocation to Abidjan was several times postponed, the last time in March 2012 when the Council of ICCO agreed to make a final decision at its September 2015 session.\n\n\nWith the current decision, the European Union will adopt its position to be taken in the 92nd regular session of the ICCO Council in September 2015 (or any extraordinary session after September until the end of 2015) regarding the relocation of ICCO headquarter from London to Abidjan.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nWith Council Decision 2012/189/EU of 26 March 2012 (OJ L 102, 12.4.2012, p. 1) the European Union approved the International Cocoa Agreement on behalf of the Union. \n\n\nWith Council Conclusion of 13 March 2012, the European Union adopted its position to be taken in the 85th session of the ICCO Council (March 2012) regarding the relocation of ICCO headquarter to Abidjan.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nThe contents of this decision were discussed in the Council Working Party on Commodities at a number of meetings in 2015.\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nSince 2002, no other country than Cote d'Ivoire has offered to host the ICCO. As Cote d'Ivoire is the biggest cocoa producer, a relocation of ICCO's headquarters from London to Abidjan is appropriate, if the local conditions allow it.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nCote d'Ivoire has indicated to take over the relocation costs necessary which have been assessed at 1,949,944\u00a3.\n\n\nThe annual administrative budgets of ICCO after relocation to Abidjan would be more or less comparable to the budgets in London.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\n\n\nA decision to move ICCO headquarters from London to Abidjan should be taken in September 2015 or at least not later than end of 2015.\n\n\nThe relocation itself should take place in September 2016 and not later than March 2017.\n\n\n\n2015/0183 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the possible relocation of the ICCO headquarter from London to Abidjan\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 in conjunction of Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The EU is a party to the International Cocoa Agreement 2010 and a member of the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO),\n\n\n(2)ICCO is supposed to adopt a decision in the 92nd regular session of its Council in September 2015 regarding the relocation of ICCO headquarter from London to Abidjan,\n\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe European Union\u2019s position for the 92nd regular session of the ICCO Council (21-25 September 2015) regarding the seat of the International Cocoa Organisation is set out as follows:\n\n\nProvided that by the 92nd regular session of the ICCO Council in September 2015 or by any upcoming extraordinary session thereof until the end of 2015,\n\n\n\uf0b7the UN security level for Cote d'Ivoire is number two or better;\n\n\n\uf0b7an updated Headquarters Agreement, Memorandum of Understanding or equivalent exchange of letters between the ICCO and Cote d'Ivoire stipulating the mutual obligations and responsibilities concerning the relocation has been signed or exchanged;\n\n\n\uf0b7an ICCO Council decision is approved on the share of the relocation costs (1,949,944 GBP paid by Cote d'Ivoire) and responsibilities between Cote d'Ivoire and ICCO, the modalities and timelines for the payment of the relocation costs, bearing in mind that 100% of the estimated relocation costs should be paid to ICCO by Cote d'Ivoire until March 2016);\n\n\n\uf0b7an ICCO Council decision is approved establishing the timelines for the relocation;\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7an ICCO Council decision is approved concerning a  ossible construction of an ICCO office 10 years after the relocation to Abidjan including appropriate modalities of funding (for example accumulated ICCO member contributions for this specific budget item over the next 10 years);\n\n\nthe relocation to Abidjan should go ahead.\n\n\nThe EU will not support deferring this decision beyond 2015.\n\n\nIf it is decided to relocate the ICCO headquarter to Abidjan the EU will support the election of a candidate for Executive Director from consumer countries.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the first day following its adoption.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
