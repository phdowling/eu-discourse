In two distinct articles,\r\nit provides that the Council is to adopt broad economic policy guidelines\r\n(Article 121) and employment guidelines (Article 148), specifying that the\r\nlatter must be consistent with the former. Given this legal basis, the\r\nguidelines for employment and economic policies are presented as two distinct \u2013\r\nbut intrinsically interconnected \u2013 legal instruments:\n\u00b7                        \r\nA Council Recommendation on broad guidelines for\r\nthe economic policies of the Member States and of the Union \u2013 Part I of the\r\nIntegrated Guidelines;\n\u00b7                        \r\nA Council Decision on guidelines for the\r\nemployment policies of the Member States \u2013 Part II of the Integrated\r\nGuidelines.\nThe guidelines were first\r\nadopted together (\u2018integrated package\u2019) in 2010, underpinning the Europe 2020\r\nstrategy. It was also decided in 2010 that the integrated guidelines should\r\nremain largely stable until 2014. Whilst the broad economic policy guidelines\r\nremain valid for any duration of time, the employment guidelines\r\nneed to be drawn up each year.\nThe guidelines, other than\r\nframing the scope and direction for Member States\u2019 policy coordination, also\r\nprovide the basis for country specific recommendations in the respective\r\ndomains.\u00a0 \nThe current set of\r\n'integrated guidelines' are to underpin the Europe 2020 strategy within the\r\ncontext of the new approach to economic policy making built on investment,\r\nstructural reform and fiscal responsibility as set out in the Commission's 2015\r\nAnnual Growth Survey. At the same time, the integrated guidelines are to\r\nsupport the achievement of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and the aims\r\nof the European Semester of economic policy coordination.\nThe \"Integrated Guidelines\"\r\nare the following:\nGuideline 1:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Boosting investment\nGuideline 2: \u00a0\u00a0 Enhancing growth by the\r\nimplementation of structural reforms\nGuideline 3: \u00a0\u00a0 Removing key barriers to\r\ngrowth and jobs at EU level\nGuideline 4: \u00a0\u00a0 Improving the\r\nsustainability and growth-friendliness of public finances \nGuideline 5: \u00a0\u00a0 Boosting demand for labour\nGuideline 6: \u00a0\u00a0 Enhancing labour supply and\r\nskills \nGuideline 7: \u00a0\u00a0 Enhancing the functioning\r\nof labour markets\nGuideline 8: \u00a0\u00a0 Ensuring fairness,\r\ncombatting poverty and promoting equal opportunities\n2015/0051 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non guidelines for the employment policies\r\nof the Member States\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 148(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[1],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[2],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[3],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEmployment Committee, \nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States and the\u00a0\r\nUnion should work towards developing a coordinated strategy for employment and\r\nparticularly for promoting a skilled, trained and adaptable workforce and\r\nlabour markets responsive to economic change and with a view to achieving the\r\nfull employment and social progress objectives set out in Article 3 of the\r\nTreaty on European Union. Member States, having regard to national practices\r\nrelated to the responsibilities of management and labour, are to regard\r\npromoting employment as a matter of common concern and coordinate their action\r\nin this respect within the Council. \u00a0\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union must combat\r\nsocial exclusion and discrimination, ensure equal access to fundamental rights,\r\nand promote social justice and protection. In defining and implementing its\r\npolicies and activities, the Union should take into account requirements linked\r\nto the guarantee of adequate social protection and the fight against social\r\nexclusion and a high level of education and training. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The employment guidelines\r\nare consistent with the broad guidelines for the economic policies\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\r\nregard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and coordinate\r\nthem within the Council. Employment guidelines and broad economic policy\r\nguidelines should be adopted by the Council to guide Member States\u2019 and Union\r\npolicies. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nTreaty provisions, the Union has developed and implemented policy coordination\r\ninstruments for fiscal policy and macro-structural policies. The European\r\nSemester combines the different instruments in an overarching framework for\r\nintegrated multilateral economic and budgetary surveillance. The streamlining\r\nand strengthening of the European Semester as set out in the Commission's 2015\r\nAnnual Growth Survey will further improve its functioning. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The financial and economic\r\ncrisis revealed and emphasised important weaknesses in the economy of the Union\r\nand its Member States. It has also underscored the close interdependence of the\r\nMember States' economies and labour markets. Moving the Union to a state of\r\nstrong, sustainable and inclusive growth and job creation is the key challenge\r\nfaced today. This requires coordinated and ambitious policy action both on\r\nUnion and national level, in line with the provisions of the Treaty and the\r\nUnion economic governance. Combining supply and demand side measures, these\r\nactions should encompass a boost to investment, a renewed commitment to\r\nstructural reforms and exercising fiscal responsibility. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States and the\r\nUnion should also address the social impact of the crisis and aim at building a\r\ncohesive society in which people are empowered to anticipate and manage change,\r\nand can actively participate in society and the economy. Access and\r\nopportunities for all should be ensured and poverty and social exclusion\r\nreduced, in particular by ensuring an effective functioning of labour markets\r\nand social welfare systems and removing barriers to labour market\r\nparticipation. Member States should also make sure that the benefits of\r\neconomic growth reach all citizens and all regions. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Action in line with the\r\nguidelines is an important contribution to reaching the goals of the Europe\r\n2020 strategy. The guidelines constitute an integrated set of European and\r\nnational policies, which Member States and the Union should implement in order\r\nto achieve the positive spill-over effects of coordinated structural reforms,\r\nan appropriate overall economic policy mix and a more consistent contribution\r\nfrom European policies to the Europe 2020 strategy\u2019s objectives.\u00a0\u00a0 \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While these guidelines are\r\naddressed to Member States and the Union, they should be implemented in\r\npartnership with all national, regional and local authorities, closely\r\nassociating parliaments, as well as social partners and representatives of\r\ncivil society.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The broad guidelines for\r\neconomic policies give guidance to the Member States on implementing reforms,\r\nreflecting interdependence. They are in line with the Stability and Growth\r\nPact. The guidelines should form the basis for country-specific recommendations\r\nthat the Council may address to the Member States.\n\u00a0HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe guidelines for Member States\u2019\r\nemployment policies, as set out in the Annex, are hereby adopted. These\r\nguidelines shall form part of the \u2018integrated guidelines\u2019.\nArticle 2\nThe guidelines in the Annex shall be taken\r\ninto account in the employment policies and reform programmes of the Member\r\nStates, which should be reported in line with Article 148(3) of the Treaty.\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member\r\nStates.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. \n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. \n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. \nANNEX\nGuidelines for the employment\r\npolicies of the Member States\r\nPart II of the Integrated Guidelines\nGuideline 5:\u00a0 Boosting demand for\r\nlabour \nMember States should facilitate job\r\ncreation, reduce barriers for business to hire people, promote entrepreneurship\r\nand in particular support the creation and growth of small entreprises in order\r\nto increase the employment rate of women and men. Member States should also\r\nactively promote the social economy and foster social innovation.\nThe tax burden should be shifted away from\r\nlabour to other sources of taxation that are less detrimental to employment and\r\ngrowth while protecting revenue for adequate social protection and growth\r\nenhancing expenditures. Reductions in labour taxation should be aimed at the\r\nrelevant components of the tax burden and at removing barriers and\r\ndisincentives to labour market participation, in particular for those furthest\r\naway from the labour market. \nMember States should, together with the\r\nsocial partners, encourage wage-setting mechanisms allowing for a\r\nresponsiveness of wages to productivity developments. In this respect, differences\r\nin skills and local labour market conditions as well as divergences in economic\r\nperformance across regions, sectors and companies should be taken into account.\r\nWhen setting minimum wages, Member\r\nStates and social partners should consider their impact on in-work poverty, job\r\ncreation and competitiveness.\nGuideline 6: Enhancing labour supply\r\nand skills \nMember States should promote productivity\r\nand employability through an appropriate supply of relevant knowledge and\r\nskills. Member States should make the necessary investments in education and\r\nvocational training systems while improving their effectiveness and efficiency\r\nto raise the skill level of the workforce, allowing it to better anticipate and\r\nmeet the rapidly changing needs of dynamic labour markets in an increasingly\r\ndigital economy. Member States should step up efforts to improve access to\r\nquality adult learning for all and implement active ageing strategies to enable\r\nlonger working lives.\nHigh unemployment should be tackled and\r\nlong-term unemployment prevented. The number of long-term unemployed should be\r\nsignificantly reduced by means of comprehensive and mutually reinforcing\r\nstrategies, including the provision of specific active support to long-term\r\nunemployed to return to the labour market. The youth unemployment needs to be\r\ncomprehesively addressed, including by equipping the relevant institutions with\r\nthe necessary means to fully and consistently implement their national Youth\r\nGuarantee Implementation Plans\nStructural weaknesses in education and\r\ntraining systems should be addressed to ensure quality learning outcomes and\r\nprevent and tackle early school leaving. Member States should increase\r\neducational attainment and consider dual learning systems and upgrading\r\nprofessional training while at the same time increase opportunities for\r\nrecognising skills acquired outside the formal education system.\nBarriers to labour market participation\r\nshould be reduced, especially for women, older workers, young people, the\r\ndisabled and legal migrants. Gender equality including equal pay must be\r\nensured in the labour market as well as access to affordable quality early\r\nchildhood education and care.\nMember States should make a full use of\r\nEuropean Social Fund and other Union funds support in order to improve\r\nemployment, social inclusion, education and public administration. \nGuideline 7: Enhancing the\r\nfunctioning of labour markets \nMember States should reduce labour market\r\nsegmentation. Employment protection rules and institutions should provide a\r\nsuitable environment for recruitment while offering adequate levels of\r\nprotection to those in employment and those seeking employment or employed on\r\ntemporary contracts or independent work contracts. Quality employment should be\r\nensured in terms of socio-economic security, education and training\r\nopportunities, working conditions\u00a0 (including health and safety) and work-life\r\nbalance.\u00a0 \nMember States should closely involve\r\nNational Parliaments and social partners in the design and implementation of\r\nrelevant reforms and policies, in line with national practices, while\r\nsupporting the improvement of the functioning and effectiveness of social\r\ndialogue at national level.\nMember States should strengthen active\r\nlabour market policies by increasing their targeting, outreach, coverage and\r\ninterplay with passive measures. These policies should aim at improving labour\r\nmarket matching and support sustainable transitions on the labour market, with\r\npublic employment services delivering individualised support and implementing\r\nperformance measurement systems. Member States should also ensure that their\r\nsocial protection systems effectively activate and enable those who can\r\nparticipate in the labour market, protect those (temporarily) excluded from the\r\nlabour markets and/or unable to participate in it, and prepare individuals for\r\npotential risks, by investing in human capital Member States should promote\r\ninclusive labour markets open to all andalso put in place effective\r\nanti-discrimination measures.\nMobility of workers should be ensured with\r\nan aim of exploiting the full potential of the European labour market,\r\nincluding by enhancing the portability of pensions and the recognition of\r\nqualifications. Member States should at the same time guard against abuses of\r\nthe existing rules.\nGuideline 8: Ensuring fairness,\r\ncombatting poverty and promoting equal opportunities \nMember States should modernise their social\r\nprotection systems to provide effective,\u00a0 efficient,\r\nand adequate protection throughout all stages of an individual\u2019s life, ensuring\r\nfairness and addressing inequalities. There is a need for simplified and better\r\ntargeted social policies complemented by affordable quality childcare and\r\neducation, training and job assistance, housing support and accessible health\r\ncare, access to basis services\r\nsuch as bank account and Internet and for action to prevent early school\r\nleaving and fight social exclusion. \nFor that puropose a variety of instruments\r\nshould be used in a complementary manner, including labour activation enabling\r\nservices and income suppoirt, targeted at individual needs. Social protection\r\nsystems should be designed in a way that facilitate take up of all persons\r\nentitled, support investment in human capital, and help prevent, reduce and\r\nprotect against poverty. \nThe pension systems should be reformed in\r\norder to secure their sustainability and adequacy for women and men in\r\na context of increasing longevity and demographic change, including by linking\r\nstatutory retirement ages to life expectancy, by increasing effective\r\nretirement ages, and by developing complementary retirement savings.\u00a0 \nMember States should improve the\r\naccessibility, efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare and long term care\r\nsystems, while safeguarding fiscal sustainability.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
