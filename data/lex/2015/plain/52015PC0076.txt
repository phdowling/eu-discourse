This entered into force\r\non 1 June 2002. A protocol was later concluded extending the Agreement to\r\ninclude the ten Member States that joined the EU in 2004 (see OJ L 89 of\r\n28.3.2006, p. 30). A second protocol was concluded extending the Agreement\r\nto include Bulgaria and Romania (see OJ L 124 of 20.5.2009, p. 53). The\r\nAgreement was initially concluded for a period of seven years, which came to an\r\nend on 31 May 2009. Following the Swiss referendum of 8 February 2009, the\r\nAgreement was renewed for an indefinite period. In spite of the results of the\r\nSwiss referendum of 9 February 2014 on mass migration, the Agreement is still\r\nin force. \nArticle 9 and Annex III of the Agreement\r\nrelate to the recognition of professional qualifications. Annex III lists the\r\nEU acts adopted in this area that are of relevance to the EU\u2019s relations with\r\nSwitzerland. Article 18 of the Agreement specifies that any amendments to Annex\r\nIII are to be adopted by decision of the EU-Swiss Joint Committee established\r\nunder Article 14.\nAnnex III was last amended by Decision No 2/2011\r\nof the EU-Swiss Joint Committee (see OJ L 277 of 22.10.2011 p. 20).\r\nThe purpose of this amendment was, in particular, to align the Agreement with\r\nDirective 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7\r\nSeptember 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications (see OJ L 255\r\nof 30.9.2005, p. 22).\nThe annexes to this\r\nDirective have themselves been amended several times since the adoption of\r\nDecision No 2/2011. Annex III therefore needs to\r\nbe updated again in order to take account of these changes. Specifically,\r\namendments need to be made to Annex III to the Agreement in order to reflect\r\nthe following:\n\u2013                        \r\nThe adoption of Regulation EU No 623/2012\r\namending Annex II to Directive 2005/36/EC (see OJ L 180 of 12.7.2012, p.\r\n9).\n\u2013                        \r\nNotification from the United Kingdom of changes\r\nrelating to the professional associations and organisations listed under Annex\r\nI to Directive 2005/36/EC. These changes are reflected in the Commission\r\ncommunication Notification of the professional associations or organisations\r\nfulfilling the conditions of Article 3(2) listed under Annex I to Directive\r\n2005/36/EC (see OJ C 182 of 23.6.2011, p. 1).\n\u2013                        \r\nFive Commission communications updating Annex V\r\nto the Agreement in the light of notifications from Member States of new or amended\r\nprofessional titles and of changes to the accepted evidence of formal\r\nqualifications and/or the bodies issuing such evidence. The Communications were\r\npublished on 24.6.2011 (OJ C 183, p. 1), 16.12.2011 (OJ C 367, p. 5), 14.8.2012\r\n(OJ C 244, p. 1), 21.12.2012 (OJ C 396, p. 1) and 28.6.2013 (OJ C 183, p. 4).\n\u2013                        \r\nRecent developments in Switzerland relating to\r\nprofessional qualifications for certain health and healthcare professions.\r\nSwitzerland has requested that a number of amendments and additions be made to\r\nAnnex III to the Agreement. These relate to the areas of medical oncology,\r\nmedical genetics and internal medicine, nursing and midwifery.\nIt should be noted that the amendments\r\nmentioned here, which have all been included in the attached draft revision of\r\nAnnex III, need to be made in order to reflect technical changes affecting the\r\ncurrent situation in Member States (the contracting parties). They do not\r\nconstitute new initiatives.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe draft Joint Committee Decision contains\r\nthree articles.\nArticle 1 stipulates that Annex III to the\r\nAgreement is to be adapted in accordance with the Annex attached to the\r\nDecision.\nArticle 2 stipulates that the Decision will\r\nbe equally authentic in all the official languages of the EU.\nArticle 3 lays\r\ndown provisions regarding the entry into force of the Decision.\nAnnex: revised\r\nAnnex III\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis proposal does not have any\r\nimplications for the EU\u2019s budget.\n2015/0040 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be taken by the\r\nEuropean Union in the Joint Committee established under the Agreement between\r\nthe European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Swiss\r\nConfederation, of the other, on the free movement of persons, as regards the\r\namendment of Annex III on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 218(9) in\r\nconjunction with Articles 46, 53 and 62 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement between the\r\nEuropean Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Swiss\r\nConfederation, of the other, on the free movement of persons[1] (\u2018the Agreement\u2019) was\r\nsigned on 21 June 1999 and entered into force on 1 June 2002.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 14 of the\r\nAgreement establishes the EU-Swiss Joint Committee.
