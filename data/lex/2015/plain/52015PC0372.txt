The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) was set up by the Member States whose currency is the euro as the main stability mechanism for the euro area.\n\n\n(3)The European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism can provide Union financial assistance to all Member States, when the conditions set in Article 122(2) TFEU and in Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 are met. The risks attached to a situation where a Member State loses market access differ however fundamentally, depending on whether that Member State is part of the euro area. The potential negative spill over effects are considerably higher for the euro area, where having a Member State in financial difficulties is likely to create risks for the financial stability of the euro area as a whole.\n\n\n(4)The ESM should be in most cases the financial instrument to be used for providing financial assistance to a euro area Member State. There may be however situations where practical, procedural or financial reasons call for a use of the EFSM, generally before or alongside an ESM financial assistance. Those situations warrant transposing the principle of reinforced solidarity between euro area Member States that is needed for the good functioning of a monetary union to the financial assistance mechanism operated under Union law.\n\n\n(5)In these circumstances, the granting of new Union financial assistance to the benefit of a Member State whose currency is the euro should be made conditional upon the establishment of arrangements which would ensure that the Member States which do not participate in the single currency would be fully compensated in the event that there is a non-payment under the EFSM Facility which results in the use of resources within the EU Budget and/or the Commission making a demand for additional resources from the non-euro area Member States.\n\n\n(6)This principle was endorsed on 17 July 2015 by a joint statement of the Commission and the Council.\n\n\n(7)Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe following paragraph 2a is inserted in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 407/2010:\n\n\n' 2a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the beneficiary Member State is a Member State whose currency is the euro, the granting of Union financial assistance shall be conditional upon legally binding provisions guaranteeing that the Member States which do not participate in the single currency are fully compensated for any liability they may incur as a result of any failure by the beneficiary Member State to repay the financial assistance in accordance with its terms.'\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. \n\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ C , , p. .\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
