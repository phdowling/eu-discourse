The objectives of such agreements are to give all European Union air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and third countries, and to bring bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries in line with Union law.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General context\n\n\nInternational aviation relations between Member States and third countries have traditionally been governed by bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries, the annexes to such agreements and other related bilateral or multilateral arrangements.\n\n\nTraditional designation clauses in Member States\u2019 bilateral air services agreements infringe Union law. They allow a third country to reject, withdraw or suspend the permissions or authorisations of an air carrier that has been designated by a Member State but that is not substantially owned and effectively controlled by that Member State or its nationals. This has been found to constitute discrimination against EU air carriers established in the territory of a Member State but owned and controlled by nationals of other Member States. This is contrary to Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which guarantees nationals of Member States who have exercised their freedom of establishment the same treatment in the host Member State as that accorded to nationals of that Member State.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\n\n\nThe provisions of the Agreement supersede or complement the existing provisions in 8 bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the People's Republic of Bangladesh.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union\n\n\nThe Agreement will serve a fundamental objective of the external aviation policy of the Union by bringing existing bilateral air services agreements in line with Union law.\n\n\n2.CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES\n\n\nConsultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents\n\n\nIn line with Article 218(4) TFEU, the Commission has conducted the negotiations in consultation with a special committee. Industry has equally been consulted during the negotiations. \n\n\nSummary of responses and how they have been taken into account\n\n\nComments made in this process have been taken into account. The Member States concerned verified the accuracy of the references to the bilateral air services agreements. Industry underlined the importance of a sound legal basis for their commercial operations.        \n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Summary of the proposed action\n\n\nIn accordance with the mechanisms and directives in the Annex to the \u201dhorizontal authorisation\u201d, the Commission has negotiated an agreement with the People's Republic of Bangladesh that replaces certain provisions in the existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the People's Republic of Bangladesh. Article 2 of the Agreement replaces the traditional designation clauses with an EU designation clause, permitting all EU carriers to benefit from the right of establishment. Article 5 resolves potential conflicts with the competition rules of the Union.\n\n\n\n\nThe negotiations on the agreement having been successfully concluded, it should be signed on behalf of the European Union. A decision to this effect is proposed herewith.\n\n\nIt is also proposed to have the agreement provisionally applied from the date of signature to ensure that the bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the People's Republic of Bangladesh are applied in line with Union law without any further delays. Provisional application is essential as experience with similar agreements has shown that ratification processes can be lengthy.      \n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legal basis\n\n\nArt. 100(2), 218(5) TFEU\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choice of instruments\n\n\nThe Agreement between the Union and the People's Republic of Bangladesh is the most efficient instrument to bring all existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the People's Republic of Bangladesh into conformity with Union law.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \n\n\nThe proposal has no implication for the budget of the Union.\n\n\n2015/0189 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the Union, and provisional application of the Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh on certain aspects of air services\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2), in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)By its Decision of 5 June 2003, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with an agreement at Union level.\n\n\n(2)Accordingly, on behalf of the Union, the Commission has negotiated an Agreement with the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh on certain aspects of air services (the Agreement).
