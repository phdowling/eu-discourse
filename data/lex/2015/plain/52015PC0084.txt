Match-fixing undermines the values\r\nof sport such as integrity, fair play and respect for others.\u00a0 It risks\r\nalienating fans and supporters from organised sport.\u00a0 Moreover, match-fixing\r\noften involves organised criminal networks active on a global scale.\u00a0 It is a\r\nproblem that has now become a priority for public authorities, the sport\r\nmovement and law enforcement agencies worldwide.\u00a0 To respond to these\r\nchallenges, the Council of Europe invited parties to the European Cultural\r\nConvention during the summer of 2012 to begin negotiations for a Convention of\r\nthe Council of Europe against the manipulation of sports results.\u00a0 Negotiations\r\nbegan in October 2012 with the first meeting of the drafting group of the\r\nCouncil of Europe.\nOn 13 November 2012 the Commission adopted\r\n\"the recommendation for a Council decision authorizing the Commission\r\nto participate, on behalf of the Union, in the negotiations for an\r\ninternational convention of the Council of Europe to combat the manipulation of\r\nsports results\"[1].\u00a0\r\nThe Commission's recommendation was transmitted to the Council Working Party on\r\nSports on 15 November 2012.\u00a0 Following discussions in the Council Working\r\nParty, the Council split the draft Council decision into two decisions due to\r\nthe addition of substantive legal bases by the Council, including a legal basis\r\nstemming from Part 3, Title V TFEU.[2]\u00a0\r\nOne decision on matters relating to betting and sport was adopted by the\r\nCouncil on 10 June 2013.[3]\u00a0\r\nThe other decision was adopted by the Council on 23 September 2013 and\r\nconcerned matters related to cooperation in criminal matters and police\r\ncooperation.[4]\nThe Commission,\r\nin accordance with the relevant Council decisions, took part in the subsequent\r\nnegotiations, which culminated on 9 July 2014 with the adoption by the\r\nMinisters\u2019 Deputies of the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of\r\nSports Competitions.[5]\u00a0\r\nThe Convention was subsequently opened for signature on 18 September 2014 at\r\nthe Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for Sport.\u00a0 According\r\nto its Article 32 (3), the Convention is open to signature of the European\r\nUnion.\u00a0 Since then a number of parties have signed the Convention, including\r\nsome Member States.\nGiven the international dimension of\r\nmatch-fixing, the Convention is also open to non-European countries.\u00a0 This\r\naspect is crucial since world-wide cooperation, notably with countries where\r\nsports betting is widespread such as South-East Asian countries, is considered\r\nan essential element in effectively fighting trans-national organised crime\r\nnetworks involved in match-fixing and operating in different continents.\u00a0 The\r\nCommission considers that the Convention can be an effective instrument in the\r\nfight against match-fixing.\nArticle 165 TFEU states that Union action\r\nshall be aimed at developing the European dimension in sport by, inter alia,\r\npromoting fairness and openness in sporting competitions and cooperation\r\nbetween bodies responsible for sports.\u00a0 In addition, Article 165 TFEU calls for\r\nthe Union and the Member States to foster cooperation with international\r\norganisations in the field of sport, in particular the Council of Europe.\u00a0\u00a0 EU\r\naction can help address transnational challenges encountered by sport in Europe\r\nsuch as match-fixing, where concerted efforts and a closely coordinated\r\napproach are necessary.\u00a0 \nOne of the main objectives of the\r\nConvention is to promote national and international cooperation, with Chapter\r\nIII setting out a number of provisions to facilitate the exchange of\r\ninformation between all interested parties.\u00a0 The fight against match-fixing\r\nrequires close cooperation between the sport movement, governments, betting\r\noperators, law enforcement authorities and international organisations.\u00a0 Such a\r\nwide range of interested parties has its' own challenges; the EU can help bring\r\ntogether and ensure a coordinated approach.\nMember States are at various stages of\r\ndevelopment in the fight to tackle match-fixing.\u00a0 The transnational nature of\r\nmatch-fixing will likely involve working with the Member States with varying\r\ndegrees of experience, creating the need for the sharing of good practice and\r\ndevelopment of competences.\u00a0 Here, the EU has an important role to play in\r\ncapacity-building, catalysing cooperation and ultimately helping to implement\r\nthe Convention.\nThe signature of this Convention should be\r\npart of the Commission's efforts to participate in the fight against match\r\nfixing, in conjunction with other tools such as the forthcoming Commission\r\ninitiative on betting-related match-fixing in line with the 2012 Commission\r\nCommunication on online gambling,[6]\r\nthe work of the EU Expert Group on match-fixing, and Preparatory Actions and\r\nprojects dedicated to match-fixing.[7]\nAccording to the Council decisions\r\nauthorizing the opening of negotiations the accession by the Union should be\r\npreceded by a competence analysis, stating that \" the legal nature of\r\nthe Convention and distribution of powers between the Member States and the\r\nUnion will be determined separately at the end of the negotiations on the basis\r\nof an analysis of the precise scope of the coverage of the individual\r\nprovisions\".\nThis competence analysis is set out in the following: \nNature and\r\nscope of the Union's competence\nPursuant to Article 1 of the Convention,\r\nits purpose is \"to combat the manipulation of sports competitions in\r\norder to protect the integrity of sport and sports ethics in accordance with\r\nthe principle of the autonomy of sport\".\u00a0 For this purpose, the\r\nultimate objective of the Convention is \"to protect the integrity of\r\nsport and sports ethics\".\u00a0 It does so by taking a number of measures\r\nthat aim at preventing, detecting and sanctioning the manipulation of sports\r\ncompetitions.\u00a0 In view of that purpose, the Convention also promotes\r\ninternational cooperation and sets-up a monitoring mechanism to ensure that the\r\nprovisions laid down in the Convention are followed up.\nThe Convention thereby embodies a\r\nmultifaceted approach to address the manipulation of sports competitions.\u00a0\r\nAccordingly, measures to be adopted vary in nature and affect different areas\r\nof law, with the prevention aspect being pervasive.[8]\u00a0 Other areas of law\r\nconcerned are substantive criminal law, judicial cooperation in criminal\r\nmatters, data protection, and also regulation of betting activities.\nPrevention\r\n(Chapters II-III, Articles 4-14)\nMost of the provisions on prevention in the\r\nConvention could be covered by Article 165(4) first indent TFEU concerning\r\nsupportive measures in the field of sports.[9]\u00a0\r\nHowever, this type of competence is limited in its scope, as it excludes any\r\nharmonization of the laws and regulations of the Member States.\u00a0 Article 165\r\nTFEU refers to the \"promotion\", \"cooperation\" or\r\n\"incentive\" measures.\u00a0 As a consequence, the Union's competence does\r\nnot supersede that of the Member States in that area.[10] \nBy contrast, measures in relation to\r\nbetting services may touch upon the internal market freedoms concerning the\r\nright of establishment and the freedom to provide services, to the extent that\r\nbetting operators exercise an economic activity.\u00a0 As regards Article 3(5)(a)\r\nand 11 in particular, the definition of \"illegal sports betting\"\r\nrefers to any sports betting whose type or operator is not allowed by virtue of\r\napplicable law in the jurisdiction of the Party, where the gambler is located.\u00a0\r\nThe term \"applicable law\" includes EU law.\u00a0 This implies that any\r\nright granted by EU law must also be borne in mind and that national law of the\r\nMember States has to be in conformity with EU law in particular with internal\r\nmarket rules.\nArticles 9 to 11 envisage measures that\r\ncould lead to a certain degree of approximation of laws.\u00a0 For instance, Article\r\n9 of the Convention proposes an indicative list of measures which could\r\nbe applied by the respective regulatory betting authority \"where\r\nappropriate\" to combat the manipulation of sports competitions in\r\nrelation to sports betting.\u00a0 Article 10(1) of the Convention states that \"each\r\nParty shall adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to\r\nprevent conflicts of interest and misuse of inside information by natural or\r\nlegal persons involved in providing sports betting products (\u2026)\"\r\n(emphasis added).\u00a0 Article 10(3) of the Convention aims at establishing\r\nreporting obligations by stating: \"Each Party shall adopt such\r\nlegislative or other measures as may be necessary to oblige sports\r\nbetting operators to report irregular or suspicious betting without delay to\r\nthe betting regulatory authority (...)\" (emphasis added).\u00a0 Finally,\r\nArticle 11 of the Convention on illegal sports betting grants even greater\r\nleeway to the Parties.\u00a0 It reads: \"each Party shall explore the most\r\nappropriate means to fight operators of illegal sports betting and shall\r\nconsider adopting measures, in accordance with the applicable law of the\r\nrelevant jurisdiction, such as (\u2026)\". \nThis shows that Articles 9, 10(1) and 10(3)\r\nof the Convention create a basis for possible harmonisation under Article 114\r\nTFEU, to the extent that betting operators exercise an economic activity.\u00a0\r\nArticle 11, which contains even more flexible wording, still involves some\r\ndegree of approximation of provisions which may also be covered by Article 114\r\nTFEU on the establishment and functioning of the internal market.\nIn addition, Article 11 of the Convention\r\nmay also affect services provided from a third country.\u00a0 The measures in\r\nquestion, which concern directly \"access\" of such services, would be\r\ncovered by the Union's common commercial policy pursuant to Article 207 TFEU. \nArticle 14 of the Convention on data\r\nprotection comes under the Union's competence according to Article 16 TFEU.\nLaw\r\nenforcement (Chapters IV-VI; Articles 15-25)\nChapter IV concerns criminal law and\r\ncooperation with regards to enforcement (articles 15 to 18).\u00a0 Article 15 of the\r\nConvention does not impose the overall incrimination of conduct of manipulation\r\nof sports competitions, but only certain forms (where they involve corruption,\r\ncoercion or fraud).\u00a0 This could be covered by Article 83(1) TFEU when committed\r\nby organised crime or through corrupt practices.[11]\u00a0 However, Article 15\r\nis not limited to organised crime and it also includes coercion and fraud\r\nwithout any corruptive behaviour.\u00a0 In this context, the relevant EU acquis\r\nis limited.\nArticle 16 concerns money laundering.\u00a0 At\r\nUnion level, this is regulated by Council Framework Decision 2001/500/JHA,[12] along with Directive\r\n2014/42EU.[13]\u00a0\r\nArticle 16(3) of the Convention falls under EU competence and Article 114 TFEU;\r\nDirective 2005/60/EC on the prevention of the use of the financial system for\r\nthe purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing is based on Article 114\r\nTFEU.[14]\u00a0\r\nAs the directive does not cover specifically sports competitions, it does not\r\ninterfere with Article 16(3) of the Convention, which concerns \"sports\r\nbetting operators\" only.\u00a0 Competence over Articles 17, 18, 22 and 23 (in\r\nchapters IV and VI) is linked to the competence under Articles 15 and 16 of the\r\nConvention.\nChapter V on jurisdiction, criminal\r\nprocedure and enforcement measures, and Chapter VI on sanctions and measures,\r\ncontain provisions which accompany the substantive criminal law provisions\r\ncontained in Article 15 to 18 of the Convention.\u00a0 Article 19 of the Convention\r\n(jurisdiction) is an accessory provision to the establishment of the criminal\r\nprovisions.\u00a0 Articles 20, 21 and 25 of the Convention (investigative measures,\r\nprotection measures, seizure and confiscation) are criminal procedural measures\r\nwhich may be covered by Article 82(2) TFEU (points (a) and (b)).\nInternational cooperation (Chapters VII;\r\nArticles 26-28)\nChapter VII concerns international\r\ncooperation in judicial and other matters.\u00a0 It is important to note that the\r\nConvention does not contain any legal regime that would replace existing rules,\r\nand it is therefore without prejudice to instruments which already exist in the\r\nfield of mutual assistance in criminal matters and extradition.[15]\u00a0 In this context,\r\nthere is a comprehensive set of instruments at European level in order to\r\nfacilitate judicial cooperation in criminal matters which would apply either to\r\nthe different modi operandi of match-fixing or upon criminalization of\r\nmatch-fixing as a new offence in the domestic legal order of the Member States.[16]\u00a0 This would cover\r\nArticle 26 of the Convention.\nArticles 27 and 28 of the Convention are\r\ngeneral provisions on cooperation which are covered by Article 165 TFEU.\nConclusions\nCertain offences are currently not covered\r\nby Article 83(1) TFEU.\u00a0 The Union has competence over the rest, but is\r\nexclusive only over two provisions - Article 11 (to the extent that it applies\r\nto services from and to third countries) and Article 14 on data protection (in\r\npart).[17]\u00a0\r\nThe remainder is shared or \"supportive\" competence.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nAs far as the legal basis is concerned, it\r\nis established case-law that the choice of legal basis for an EU measure must\r\nrest on objective factors that are amenable to judicial review; these include\r\nthe aim and the content of the measure.[18]\u00a0\r\nIf examination of a European Union measure reveals that it pursues a twofold\r\npurpose or that it has a twofold component and if one of those is identifiable\r\nas the main or predominant purpose or component, whereas the other is merely\r\nincidental, the measure must be founded on a single legal basis, namely that\r\nrequired by the main or predominant purpose or component.\u00a0 By way of exception,\r\nif it is established that the measure pursues several objectives which are\r\ninseparably linked without one being secondary and indirect in relation to the\r\nother, the measures must be founded on the various corresponding legal bases.[19] \nThe legal bases which potentially have\r\nrelevance here are: Article 16 TFEU (data protection), Article 82(1) and 82(2)\r\nTFEU (judicial cooperation in criminal matters), Article 83(1) TFEU\r\n(substantive criminal law), Articles 114 TFEU (establishment and functioning of\r\nthe internal market), Article 165 TFEU (sports) and Article 207 TFEU (common\r\ncommercial policy). \nTaken as a whole, the objective of\r\ncombatting the manipulation of sports competitions contains elements of\r\nprevention and cooperation which are mainly covered by Article 165 TFEU and\r\nelements of cooperation and approximation which are covered by Articles 114\r\n(for the non-criminal provisions), Article 207 TFEU (insofar as those\r\nprovisions relate to access by third country betting operators) and Articles\r\n82(1) and 83 TFEU (for criminal matters).\nInsofar as the betting services are\r\nconcerned, Articles 114 and 207 TFEU may be relevant, depending on whether the\r\nservices are \"intra EU\" or not.\u00a0 It appears that the internal market\r\naspect is more prominent in the Convention as a whole, whereas the common\r\ncommercial policy aspect appears to be present only in Article 11 of the\r\nConvention.\u00a0 However, even if Article 207 TFEU is not mentioned and considered\r\nancillary to the internal market aspects, Member States are not competent to\r\nthe relevant aspects which fall in the common commercial policy. \nAs regards data protection, it is not the\r\nmain objective of the Convention and its provisions are simply incidental.\u00a0 Nowadays\r\nmany Conventions of the Council of Europe will recall that data protection\r\nneeds to be respected, even if such obligations may flow from other Conventions\r\nas well (such as Convention No 108 for the Protection of Individuals with\r\nregard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data), insofar as the Parties to\r\neach Convention may not be identical.\nAs a consequence, for the EU to exercise\r\nits competences over the entirety of the Convention (excluding the elements\r\nover which it would have no competence), the main legal bases are Articles\r\n82(1), 83(1), 114 and 165 TFEU.\nIt follows from the intertwined nature of the Convention, and the\r\nfact that it involves competences which may be exclusive of the EU and\r\ncompetences not granted to the EU, that it is not possible for the Union or the\r\nMember States to conclude the Convention in isolation.\u00a0 \n2015/0042 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, of the Council of Europe Convention on the manipulation of sports\r\ncompetitions with regard to matters not related to substantive criminal law and\r\njudicial cooperation in criminal matters\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 114 and 165 TFEU\r\nin conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 10 June 2013, the\r\nCouncil authorised the Commission to participate, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, in the negotiations for an international convention of the Council of\r\nEurope to combat the manipulation of sports competitions (hereinafter referred\r\nto as \"the Convention\") with the exception of matters related to\r\ncooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 23 September 2013, the\r\nCouncil adopted a second authorization for the Commission to participate, on\r\nbehalf of the European Union, in the negotiations for the Convention as regards\r\nmatters related to cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation. [20]\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The negotiations were\r\nsuccessfully concluded by the adoption of the Convention by the Council of\r\nEurope Committee of Ministers on 9 July 2014.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provisions on prevention\r\nare mainly laid down in chapters II and III of the Convention.[21] These provisions may\r\npotentially be covered, in full or to a large extent, by Article 165 TFEU. It\r\nis to be mentioned that Article 165 TFEU is only a supportive competence which\r\nexcludes any harmonization measures and does not supersede the competences of\r\nMember States in these areas.[22]\r\n\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other measures, notably\r\nArticles 9, 10 (1) and (3) and 11 of the Convention contain some limited\r\napproximation of laws which can be covered by Article 114 TFEU. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 11 may also affect\r\nservices provided from a third country. The measures in question, which concern\r\ndirectly \"access\" of such services, are covered by common commercial\r\npolicy (Article 207 TFEU). Member States are not competent to the relevant\r\naspects which fall in the common commercial policy. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 14 on data\r\nprotection comes under the Union's competence according to Article 16 TFEU and\r\nis also exclusive in nature. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union is\r\npromoting the signing of the Council of Europe Convention on the manipulation\r\nof sports competitions, as a contribution to the European Union's effort to\r\ncombat the manipulation of sports competitions in order to protect the\r\nintegrity of sport and sports ethics in accordance with the principle of\r\nautonomy of sport.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the Convention\r\nshould be signed on behalf of the European Union, subject to its conclusion at\r\na later date.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe signing of the Council of Europe\r\nConvention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions is hereby approved on\r\nbehalf of the Union, subject to the conclusion of the said Convention.\nThe text of the Convention to be signed is\r\nattached to this Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe Council Secretariat General shall\r\nestablish the instrument of full powers to sign the Convention, subject to its\r\nconclusion, for the person(s) indicated by the negotiator of the Convention.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall enter into force on\r\nthe\u00a0 day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0
