These particular effects have been described in a 2012 report issued by the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT)\n3\n, and are now the subject of a detailed study and re-assessment conducted by the ECC\u2019s Working Group on Spectrum Engineering \u2013 Short-range devices (SE24). The target date for work on this item to be concluded in SE24 is currently Q1 2016\n4\n.\n\n\nThe density of radio links close to airports in Iceland and in Norway, and the intensity of their use are higher than in the EU. An exemption is therefore needed as regards the frequency band 6,0-8,5 GHz in order to avoid the occurrence of harmful interference to the mobile operators\u2019 radio links. The following adaptation is inserted in the Joint Committee Decision:\n\n\n\u201cIceland and Norway shall be exempted from allowing the use of the 6.0 to 8.5 GHz band by equipment using ultra-wideband technology onboard aircraft.\u201d\n\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\n\nArticle 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94\n5\n concerning arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement provides that the Council establishes the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf on such Decisions, on a proposal from the Commission. \n\n\nThe Commission submits the Draft Decision of the EEA Joint Committee for adoption by the Council as the Union\u2019s position. The Commission would hope to be able to present it in the EEA Joint Committee at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\n\n2015/0300 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, in the EEA Joint Committee concerning an amendment to Annex XI (Electronic communication, audiovisual services and information society)\nto the EEA Agreement\n(ultra-wide band)\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 of 28 November 1994\n6\n concerning arrangements for implementing the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 1(3) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Agreement on the European Economic Area ('the EEA Agreement') entered into force on 1 January 1994.\n\n\n(2)Pursuant to Article 98 of the EEA Agreement, the EEA Joint Committee may decide to amend, inter alia, Annex XI (Electronic communication, audiovisual services and information society) to the EEA Agreement.\n\n\n(3)Commission Implementing Decision 2014/702/EU\n7\n is to be incorporated into the EEA Agreement. The density of radio links close to airports in Iceland and in Norway, and the intensity of their use are higher than in the EU. In order to avoid the occurrence of harmful interference to the mobile operators\u2019 radio links, Iceland and Norway should be exempted from allowing the use of the 6.0 to 8.5 GHz band by equipment using ultra-wideband technology onboard aircraft.\n\n\n(4)Annex XI (Electronic communication, audiovisual services and information society) to the EEA Agreement should therefore be amended accordingly. \n\n\n(5)The position of the Union within the EEA Joint Committee should therefore be based on the attached draft Decision,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position to be adopted, on behalf of the Union, within the EEA Joint Committee on the proposed amendment to Annex XI (Electronic communication, audiovisual services and information society) to the EEA\u00a0Agreement shall be based on the draft decision of the EEA\u00a0Joint Committee attached to this\u00a0Decision.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ L 293, 9.10.2014, p. 48-56.\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ L 55, 23.2.2007, p.
