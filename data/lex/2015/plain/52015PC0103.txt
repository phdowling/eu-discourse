Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 is\r\napplied by all Member States, with the exception of Ireland and the United\r\nKingdom. \nRegulation (EU)\r\nNo 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council[2] amended Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 539/2001 by transferring 19 countries to Annex II, which lists the third\r\ncountries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement. Those 19\r\ncountries are: Colombia, Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,\r\nMicronesia, Nauru, Palau, Peru, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. The reference to each of those countries in\r\nAnnex II is accompanied by a footnote which specifies that \"the exemption\r\nfrom the visa requirement shall apply from the date of entry into force of an\r\nagreement on visa exemption to be concluded with the European Union\". \nRegulation (EU)\r\nNo 509/2014 was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June\r\n2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to\r\nauthorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the\r\nfollowing 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,\r\nMicronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa,\r\nSolomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United\r\nArab Emirates and Vanuatu[3].\r\nOn 9 October 2014, The Council addressed negotiating directives to the\r\nCommission.\nColombia and\r\nPeru are, according to Recital 5 of Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 and the\r\njoint declaration issued at the time of adoption, subject to a specific\r\nprocedure which requires a further assessment of the fulfilment by them of the\r\nrelevant criteria, before the Commission can present to the Council\r\nrecommendations for decisions authorising the opening of negotiations on visa\r\nwaiver agreements with those two countries. They were therefore not included in\r\nthe above-mentioned Recommendation to the Council.\u00a0 \nThe\u00a0\r\nnegotiations on the visa waiver agreement with the United Arab Emirates (UAE)\r\nwere opened on 5 November 2014 in Brussels. During that meeting the entire\r\ndraft text could be reviewed and agreement was reached on all its aspects.\r\nAfter a number of subsequent informal exchanges, the agreement was initialled\r\nby the chief negotiators on 20 November 2014. \nThe Member States were informed during the\r\nmeeting of the Visa Working Party of the Council held on 21 November 2014.\nOn the part of the Union, the legal basis\r\nfor the agreement is point (a) of Article 77(2) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjunction with Article 218\r\nthereof.\n[\u2026] signed the\r\nAgreement on [\u2026] on behalf of the Union. In accordance with point (a) of the\r\nsecond subparagraph of Article 218(6) TFEU, the European Parliament\u2019s consent\r\nfor the conclusion of the Agreement was given on [\u2026].\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OUTCOME OF THE\r\nNEGOTIATIONS\nThe Commission\r\nconsiders that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives\r\nwere attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the\r\nUnion.\nThe final\r\ncontent of it can be summarised as follows:\nPurpose\nThe agreement provides for visa-free travel\r\nfor the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the UAE when\r\ntravelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period\r\nof 90 days in any 180-day period. \nIn order to safeguard equal treatment of\r\nall EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that\r\nthe UAE may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the\r\nMember States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or\r\nterminate the agreement\u00a0 in respect of all of its Member States.\nThe specific\r\nsituation of the United Kingdom and Ireland is reflected in the preamble. \nScope\nThe visa waiver covers all categories of\r\npersons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders)\r\ntravelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a\r\npaid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also the UAE\r\nremain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party\r\nin accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure\r\nharmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on\r\nthe interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of\r\ncarrying out a paid activity.\nDuration of stay\nThe agreement provides for visa-free travel\r\nfor the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the UAE when\r\ntravelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period\r\nof 90 days in any 180-day period. A joint declaration on the interpretation of\r\nthis period of 90 days is attached to the agreement. \nThe agreement takes into account the\r\nsituation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis\r\nin full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal\r\nborders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of the UAE to stay\r\nfor 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States\r\n(Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated\r\nfor the whole Schengen area.\nTerritorial application\nThe agreement contains provisions related\r\nto its territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the\r\nvisa waiver would entitle nationals of the UAE to stay only in those Member\r\nStates\u2019 European territories.\nDeclarations\nOther joint\r\ndeclarations are attached to the agreement:\n- on the full\r\ndissemination of information about the content and consequences of the visa\r\nwaiver agreement and related issues, such as the entry conditions, and\n- on the\r\nassociation of Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the\r\nimplementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONCLUSIONS\nIn the light of the above-mentioned\r\nresults, the Commission proposes that the Council approve, after obtaining the\r\nconsent of the European Parliament, the Agreement between the European Union\r\nand the UAE on the short-stay visa waiver.\n2015/0062 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion of the Agreement between\r\nthe European Union and the United Arab Emirates on the short-stay visa waiver\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion, and in particular point (a) of Article 77(2), in conjunction with point\r\n(a) of the second subparagraph of Article 218(6), thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission has negotiated on behalf of the European Union an Agreement with the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates on the short-stay visa waiver (hereinafter \u2018the\r\nAgreement\u2019). \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\r\nAgreement was signed, on behalf of the European Union, on \u2026\u2026.2015 and has been\r\nprovisionally applied since that date, subject to its possible conclusion at a\r\nlater date, in accordance with Decision\u2026\u2026../\u2026\u2026/EU of the Council of [\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nAgreement should be approved.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nAgreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement,\r\nwhich shall adopt its rules of procedure.

Among others, it means that\r\nan absence for an uninterrupted period of 90 days allows for a new stay for up\r\nto 90 days.\nJOINT DECLARATION ON THE INFORMATION OF THE\r\nCITIZENS ABOUT THE VISA WAIVER AGREEMENT\nRecognising the importance of transparency for\r\nthe citizens of the European Union and the nationals of the United Arab\r\nEmirates, the Contracting Parties agree to ensure full dissemination of\r\ninformation about the content and consequences of the visa waiver agreement and\r\nrelated issues, such as the entry conditions.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
