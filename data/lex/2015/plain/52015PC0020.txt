Greater transparency in investor-state\r\ndispute settlement is an important objective, as it aims at providing maximum\r\naccess of the public to documents and hearings, as well as allowing interested\r\nthird parties to make submissions. This is important as Investor-State dispute\r\nsettlement may concern disputes raising questions relating to public policies\r\nor impact public finances.\nThe Commission has since 2010 focussed on\r\nimproving transparency for investor-state dispute settlement.[1] This was explicitly\r\nrequested by the European Parliament in its resolution on the future European\r\nInvestment Policy[2].\r\nAt the same time as ensuring that future EU agreements provide for a high\r\ndegree of transparency, the Commission has been instrumental in pushing in the\r\nUnited Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) for global\r\ntransparency rules for investor-state dispute settlement and to develop\r\nmechanisms to apply these improved transparency rules to the 3,000 existing\r\ninvestment treaties. The present proposal delivers on the policy objectives set\r\nin 2010 and the European Parliament\u2019s request of 2011, demonstrates the\r\nCommission\u2019s determination to reform and improve the investor-state dispute\r\nsettlement system as a whole and is tangible proof of the benefits of a common\r\nEU external investment policy \u2013 such a result would have been highly unlikely\r\nwithout such a common EU external investment policy. \nUNCITRAL adopted on 10 July 2013 rules on\r\ntransparency for investor-state dispute settlement (\u201cthe Transparency Rules\u201d),\r\nwhich were in turn endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on 16\r\nDecember 2013[3].\r\nThese provide for all documents to be made public (both decisions of the\r\ntribunal and submissions of the parties), for hearings to be open to the public\r\nand for interested parties (civil society) to make submissions to the tribunal.\r\nAppropriate protections for confidential information are provided, but these do\r\nnot go beyond comparable protections in domestic courts. The Union will use\r\nthese rules as the basis for the provisions on transparency on investor-state dispute\r\nsettlement in all agreements currently under negotiations and has included them\r\nor comparable rules and indeed gone further in the draft Comprehensive Economic\r\nand Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada and the draft EU-Singapore FTA. \nThe rules became effective on 1 April 2014.\r\nThey apply automatically to investor-state dispute settlement arising on the\r\nbasis of treaties concluded after 1 April 2014 where a reference was made\r\ntherein to UNCITRAL Arbitration rules. At the same time, the Transparency Rules\r\ndo not apply to treaties concluded prior to that date. Given the very high\r\nnumber of existing investment agreements concluded prior to 1 April 2014, it is\r\nimportant to ensure the application of the Transparency Rules to those\r\nagreements. The European Union is a party to one such agreement - the Energy\r\nCharter Treaty - and the Member States of the European Union are parties to\r\naround 1,400 such agreements with third countries. \nAs a consequence, together with other\r\nUNCITRAL Members, the Union has pushed for the negotiation of a multilateral\r\nconvention which would facilitate the application of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules\r\nto existing investment treaties. On 10 February 2014, the Council authorised\r\nthe Commission to negotiate such a convention under the auspices of UNCITRAL\r\n(The Convention) and the Union, represented by the Commission has actively\r\nparticipated in the negotiation of the Convention. The negotiations were\r\nconcluded on 9 July 2014 and\r\nthe Convention adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December\r\n2014[4]. The Convention will be open for signature on 17 March 2015 in Port Louis, Mauritius and thereafter at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. \nThe Convention applies to investment\r\ntreaties concluded before 1 April 2014 and establishes a mechanism allowing\r\ncountries and regional economic integration organisations to agree between\r\nthemselves to apply the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules in disputes covered by\r\ninvestment treaties to which they are parties. It permits both the Union and the\r\n  Member States to adhere to the Convention and to apply the Transparency Rules\r\nto their existing investment treaties. By signing the Convention, the European\r\nUnion could become a party to the Convention in respect of the Energy Charter\r\nTreaty and the Member States could become a party to the Convention in respect\r\nof their existing agreements. The Convention provides for a negative list\r\napproach, i.e. the Transparency Rules will apply unless a signatory lists\r\nparticular agreements as not being subject to the Convention by making a\r\nreservation under Article 3.\nWith respect to the Energy Charter Treaty,\r\nthe European Union would become a party to the Convention in order to extend\r\nthe scope of application of the Transparency Rules to investor-State disputes\r\nunder the Energy Charter Treaty in which the Union is a respondent and the\r\nclaimant is of a non-EU State that that has not excluded the application of the\r\nconvention to disputes arising under the Energy Charter Treaty.\nHaving regard to the Treaty of the Functioning\r\nof the European Union (TFEU) and in particular of Article 207 and Articles 63\r\nto 66, in conjunction with Article 3(2), the conclusion of international\r\nagreements in the field of foreign investments is part of the Union's exclusive\r\ncompetence since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. It is the\r\nCommission's view that the Union's exclusive competence to adopt legally\r\nbinding acts in the field of foreign investment covers all matters relating to\r\nforeign investment (foreign direct investment and portfolio investment),\r\nincluding matters relating to the settlement of investment disputes.\nAs a result, the maintenance in force of\r\nbilateral investment treaties signed by Member States with third countries\r\nbefore 1 December 2009 has been authorized pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1219/2012 of 12 December 2012[5]\r\nand the signing and conclusion of bilateral investment treaties between Member\r\nStates and third countries after 1 December 2009 must be authorized pursuant to\r\nArticles 11 or 12 of Regulation (EU) No 1219/2012. The signing and conclusion\r\nof this Convention also falls into the ambit of the European Union's exclusive\r\ncompetence and, in accordance with Article 2(1) TFEU, Member States may adopt\r\nlegally binding acts within this area only if so empowered to do so by the Union. Therefore, the Union should empower Member States to become parties to the\r\nConvention to allow them to extend the application of the Transparency Rules to\r\ntheir bilateral investment agreements with non-EU countries concluded prior to\r\n1 April 2014 and which are maintained in force pursuant to Article 3 of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1219/2012. This empowerment also covers Member States when\r\nthey act as respondents pursuant to the Energy Charter Treaty in respect of\r\ncases brought by non-EU investors[6].\r\nThe Commission, consistent with the objective of increasing transparency of the\r\ninvestor-state dispute settlement system considers that Member States should\r\nprovide for the application of the Transparency Rules to all of the\r\naforementioned treaties, i.e. by ratifying the Convention without carving out its\r\napplication to any of them.\n. Finally it should be noted that the\r\nCommission plans to provide the funding for the website upon which all\r\ndocuments subject to the Transparency Rules will be provided. \nThe Commission herewith submits a proposal\r\nfor a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Convention by the European\r\nUnion and on the empowerment of Member States to individually adhere to the\r\nConvention. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe UNCITRAL Convention on transparency in\r\ntreaty-based investor-State arbitration allows for the extension of the\r\napplication of the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency. Observers and civil society\r\nhave participated in the negotiation of the Convention. They had the\r\nopportunity to make their views known.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS\r\nOF THE PROPOSAL\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(4), 1st\r\nsubparagraph in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) thereof, the Commission is\r\nsubmitting a proposal to the Council for a decision on the conclusion, on\r\nbehalf of the European Union, of the United Nations Commission on International\r\nTrade Law Convention on transparency in treaty-based investor-State\r\narbitration.\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union and in particular Article 2(1), this proposal\r\nalso includes an empowerment of Member States to conclude the United Nations\r\nCommission on International Trade Law Convention on transparency in\r\ntreaty-based investor-State arbitration.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThere are no budgetary implications.\n2015/0012 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, of the United Nations Convention on transparency in\r\ntreaty-based investor-State arbitration\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion, and in particular Article\r\n207(4), 1st subparagraph, in conjunction with Article\r\n218(6)(a) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the entry into\r\nforce of the Treaty of Lisbon, foreign direct investment is included in the list\r\nof matters falling under the common commercial policy. In accordance with\r\nArticle 3(1)(e) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\r\n(\u2018TFEU\u2019), the European Union has exclusive competence with respect to the\r\ncommon commercial policy. Accordingly, only the Union may legislate and adopt\r\nlegally binding acts within that area. The Member States are able to do so\r\nthemselves only if so empowered by the Union, in accordance with Article 2(1)\r\nTFEU.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, Chapter 4 of\r\nTitle IV of Part Three TFEU lays down common rules on the movement of capital\r\nbetween Member States and third countries, including in respect of capital\r\nmovements involving investments. Those rules can be affected by international\r\nagreements relating to foreign investment concluded by Member States with third\r\ncountries.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Council Decision\r\n[XXX] of [\u2026], the United Nations Commission on\r\nInternational Trade Law Convention on transparency in treaty-based\r\ninvestor-State arbitration was signed on [\u2026], subject to its conclusion at a later date.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is desirable to apply\r\ntransparency rules to investor-State dispute settlement to the greatest extent\r\npossible. As regards the European Union the transparency rules should apply to\r\nthe Energy Charter Treaty. It is desirable that the Member States conclude the\r\nConvention, and apply it to existing bilateral investment treaties with third\r\ncountries.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The agreement should be approved\r\non behalf of the European\r\nUnion, Member States should be empowered to conclude the Convention and\r\napply it to existing bilateral investment treaties with third countries as well\r\nas to disputes under the Energy Charter Treaty with investors of third\r\ncountries,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe Convention\r\non transparency in treaty-based investor-State arbitration elaborated under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law is hereby\r\napproved on behalf of the Union. The text of the Agreement is attached to this\r\nDecision.\nArticle 2\nMember States\r\nare empowered to individually conclude the Convention in relation to their\r\nbilateral investment agreements with third countries authorised in application\r\nof Regulation (EU) No 1219/2012 of 12 December 2012 and in relation to the\r\npossible application of the Energy Charter Treaty in disputes between the\r\nMember States and investors of third countries as provided for in the context\r\nof the Energy Charter Treaty[7].\nArticle 3\nThe President\r\nof the Council shall designate the person empowered to proceed, on behalf of\r\nthe European Union, to the deposit of the instrument of approval provided for\r\nin Article 7 of the Agreement, in order to express the consent of the European\r\nUnion to be bound by the Agreement.\nArticle 4\nThis\r\nDecision shall enter into force on\r\n[\u2026].\nDone at

treaty-based investor-State arbitration\nPreamble \nThe Parties to this Convention,\nRecognizing\r\nthe value of arbitration as a method of settling disputes that may arise in the\r\ncontext of international relations, and the extensive and wide-ranging use of\r\narbitration for the settlement of investor-State disputes,\nAlso recognizing the need for provisions on transparency in the settlement of\r\ntreaty-based investor-State disputes to take account of the public interest\r\ninvolved in such arbitrations,\nBelieving\r\nthat the Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration\r\nadopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on 11 July\r\n2013 (\u201cUNCITRAL Rules on Transparency\u201d), effective as of 1 April 2014, would\r\ncontribute significantly to the establishment of a harmonized legal framework\r\nfor a fair and efficient settlement of international investment disputes, \nNoting the\r\ngreat number of treaties providing for the protection of investments or\r\ninvestors already in force, and the practical importance of promoting the\r\napplication of the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency to arbitration under those\r\nalready concluded investment treaties, \nNoting also\r\narticle 1(2) and (9) of the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency,\nHave agreed\r\nas follows:\nScope of application\nArticle
