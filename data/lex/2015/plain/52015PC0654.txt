"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 16.12.2015\nCOM(2015) 654 final\n2015/0298(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nconcluding an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the People's Republic of China pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nWith the accession of the Republic of Croatia, the European Union enlarged its customs union. Consequently, the European Union was required under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules (Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994) to enter into negotiations with WTO Members having negotiating rights related to the tariff schedule of Croatia in order to eventually agree on a compensatory adjustment. Such adjustment is due if the adoption of the EU\u2019s external tariff regime results in an increase in tariff beyond the level for which the acceding country has bound itself at the WTO.\n\n\nOn 15 July 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994. The Commission has negotiated with the Members of the WTO holding negotiating rights with respect to the withdrawal of specific concessions in relation to the withdrawal of the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union. \n\n\nNegotiations with the People's Republic of China resulted in a draft Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters that was initialled on 7 October 2015 in Brussels (the Agreement). Consequently, this proposal asks the Council to adopt a decision to conclude the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters with People's Republic of China. In parallel, a separate proposal on the signature of this Agreement is also submitted.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe proposal is consistent with EU practice followed in previous EU enlargements.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe proposal follows EU practice which is consistent with the EU external action, industrial and agricultural policies.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nArticle 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjuction with Article 218(5) of the TFEU for the signature of international agreements.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe proposal falls under exclusive competence of the Union, Article 3(1)(e) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe People's Republic of China was affected by the withdrawal of Croatia's concessions. The compensatory adjustments do not exceed China's rights in this respect. The proposal complies with the proportionality treatment.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nA Decision of the Council to conclude the Agreement is required under Article 218(5) TFEU.\n\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nThe Council (Trade Policy Committee) has been regularly consulted on the content and advancement of the negotiations. The European Parliament (INTA Committee) has been informed.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nSee Financial Statement.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nThis proposal asks the Council to adopt a Decision to conclude the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters with the People's Republic of China. In parallel, a separate proposal on the signature of this Agreement is also being submitted to the Council.\n\n\n\nThe results of the Agreement will have to be incorporated, for industrial goods, into Annex I of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff by means of a Commission implementing regulation amending the Annex, on the basis of Article 9 of Regulation, to reduce the conventional rate of duty fixed in the Common Customs Tariff as follows:\n\n\n\u2013On tariff line 6404 19 90 (footwear with outer soles of rubbers or plastics - other) lower the current bound EU duty of 17 % to 16,9%\n\n\n\u2013On tariff line 8415 10 90 (window or wall air conditioning machines \"split-system\") lower the current bound EU duty of 2,7 % to 2,5%.\n\n\nFor the agriculture quota increases, the Commission will adopt an implementing Regulaltion to open and administer the following quotas, pursuant to Article 187(a) of the Single Common Market Organisation (CMO) Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013):\n\n\n\u2013On tariff line 0703 20\u00a000 add 2\u00a0150 tonnes to the allocation for People's Republic of China under the EU tariff rate quota for garlic, maintaining the present in-quota rate of 9.6%.\n\n\n\u2013Add 650 tonnes to the allocation for People's Republic of China under the EU tariff rate quota for mushroom of species agaricus, prepared, preserved or provisionally preserved; maintaining the present in-quota rates.\n\n\nThese implementation measures are being prepared in parallel to this proposal.\n\n\n2015/0298 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\nconcluding an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the People's Republic of China pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(4), first subparagraph, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament\n1\n,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)On 15 July 2013 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with certain other Members of the World Trade Organization under Article XXIV:6 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994, in the course of the accession to the European Union of the Republic of Croatia.\n\n\n(2)Negotiations have been conducted by the Commission within the framework of the negotiating directives issued by the Council.\n\n\n(3)These negotiations have been concluded and an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the People's Republic of China pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union was initialled on 7 October 2015.\n\n\n(4)The Agreement was signed on behalf of the European Union on [\u2026], subject to the conclusion of the Agreement at a later date, in accordance with Council Decision [\u2026].\n\n\n(5)The Agreement should be concluded,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the People's Republic of China pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union, is hereby concluded.\n\n\nThe text of the Agreement is annexed to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe President of the Council shall designate the person empowered to proceed, on behalf of the European Union, to the notification provided for in the Agreement, in order to express the consent of the European Union to be bound by the Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.
