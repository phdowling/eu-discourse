Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the Commission\r\ndecided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten\r\namendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments\r\nshould endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they\r\nare responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily\r\nunderstandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a\r\ngiven matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 2271/96 of 22 November 1996 protecting against the effects of the\r\nextra-territorial application of legislation adopted by a third country, and\r\nactions based thereon or resulting therefrom[3].\r\nThe new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it[4], fully preserving the\r\ncontent of the acts being codified. At the same time, it is also appropriate to\r\nmake certain substantive amendments to Articles 5 and 12 of Regulation (EC) No 2271/96, with a view to delegating powers to the\r\nCommission for establishing the criteria for the application of a provision\r\ncontained in the second paragraph of Article 5 of that Regulation. Therefore,\r\nthe proposal is being presented in the form of a recast.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The recast proposal was drawn up on the basis of a\r\npreliminary consolidation, in 22 official languages, of Regulation (EC) No 2271/96 and the\r\ninstruments amending it, carried out by the Publications Office of the European\r\nUnion, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have been given\r\nnew numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a\r\ntable set out in Annex III to the recast Regulation.\n\u00ea 2271/96\r\n(adapted)\n2015/0027 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nprotecting against the effects of the\r\nextra-territorial application of legislation adopted by a third country and\r\nactions based thereon or resulting therefrom (recast)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 64 \u00d5 , \u00d6 Article\r\n207(2) \u00d5 and \u00d6 Article\r\n352 \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00f2 new\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No 2271/96[6] has\r\nbeen substantially amended\r\nseveral times[7]. Since\r\nfurther amendments are to be made, that Regulation should be recast in the interests of clarity. \n\u00ea 2271/96 recital\r\n1 (adapted)\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nobjectives of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 include\r\ncontributing to the harmonious development of world trade and to the\r\nprogressive abolition of restrictions on international trade. \n\u00ea 2271/96\r\nrecital 2 (adapted)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\n\u00d6 Union \u00d5 endeavours to\r\nachieve to the greatest extent possible the objective of free movement of\r\ncapital between Member States and third countries, including the removal of any\r\nrestrictions on direct investment \u2014 including investment in real estate \u2014 establishment, the provision of financial services or the admission\r\nof securities to capital markets.\n\u00ea 2271/96 recital\r\n3 (adapted)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\r\nthird country has enacted certain laws, regulations and other legislative\r\ninstruments which purport to regulate activities of natural and legal persons\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the Member \u00d6 States \u00d5. \n\u00ea 2271/96 recital\r\n4\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\r\ntheir extra-territorial application such laws, regulations and other\r\nlegislative instruments violate international law and impede the attainment of\r\nthe aforementioned objectives.\n\u00ea 2271/96 recital\r\n5 (adapted)\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Such\r\nlaws, regulations and other legislative instruments, and actions based thereon\r\nor resulting therefrom affect or are likely to affect the established legal\r\norder and have adverse effects on the interests of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 and the\r\ninterests of natural and legal persons exercising rights under the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) \u00d5.\n\u00ea 2271/96 recital\r\n6 (adapted)\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under\r\nthose exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to protect the established\r\nlegal order, the interests of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 and the\r\ninterests of the said natural and legal persons \u00d6 at Union\r\nlevel \u00d5, in particular\r\nby removing, neutralising, blocking or otherwise countering the effects of the\r\nforeign legislation concerned.\n\u00ea 2271/96 recital\r\n7\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nrequest to supply information under this Regulation does not preclude a Member State from requiring information of the same kind to be provided to the authorities\r\nof that State.\n\u00ea 2271/96 recital\r\n8\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCouncil has adopted the Joint Action 96/668/CFSP[8]\r\nin order to ensure that the Member States take the necessary measures to\r\nprotect those natural and legal persons whose interests are affected by the\r\naforementioned laws and actions based thereon, insofar as those interests are\r\nnot protected by this Regulation.\n\u00ea 37/2014 Art. 1\r\nand Annex .6 (adapted)\n\u00f0 new\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in\r\naccordance with Article 290 TFEU for the purpose of amending Annex I to \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation \u00f0 as well as for establishing criteria for the\r\nauthorisation of persons to comply fully or partially with any requirement or\r\nprohibition, including requests of foreign courts, in cases where\r\nnon-compliance would seriously damage their interests or those of the Union \u00ef. It is of particular importance that the\r\nCommission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work,\r\nincluding at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up\r\ndelegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\r\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the\r\nCouncil.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00d6 In order\r\nto ensure uniform conditions for \u00d5 the\r\nimplementation of \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation, \u00d6 implementing\r\npowers should be conferred on the Commission \u00d5.
