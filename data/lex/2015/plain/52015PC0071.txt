The Convention for the\r\nConservation of Southern Bluefin tuna entered into force on 20 May 1994. \nThe European\r\nUnion has been a Cooperating Non-Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission since\r\n2006. Cooperating Non-Members participate fully in the activities of the CCSBT\r\nbut are not entitled to vote. The status of Cooperating Non-Member requires\r\nadherence to the management and conservation objectives and measures of the\r\nCCSBT.\nAfter several\r\nyears of discussions, the CCSBT amended the Resolution governing the Extended\r\nCommission during its 20th meeting in October 2013 to allow Regional Economic\r\nIntegration Organisations (REIOs) to become a Member of the Extended Commission\r\nthrough Exchange of Letters in which the applicant shall give the CCSBT its firm\r\ncommitment to respect the terms of the Convention and comply with decisions of\r\nthe CCSBT Extended Commission.\nBy its\r\nProposal for a Council Decision on the signing, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, and provisional application of the Exchange of Letters to obtain\r\nmembership of the Extended Commission of the Convention for the Conservation of\r\nSouthern Bluefin Tuna of [XXX], the European\r\nCommission recommended to the Council the signature and provisional application\r\nof the Exchange of Letters to obtain Membership of the CCSBT Extended\r\nCommission. \nUpon\r\ncompletion of this procedure the EU would be entitled to membership and vote in\r\nthe CCSBT Extended Commission and Extended Scientific Committee. \nThe main interest in the CCSBT for the EU\r\nlies in the similarities between the management of Southern Bluefin Tuna\r\n(CCSBT) and Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (ICCAT), and the wish to continue promoting\r\nconsistency in the Union's conservation approach across oceans and reinforcing\r\nits commitment to the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fisheries\r\nresources globally.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot

provisional application of the Exchange\r\nof Letters to obtain membership of the CCSBT Extended Commission and Extended\r\nScientific Committee after having obtained the consent from the European\r\nParliament.\n2015/0036 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nto conclude, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, the Exchange of Letters to obtain membership of the Extended

policy and to enter into agreements with third countries and\r\ninternational organisations.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Council\r\nDecision 98/392/EC ([2]),\r\nthe Union is a Contracting Party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea of 10 December 1982, which requires all members of the international\r\ncommunity to cooperate in conserving and managing the biological resources of\r\nthe sea.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Council\r\nDecision 98/414/EC ([3]),\r\nthe Union is a Contracting Party to the Agreement on the implementation of the\r\nprovisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10\r\nDecember 1982, relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks\r\nand Highly

Commission.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since vessels flying the\r\nflags of Member States of the Union fish resources in the area of distribution\r\nof Southern Bluefin Tuna, it is in the Union's interest to play an effective\r\nrole in the implementation of the Convention.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Such course of action will\r\nalso promote consistency in the Union's conservation approach across oceans and\r\nreinforce its commitment to the long-term conservation and sustainable use of\r\nfisheries resources globally.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Exchange of Letters\r\ntext should therefore be concluded.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe Exchange of Letters to
