In the event of the adoption after 1\r\nJanuary 2014 of new rules or programmes under shared management for the\r\nStructural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural\r\nDevelopment, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the Asylum and Migration\r\nFund and the Internal Security Fund, the MFF shall be revised in order to\r\ntransfer to subsequent years, in excess of the corresponding expenditure ceilings,\r\nallocations not used in 2014. \n2. The revision concerning the transfer\r\nof unused allocation for the year 2014 shall be adopted before 1 May 2015.\nAs a consequence of the late agreement on\r\nthe MFF 2014-2020, the various legal acts laying down provisions for\r\nimplementing the funds were adopted in December 2013 for the European Regional\r\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund (CF)\r\nand the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), and as late\r\nas May 2014 for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), the Asylum,\r\nMigration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the Internal Security Fund (ISF). A\r\nrange of Implementing Acts and Delegated Acts were subsequently adopted in the\r\ncourse of 2014 for each Fund. \nThe Commission\u2019s strategy to launch an\r\ninformal dialogue on the programming documents for the European Structural and\r\nInvestment Funds (ESI Funds, i.e. ERDF, ESF, CF, EAFRD and EMFF) as from 2012\r\nhas achieved important results. The adoption of Partnership Agreements with\r\nMember States took about four month less than in the previous programming\r\nperiod. \nNevertheless, as\r\na result of the late agreement on legal acts, a significant amount of\r\nprogrammes could not be adopted in 2014 and were not advanced enough either to\r\nbenefit from the procedure for carry-over of appropriations under Article 13 of\r\nthe Financial Regulation[2]:\r\nProgrammes which are \"ready for adoption\" at\r\nthe end of 2014, but cannot be adopted formally due to lack of time, can\r\nbenefit from the \"carry-over\" procedure under Article 13(2)(a) of the\r\nFinancial Regulation as regards the 2014 commitment. In this context\r\n\"ready for adoption\" means that the preparatory stages have been\r\ncompleted and no further actions are required before launching the procedure for\r\nthe Commission decision to adopt the programme. In such cases, the carry-over\r\nprocedure allows for the 2014 commitment to be carried over to 2015 provided\r\nthat 2014 amounts are committed up to 31 March 2015. \nAllocations not used in 2014 nor carried\r\nover need to be transferred to subsequent years by means of a revision of the\r\nMFF in accordance with Article 19 of the MFF Regulation. \nThe revision of the MFF ceilings will have\r\nto be accompanied by an Amending Budget as far as 2015 commitment appropriations\r\nare concerned. Both the revision and the Amending Budget will be a prerequisite\r\nfor the adoption of programmes which trigger the budgetary commitment and the\r\npayment of the initial pre-financing.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scope of the revision\nThe revision under Article 19 of the MFF\r\nRegulation applies to the adoption after 1 January 2014 of new rules or\r\nprogrammes under shared management for the ESI Funds, the AMIF and the ISF. It\r\nthus applies to programmes adopted after 1 January 2014 even when the relevant\r\nlegal act was adopted by that time. Moreover, \u2018rules\u2019 covers not only the basic\r\nlegislative acts laying down the provisions for implementing the funds\r\nconcerned, but also implementing and delegated acts, to the extent to which\r\nthey are a prerequisite for preparing or finalising the programmes.\nConsequently, this provision also applies to\r\nfunds from the specific allocation for the Youth Employment Initiative as the\r\nlegal basis is the same as for programmes.\nIt also applies to the Fund for European Aid\r\nto the most Deprived (FEAD) as its commitments originate from the Structural\r\nFunds and are implemented under shared management.\nFinally, Article 19 also covers contributions\r\nfrom the ERDF to the cross-border and sea-basin programmes established under\r\nthe European Neighbourhood Instrument and the Instrument for Pre-Accession\r\nAssistance as those amounts are part of national allocations defined in Article\r\n91(2) of the ESI Funds\u2019 Common Provisions Regulation (CPR)[3].\u00a0 \nConversely, the provision does neither apply\r\nto amounts transferred from the Cohesion Fund to the Connecting Europe\r\nFacility, nor to technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission, nor\r\nto innovative actions, as these are not part of\u00a0 programmes and are managed by\r\nthe Commission under direct management. It does not apply either to\r\ncontributions from Heading 4 of the MFF even when transferred to the ERDF and\r\nthe European Territorial Cooperation objective. \nArticle 19 does not impose any constraints as\r\nto the profile of the transfer of allocations to subsequent years. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 TRANSFER OF ALLOCATIONS\nCommitment appropriations for programmes\r\nunder shared management within the meaning of Article 19 of the MFF Regulation\r\nlapsed in 2014 for an amount of EUR 21,043,639,478 in current prices. This\r\ncorresponds to the 2014 tranches of programmes that could neither be committed\r\nin 2014 nor carried over to 2015. \nThe below table shows the distribution by\r\nFund of the 2014 commitments, distinguishing those adopted in 2014 from those\r\ncarried-over as well as from those to be transferred under Article 19 of the\r\nMFF Regulation: \nThe Commission proposes to transfer the bulk\r\nof the allocations not used in 2014 to year 2015 in order to keep the pace of\r\ninvestments for growth and jobs, minimise differences of treatment with\r\nprogrammes adopted in 2014 and ensure equal treatment with programmes whose\r\n2014 commitment tranche is carried-over in accordance with Article 13 of the\r\nFinancial Regulation[4].\r\nHence, all allocations not used in 2014 nor carried over will be transferred to\r\n2015, except in the following cases: \nThe unused EAFRD allocations are proposed\r\nto be transferred in equal parts to 2015 and 2016. This is justified by the\r\ncumulative effect of, in particular, the following circumstances: \n\u2013                        \r\nThe regulatory framework providing the essential\r\nelements necessary to Member States for the preparation of their rural\r\ndevelopment programmes was completed only in the second half of 2014.\r\nFurthermore, the latest regulation amending the basic act following Member\r\nStates' decisions to transfer amounts between direct aids and rural\r\ndevelopment, and thereby impacting the programming, came into force only at the\r\nend of December 2014. \n\u2013                        \r\nBecause of the transitional rules under\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1310/2013 significant amounts spent under the new rural\r\ndevelopment programmes are still paid under the budget line for the old\r\nprogrammes during the transition between two periods. Therefore, doubling the\r\navailable commitments on the budget line for the new RDPs would result in\r\nadditional unused appropriations in 2015 as the total annual payments would not\r\nconsume all the available commitments in the budget line for the new RDPs.\n\u2013                        \r\nAs opposed to the other ESI Funds, programmes\r\nfinanced from the EAFRD will not benefit from annual pre-financing, resulting\r\nin a higher amount of interim payments to be claimed within the decommitment\r\ndeadlines. \nFor contributions\r\nfrom the ERDF to the cross-border and sea-basin programmes established under\r\nthe European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI-CBC programmes) and the Instrument\r\nfor Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA-CBC programmes) it is\r\nproposed to transfer the whole 2014 ERDF allocation to 2017. The set-up of\r\nthese programmes is more complex and takes longer. This is due to the specific\r\ncharacter of those programmes involving Member States and candidate or\r\nneighbouring countries. \nFor programmes financed from the AMIF or\r\nthe ISF, allocations not used in 2014 shall be transferred to years 2015 to\r\n2017 with a degressive profile. The basic acts for these funds were only\r\nadopted in May 2014, with the adoption of a number of implementing and\r\ndelegated acts still pending. These funds are subject\r\nto a stricter decommitment rule than for the ESI Funds i.e. n+2, as from the\r\nsecond year of implementation, instead of n+3. Finally, the Member States\u2019\r\nexperience in managing these funds under shared management is rather new. The\r\nproposed transfer of the 2014 allocations over three years takes account of\r\nthese particular features.\nConsequently, the allocations not used in\r\n2014 are proposed to be transferred to subsequent years as shown in the below\r\ntable. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IMPLICATIONS ON PAYMENTS\nConcerning the implications on payments in\r\n2015, they will be covered within the voted budget for 2015. The first initial\r\npre-financing that has not been paid in 2014 will have to be paid in 2015\r\ntogether with the second pre-financing. However, the corresponding unused\r\nappropriations in 2014 have been used by transfers to reduce the backlog of\r\nunpaid bills from the previous period 2007-2013 and the reverse operation could\r\nbe done, if need be, in 2015 to cover the pre-financings. \nThe medium and longer term implications on\r\ninterim payments of the transfer are more difficult to predict. \nThe legislative acts laying down the\r\nprovisions for implementing the funds contain provisions for the automatic\r\ndecommitment of appropriations not used within a given deadline, which is of\r\nn+3 years for the ESI Funds and of n+2 years for the AMIF and the ISF. \nThe year \u201cn\u201d corresponds to the year of the\r\nbudgetary commitment. As both in case of a carry-over and in case of a transfer\r\nof commitment appropriations from 2014 to 2015 the budgetary commitment will be\r\nmade in 2015, the n+3 period will start from 2015, with\r\nthe deadline shifting accordingly from end 2017 to end 2018. In case of n+2,\r\nthe same applies: the period will start from 2015 and the deadline shift accordingly\r\nby one year. \nThis could in principle result in a shift of\r\npayments from one year to another without this lowering the overall needs over\r\nthe 2014-2020 period. On the other hand, the real pace of implementation will\r\nnot be pre-determined by the transfer. Under all programmes, regardless of\r\ntheir date of adoption, expenditure is eligible as from 1 January 2014 (and as\r\nfrom 1 September 2013 for the Youth Employment Initiative and 1 December 2013\r\nfor the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived). This means that\r\nimplementation could start before the formal adoption of the respective\r\nprogramme and limit the impact of the delay on the submission of interim payment\r\nclaims.\nBoth the fact that Member States have n+3\r\nyears to spend the funds (n+2 for AMIF and ISF), taking account of initial and\r\nannual pre-financing, and the availability of the Global Margin for payments (Article\r\n5 of the MFF Regulation) are expected to further mitigate the impact of the\r\ntransfer of commitments from 2014 on annual payment ceilings. \nFor these reasons, the Commission does not\r\npropose to revise the payment ceilings. It will review the situation regularly\r\nin the light of implementation and make proposals if appropriate in accordance\r\nwith the relevant provisions of the MFF Regulation.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 REVISED FINANCIAL\r\nFRAMEWORK IN CURRENT PRICES\nThe proposed\r\ntransfer of allocations in the below MFF table is expressed in current prices\r\nand incorporates the technical adjustment made for 2015[5]. \nThe Council regulation amending the MFF Regulation\r\nmust refer to the basic table set out in its Annex, which is expressed in\r\nconstant 2011 prices. The amounts in current prices are thus to be converted\r\ninto 2011 prices.\n2015/0010 (APP)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\r\n1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years\r\n2014-2020\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 312 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing\r\nthe European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament, \nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 19 of Council\r\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013[6]\r\nprovides that in the event of the adoption after 1 January 2014 of new rules or\r\nprogrammes under shared management for the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund,\r\nthe European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Maritime and\r\nFisheries Fund, the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and the Internal\r\nSecurity Fund, the multiannual financial framework is to be revised in order to\r\ntransfer to subsequent years, in excess of the corresponding expenditure\r\nceilings, allocations not used in 2014.
