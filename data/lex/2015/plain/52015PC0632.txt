"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 11.12.2015\nCOM(2015) 632 final\n2015/0286(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nFollowing the adoption of Council Directive 2003/48/EC, the Savings Directive, and in order to preserve the level playing field of economic operators, the EU signed Agreements with Switzerland, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in the Directive. Member States also signed agreements with the dependent territories of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.\n\n\nMore recently, the importance of automatic exchange of information as a means to combat cross-border tax fraud and tax evasion by ensuring full tax transparency and cooperation between tax administrations worldwide has also been recognised at the international level. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was mandated by the G20 to develop a single global standard for automatic exchange of financial account information. The Global Standard was released by the OECD Council in July 2014.\n\n\nFollowing the adoption of a proposal to update the Savings Directive, the Commission adopted on 17 June 2011 a recommendation for a mandate to initiate negotiations with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino, in order to upgrade the EU\u2019s Agreements with those countries in line with international developments and to ensure that those countries continue to apply measures equivalent to those in the EU. On 14 May 2013, the Council reached an agreement on the Negotiating Mandate by concluding that negotiations should be aligned with the recent developments at global level where it was agreed to promote automatic exchange of information as an international standard.\n\n\nIn its communication of 6 December 2012 containing an Action Plan to strengthen the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion, the Commission highlighted the need to promote vigorously the automatic exchange of information as the future European and international standard for transparency and exchange of information in tax matters.\n\n\nOn the basis of a proposal presented by the Commission in June 2013, the Council on 9 December 2014 adopted Directive 2014/107/EU amending Directive 2011/16/EU and extending the mandatory automatic exchange of information between EU tax authorities to a full range of financial items in accordance with the Global Standard. The amendment ensures a coherent, consistent and comprehensive Union-wide approach to the automatic exchange of financial account information in the Internal Market.\n\n\nAs Directive 2014/107/EU is generally broader in scope than Directive 2003/48/EC and provides that in cases of overlap of scope, Directive 2014/107/EU prevails, on 18 March 2015 the Commission adopted a proposal to repeal Directive 2003/48/EC.\n\n\nIn order to minimise costs and administrative burdens both for tax administrations and for economic operators, it is crucial to ensure that the amendment of the existing Savings Agreement with Andorra is in line with EU and international developments. This will increase tax transparency in Europe and will be the legal basis for implementing the OCDE Global Standard on automatic exchange of information between Andorra and the EU. \n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\nThe legal basis for this proposal is provided by Article 115 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article 218(5) and (8) second subparagraph. The substantive legal basis is provided by Article 115 TFEU. \n\n\nArticle 1(1) of the Amending Protocol annexed to this Proposal for Council Decision changes the title of the existing Agreement in order to better reflect the contents of the Agreement, as amended by that Amending Protocol. \n\n\nArticle 1(2) replaces the existing articles and Annexes with a new set of provisions comprising 11 Articles, an Annex I that reflects the OECD Common Reporting Standard which is part of the Global Standard, an Annex II that reflects important parts of the OECD Commentaries to the Global Standard and an Annex III that lists the Competent Authorities of Andorra and of each Member State.\n\n\nThe new Articles reflect the articles of the OECD Model Competent Authority agreement for the implementation of the Global Standard, with minor adaptations to reflect the particular legal context of an EU Agreement. In Article 1 there is no definition of  Tax Identification Number (TIN), since there is already a definition of TIN in Section VIII(E)(5) of Annex I. Article 5 includes a full set of provisions on exchange of information upon request that follows the latest text of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Article 6 includes a more detailed set of provisions on data protection. Article 7 provides for an additional stage of consultation before any Member State or Andorra undertakes to suspend the Agreement. Article 8 features provisions on amendments to the Agreement. Article 10 defines the territorial scope.\n\n\nAnnex I follows both the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and Annex I to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation. Annex II implements key parts of the OECD Commentaries to the CRS and corresponds to Annex II to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation. The minor deviations from Annex I or II to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation are justified by the re-alignment of the text to the CRS requested by the Andorran negotiators. Those include the following:\n\n\n1. In Section I(D) the reference to the reporting of place of birth is realigned to the CRS.\n\n\n2. Section I(A) on insurances that are effectively prevented by law from being sold to residents of a Reportable Jurisdiction is reintroduced. In order to avoid risks of abuse of that exemption, a corresponding Joint Declaration is included at the end of the Amending Protocol.\n\n\n3. All the relevant options provided for in the CRS Commentaries and in the Directive on Administrative Cooperation have been left at the discretion of each Member State and Andorra and are not exercised directly in the Agreement. There is instead an obligation on Member States and Andorra to notify each other and the Commission whether they have exercised any particular option. This is meant as a safeguard for the correct application of the alternative definition of \u201cRelated Entity\u201d in connection with the option on new accounts of current customers.\n\n\n\n\n4. The definitions of \u201cInternational Organisation\u201d and \u201cCentral Bank\u201d in Section VIII(B)(3) and (4) have been realigned to the CRS in order to enable them to apply also in the context of the exemption from the look-through for Passive non-financial entities (NFEs) in Section VIII(D)(9)(c).\n\n\n5. In Annex II the definition of \u201cResidence of a Financial Institution\u201d is aligned to the CRS Commentaries in order to cover cases where the residence of another Financial Institution should be determined, e.g. for the look-through for Passive NFEs.\n\n\nArticle 2 of the Amending Protocol includes provisions on the entry into force and application. It deals with issues on the transition from the existing Agreement to the amended Agreement, with regard to requests for information, credits available to beneficial owners for withholding tax, final payments of withholding tax by Andorra to Member States and final exchanges of information under the voluntary disclosure mechanism.\n\n\nArticle 3 includes a Protocol on additional safeguards related to the exchange of information on request. The text specifies that exchanges on the basis of a group request are not prevented. The Protocol on additional safeguards is in line with the Global Forum's Terms of Reference for exchange of information on request.\n\n\nArticle 4 lists the languages in which the Amending Protocol is signed.\n\n\nThe revised Agreement is supplemented by four Joint Declarations of the contracting parties and one Unilateral Declaration by Andorra.\n\n\nThe first Joint Declaration concerns the expected date of entry into force of the revised Agreement. The second and third Declarations make a link respectively to the Commentaries to the Global Standard and Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital. The fourth Declaration aims at preventing misinterpretation of Section III(A) of Annex I and establishes a mechanism of mutual notification of the cases where that exemption would have grounds to apply. The fifth Declaration is a unilateral one from the Andorran side. \n\n\nThe proposal does not go beyond what is necessary or appropriate to achieve the expected objectives.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe Amending Protocol implements the Global Standard between EU Member States and Andorra. The different stakeholders were already consulted on various occasions during the development of the OECD Global Standard.\n\n\nEU Member States have also been consulted and informed during the negotiations between the Commission and Andorra. The Commission reported to the European Council at its meetings in March and December 2014 on the state of play of the negotiations with Andorra. \n\n\nThe Commission has also consulted the new Expert Group on automatic exchange of financial account information that provides advice to ensure that EU legislation on automatic exchange of information in direct taxation is effectively aligned and fully compatible with the OECD Global Standard. The Expert Group includes representatives from organisations representing the financial sector and organisations campaigning against tax evasion and tax avoidance.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal does not have any budgetary implications\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\nNone\n\n\n2015/0286 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments\n\n\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 115 in conjunction with Article 218 (5) and the second paragraph of Article 218 (8)\u00a0thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)On 14 May 2013 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Principality of Andorra to amend the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments\n1\n, in order to align it with the recent developments at global level where it was agreed to promote automatic exchange of information as an international standard.\n\n\n(2)The text of the Amending Protocol, which is the result of the negotiations, duly reflects the negotiating directives issued by the Council as it aligns the Agreement with the latest developments at international level concerning automatic exchange of information, namely, with the Global Standard for automatic exchange of financial account information in tax matters developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Union, its Member States and the Principality of Andorra have actively participated in the work of the Global Forum of the OECD for supporting the development and implementation of this Standard. The text of the Agreement, as amended by this Amending Protocol, is the legal basis for implementing the Global Standard in the relations between the Union and the Principality of Andorra.\n\n\n(3)Therefore, the Amending Protocol should be signed on behalf of the European Union, subject to its conclusion at a later date,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe signing of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments is hereby authorised on behalf of the Union, subject to the conclusion of that Amending Protocol\n2\n.\n\n\nThe text of the Amending Protocol is attached to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe President of the Council is hereby authorised to designate the person(s) empowered to sign the Amending Protocol on behalf of the Union.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The

the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX\n\n\nto the\n\n\nProposal for a COUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments\n\n\n\nAmending Protocol to the\n\n\nAgreement between the European Community and the Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments\n\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION, \n\n\nand\n\n\nTHE PRINCIPALITY OF ANDORRA, hereinafter referred to as \u2018Andorra\u2019,\n\n\nboth hereinafter referred to as \u2018Contracting Party\u2019 or, jointly, as \u2018Contracting Parties\u2019,\n\n\nWith a view to implementing the OECD Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, hereinafter referred to as \u2018Global Standard\u2019, within a framework of cooperation between the Contracting Parties,\n\n\nWhereas, the Contracting Parties have a longstanding and close relationship with respect to mutual assistance in tax matters, in particular on the application of measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments\n1\n, and desire to improve international tax compliance by further building on that relationship,\n\n\nWhereas, the Contracting Parties desire to come to an agreement to improve international tax compliance based on reciprocal automatic exchange of information subject to certain confidentiality and other protections, including provisions limiting the use of the information exchanged, \n\n\nWhereas Article 12 of the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments\n2\n, hereinafter referred to as \u2018Agreement\u2019, in the form prior to its amendment by this Amending Protocol, which currently provides for  exchange of information upon request limited to conduct constituting tax fraud and the like, should be aligned to the OECD standard on transparency and exchange of information in tax matters,\n\n\nWhereas, the Contracting Parties will apply their respective data protection laws and practices to the processing of personal data exchanged in accordance with the Agreement as amended by this Amending Protocol and undertake to notify each other without undue delay in the event of any change in the substance of those laws and practices, \n\n\nWhereas, Commission Decision 2010/625/EU of 19 October 2010\n3\n pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC\n4\n on the adequate protection of personal data provided in Andorra stated that for all the activities falling within the scope of that Directive, Andorra is considered as providing an adequate level of protection of personal data transferred from the European Union, \n\n\nWhereas, the Member States and Andorra will have in place by the date of entry into force of this Amending Protocol (i) appropriate safeguards to ensure that the information received pursuant to the Agreement as amended by this Amending Protocol remains confidential and is used solely for the purposes of and by the persons or authorities concerned with the assessment or collection or recovery of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to taxes, or the oversight of these, as well as for other authorised purposes, and (ii) the infrastructure for an effective exchange relationship (including established processes for ensuring timely, accurate, secure and confidential information exchanges, effective and reliable communications, and capabilities to promptly resolve questions and concerns about exchanges or requests for exchanges and to administer the provisions of Article 4 of the Agreement as amended by this Amending Protocol),\n\n\n\n\nWhereas Reporting Financial Institutions, sending Competent Authorities and receiving Competent Authorities, as data controllers, should retain information processed in accordance with the Agreement as amended by this Amending Protocol for no longer than necessary to achieve the purposes thereof. Given the differences in Member States\u2019 and Andorran legislation, the maximum retention period should be set for each Contracting Party by reference to the statute of limitations provided by each data controller\u2019s domestic tax legislation,\n\n\nWhereas the categories of Reporting Financial Institutions and Reportable Accounts covered by the Agreement as amended by this Amending Protocol are designed to limit the opportunities for taxpayers to avoid being reported by shifting assets to Financial Institutions or investing in financial products that are outside the scope of the Agreement as amended by this Amending Protocol. However, certain Financial Institutions and accounts that present a low risk of being used to evade tax should be excluded from the scope. Thresholds should not be generally included as they could easily be circumvented by splitting accounts into different Financial Institutions. The financial information which is required to be reported and exchanged should concern not only all relevant income (interests, dividends and similar types of income) but also account balances and sale proceeds from Financial Assets, in order to address situations where a taxpayer seeks to hide capital that in itself represents income or assets with regard to which tax has been evaded. Therefore, the processing of information under the Agreement as amended by this Amending Protocol is necessary for and proportionate to the purpose of enabling Member States\u2019 and Andorran tax administrations to correctly and unequivocally identify the taxpayers concerned, to administer and enforce their tax laws in cross-border situations, to assess the likelihood of tax evasion being perpetrated and to avoid unnecessary further investigations,\n\n\nHAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Andorra providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (hereinafter referred to as the \"Agreement\") shall be amended as follows:\n\n\n(1) The title shall be replaced by:\n\n\n\u201cAgreement between the European Union and the Principality of Andorra on the automatic exchange of financial account information to improve international tax compliance\u201d;\n\n\n(2) Articles 1 through 19 shall be replaced by:\n\n\n\u201cArticle 1\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n1.

The Competent Authorities will agree on one or more methods for data transmission including encryption standards.\n\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nCooperation on Compliance and Enforcement\n\n\nThe Competent Authority of a Member State will notify the Competent Authority of Andorra and the Competent Authority of Andorra will notify the Competent Authority of a Member State when the first-mentioned (notifying) Competent Authority has reason to believe that an error may have led to incorrect or incomplete information reporting under Article 2 or there is non-compliance by a Reporting Financial Institution with the applicable reporting requirements and due diligence procedures consistent with Annexes I and II. The notified Competent Authority will take all appropriate measures available under its domestic law to address the errors or non-compliance described in the notice.\n\n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\nExchange of Information upon Request\n\n\n1.

In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article and of Article 6 be construed so as to impose on Andorra or on a Member State the obligation: \n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of Andorra or that Member State, respectively; \n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of Andorra or that Member State, respectively; \n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).\n\n\n3. If information is requested by a Member State or by Andorra acting as the requesting jurisdiction in accordance with this Article, Andorra or the Member State acting as the requested jurisdiction shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that requested jurisdiction may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 2 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit the requested jurisdiction to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. \n\n\n\n\n4. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 2 be construed to permit Andorra or a Member State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.\n\n\n5. The Competent Authorities will agree on the standard forms to be used as well as on one or more methods for data transmission including encryption standards \n\n\n\nArticle 6\n\n\nConfidentiality and Data Safeguards\n\n\n1. Any information obtained by a jurisdiction (being a Member State or Andorra) under this Agreement shall be treated as confidential and protected in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic law of that jurisdiction and, to the extent necessary for the protection of personal data, in accordance with the applicable domestic law and safeguards which may be specified by the jurisdiction supplying the information as required under its domestic law.\n\n\n2. Information processed in accordance with this Agreement shall be retained for no longer than necessary to achieve the purposes of this Agreement, and in any case in accordance with each data controller\u2019s domestic rules on statute of limitations.\n\n\n3. Such information shall in any case be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative or supervisory bodies) concerned with the assessment, collection or recovery of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to taxes of that jurisdiction (being a Member State or Andorra), or the oversight of these. Only the persons or authorities mentioned above may use the information and then only for purposes spelled out in the preceding sentence. They may, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, disclose it in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions relating to such taxes. \n\n\n4. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, information received by a jurisdiction (being a Member State or Andorra) may be used for other purposes when such information may so be used under the laws of the supplying jurisdiction (being, respectively, Andorra or a Member State) and the Competent Authority of that jurisdiction authorises such use. Information provided by a jurisdiction (being a Member State or Andorra) to another jurisdiction (being, respectively, Andorra or a Member State) may be transmitted by the latter to a third jurisdiction (being another Member State), subject to prior authorisation by the Competent Authority of the first-mentioned jurisdiction, from which the information originated. \n\n\nInformation provided by one Member State to another Member State under its applicable law implementing Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation may be transmitted to Andorra subject to prior authorisation by the Competent Authority of the Member State from which the information originated.\n\n\n5. Each Competent Authority of a Member State or Andorra will immediately notify the other Competent Authority, i.e. that of Andorra or that Member State, respectively, regarding any breach of confidentiality, failure of safeguards and any sanctions and remedial actions consequently imposed.\n\n\n\nArticle 7\n\n\nConsultations and suspension of this Agreement\n\n\n1. If any difficulties in the implementation or interpretation of this Agreement arise, any of the Competent Authorities of Andorra or a Member State may request consultations between the Competent Authority of Andorra and one or more of the Competent Authorities of Member States to develop appropriate measures to ensure that this Agreement is fulfilled. Those Competent Authorities shall immediately notify the European Commission and the Competent Authorities of the other Member States of the results of their consultations. In relation to issues of interpretation the European Commission may take part in consultations at the request of any of the Competent Authorities.\n\n\n2. If the consultation relates to significant non-compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and the   procedure described in paragraph 1 does not provide for an adequate settlement, the Competent Authority of a Member State or Andorra may suspend the exchange of information under this Agreement towards, respectively, Andorra or a specific Member State, by giving notice in writing to the other Competent Authority concerned. Such suspension will have immediate effect. For the purposes of this paragraph, significant non-compliance includes, but is not limited to, non-compliance with the confidentiality and data safeguard provisions of this Agreement, a failure by the Competent Authority of a Member State or Andorra to provide timely or adequate information as required under this Agreement or defining the status of Entities or accounts as Non-Reporting Financial Institutions and Excluded Accounts in a manner that frustrates the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n\n\nArticle 8\n\n\nAmendments\n\n\n1. The Contracting Parties shall consult each other on each occasion when an important change is adopted at OECD level to any of the elements of the Global Standard or \u2013 if deemed necessary by the Contracting Parties \u2013 in order to improve the technical functioning of this Agreement or to assess and reflect other international developments. The consultations shall be held within one month of a request by either Contracting Party or as soon as possible in urgent cases.\n\n\n\n\n2. On the basis of such a contact, the Contracting Parties may consult each other in order to examine whether changes to this Agreement are necessary.\n\n\n3. For the purposes of the consultations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 each Contracting Party shall inform the other Contracting Party of possible developments which could affect the proper functioning of this Agreement. This shall also include any relevant agreement between one of the Contracting Parties and a third State.\n\n\n4. Following the consultations, this Agreement may be amended by means of a protocol or a new agreement between the Contracting Parties. \n\n\n\nArticle 9\n\n\nTermination \n\n\nEither Contracting Party may terminate this Agreement by giving notice of termination in writing to the other Contracting Party. Such termination will become effective on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of 12 months after the date of the notice of termination. In the event of termination, all information previously received under this Agreement will remain confidential and subject to Article 6 of this Agreement.\n\n\n\nArticle 10 \n\n\nTerritorial Scope\n\n\nThis Agreement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories of the Member States in which the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union are applied and under the conditions laid down in those Treaties and, on the other hand, to the territory of Andorra.\u201d\n\n\n\n(3) the Annexes shall be replaced by:\n\n\n\u201cANNEX I\u00a0\n\n\n\nCOMMON STANDARD ON REPORTING AND DUE DILIGENCE FOR FINANCIAL \n\n\nACCOUNT INFORMATION (\u201cCOMMON REPORTING STANDARD\u201d)\u00a0\n\n\n\nSection I: General Reporting Requirements \n\n\nA. Subject to paragraphs C to E, each Reporting Financial Institution must report to the Competent Authority of its jurisdiction (being a Member State or Andorra) the following information with respect to each Reportable Account of such Reporting Financial Institution: \n\n\n1. the name, address,  jurisdiction(s) of residence (being a Member State or Andorra), TIN(s) and date and place of birth (in the case of an individual) of each Reportable Person that is an Account Holder of the account and, in the case of any Entity that is an Account Holder and that, after application of the due diligence procedures consistent with Sections V, VI and VII, is identified as having one or more Controlling Persons that is a Reportable Person, the name, address, jurisdiction(s) (being a Member State, Andorra or other jurisdiction) of residence and TIN(s) of the Entity and the name, address, jurisdiction(s) (being a Member State or Andorra) of residence, TIN(s) and date and place of birth of each Reportable Person; \n\n\n\n\n2. the account number (or functional equivalent in the absence of an account number); \n\n\n3. the name and identifying number (if any) of the Reporting Financial Institution; \n\n\n4. the account balance or value (including, in the case of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or Annuity Contract, the Cash Value or surrender value) as of the end of the relevant calendar year or other appropriate reporting period or, if the account was closed during such year or period, the closure of the account; \n\n\n5. in the case of any Custodial Account: \n\n\n(a) the total gross amount of interest, the total gross amount of dividends, and the total \n\n\ngross amount of other income generated with respect to the assets held in the account, in each case paid or credited to the account (or with respect to the account) during the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period; and \n\n\n(b) the total gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of Financial Assets paid or credited to the account during the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period with respect to which the Reporting Financial Institution acted as a custodian, broker, nominee, or otherwise as an agent for the Account Holder; \n\n\n6. in the case of any Depository Account, the total gross amount of interest paid or credited to the account during the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period; and \n\n\n7. in the case of any account not described in subparagraph A(5) or (6), the total gross amount paid or credited to the Account Holder with respect to the account during the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period with respect to which the Reporting Financial Institution is the obligor or debtor, including the aggregate amount of any redemption payments made to the Account Holder during the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period. \n\n\nB. The information reported must identify the currency in which each amount is denominated. \n\n\nC. Notwithstanding subparagraph A(1), with respect to each Reportable Account that is a Preexisting Account, the TIN(s) or date of birth is not required to be reported if such TIN(s) or date of birth is not in the records of the Reporting Financial Institution and is not otherwise required to be collected by such Reporting Financial Institution under domestic law or any European Union legal instrument (if applicable). However, a Reporting Financial Institution is required to use reasonable efforts to obtain the TIN(s) and date of birth with respect to Preexisting Accounts by the end of the second calendar year following the year in which Preexisting Accounts were identified as Reportable Accounts. \n\n\nD. Notwithstanding subparagraph A(1), the TIN is not required to be reported if a TIN is not issued by the relevant Member State, Andorra or other jurisdiction of residence. \n\n\nE. Notwithstanding subparagraph A(1), the place of birth is not required to be reported unless the Reporting Financial Institution is otherwise required to obtain and report it under domestic law and it is available in the electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution. \n\n\n\nSection II: General Due Diligence Requirements \n\n\nA. An account is treated as a Reportable Account beginning as of the date it is identified as such pursuant to the due diligence procedures in Sections II to VII and, unless otherwise provided, information with respect to a Reportable Account must be reported annually in the calendar year following the year to which the information relates. \n\n\nB. The balance or value of an account is determined as of the last day of the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period. \n\n\nC. Where a balance or value threshold is to be determined as of the last day of a calendar year, the relevant balance or value must be determined as of the last day of the reporting period that ends with or within that calendar year. \n\n\nD. Each Member State or Andorra may allow Reporting Financial Institutions to use service providers to fulfil the reporting and due diligence obligations imposed on such Reporting Financial Institutions, as contemplated in domestic law, but those obligations shall remain the responsibility of the Reporting Financial Institutions. \n\n\nE. Each Member State or Andorra may allow Reporting Financial Institutions to apply the due diligence procedures for New Accounts to Preexisting Accounts, and the due diligence procedures for High Value Accounts to Lower Value Accounts. Where a Member State or Andorra allows New Account due diligence procedures to be used for Preexisting Accounts, the rules otherwise applicable to Preexisting Accounts continue to apply.\n\n\n\n\n\nSection III: Due Diligence for Preexisting Individual Accounts \n\n\nThe following procedures apply for purposes of identifying Reportable Accounts among Preexisting Individual Accounts. \n\n\nA. Accounts Not Required to be Reviewed, Identified, or Reported. A Preexisting Individual Account that is a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract is not required to be reviewed, identified or reported, provided the Reporting Financial Institution is effectively prevented by law from selling such Contract to residents of a Reportable Jurisdiction. \n\n\nB. Lower Value Accounts. The following procedures apply with respect to Lower Value Accounts. \n\n\n1. Residence Address. If the Reporting Financial Institution has in its records a current residence address for the individual Account Holder based on Documentary Evidence, the Reporting Financial Institution may treat the individual Account Holder as being a resident for tax purposes of the Member State or Andorra or other jurisdiction in which the address is located for purposes of determining whether such individual Account Holder is a Reportable Person. \n\n\n2. Electronic Record Search. If the Reporting Financial Institution does not rely on a current residence address for the individual Account Holder based on Documentary Evidence as set forth in subparagraph B(1), the Reporting Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution for any of the following indicia and apply subparagraphs B(3) to (6): \n\n\n(a) identification of the Account Holder as a resident of a Reportable Jurisdiction; \n\n\n(b) current mailing or residence address (including a post office box) in a Reportable Jurisdiction; \n\n\n(c) one or more telephone numbers in a Reportable Jurisdiction and no telephone number in Andorra or the Member State of the Reporting Financial Institution, as the context requires; \n\n\n(d) standing instructions (other than with respect to a Depository Account) to transfer funds to an account maintained in a Reportable Jurisdiction; \n\n\n(e) currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with an address in a Reportable Jurisdiction; or \n\n\n(f) a \u201chold mail\u201d instruction or \u201cin-care-of\u201d address in a Reportable Jurisdiction if the Reporting Financial Institution does not have any other address on file for the Account Holder. \n\n\n3. If none of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2) are discovered in the electronic search, then no further action is required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account, or the account becomes a High Value Account. \n\n\n4. If any of the indicia listed in subparagraphs B(2)(a) to (e) are discovered in the electronic search, or if there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the Account Holder as a resident for tax purposes of each Reportable Jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified, unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(6) and one of the exceptions in that subparagraph applies with respect to that account. \n\n\n5. If a \u201chold mail\u201d instruction or \u201cin-care-of\u201d address is discovered in the electronic search and no other address and none of the other indicia listed in subparagraphs B(2)(a) to (e) are identified for the Account Holder, the Reporting Financial Institution must, in the order most appropriate to the circumstances, apply the paper record search described in subparagraph C(2), or seek to obtain from the Account Holder a self-certification or Documentary Evidence to establish the residence(s) for tax purposes of such Account Holder. If the paper search fails to establish an indicium and the attempt to obtain the self-certification or Documentary Evidence is not successful, the Reporting Financial Institution must report the account to the Competent Authority of its Member State or Andorra, as the context requires, as an undocumented account. \n\n\n6. Notwithstanding a finding of indicia under subparagraph B(2), a Reporting Financial Institution is not required to treat an Account Holder as a resident of a Reportable Jurisdiction if: \n\n\n(a) the Account Holder information contains a current mailing or residence address in the Reportable Jurisdiction, one or more telephone numbers in that Reportable Jurisdiction (and no telephone number in Andorra or the Member State of the Reporting Financial Institution, as the context requires) or standing instructions (with respect to Financial Accounts other than Depository Accounts) to transfer funds to an account maintained in a Reportable Jurisdiction, and the Reporting Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: \n\n\n(i) a self-certification from the Account Holder of the jurisdiction(s) of residence (being a Member State, Andorra or other jurisdictions) of such Account Holder that does not include such Reportable Jurisdiction; and \n\n\n(ii) Documentary Evidence establishing the Account Holder\u2019s non-reportable status. \n\n\n\n\n(b) the Account Holder information contains a currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with an address in the Reportable Jurisdiction, and the Reporting Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: \n\n\n(i) a self-certification from the Account Holder of the jurisdiction(s) of residence (being a Member State, Andorra or other jurisdictions) of such Account Holder that does not include such Reportable Jurisdiction; or \n\n\n(ii) Documentary Evidence establishing the Account Holder\u2019s non-reportable status. \n\n\nC. Enhanced Review Procedures for High Value Accounts. The following enhanced review procedures apply with respect to High Value Accounts. \n\n\n1. Electronic Record Search. With respect to High Value Accounts, the Reporting Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution for any of the indicia described in subparagraph B(2). \n\n\n2. Paper Record Search. If the Reporting Financial Institution\u2019s electronically searchable databases include fields for, and capture, all of the information described in, subparagraph C(3), then a further paper record search is not required. If the electronic databases do not capture all of that information, then with respect to a High Value Account, the Reporting Financial Institution must also review the current customer master file and, to the extent not contained in the current customer master file, the following documents associated with the account and obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution within the last five years for any of the indicia described in subparagraph B(2): \n\n\n(a) the most recent Documentary Evidence collected with respect to the account; \n\n\n(b) the most recent account opening contract or documentation; \n\n\n(c) the most recent documentation obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures or for other regulatory purposes; \n\n\n(d) any power of attorney or signature authority forms currently in effect; and \n\n\n(e) any standing instructions (other than with respect to a Depository Account) to transfer funds currently in effect. \n\n\n3. Exception To The Extent Databases Contain Sufficient Information. A Reporting Financial Institution is not required to perform the paper record search described in subparagraph C(2) to the extent the Reporting Financial Institution\u2019s electronically searchable information includes the following: \n\n\n(a) the Account Holder\u2019s residence status; \n\n\n(b) the Account Holder\u2019s residence address and mailing address currently on file with the Reporting Financial Institution; \n\n\n(c) the Account Holder\u2019s telephone number(s) currently on file, if any, with the Reporting Financial Institution; \n\n\n(d) in the case of Financial Accounts other than Depository Accounts, whether there are standing instructions to transfer funds in the account to another account (including an account at another branch of the Reporting Financial Institution or another Financial Institution); \n\n\n(e) whether there is a current \u201cin-care-of\u201d address or \u201chold mail\u201d instruction for the Account Holder; and \n\n\n(f) whether there is any power of attorney or signatory authority for the account. \n\n\n4. Relationship Manager Inquiry for Actual Knowledge. In addition to the electronic and paper record searches described in subparagraphs C(1) and (2), the Reporting Financial Institution must treat as a Reportable Account any High Value Account assigned to a relationship manager (including any Financial Accounts aggregated with that High Value Account) if the relationship manager has actual knowledge that the Account Holder is a Reportable Person. \n\n\n5. Effect of Finding Indicia. \n\n\n\n\n(a) If none of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2) are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described in paragraph C, and the account is not identified as held by a Reportable Person in subparagraph C(4), then further action is not required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account. \n\n\n(b) If any of the indicia listed in subparagraphs B(2)(a) to (e) are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described in paragraph C, or if there is a subsequent change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account with respect to each Reportable Jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(6) and one of the exceptions in that subparagraph applies with respect to that account. \n\n\n(c) If a \u201chold mail\u201d instruction or \u201cin-care-of\u201d address is discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described in paragraph C, and no other address and none of the other indicia listed in subparagraphs B(2)(a) to (e) are identified for the Account Holder, the Reporting Financial Institution must obtain from such Account Holder a self-certification or Documentary Evidence to establish the residence(s) for tax purposes of the Account Holder. If the Reporting Financial Institution cannot obtain such self-certification or Documentary Evidence, it must report the account to the Competent Authority of its Member State or Andorra, as the context requires, as an undocumented account. \n\n\n6. If a Preexisting Individual Account is not a High Value Account as of 31 December preceding the entry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on \u2026, but becomes a High Value Account as of the last day of a subsequent calendar year, the Reporting Financial Institution must complete the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph C with respect to such account within the calendar year following the year in which the account becomes a High Value Account. If, based on that review such account is identified as a Reportable Account, the Reporting Financial Institution must report the required information about such account with respect to the year in which it is identified as a Reportable Account and subsequent years on an annual basis, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Reportable Person. \n\n\n7. Once a Reporting Financial Institution applies the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph C to a High Value Account, the Reporting Financial Institution is not required to re-apply such procedures, other than the relationship manager inquiry described in subparagraph C(4), to the same High Value Account in any subsequent year unless the account is undocumented where the Reporting Financial Institution should re-apply them annually until such account ceases to be undocumented. \n\n\n8. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a High Value Account that results in one or more indicia described in subparagraph B(2) being associated with the account, then the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account with respect to each Reportable Jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(6) and one of the exceptions in that subparagraph applies with respect to that account. \n\n\n9. A Reporting Financial Institution must implement procedures to ensure that a relationship manager identifies any change in circumstances of an account. For example, if a relationship manager is notified that the Account Holder has a new mailing address in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution is required to treat the new address as a change in circumstances and, if it elects to apply subparagraph B(6), is required to obtain the appropriate documentation from the Account Holder. \n\n\nD. Review of Preexisting High Value Individual Accounts must be completed within one year of the entry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on \u2026. Review of Preexisting Lower Value Individual Accounts must be completed within two years of the entry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on \u2026.\n\n\nE. Any Preexisting Individual Account that has been identified as a Reportable Account under this Section must be treated as a Reportable Account in all subsequent years, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Reportable Person. \n\n\n\nSection IV: Due Diligence for New Individual Accounts \n\n\nThe following procedures apply for purposes of identifying Reportable Accounts among New Individual Accounts. \n\n\nA. With respect to New Individual Accounts, upon account opening, the Reporting Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification, which may be part of the account opening documentation, that allows the Reporting Financial Institution to determine the Account Holder\u2019s residence(s) for tax purposes and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification based on the information obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution in connection with the opening of the account, including any documentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. \n\n\nB. If the self-certification establishes that the Account Holder is resident for tax purposes in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account and the self-certification must also include the Account Holder\u2019s TIN with respect to such Reportable Jurisdiction (subject to paragraph D of Section I) and date of birth. \n\n\nC. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a New Individual Account that causes the Reporting Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the original self-certification is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Financial Institution cannot rely on the original self-certification and must obtain a valid self-certification that establishes the residence(s) for tax purposes of the Account Holder. \n\n\n\nSection V: Due Diligence for Preexisting Entity Accounts \n\n\nThe following procedures apply for purposes of identifying Reportable Accounts among Preexisting Entity Accounts. \n\n\nA. Entity Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified or Reported. Unless the Reporting Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all Preexisting Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, a Preexisting Entity Account with an aggregate account balance or value that does not exceed USD 250 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic currency of each Member State or Andorra, as of 31 December preceding the entry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on \u2026, is not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as a Reportable Account until the aggregate account balance or value exceeds that amount as of the last day of any subsequent calendar year. \n\n\nB. Entity Accounts Subject to Review. A Preexisting Entity Account that has an aggregate account balance or value that exceeds USD 250 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic currency of each Member State or Andorra, as of 31 December preceding the entry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on \u2026, and a Preexisting Entity Account that does not exceed, as of 31 December preceding the entry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on \u2026, that amount but the aggregate account balance or value of which exceeds such amount as of the last day of any subsequent calendar year, must be reviewed in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph D. \n\n\n\n\nC. Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting Is Required. With respect to Preexisting Entity Accounts described in paragraph B, only accounts that are held by one or more Entities that are Reportable Persons, or by Passive NFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons, shall be treated as Reportable Accounts. \n\n\nD. Review Procedures for Identifying Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting Is Required. For Preexisting Entity Accounts described in paragraph B, a Reporting Financial Institution must apply the following review procedures to determine whether the account is held by one or more Reportable Persons, or by Passive NFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons: \n\n\n1. Determine Whether the Entity Is a Reportable Person. \n\n\n(a) Review information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes (including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures) to determine whether the information indicates that the Account Holder is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction. For this purpose, information indicating that the Account Holder is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction includes a place of incorporation or organisation,  or an address in a Reportable Jurisdiction. \n\n\n(b) If the information indicates that the Account Holder is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account unless it obtains a self-certification from the Account Holder, or reasonably determines based on information in its possession or that is publicly available, that the Account Holder is not a Reportable Person. \n\n\n2. Determine Whether the Entity is a Passive NFE with One or More Controlling Persons Who Are Reportable Persons. With respect to an Account Holder of a Preexisting Entity Account (including an Entity that is a Reportable Person), the Reporting Financial Institution must determine whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons. If any of the Controlling Persons of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, then the account must be treated as a Reportable Account. In making these determinations the Reporting Financial Institution must follow the guidance in subparagraphs D(2)(a) to (c) in the order most appropriate under the circumstances. \n\n\n(a) Determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE. For purposes of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE, the Reporting Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification from the Account Holder to establish its status, unless it has information in its possession or that is publicly available, based on which it can reasonably determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFE or a Financial Institution other than an Investment Entity described in subparagraph A(6)(b) of Section VIII that is not a Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution. \n\n\n(b) Determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder. For the purposes of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. \n\n\n(c) Determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person. For the purposes of determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on: \n\n\n(i) information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures in the case of a Preexisting Entity Account held by one or more NFEs with an aggregate account balance or value that does not exceed USD 1 000 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic currency of each Member State or Andorra; or \n\n\n(ii) a self-certification from the Account Holder or such Controlling Person of the \n\n\njurisdiction(s) (being a Member State, Andorra or other jurisdictions) in which the Controlling Person is resident for tax purposes. \n\n\nE. Timing of Review and Additional Procedures Applicable to Preexisting Entity Accounts. \n\n\n1. Review of Preexisting Entity Accounts with an aggregate account balance or value that exceeds USD 250 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic currency of each Member State or Andorra, as of 31 December preceding the entry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on \u2026, must be completed within two years of the entry into force. \n\n\n2. Review of Preexisting Entity Accounts with an aggregate account balance or value that does not exceed USD 250 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic currency of each Member State or Andorra,\u00a0as of 31 December preceding the entry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on \u2026, but exceeds that amount as of 31 December of a subsequent year, must be completed within the calendar year following the year in which the aggregate account balance or value exceeds such amount. \n\n\n3. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a Preexisting Entity Account that causes the Reporting Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the self-certification or other documentation associated with an account is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Financial Institution must re-determine the status of the account in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph D. \n\n\n\nSection VI: Due Diligence for New Entity Accounts \n\n\nThe following procedures apply for purposes of identifying Reportable Accounts among New Entity Accounts. \n\n\nA. Review Procedures for Identifying Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting Is Required. For New Entity Accounts, a Reporting Financial Institution must apply the following review procedures to determine whether the account is held by one or more Reportable Persons, or by Passive NFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons: \n\n\n\n\n1. Determine Whether the Entity Is a Reportable Person. \n\n\n(a) Obtain a self-certification, which may be part of the account opening documentation, that allows the Reporting Financial Institution to determine the Account Holder\u2019s residence(s) for tax purposes and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification based on the information obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution in connection with the opening of the account, including any documentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. If the Entity certifies that it has no residence for tax purposes, the Reporting Financial Institution may rely on the address of the principal office of the Entity to determine the residence of the Account Holder. \n\n\n(b) If the self-certification indicates that the Account Holder is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account unless it reasonably determines based on information in its possession or that is publicly available, that the Account Holder is not a Reportable Person with respect to such Reportable Jurisdiction. \n\n\n2. Determine Whether the Entity is a Passive NFE with One or More Controlling Persons Who Are Reportable Persons. With respect to an Account Holder of a New Entity Account (including an Entity that is a Reportable Person), the Reporting Financial Institution must determine whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons. If any of the Controlling Persons of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, then the account must be treated as a Reportable Account. In making these determinations the Reporting Financial Institution must follow the guidance in subparagraphs A(2)(a) to (c) in the order most appropriate under the circumstances. \n\n\n(a) Determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE. For purposes of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE, the Reporting Financial Institution must rely on a self-certification from the Account Holder to establish its status, unless it has information in its possession or that is publicly available, based on which it can reasonably determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFE or a Financial Institution other than an Investment Entity described in subparagraph A(6)(b) of Section VIII that is not a Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution . \n\n\n(b) Determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder. For purposes of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. \n\n\n(c) Determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person. For purposes of determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on a self-certification from the Account Holder or such Controlling Person. \n\n\n\nSection VII: Special Due Diligence Rules \n\n\nThe following additional rules apply in implementing the due diligence procedures described above: \n\n\nA. Reliance on Self-Certifications and Documentary Evidence. A Reporting Financial Institution may not rely on a self-certification or Documentary Evidence if the Reporting Financial Institution knows or has reason to know that the self-certification or Documentary Evidence is incorrect or unreliable. \n\n\nB. Alternative Procedures for Financial Accounts Held by Individual Beneficiaries of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract and for a Group Cash Value Insurance Contract or Group Annuity Contract. A Reporting Financial Institution may presume that an individual beneficiary (other than the owner) of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract receiving a death benefit is not a Reportable Person and may treat such Financial Account as other than a Reportable Account unless the Reporting Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the beneficiary is a Reportable Person. A Reporting Financial Institution has reason to know that a beneficiary of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract is a Reportable Person if the information collected by the Reporting Financial Institution and associated with the beneficiary contains indicia as described in paragraph B of Section III. If a Reporting Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the beneficiary is a Reportable Person, the Reporting Financial Institution must follow the procedures in paragraph B of Section III. \n\n\nA Member State or Andorra shall have the option to allow Reporting Financial Institutions to treat a Financial Account that is a member\u2019s interest in a Group Cash Value Insurance Contract or Group Annuity Contract as a Financial Account that is not a Reportable Account until the date on which an amount is payable to the employee/certificate holder or beneficiary, if the Financial Account that is a member\u2019s interest in a Group Cash Value Insurance Contract or Group Annuity Contract meets the following requirements:\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Group Cash Value Insurance Contract or Group Annuity Contract is issued to an employer and covers 25 or more employees/certificate holders;\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the employee/certificate holders are entitled to receive any contract value related to their interests and to name beneficiaries for the benefit payable upon the employee\u2019s death; and\n\n\n(c) the aggregate amount payable to any employee/certificate holder or beneficiary does not exceed USD 1 000 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic currency of each Member State or Andorra.\n\n\nThe term \u201cGroup Cash Value Insurance Contract\u201d means a Cash Value Insurance Contract that (i) provides coverage on individuals who are affiliated through an employer, trade association, labour union, or other association or group; and (ii) charges a premium for each member of the group (or member of a class within the group) that is determined without regard to the individual health characteristics other than age, gender, and smoking habits of the member (or class of members) of the group. \n\n\nThe term \u201cGroup Annuity Contract\u201d means an Annuity Contract under which the obligees are individuals who are affiliated through an employer, trade association, labour union, or other association or group.\n\n\nBefore the entry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on \u2026, Member States shall communicate to Andorra and Andorra shall communicate to the European Commission whether they have exercised the option provided for in this paragraph. The European Commission may coordinate the transmission of the communication from Member States to Andorra and the European Commission shall transmit the communication from Andorra to all Member States. All further changes to the exercise of that option by a Member State or Andorra shall be communicated in the same manner.\n\n\nC. Account Balance Aggregation and Currency Rules. \n\n\n\n\n1.

For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by an individual, a Reporting Financial Institution is required to aggregate all Financial Accounts maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity, but only to the extent that the Reporting Financial Institution\u2019s computerised systems link the Financial Accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or TIN, and allow account balances or values to be aggregated. Each holder of a jointly held Financial Account shall be attributed the entire balance or value of the jointly held Financial Account for purposes of applying the aggregation requirements described in this subparagraph. \n\n\n2. Aggregation of Entity Accounts. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by an Entity, a Reporting Financial Institution is required to take into account all Financial Accounts that are maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity, but only to the extent that the Reporting Financial Institution\u2019s computerised systems link the Financial Accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or TIN, and allow account balances or values to be aggregated. Each holder of a jointly held Financial Account shall be attributed the entire balance or value of the jointly held Financial Account for purposes of applying the aggregation requirements described in this subparagraph. \n\n\n3. Special Aggregation Rule Applicable to Relationship Managers. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by a person to determine whether a Financial Account is a High Value Account, a Reporting Financial Institution is also required, in the case of any Financial Accounts that a relationship manager knows, or has reason to know, are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or established (other than in a fiduciary capacity) by the same person, to aggregate all such accounts. \n\n\n4.

The term \u201cControlling Persons\u201d must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations. \n\n\n7. The term \u201cNFE\u201d means any Entity that is not a Financial Institution. \n\n\n8. The term \u201cPassive NFE\u201d means any: (i) NFE that is not an Active NFE; or (ii) an Investment Entity described in subparagraph A(6)(b) that is not a Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution. \n\n\n9. The term \u201cActive NFE\u201d means any NFE that meets any of the following criteria: \n\n\n(a) less than 50 % of the NFE\u2019s gross income for the preceding calendar year or other appropriate reporting period is passive income and less than 50 % of the assets held by the NFE during the preceding calendar year or other appropriate reporting period are assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income; \n\n\n(b) the stock of the NFE is regularly traded on an established securities market or the NFE is a Related Entity of an Entity the stock of which is regularly traded on an established securities market; \n\n\n(c) the NFE is a Governmental Entity, an International Organisation, a Central Bank , or an Entity wholly owned by one or more of the foregoing; \n\n\n(d) substantially all of the activities of the NFE consist of holding (in whole or in part) the outstanding stock of, or providing financing and services to, one or more subsidiaries that engage in trades or businesses other than the business of a Financial Institution, except that an Entity does not qualify for this status if the Entity functions (or holds itself out) as an investment fund, such as a private equity fund, venture capital fund, leveraged buyout fund, or any investment vehicle whose purpose is to acquire or fund companies and then hold interests in those companies as capital assets for investment purposes; \n\n\n(e) the NFE is not yet operating a business and has no prior operating history, but is investing capital into assets with the intent to operate a business other than that of a Financial Institution, provided that the NFE does not qualify for this exception after the date that is 24 months after the date of the initial organisation of the NFE; \n\n\n(f) the NFE was not a Financial Institution in the past five years, and is in the process of liquidating its assets or is reorganising with the intent to continue or recommence operations in a business other than that of a Financial Institution; \n\n\n(g) the NFE primarily engages in financing and hedging transactions with, or for, Related Entities that are not Financial Institutions, and does not provide financing or hedging services to any Entity that is not a Related Entity, provided that the group of any such Related Entities is primarily engaged in a business other than that of a Financial Institution; or \n\n\n(h) the NFE meets all of the following requirements: \n\n\n(i) it is established and operated in its jurisdiction of residence (being a Member State, Andorra or other jurisdiction) exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, artistic, cultural, athletic, or educational purposes; or it is established and operated in its jurisdiction of residence (being a Member State, Andorra or other jurisdiction) and it is a professional organisation, business league, chamber of commerce, labour organisation, agricultural or horticultural organisation, civic league or an organisation operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare; \n\n\n(ii) it is exempt from income tax in its jurisdiction of residence (being a Member State, Andorra or other jurisdiction); \n\n\n(iii) it has no shareholders or members who have a proprietary or beneficial interest in its income or assets; \n\n\n(iv) the applicable laws of the NFE\u2019s jurisdiction of residence (being a Member State, Andorra or other jurisdiction) or the NFE\u2019s formation documents do not permit any income or assets of the NFE to be distributed to, or applied for the benefit of, a private person or non-charitable Entity other than pursuant to the conduct of the NFE\u2019s charitable activities, or as payment of reasonable compensation for services rendered, or as payment representing the fair market value of property which the NFE has purchased; and \n\n\n(v) the applicable laws of the NFE\u2019s jurisdiction of residence (being a Member State, Andorra or other jurisdiction) or the NFE\u2019s formation documents require that, upon the NFE\u2019s liquidation or dissolution, all of its assets be distributed to a Governmental Entity or other non-profit organisation, or escheat to the government of the NFE\u2019s jurisdiction of residence (being a Member State, Andorra or other jurisdiction) or any political subdivision thereof. \n\n\nE. Miscellaneous \n\n\n1. The term \u201cAccount Holder\u201d means the person listed or identified as the holder of a Financial Account by the Financial Institution that maintains the account. A person, other than a Financial Institution, holding a Financial Account for the benefit or account of another person as agent, custodian, nominee, signatory, investment advisor, or intermediary, is not treated as holding the account for purposes of this Annex, and such other person is treated as holding the account.

For this purpose, control includes direct or indirect ownership of more than 50 % of the vote and value in an Entity. \n\n\nBefore the entry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on \u2026, Member States shall communicate to Andorra and Andorra shall communicate to the European Commission whether they have exercised the option provided for in this subparagraph. The European Commission may coordinate the transmission of the communication from Member States to Andorra and the European Commission shall transmit the communication from Andorra to all Member States. All further changes to the exercise of that option by a Member State or Andorra shall be communicated in the same manner.\n\n\n5. The term \u201cTIN\u201d means Taxpayer Identification Number (or functional equivalent in the absence of a Taxpayer Identification Number). \n\n\n6. The term \u201cDocumentary Evidence\u201d includes any of the following: \n\n\na) a certificate of residence issued by an authorised government body (for example, a government or agency thereof, or a municipality) of the jurisdiction (being a Member State, Andorra or other jurisdiction) in which the payee claims to be a resident. \n\n\nb) with respect to an individual, any valid identification issued by an authorised government body (for example, a government or agency thereof, or a municipality), that includes the individual\u2019s name and is typically used for identification purposes. \n\n\nc) with respect to an Entity, any official documentation issued by an authorised government body (for example, a government or agency thereof, or a municipality) that includes the name of the Entity and either the address of its principal office in the jurisdiction (being a Member State, Andorra or other jurisdiction) in which it claims to be a resident or the jurisdiction (being a Member State, Andorra or other jurisdiction) in which the Entity was incorporated or organised. \n\n\nd) any audited financial statement, third-party credit report, bankruptcy filing, or securities regulator\u2019s report. \n\n\nWith respect to a Preexisting Entity Account, each Member State or Andorra shall have the option to allow Reporting Financial Institutions to use as Documentary Evidence any classification in the Reporting Financial Institution's records with respect to the Account Holder that was determined based on a standardised industry coding system, that was recorded by the Reporting Financial Institution consistent with its normal business practices for purposes of AML/KYC Procedures or another regulatory purposes (other than for tax purposes) and that was implemented by the Reporting Financial Institution prior to the date used to classify the Financial Account as a Preexisting Account, provided that the Reporting Financial Institution does not know or does not have reason to know that such classification is incorrect or unreliable. The term \u2018standardised industry coding system\u2019 means a coding system used to classify establishments by business type for purposes other than tax purposes.\n\n\nBefore the entry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on \u2026, Member States shall communicate to Andorra and Andorra shall communicate to the European Commission whether they have exercised the option provided for in this subparagraph. The European Commission may coordinate the transmission of the communication from Member States to Andorra and the European Commission shall transmit the communication from Andorra to all Member States. All further changes to the exercise of that option by a Member State or Andorra shall be communicated in the same manner.\n\n\n\nSection IX: Effective Implementation \n\n\nEach Member State and Andorra must have rules and administrative procedures in place to ensure effective implementation of, and compliance with, the reporting and due diligence procedures set out above including: \n\n\n1. rules to prevent any Financial Institutions, persons or intermediaries from adopting practices intended to circumvent the reporting and due diligence procedures; \n\n\n2. rules requiring Reporting Financial Institutions to keep records of the steps undertaken and any evidence relied upon for the performance of the reporting and due diligence procedures and adequate measures to obtain those records; \n\n\n3. administrative procedures to verify Reporting Financial Institutions\u2019 compliance with the reporting and due diligence procedures; administrative procedures to follow up with a Reporting Financial Institution when undocumented accounts are reported; \n\n\n4. administrative procedures to ensure that the Entities and accounts defined in domestic law as Non-Reporting Financial Institutions and Excluded Accounts continue to have a low risk of being used to evade tax; and \n\n\n5. effective enforcement provisions to address non-compliance.\u00a0\n\nANNEX II\n\n\n\n\n\nComplementary Reporting and Due Diligence rules for financial account information\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Change in circumstances\n\n\nA \u2018change in circumstances\u2019 includes any change that results in the addition of information relevant to a person's status or otherwise conflicts with such person's status. In addition, a change in circumstances includes any change or addition of information to the Account Holder's account (including the addition, substitution, or other change of an Account Holder) or any change or addition of information to any account associated with such account (applying the account aggregation rules described in subparagraphs C(1) to (3) of Section VII of Annex I) if such change or addition of information affects the status of the Account Holder. \n\n\nIf a Reporting Financial Institution has relied on the residence address test described in subparagraph B(1) of Section III of Annex I and there is a change in circumstances  that causes the Reporting Financial Institution to know or have reason to know that the original Documentary Evidence (or other equivalent documentation ) is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Financial Institution must, by the later of the last day of the relevant calendar year or other appropriate reporting period, or 90 calendar days following the notice or discovery of such change in circumstances, obtain a self-certification and new Documentary Evidence to establish the residence(s) for tax purposes of the Account Holder. If the Reporting Financial Institution cannot obtain the self-certification and new Documentary Evidence by such date, the Reporting Financial Institution must apply the electronic record search procedure described in subparagraphs B(2) to (6) of Section III of Annex I.\n\n\n\n2. Self-certification for New Entity Accounts\n\n\nWith respect to New Entity Accounts, for the purposes of determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, a Reporting Financial Institution may only rely on a self-certification from either the Account Holder or the Controlling Person.\n\n\n\n3. Residence of a Financial Institution\n\n\nA Financial Institution is \u2018resident\u2019 in a Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction if it is subject to the jurisdiction of such Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction (i.e., the Participating Jurisdiction is able to enforce reporting by the Financial Institution). In general, where a Financial Institution is resident for tax purposes in a Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction, it is subject to the jurisdiction of such Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction and it is, thus, a Member State Financial Institution, Andorra Financial Institution or another Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution. In the case of a trust that is a Financial Institution (irrespective of whether it is resident for tax purposes in a Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction), the trust is considered to be subject to the jurisdiction of a Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction if one or more of its trustees are resident in such Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction except if the trust reports all the information required to be reported pursuant to this Agreement or another agreement implementing the Global Standard with respect to Reportable Accounts maintained by the trust to another Participating Jurisdiction (being a Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction), because it is resident for tax purposes in such other Participating Jurisdiction. However, where a Financial Institution (other than a trust) does not have a residence for tax purposes (e.g., because it is treated as fiscally transparent, or it is located in a jurisdiction that does not have an income tax), it is considered to be subject to the jurisdiction of a Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction and it is, thus, a Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution if:\n\n\n(a)it is incorporated under the laws of the Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction ;\n\n\n(b)it has its place of management (including effective management) in the Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction ; or\n\n\n(c)it is subject to financial supervision in the Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction.\n\n\nWhere a Financial Institution (other than a trust) is resident in two or more Participating Jurisdictions (being a Member State, Andorra or another Participating Jurisdiction), such Financial Institution will be subject to the reporting and due diligence obligations of the Participating Jurisdiction in which it maintains the Financial Account(s).\n\n\n\n4. Account maintained\n\n\nIn general, an account would be considered to be maintained by a Financial Institution as follows:\n\n\n(a)in the case of a Custodial Account, by the Financial Institution that holds custody over the assets in the account (including a Financial Institution that holds assets in street name for an Account Holder in such institution).\n\n\n\n\n(b)in the case of a Depository Account, by the Financial Institution that is obligated to make payments with respect to the account (excluding an agent of a Financial Institution regardless of whether such agent is a Financial Institution).\n\n\n(c)in the case of any equity or debt interest in a Financial Institution that constitutes a Financial Account, by such Financial Institution.\n\n\n(d)in the case of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract, by the Financial Institution that is obligated to make payments with respect to the contract.\n\n\n\n5. Trusts that are Passive NFEs\n\n\nAn Entity such as a partnership, limited liability partnership or similar legal arrangement that has no residence for tax purposes, according to subparagraph D(3) of Section VIII of Annex I, shall be treated as resident in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated. For these purposes, a legal person or a legal arrangement is considered \u2018similar\u2019 to a partnership and a limited liability partnership where it is not treated as a taxable unit in a Reportable Jurisdiction under the tax laws of such Reportable Jurisdiction. However, in order to avoid duplicate reporting (given the wide scope of the term \u201cControlling Persons\u201d in the case of trusts), a trust that is a Passive NFE may not be considered a similar legal arrangement.\n\n\n\n6. Address of Entity\u2019s principal office\n\n\nOne of the requirements described in subparagraph E(6)(c) of Section VIII of Annex I is that, with respect to an Entity, the official documentation includes either the address of the Entity\u2019s principal office in the Member State, Andorra or other jurisdiction in which it claims to be a resident or the Member State, Andorra or other jurisdiction in which the Entity was incorporated or organised. The address of the Entity\u2019s principal office is generally the place in which its place of effective management is situated. The address of a Financial Institution with which the Entity maintains an account, a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes is not the address of the Entity\u2019s principal office unless such address is the only address used by the Entity and appears as the Entity's registered address in the Entity's organisational documents. Further, an address that is provided subject to instructions to hold all mail to that address is not the address of the Entity\u2019s principal office.\n\n\n\n\nANNEX III\n\n\nLIST OF COMPETENT AUTHORITIES OF THE CONTRACTING PARTIES\n\n\nThe Competent Authorities for the purposes of this Agreement are:\n\n\n(a) in the Principality of Andorra: El Ministre eucarregat de les Finances or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(b) in the Kingdom of Belgium: De Minister van Financi\u00ebn/Le Ministre des Finances or an authorised representative,\n\n\n (c) in the Republic of Bulgaria: \u0418\u0437\u043f\u044a\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u0434\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u043d\u0430 \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0430\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 or an authorised representative, \n\n\n(d) in the Czech Republic: Ministr financ\u00ed or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(e) in the Kingdom of Denmark: Skatteministeren, or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(f) in the Federal Republic of Germany: Der Bundesminister der Finanzen or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(g) in the Republic of Estonia: Rahandusminister or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(h) in the Hellenic Republic: \u039f \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \u039f\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u039f\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd or an authorised representative,\n\n\n\n\n(i) in the Kingdom of Spain: El Ministro de Econom\u00eda y Hacienda or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(j) in the French Republic: Le Ministre charg\u00e9 du budget or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(k) in the Republic of Croatia: Ministar financija or an authorised representative\n\n\n(l) in Ireland: The Revenue Commissioners, or their authorised representative,\n\n\n(m) in the Italian Republic: Il Direttore Generale delle Finanze or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(n) in the Republic of Cyprus: \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 \u039f\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd, or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(o) in the Republic of Latvia: Finan\u0161u ministrs or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(p) in the Republic of Lithuania: Finans\u0173 ministras or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(q) in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg: Le Ministre des Finances or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(r) in Hungary: A p\u00e9nz\u00fcgyminiszter or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(s) in the Republic of Malta: Il-Ministru responsabbli g\u0127all-Finanzi or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(t) in the Kingdom of the Netherlands: De Minister van Financi\u00ebn or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(u) in the Republic of Austria: Der Bundesminister f\u00fcr Finanzen or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(v) in the Republic of Poland: Minister Finans\u00f3w or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(w) in the Portuguese Republic: O Ministro das Finan\u00e7as or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(x) in Romania: Pre\u0219edintele Agen\u021biei Na\u021bionale de Administrare Fiscal\u0103 or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(y) in the Republic of Slovenia: Minister za finance or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(z) in the Slovak Republic: Minister financi\u00ed or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(aa) in the Republic of Finland: Valtiovarainministeri\u00f6/Finansministeriet or an authorised representative,\n\n\n(ab) in the Kingdom of Sweden: Chefen f\u00f6r Finansdepartementet or an authorised representative,\n\n\n\n\n(ac) in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and in the European territories for whose external relations the United Kingdom is responsible: the Commissioners of Inland Revenue or their authorised representative and the competent authority in Gibraltar, which the United Kingdom will designate in accordance with the Agreed Arrangements relating to Gibraltar authorities in the context of EU and EC instruments and related treaties notified to the Member States and institutions of the European Union of 19 April 2000, a copy of which shall be notified to Andorra by the Secretary General of the Council of the European Union, and which shall apply to this Agreement.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nEntry into force and application\n\n\n1.

Andorra shall establish a final account by the end of the period of applicability of the Agreement in the form prior to its amendment by this Amending Protocol, make a final payment to the Member States and report the information that it received from paying agents established in Andorra, in accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement in the form prior to its amendment by this Amending Protocol with respect to the last year of applicability of the Agreement in the form prior to its amendment by this Amending Protocol, or to any preceding year, if applicable.\n\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThe Agreement is supplemented by a Protocol with the following content:\n\n\n\"Protocol to the Agreement between the European Union and the Principality of Andorra on the automatic exchange of financial account information to improve international tax compliance.\n\n\nOn the occasion of the signature of this Amending Protocol between the European Union and Andorra the duly authorised undersigned have agreed the following provisions which shall form an integral part of the Agreement as amended by this Amending Protocol:\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is understood that an exchange of information under Article 5 of this Agreement will only be requested once the requesting State (being a Member State or Andorra) has exhausted all regular sources of information available under the internal taxation procedure.\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is understood that the Competent Authority of the requesting State (being a Member State or Andorra) shall provide the following information to the Competent Authority of the requested State (being, respectively, Andorra or a Member State) when making a request for information under Article 5 of this Agreement:\n\n\n(i)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the identity of the person under examination or investigation;\n\n\n(ii)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the period of time for which the information is requested;\n\n\n(iii) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a statement of the information sought including its nature and the form in which the requesting State wishes to receive the information from the requested State;\n\n\n(iv)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the tax purpose for which the information is sought;\n\n\n(v)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to the extent known, the name and address of any person believed to be in possession of the requested information.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is understood that the reference to the standard of \"foreseeable relevance\" is intended to provide for exchange of information under Article 5 of this Agreement to the widest possible extent and, at the same time, to clarify that Member States and Andorra are not at liberty to engage in \"fishing expeditions\" or to request information that is unlikely to be relevant to the tax affairs of a given taxpayer. While paragraph 2 contains important procedural requirements that are intended to ensure that fishing expeditions do not occur, clauses (i) to (v) of paragraph 2 nevertheless are not to be interpreted in order to frustrate effective exchange of information. The standard of \"foreseeable relevance\" can be met both in cases dealing with one taxpayer (whether identified by name or otherwise) or several taxpayers (whether identified by name or otherwise).\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is understood that this Agreement does not include exchange of information on a spontaneous basis.\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is understood that in case of an exchange of information under Article 5 of this Agreement, the administrative procedural rules regarding taxpayers' rights provided for in the requested State (being a Member State or Andorra) remain applicable. It is further understood that these provisions aim at guaranteeing the taxpayer a fair procedure and not at preventing or unduly delaying the exchange of information process.\u201d.\n\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nLanguages\n\n\nThis Amending Protocol is drawn up in duplicate in the Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish languages, each of these language versions being equally authentic.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo be updated in all languages\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries have hereunto set their hands.\n\n\n\n\nTo be updated in all languages\n\n\n\nDone at [XXXX], this [XXXX] day of [XXXX] in the year [XXXX].\n\n\n\nTo be updated in all languages\n\n\n\nFor the European Union\n\n\n\nFor the Principality of Andorra\n\n\n\n\nDeclarations of the Contracting Parties:\n\n\n\nJoint declaration of the Contracting Parties on the entry into force of the Amending Protocol\n\n\n\n\nThe Contracting Parties declare that they expect that the constitutional requirements of Andorra and the requirements of European Union law concerning entering into international agreements will be fulfilled in time to enable the Amending Protocol to enter into force on the first day of\u00a0January\u00a02017. They will take all the measures in their power to achieve that goal.\n\n\n\nJoint declaration of the Contracting Parties on the Agreement and the Annexes\n\n\nThe Contracting Parties agree, regarding the implementation of the Agreement and the Annexes, that the Commentaries to the OECD Model Competent Authority Agreement and Common Reporting Standard should be a source of illustration or interpretation in order to ensure consistency in application.\n\n\n\nJoint declaration of the Contracting Parties on Article 5\u00a0of the Agreement\n\n\nThe Contracting Parties agree, regarding the implementation of Article 5 on Exchange of Information upon Request, that the commentary to Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital should be a source of interpretation.\n\n\n\nJoint declaration of the Contracting Parties on Section III(A) of Annex I of the Agreement\n\n\nThe Contracting Parties agree that they will examine the practical relevance of Section III (A) of Annex I which provides that preexisting Cash Value Insurance Contracts and Annuity Contracts are not required to be reviewed, identified or reported, provided the Reporting Financial Institution is effectively prevented by law from selling such Contracts to residents of a Reportable Jurisdiction.\n\n\nThe Contracting Parties have a common interpretation that under Section III (A) of Annex I the Reporting Financial Institution is effectively prevented by law from selling Cash Value Insurance Contracts and Annuity Contracts to residents of a Reportable Jurisdiction only where the European Union and domestic law of Member States or Andorran law applicable to a Reporting Financial Institution resident in a Participating Jurisdiction (being a Member State or Andorra) does not only effectively prevent that Reporting Financial Institution by law from selling Cash Value Insurance Contracts or Annuity Contracts in a Reportable Jurisdiction (being, respectively, Andorra or a Member State), but those laws also effectively prevent the Reporting Financial Institution by law from selling Cash Value Insurance Contracts or Annuity Contracts to residents of that Reportable Jurisdiction in any other circumstances.\n\n\nIn this context, each Member State will inform the European Commission, which will in turn notify Andorra, in case Reporting Financial Institutions in Andorra are prevented by law from selling such Contracts, regardless of where they are finalised, to its residents based on applicable European Union law and domestic law of that Member State. Accordingly, Andorra will notify the European Commission, which will in turn inform Member States, in case Reporting Financial Institutions of one or more Member States are prevented by law from selling such Contracts, regardless of where they are finalised, to Andorra residents based on Andorran law. These notifications will be made prior to the entry into force of the Amending Protocol regarding the foreseen legal situation as of the entry into force. In the absence of such notification it will be considered that Reporting Financial Institutions are not effectively prevented by the law of the Reportable Jurisdiction in one or more circumstances from selling Cash Value Insurance Contracts or Annuity Contracts to residents of that Reportable Jurisdiction. \n\n\nIn addition, each Member State will inform the European Commission, which will in turn notify Andorra, in case Reporting Financial Institutions in that Member State are prevented by law from selling such Contracts, regardless of where they are finalised, to Andorra residents based on applicable EU and domestic law of that Member State. Accordingly, Andorra will notify the European Commission, which will in turn inform Member States, in case Reporting Financial Institutions in Andorra are prevented by law from selling such Contracts, regardless of where they are finalised, to residents of one or more Member States based on Andorra law. These notifications will be made prior to the entry into force of the Amending Protocol regarding the foreseen legal situation as of the entry into force. In the absence of such notification it will be considered that Reporting Financial Institutions are not effectively prevented by the law of the Jurisdiction of the Financial Institution in one or more circumstances from selling Cash Value Insurance Contracts or Annuity Contracts to residents of the Reportable Jurisdiction. \n\n\nIn the absence of a notification from the Jurisdiction of the Reporting Financial Institution and from the Reportable Jurisdiction with regard to the relevant Reporting Financial Institution and Contract, Section III (A) of Annex I shall not apply to that Reporting Financial Institution and Contract.\n\n\n\nDeclaration of Andorra on article 5 of the Agreement\n\n\nThe Andorran Delegation has informed the European Commission that Andorra will not exchange information in relation to a request based on data obtained illegally. The European Commission took note of the Andorran position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ EU L157, 26.6.2003, p. 38.\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ EU L359, 4.12.2004, p. 33.\n\n\n\n(3)\nOJ EU L277, 21.10.2010, p. 27.\n\n\n\n(4)\nOJ EU L281, 23.11.1995, p. 31.\n\n\n\n(5)\nOJ EU L64, 11.3.2011, p. 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
