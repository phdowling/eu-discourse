Following these negotiations, a new Agreement and Protocol were initialled on 5 June 2015. They cover a period of five years from the date of their provisional application, i.e. from the date of their signature, as laid down in Article 15 of the Agreement and Article 12 of the Protocol.\n\n\nThe new Agreement will provide for a framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to establishing a strategic partnership between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia.\n\n\nThe main objective of the new Protocol is to provide fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the Liberian fishing zone, on the basis of the best available scientific advice and respecting the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), where applicable within the limits of the available surplus. The Commission based its position in part on the results of a forward-looking assessment, carried out by external experts, of whether a new Agreement and Protocol should be concluded. The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in Liberia\u2019s fishing zone, in the interests of both parties.\n\n\nThe Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories:\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a028 tuna seiners;\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06 surface long-liners.\n\n\nThe method for allocating fishing opportunities among the Member States should be defined. The Commission accordingly proposes that the Council adopt this Regulation.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe interested parties were consulted during the ex-ante evaluation on a possible Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and Protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia. Experts from the Member States and industry were also consulted in technical meetings. Furthermore, the Liberian fisheries authorities and stakeholders were consulted during a dedicated technical meeting. These consultations led to the conclusion that it would be beneficial for the EU and the Republic of Liberia to conclude a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and Protocol.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThis procedure is being carried out in parallel with the procedures relating to the Council Decision authorising the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia and the Implementation Protocol thereto, and the Council Decision on the conclusion, with the consent of the European Parliament, of the said Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and Implementation Protocol.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe annual financial contribution is EUR\u00a0715\u00a0000 for the first year, EUR\u00a0650\u00a0000 for the second, third and fourth years, and EUR\u00a0585\u00a0000 for the fifth year, on the basis of:\n\n\n(a) a reference tonnage of 6\u00a0500 tonnes, for which an amount linked to access has been set at EUR\u00a0357\u00a0500 for the first year, EUR\u00a0325\u00a0000 for the second, third and fourth years, and EUR\u00a0292\u00a0500 for the fifth year; and\n\n\n(b) support for development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Republic of Liberia, amounting to EUR\u00a0357\u00a0500 for the first year, EUR\u00a0325\u00a0000 for the second, third and fourth years, and EUR\u00a0292\u00a0500 for the fifth year. This support meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the Republic of Liberia\u2019s needs in relation to scientific research, artisanal fisheries as well as fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance and the fight against illegal fishing.\n\n\n2015/0222 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\n\n\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\n\n\nconcerning the allocation of fishing opportunities under the Implementation Protocol to the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)On 5 June 2015 the European Union and the Republic of Liberia initialled a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Agreement\u2019) and an Implementation Protocol thereto, granting Union vessels fishing opportunities in the waters over which the Republic of Liberia has sovereignty or jurisdiction in respect of fisheries.\n\n\n(2)On [\u2026] the Council adopted Decision 2014/\u2026/EU\n2\n on the signature and provisional application of the Agreement and the Implementation Protocol.\n\n\n(3)The method for allocating the fishing opportunities among the Member States should be defined, both for the period of provisional application and for the duration of the Protocol.\n\n\n(4)Article 10(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008\n3\n provides that the Commission must inform the Member States concerned if it transpires that the fishing opportunities allocated to the Union under the Protocol are not fully utilised.
