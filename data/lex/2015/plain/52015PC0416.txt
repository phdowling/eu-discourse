In accordance with Article 395(2) of the VAT Directive, the Commission informed the other Member States by letters dated 24 June 2015 of the request made by Slovenia. By letter dated 25 June 2015, the Commission notified Slovenia that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.\n\n\nGeneral context\n\n\nChapter 1 of Title XII of the VAT Directive allows for the possibility for Member States to apply special schemes for small enterprises, including the possibility of exempting taxable persons below a certain annual turnover. This exemption implies that a taxable person does not have to charge VAT on his supplies and, consequently, he cannot deduct the VAT on his input.\n\n\nUnder Article 287(15) of the VAT Directive, Slovenia may exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than the equivalent in national currency of EUR 25 000.\n\n\nIn 2012, Slovenia requested a derogation in order to simplify VAT obligations for small traders and to ease the collection of the tax for the national tax administration. By Council Implementing Decision 2013/54/EU of 22 January 2013 the Council authorised Slovenia to exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 50 000 until 31 December 2015. This measure is optional for taxable persons. Based on this experience, Slovenia has now requested an extension of that measure which would continue to be optional for taxable persons.\n\n\nFrom the information provided by Slovenia, at the end of 2013, 51.45% of the VAT payers had a taxable turnover below EUR 50 000 and the VAT revenue generated by them represented only 1% of the total VAT revenue. In addition, the number of taxable persons registered for VAT purposes with a threshold between EUR 25 000 and EUR 50 000 has decreased both in 2013 and 2014. This signifies that an increasing number of small business make use of the simplification measure.\n\n\nFrom information provided by Slovenia, it appears that the impact of the measure on tax VAT revenue collected at the final consumption stage is negligible.\n\n\nIt is therefore proposed to extend the derogation for another period until the earliest of 31 December 2018 or the entry into force of a Directive on the annual turnover thresholds below which taxable persons may be exempt from VAT.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nSimilar derogations have been granted to other Member States.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe measure is in line with the Union's objectives for small businesses, as laid out in Commission Communication \"Think small first\" \u2013 a \"Small Business Act for Europe\" (COM(2008) 394 of 25 June 2008).\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons.\n\n\nThe Decision concerns an authorisation granted to a Member State upon its own request and does not constitute any obligation.\n\n\nGiven the limited scope of the derogation, the special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued.\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nProposed instruments: Council Implementing Decision.\n\n\nUnder Article 395 of the VAT Directive, derogation from the common VAT rules is only possible with the authorisation of the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission. Moreover, a Council Implementing Decision is the most suitable instrument since it can be addressed to individual Member States.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nNot relevant.\n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nThere was no need for external expertise. \n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nThe proposal for a Council Implementing Decision aims at continuing for another three years a simplification measure which removes many of the VAT obligations for businesses operating with an annual turnover no higher than EUR 50 000 and therefore has a potential positive impact on the reduction of administrative burden for businesses and tax administration without a major impact on the total VAT revenue. Because of the narrow scope of the derogation and its limited application in time, the scope will in any case be limited.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe proposal has no implication for the EU budget because Slovenia will carry out a compensation calculation in accordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC EURATOM) 1553/89.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\nThe proposal includes a sunset clause; an automatic time limit which is set at 31 December 2018 for this derogation.\n\n\n\n2015/0185 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\n\n\namending Implementing Decision 2013/54/EU authorising the Republic of Slovenia to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 287 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\n\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, \n\n\nHaving regard to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax\n1\n, and in particular Article 395(1) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Article 287(15) of Directive 2006/112/EC authorises Slovenia to exempt from value added tax (VAT) taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 25 000.\n\n\n(2)By Council Implementing Decision 2013/54/EU\n2\n, Slovenia was authorised, until 31 December 2015 and as a derogation, to exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 50 000.\n\n\n(3)By letters registered with the Commission on 27 May 2015 and 17 June 2015, Slovenia requested authorisation for an extension of the measure derogating from Article 287(15) of Directive 2006/112/EC in order to be able to continue to exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 50 000. Through that measure, those taxable persons would continue to be exempted from certain or all of the obligations in relation to VAT referred to in Chapters 2 to 6 of Title XI of Directive 2006/112/EC.\n\n\n(4)The Commission informed the other Member States by letters dated 24 June 2015 of the request made by Slovenia. By letter dated 25 June 2015, the Commission notified Slovenia that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.\n\n\n(5)From the information provided by Slovenia, at the end of 2013, 51.45% of the VAT payers had a taxable turnover below EUR 50 000 and represented only 1% of the total VAT revenue.\n\n\n(6)Given that this higher threshold has resulted in reduced VAT obligations for the small businesses, whilst such businesses may still opt for the regular VAT arrangements in accordance with Article 290 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Slovenia should be authorised to apply the measure for a further limited period.\n\n\n(7)(7)The derogation has no impact on the Union's own resources accruing from VAT because Slovenia will carry out a compensation calculation in accordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC, EURATOM) 1553/89\n3\n. \n\n\n(8)(8)Implementing Decision 2013/54/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nIn the second paragraph of Article 2 of Implementing Decision 2013/54/EU, the date \u201831 December 2015\u2019 is replaced by the date \u201831 December 2018\u2019.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Slovenia.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1\n\n\n\n(2)\nCouncil Implementing Decision 2013/54/EU of 22 January 2013 authorising the Republic of Slovenia to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 287 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (OJ L 22, 25.1.2013, p.15).\n\n\n\n(3)\nCouncil Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89 of 29 May 1989 on the definitive uniform arrangements for the collection of own resources accruing from value added tax (OJ L 155, 7.6.1989, p. 9).\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
