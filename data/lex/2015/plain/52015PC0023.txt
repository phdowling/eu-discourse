The EU and Turkey signed the Convention on 15 June 2011 and on 4 November 2011 respectively.\nThe EU and Turkey deposited their\r\ninstrument of acceptance with the depositary of the Convention on 26 March 2012\r\nand 4 December 2013 respectively. As a consequence, in application of its\r\nArticle 10(3), the Convention entered into force in relation to the EU and Turkey on 1 May 2012 and on 1 February 2014 respectively.\nArticle 6 of the Convention provides that\r\neach Contracting Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the\r\nConvention is effectively applied. To that effect, the EU-Turkey Association\r\nCouncil should adopt a Decision replacing Protocol 3 to Decision No 1/98 of the EC-Turkey Association Council on the trade\r\nregime for agricultural products[2], concerning the definition of the concept of 'originating products'\r\nand methods of administrative cooperation, by a new Protocol which, with regard\r\nto the rules of origin, refers to the Convention. The position to be taken by\r\nthe EU within the Association Council should be established by the Council.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe EU Member States were informed on the\r\ndraft Council Decision in the Customs Code Committee's Origin Section of 13 May\r\n2013. The Contracting Parties to the Convention were last consulted at the\r\nmeeting of the Pan-Euro-Med working group of 22 and 23 October 2014.\nNo recourse to external expertise has been\r\nnecessary. Furthermore, it has not been necessary to conduct an impact\r\nassessment, since the proposed amendments are technical in nature and do not\r\naffect the substance of the protocol on rules of origin currently in effect.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the Council Decision is\r\nthe first subparagraph of Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article\r\n218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union.
