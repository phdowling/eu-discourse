Furthermore, guarantee documents where Contracting Parties to the Convention are mentioned need to be changed accordingly.\n\n\nThe purpose is to adopt the common EU position on the draft Decision No \u2026/2015 of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit amending the Convention. \n\n\nConsistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThere are no existing provisions in the area of the proposal.\n\n\nConsistency with other Union policies\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\nLegal basis\n\n\nArticle 15 of the Convention of 20 May 1987 on a common transit procedure.\n\n\nThe Convention establishes the measures facilitating the movement of goods between the European Union, the Republic of Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Kingdom of Norway, the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Turkey.\n\n\nThe Republic of Serbia wishes to accede to the Convention and has fulfilled the legal, structural and information technology requirements, which are preconditions for accession.\n\n\nOnce all preconditions have been met by the Republic of Serbia and the country has been invited to accede and deposited its instrument of accession, it is necessary to amend the Convention with new linguistic references in the Serbian language and the appropriate adaptations of guarantee documents. These amendments are to be introduced and applied as of the first day the Republic of Serbia starts using the common transit system.\n\n\nThis draft decision was pre-approved by the Customs Code Committee - Customs Status and Transit Section and by the EU/EFTA Working Group on Common transit.\n\n\nThe Commission is invited to approve this draft Decision by the written procedure, in order to submit it to the Council to establish a common position for its final adoption by the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit.\n\n\nProportionality\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The form of proposed action is the only one possible.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The form of proposed action does not involve any financing cost.\n\n\nChoice of the instrument\n\n\nProposed instruments: Decision.\n\n\nThere is no other adequate instrument.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nStakeholder consultation\n\n\nConsultation with approval on the draft Decision No \u2026/2015 of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit amending the Convention were carried out with the Member States within the Customs Code Committee \u2013 Customs Status and Transit Section and with Contracting Parties to the Convention within the  EU-EFTA working group on \"Common transit\".\n\n\nSummary of responses and how they have been taken into account:\n\n\nFavourable opinion.\n\n\nCollection and use of expertise\n\n\nThere was no need for external expertise.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\n\nThe accession to the Convention is part of the pre-accession strategy of the Republic of Serbia to the European Union. It will lead to an alignment to the 'acquis communautaire' in the transit area. The introduction of common transit in the Republic of Serbia as an alternative to the TIR procedure will bring further facilitation of transit, reduction in costs and a possible increase in trade.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal has no implication for the EU budget.\n\n\n2015/0187 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\n\n\non the position to be taken by the European Union in the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit as regards the adoption of a Decision amending the Convention on a common transit procedure \n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Article 15a of the Convention between the European Economic Community, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland, the Republic of Iceland, the Kingdom of Norway, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Swiss Confederation on a common transit procedure\n1\n (the \"Convention\") allows for a third country to become a Contracting Party to the Convention following a decision of the Joint Committee set up by the Convention to invite the country.\n\n\n(2)Article 15 of the Convention empowers the EU-EFTA Joint Committee to recommend and adopt, by decisions, amendments to the Convention and the Appendices thereto.\n\n\n(3)The Republic of Serbia formally expressed its wish to join the common transit system.\n\n\n(4)Having satisfied the essential legal, structural and information technology requirements which are preconditions for accession and following the formal procedure for accession, the Republic of Serbia may accede to the Convention.\n\n\n(5)The enlargement of the common transit system will require amendments to the Convention concerning new linguistic references in the Serbian language and the appropriate adaptations to guarantee documents.\n\n\n(6)The proposed amendments were presented to, and discussed within the EU-EFTA Working Group on \"common transit\" and \"simplification of formalities in trade in goods\" and the text received preliminary approval.\n\n\n(7)The position of the Union concerning the proposed amendment should therefore be based on the attached draft Decision,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position to be taken by the Union within the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit shall be based on the draft Decision attached to this Decision.\n\n\nMinor changes to the draft Decision may be agreed upon by the representatives of the Union in the EU-EFTA Joint Committee.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nAfter its adoption, the Decision of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.\n\n\n\n\nDone at
