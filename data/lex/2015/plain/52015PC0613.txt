Its objective is to prepare the EU aviation safety regulatory framework for the challenges of the next ten to fifteen years and thus to continue to ensure safe, secure and environmentally friendly air transport for passengers and the general public. This initiative builds on over twelve years of experience in the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008\n1\n and its predecessor\n2\n. \n\n\nSafety and consideration for environmental protection are pre-requisites for a competitive aviation sector. With the aviation traffic in Europe predicted to reach 14.4 million flights in 2035 (50% more than in 2012), the Commission's objective is to make sure that the system continues to maintain the current low number of accidents, allowing the EU aviation sector to safely grow in the future and thus to contribute to its competitive edge. For this purpose the present initiative proposes to introduce a risk and performance based approach to safety regulation, close existing safety gaps, and better take into account interdependencies between aviation safety and other technical domains of regulation such as aviation security or environmental protection.\n\n\nWhile aviation safety is the principal objective of this proposal, it is not the only one. This proposal must also be seen in the context of the Commission priorities of fostering jobs and growth, developing the internal market and strengthening Europe's role as a global actor. This initiative aims at contributing to a competitive European aviation industry and aeronautical manufacturing which generates high value-jobs and drives technological innovation. It will create an effective regulatory framework for the integration of new business models and emerging technologies. In particular this initiative proposes to create a Union framework for safe integration of unmanned aircraft into the European airspace.\n\n\nThis proposal also responds to the calls from the Member States, industry and airspace users for a more proportionate and flexible approach to safety regulation and to eliminate rules which can stifle entrepreneurship with too prescriptive requirements. It notably proposes to introduce a scalable framework which recognises the differences existing between the various sectors of civil aviation and the risks involved therein. This approach is expected to benefit the whole aviation sector in the Union and will be particularly suited to the needs of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\n\nWith the transition to a risk and performance based approach to regulation and oversight, Member States and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) will need to develop new skills and competences, as well as to be continuously abreast with the latest technologies developed by the industry. This initiative supports the achievement of these objectives by proposing better arrangements for coordination and development of aviation research and training.\n\n\nFinally the present proposal addresses the challenges that some national authorities face in maintaining and financing the resources necessary for accomplishing the required certification and oversight work. To this end the present initiative proposes a framework for pooling and sharing of technical resources between the national authorities and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and which includes the possibility of transferring responsibilities for implementation of Union legislation on a voluntary basis.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe present initiative builds on the existing Union provisions dealing with civil aviation safety as currently contained in Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n\n\nThe proposal is consistent with the 2013 Commission initiative on accelerating the implementation of the Single European Sky (SES II + initiative)\n3\n. When preparing the present proposal the Commission has taken into account the Commission\u2019s proposal COM(2013)409 of 11.06.2013 and the results of the discussions so far in the European Parliament and in the Council on the proposed SES II+ amendments to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. In order to avoid two legislative proposals related to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 being discussed in parallel and this proposal being the more comprehensive one, the proposed SES II+ amendments to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 have been subsumed into this new proposal, while adapting them to the new structure and drafting style of this proposal. As a result the Commission will not pursue further discussions on the proposal COM(2013)409 of 11.6.2013, which was presented as part of the SES II + initiative. \n\n\nWhere changes proposed by this initiative have impact on other Union legislation adopted by the European Parliament and the Council related to air transport (which is the case for accident investigation, occurrence reporting and licensing of air carriers), appropriate amendments to other Union acts are proposed to ensure consistency of approach.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThis initiative is linked and fully consistent with the 2014-2019 strategic objectives of the Commission with respect to the promotion of 'Jobs and Growth' and of a 'Deeper and Fairer Internal Market with a Strengthened Industrial Base'.\n\n\nThe present proposal is also consistent with the 'Common Approach on decentralised agencies' agreed in 2012 between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, and aligns, where relevant, the provisions dealing with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency with the standard clauses recommended in this common approach.\n\n\nThe initiative also intends to make the design and operations of unmanned aircraft more consistent with the wider aviation policy framework. Unmanned aircraft will become another type of aerial vehicle to provide a range of new services in the European aviation market within the context of Regulation (EC) 1008/2008 on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community. As unmanned aircraft share the same airspace with other aircraft, the safety of their operations must remain coherent with the overall aviation safety policy. Finally, unmanned aircraft operations must also be consistent with air traffic rules as laid down in the Common Rules of the Air.\u00a0\n4\n\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal is based on Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which is the legal basis for the adoption of Union measures relating to air transport. \n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nPursuant to Regulations No (EC) 1592/2002 and No (EC) 216/2008, the Union has been made responsible for tasks regarding the airworthiness and environmental compatibility of aeronautical products, flight operations, aircrew licensing, aerodromes and air traffic management and air navigation services (ATM/ANS), as well as safety of third country operators. Civil aviation safety has therefore now been regulated at Union level for over a decade. This results from the fact that air transport and aeronautical production are, to a large extent, activities of transnational character which can be better addressed at Union level. \n\n\nUnder the present initiative a limited number of specific areas are proposed to be added to this overall Union aviation safety framework, namely unmanned aircraft, safety of ground handling services and security aspects of aircraft and aviation systems\u2019 design, including cybersecurity.\n\n\nUnmanned aircraft manufacturing has a cross-border dimension since many unmanned aircraft are bought online, are imported or at least have imported parts. Mutual recognition in the internal market is difficult to achieve in the presence of detailed and diverging national standards and rules. Also with regard to unmanned aircraft services, many operators are developing cross-border activities. For instance, infrastructure inspections, from oil rigs to rail tracks, are being organised at an international level. Even if operations have a limited scope, operators should be in a position to use the same unmanned aircraft and the same operating requirements with the same pilot at different places in the Union to develop their businesses, especially if they operate in niche markets. Large delivery companies have expressed their intentions to organise their services at European level which requires common rules. Subsidiarity applies at the level of the implementation of the common operational rules, e.g. Member State authorities will carry out local risk assessments and decide which airspace shall be open or closed to unmanned aircraft operations, and under which conditions. Most of the light unmanned aircraft operations have a local dimension and it should be for the local authorities to assess the level of risk and authorise the specific type of operation.\n\n\nAs regards ground handling services, the need for action at Union level is necessary given the fact that accidents related to ground handling constitute the fourth biggest accident category in the period of the last ten years, while the voluntary initiatives at Member State level have as yet not produced satisfactory results to address this risk. There are at present no safety requirements at Union level which address directly the providers of ground handling services. As ground handling is part of the overall aviation system and interlinks with other domains which are covered by Union competence (such as aerodrome and flight operations), regulating it at Union level will assure a consistent approach in all Member States. In order to ensure a proportionate approach, it is proposed that there is no need for certification of service providers as a condition to start operations. It is also the Commission\u2019s view that the common requirements for ground handling should be based on recognised industry standards and best practices. At the same time Member States should be given the necessary regulatory tools to ensure effective oversight with respect to the providers of such services.\n\n\nWith respect to security aspects of aircraft and systems\u2019 design, it has to be pointed out that the Union is already involved in some of these issues. The interaction between Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002\n5\n and the current Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 is not always clear, however, including on the role of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. This initiative proposes to clarify the role of the Union in this regard, taking account of the fact that these security aspects are closely linked with safety of aircraft design and flight operations, where the Union is already responsible pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nProportionality is one of the primary objectives of the present initiative, and measures aiming at making the current regulatory framework for aviation safety more proportional are an integral element of the final package of policy measures proposed, as explained in the accompanying Impact Assessment Report (Chapter 6.6). This initiative proposes to introduce a risk based approach to the regulation of aviation safety, which should benefit the whole aviation sector and which is particularly suited to regulating small and medium sized enterprises.\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nThe present proposal does not change the type of instrument used. Since 2002, when Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 was adopted, civil aviation safety in the Union has been regulated by means of regulations. The Commission sees no reason to change that.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nStakeholders were consulted in parallel by the Commission and by the European Aviation Safety Agency. The two consultations were complementary. In addition, the services of the Commission conducted a number of meetings with Member States and aviation stakeholders to supplement the public consultations with additional information. The \n\nsummary of the results of the Commission public consultation has been published on the Europa website\n\n. The main findings of the public consultation are as follows:\n\n\n\n\u2013There is a strong agreement that the Union has achieved a very high level of safety. Over 90% of contributors agreed or strongly agreed with a statement that it is, at present, safe to travel by plane in the Union;\n\n\n\u2013At the same time it was recognised that, when it comes to safety, there is no place for complacency. Over 70% of Member States and industry organisations which contributed to the Commission\u2019s on-line survey believe that the ability to identify and mitigate safety risks has to be improved;\n\n\n\u2013Beyond maintaining the current safety performance, the main concern of Member States and stakeholders is the efficiency and proportionality of the present system. The vast majority of the organisations which contributed to the Commission\u2019s on-line survey (82%), and in particular the SMEs, argue that existing rules are too detailed and prescriptive, and that the current safety levels could be maintained with lower compliance cost (83%). This view is largely shared by Member States;\n\n\n\u2013There is a concern amongst Member States and industry that the current way the technical resources are being used by the aviation authorities is inefficient, and that some national aviation authorities experience shortages of resources. The majority (63%) of Member States and of the organisations which submitted replies to the Commission\u2019s on-line survey believe that some of the national aviation authorities do not have sufficient financial or human resources to carry out their oversight tasks;\n\n\n\n\n\u2013The aircraft manufacturing industry has advocated a much more active role of the Union in promoting European civil aviation safety standards internationally, including in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), and expressed concern about long-term availability of resources at the European Aviation Safety Agency for product certification;\n\n\n\u201373% of organisations which contributed to the Commission\u2019s on-line survey pointed towards possible inconsistencies, gaps and overlaps in the application of the law, in particular stemming from varying interpretations of law by Member States.\n\n\nThe Union social partners (representing both employers and employees) have contributed to the consultations conducted by the Commission and the European Aviation Safety Agency. The organisations representing the aviation personnel pointed in particular to the fact that the performance based approach to aviation safety should complement but not replace the current system of prescriptive regulations. Organisations representing the employees were also concerned about the future availability of resources dedicated by Member States to safety oversight and pointed to the need to pay particular attention to ensuring a high level of training and competency of staff both at the authorities and in the aviation sector at large. Organisations representing the pilots in particular expressed concerned about potential negative impact on safety stemming from certain airline employment practices and other innovative business models.\n\n\nOn the other hand organisations representing the employers drew the Commission's attention to differences in application of law by Member States, overregulation and inefficient use of resources dedicated to certification and oversight. Employers pointed in particular to the fact that, while the aviation industry operates freely within the internal market, oversight is still organised based on the principle of individual Member State responsibility. Level playing field, standardisation and stability in the implementation of rules are considered to be of particular importance for the employers. Some of the organisations representing employers advocated the creation of a single civil aviation authority for the Union.\n\n\nThe Commission largely agrees with the results of the public consultations and has reflected them in the formulation of the present proposal. The ability of the Union to identify and mitigate safety risks should be enhanced by the provisions of the proposal dealing with safety management, the European Plan for Aviation Safety, and national safety programmes. The introduction of a risk and performance based approach to regulation should allow achieving a more proportionate regulatory framework which better takes into account the differences between the different types of aviation activities and the risks involved therein. The proposed framework for pooling and sharing of resources between the national aviation authorities and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency is expected to increase the efficiency in the use of resources. \n\n\nA separate public consultation was organised for unmanned aircraft, which endorsed the need for urgent action at the Union level to tap the potential of unmanned aircraft. The contribution of these technologies to jobs and growth was confirmed. The consultation confirmed the view that the full range of unmanned aircraft is ready for development and that legal and technological uncertainty impedes a swift expansion. Specific authorizations and fragmentation are a real burden. Respondents identified safety and privacy as the most important concerns which could be managed with an appropriate regulatory framework that keeps rules proportionate to risk and with a strong role for national authorities.\n\n\nThe current division of competence between Union and Member States regarding regulation of unmanned aircraft, which is based on a threshold of 150 kg, is generally deemed obsolete. The rules for unmanned aircraft should evolve towards an operation centric approach, where risk of a particular operation is made dependent on a range of factors. Concerning security and privacy aspects of unmanned aircraft operations, the consultation does not point to the need for new rules, but more to a better application of existing rules, with a closer collaboration between national aviation authorities and national data protection authorities.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nThe Commission has sought an \n\nOpinion from the European Aviation Safety Agency, which was delivered on 16 March 2015\n\n. The opinion is based on over 6 000 comments submitted by Member States and stakeholders, and suggests a variety of changes to the different areas of technical regulation of aviation, including safety, security, research, environmental protection, and efficient use of resources within the European aviation safety system.\n\n\n\nThe Commission has also relied on the following expertise and advice:\n\n\n1.Two studies were contracted to support the impact assessment process:\n\n\n\u2013The first study analysed the availability, efficiency of utilisation and evolution of human resources of aviation authorities, as well as the financing of the European aviation safety system (support study on resources). This study concluded that the resource to workload balance has deteriorated over the last ten years. Furthermore, according to the study, existing resources could be better allocated across the system. Shortcomings were also identified as regards qualifications of staff. The study argues that, combined, these aspects prevent aviation authorities from performing up to their potential. Finally, the study concluded that differences in working methods between national aviation authorities and differences in the way these authorities are financed impact on a level playing field within the common aviation market.\n\n\n\u2013The second study, on performance schemes and performance based approach, explored possibilities of introducing performance elements in the management of aviation safety (support study on performance). This study concluded that introducing a safety performance scheme for civil aviation is feasible, but cautioned against its rapid introduction for a number of technical reasons. With respect to a performance based approach to regulation of aviation safety, the study concluded that this approach should have a positive impact on aviation safety and innovation, but the impact of this approach can only be described qualitatively and is very much depending on the specific rules that will be converted from prescriptive to performance based. This makes it impossible to quantify upfront the benefits of a performance based approach to safety regulation in the aviation sector. This study was also subject to a peer review by industry and Member States' experts.\n\n\n2.The Commission took into account recommendations of the \n\nsub-group on the future EU aviation regulatory system\n\n set up by the Management Board of the European Aviation Safety Agency, which was made up of the Directors-General of Civil Aviation of 14 EU/EFTA countries, as well as of representatives from EASA and the Commission\n6\n. Finally the results of the independent external \n\nevaluation conducted in accordance with Article 62\n\n of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 on the implementation of this Regulation were taken into account (Article 62 evaluation)\n7\n.\u00a0 In both of these evaluations it was recommended, amongst other, that Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 be amended in a number of respects. The summary of the recommendations made by these evaluations are contained in the impact assessment report accompanying this proposal. \n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nThis proposal is accompanied by two Impact Assessment Reports which can be accessed at [link]. The Impact Assessment Report on the Review of Regulation (EC) 216/2008 has been reviewed by the Impact Assessment Board, which has issued a positive opinion [link] on 19 June 2015. The Regulatory Scrutiny Board reviewed the Impact Assessment Report on the Safe Development of Drone Operations in the EU and has issued a positive opinion [link] on 5 November 2015.  \n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nThe proposal exempts manned aircraft which are of very simple design or operate mainly on a local basis, and those that are home-built or particularly rare or only exist in a small number. The initiative also exempts aerodromes which are not open to public use, which do not serve commercial air transport, or which do not meet certain minimum technical characteristics related to the size or scope of operations. \n\n\nMicroenterprises and SMEs are not excluded from the scope of the proposal, which is also the case under the current Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. The proposal introduces however a more proportionate and scalable regime which will allow to better take into account the differences which exist between the different sizes of businesses. The introduction of such a scalable regime is one of the primary objectives of the present proposal.  More specifically, as regards SMEs and light aviation, a number of measures would reduce the administrative burden for these sectors and make the regulation more favourable for small entrepreneurs. In the domain of aircraft design approval, an alternative procedure to a type certification is proposed for light aircraft used in low risk operations. Manufacturers of ultralight aircraft which are normally excluded from EU rules, would be also allowed - if they wish so - to have their products regulated under EU law and thus benefit from free circulation within the internal market. Aeroclubs and specialised light aviation associations would be allowed to act - within established conditions - as qualified entities on behalf of national aviation authorities.\n\n\nThe proposal will also facilitate the electronic exchange of information and further introduction of digital technologies. The Commission in particular proposes the establishment of an electronic repository of information relevant for certification, oversight and enforcement activities to which all the aviation authorities of the Member States and EASA would have access. Certain information collected in the repository will also be made available to the general public. It is proposed that the Agency is empowered to enter into arrangements with undertakings or associations of undertakings regarding data gathering, exchange and analysis, which would pave the way for the introduction of big data technologies in aviation safety analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nThe present proposal does not have direct consequences for the protection of fundamental rights, except for the particular articles concerning operations of unmanned aircraft. The rules developed for the safe operations of unmanned aircraft will contribute to the more effective application of existing rules on privacy and data protection. So will the safety requirement to equip the unmanned aircraft with an identification device, like an electronic identification chip, also help detecting persons who did not respect privacy or data protection rules. \n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal has budgetary implications with regard to the budget of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency set out under article 06 02 02 of the Union budget, as further explained in the Legislative Financial Statement.\n\n\nThe proposal introduces a number of new tasks for the Agency with consequences for its need for posts financed from the Union contribution. The additional staff requests mainly relate to (1) the coordination at Union level of the gathering, exchange and analysis of data and information (known as \u201cbig data\u201d), (2) the creation and management of a Union repository of information relevant for certification, oversight and enforcement, (3) new tasks related to rule-making and implementation in the areas of ground handling, environment and security, as well as (4) the creation of a framework for the transfer of responsibilities within the European aviation safety system aiming at better use of available resources Union-wide.\n\n\nThe identified human resources required will partially be met by present staff through their redeployment, thus reducing the need of the Agency for additional staff financed from budget related to the Union contribution to 5 posts and 4 contract agents.\n\n\nIn Annex X to the Impact Assessment Report a proposal has been made, based on re-attributing charges paid for ATM/ANS-related authority tasks from Eurocontrol to the Agency, without increasing the costs for operators. If the Agency were enabled to finance its activities related to ATM/ANS authority tasks through those charges, budget from its Union contribution would become available to finance additional posts. The proposed Regulation therefore establishes en-route charges as a revenue for the Agency in Article 109(1)(f). Attributing en-route charges to EASA would in addition require an amendment to Commission Implementing Regulation 391/2013 of 3 May 2013 on laying down a common charging scheme for air navigation services.\n\n\nFurthermore, the proposal aims at introducing a mechanism that would allow better adjusting the Agency's staffing levels financed from budget related to fees and charges to the identified needs.\n\n\nIn this context it is important to note that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency is a Union agency that is partially self-financed from fees and charges. The Union contribution together with contributions from third countries constitutes about one third of its budget, while about two thirds are generated through the collection of fees and charges from industry for certification and other services. The budget from the Union contribution is distinct from the fees and charges budget and the Agency's accounting system strictly distinguishes between Union contribution related activities and fees and charges related activities avoiding any cross financing. In the case of this Agency, the Union contribution therefore does not constitute a \"balancing\" contribution, as is the case for other partially self-financed agencies, based on the decision of the legislator that fees and charges should reflect real costs.\n\n\nThe Commission proposes to examine the possibility of introducing more flexibility in adjusting the Agency's establishment plan related to fees and charges from industry for certification and other services, based on fluctuations in industry demand for services. Such flexibility should, however, be conditional upon the development of solid indicators to measure workload and the efficiency of the Agency. This is to ensure that increased flexibility does not lead to an additional burden on industry. Those indicators could take into account elements such as average timeliness of certification activities, response time to industry applications, average effort per certificate and ratio of overhead costs over total activity costs. In case of decreasing demand the Agency has to adjust fee-financed staffing levels downwards. Necessary staff reduction would be achieved making use of fixed-term contracts and natural turn-over in posts underpinned by a sound planning of future tasks.\n\n\nThere are a number of factors that may impact the need for staff financed through fees. Factors that may influence market demand in the next five years include:\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Demand for new aircraft with a focus on Asia-Pacific, where the fleet is expected to grow by a factor of three. This demand will partly be satisfied by new types from manufacturers from these regions which will also be subject to the EASA certification process. \n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Global traffic that is expected to rise by an annual rate of 3% having a direct impact on the Agency\u2019s continuing airworthiness activities (safety critical oversight) as the work per type certificate is directly proportionate to the usage of the type by airlines.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New technologies such as the development of unmanned aircraft, electric aircraft or new airship technology.\n\n\nFactors that may influence the development of new tasks at the agency include:\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Big data project\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transfer of responsibilities from Member States to the Agency according to the proposed Articles 53, 54 and 55 on a basis of a fee-financed system. \n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Security threats including to cyber security are increasing and may require new approaches to certification.\n\n\nThe Commission intends to discuss the merits of introducing a new model of flexibility to respond to fluctuations in workload from industry, while guaranteeing efficiency through the use of indicators, with the European Parliament and the Council in the context of the inter-institutional working group (IIWG) on resources of decentralised agencies, whose next meeting is tentatively scheduled for March 2016.\n\n\nIn parallel, together with the Agency the Commission will continue working on a set of indicators to measure the Agency's workload and efficiency in relation to fees and charges to set out in detail how a system of flexibility for posts related to fees and charges would work in practice, and what the corresponding impact on the Agency's establishment plan would be.\n\n\n\n\nThe request for increased flexibility in adjusting staffing levels for posts related to fees and charges is closely linked to the Commission priority of boosting jobs, growth and investment. With respect to the activities financed from fees and charges industry is expecting a timely and market-driven response to its needs considered essential for the competitiveness of the European aviation industry. \n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nThe monitoring, evaluation and reporting framework for the present initiative is described in Chapter 7 of the accompanying Impact Assessment Report. Ample mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation already exist and can be used, due to the fact that in the field of aviation safety the monitoring of performance is an integral element of the Union regulatory framework. The effectiveness of the proposed measure, once adopted, will be subject to a mandatory evaluation every five years, as is the case under the current Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal \n\n\n\nThe whole text of the proposed Regulation has undergone a thorough quality of legislation check, as a result of which the Commission is proposing a new, clearer structure for the Regulation and standardised language, especially in Chapter III, which deals with the different domains of aviation safety. \n\n\nAll the provisions dealing with activities of national competent authorities and of the Agency with respect to exercise of their certification, oversight and enforcement tasks have been now concentrated in Chapter IV. Chapter III of the proposed Regulation contains exclusively provisions which are applicable to the legal and natural persons subject to the provisions of the Regulation (that is pilots, organisations responsible for aircraft manufacturing, aerodrome operators etc.).\n\n\nChapter I 'Principles':\n\n\nArticle 1: Additional objectives and means to achieve these objectives are added to the proposed Regulation, as compared to the current Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n\n\nArticle 2: This article merges Articles 1 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. The text has been simplified. The main change is the introduction of the possibility for Member States to apply certain provisions of the new Regulation to activities and services performed by state aircraft, such as customs, police, search and rescue, firefighting, coastguard or similar activities or services, as well as to ATM/ANS provided by the military. The opt-in is modular, meaning that for example a Member State may use it for one or more activities or services concerned. It is also up to the Member State concerned to decide in which domains of aviation regulation (airworthiness, aircrew, operations etc.) it wishes to use the opt-in. Where a Member State makes use of the opt-in for an activity, it will have to comply with the relevant provisions of the new Regulation and the acts adopted on the basis thereof. Member States will also be able to decide at any moment to stop the application of the provisions of the Regulation to state aircraft or ATM/ANS provided by the military, subject to providing an adequate transition period.\n\n\nIn addition, the list of aircraft excluded from the scope of the Regulation (Annex I aircraft) has been revised (for example small aircraft with electric engines have been added). It is also proposed that the Commission be authorised to adjust by means of a delegated act the weight limits and other technical criteria of aircraft listed in Annex I. Finally, it is proposed that manufacturers of aircraft listed in Annex I may request to have individual types of such aircraft regulated under the provisions of the Regulation. This opt-in has been designed specifically for aircraft that are built in serial production and that could benefit from free circulation in the single market and under common requirements.\n\n\nIn all cases, these opt-in and opt-out possibilities are subject to certain conditions, including a prior Commission decision, meant to ensure, in particular, the correct application of the new Regulation, respect for the objectives set out in its Article 1 and transparency and legal certainty for all parties concerned.\n\n\nArticle 3: A number of definitions are amended and new definitions added as required by the changes in the substantive provisions of the proposed Regulation. Definitions of 'complex motor powered aircraft' and of 'commercial operation' have been removed in line with the risk based approach. The specific criteria to which these definitions refer can be better laid down in the delegated acts. Transitional provisions have been added at the end of the proposed Regulation (Article 126) in order to ensure an orderly transition where a definition has been changed or removed.\n\n\nArticle 4: A new Article dealing with basic principles is added, as compared to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. It introduces in particular the principle of proportionality, reflecting also the position taken by the Council on the SESII+ initiative proposed earlier by the Commission, and criteria that should be taken into account in the conduct of risk assessments leading to the formulation and implementation of the measures taken under the new Regulation.\n\n\nChapter II 'Aviation Safety Management':\n\n\nArticles 5-8: A new chapter dealing with safety management is introduced, which requires the adoption of the European Aviation Safety Programme and the European Plan for Aviation Safety, and transposes ICAO Annex 19 standards and recommended practices related to State Safety Programmes. Article 6, dealing with the European Plan for Aviation Safety, introduces the concept of acceptable level of safety performance at Union level. The introduction of this concept does not result however in establishing any binding safety targets for the Union or its Member States.\n\n\nChapter III 'Substantive Requirements':\n\n\nArticles 9-18: The provisions of the Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 dealing with airworthiness have been revised taking into account existing experience and to reflect the new concept of non-installed equipment. The scope of the provisions dealing with airworthiness certification is also extended to environmental compatibility of aeronautical products. The environmental standards for products should continue to be based on ICAO Annex 16, but the Union would now be given the flexibility to adapt the ICAO standards to its specific needs, as already is the case for safety. Finally, for low risk operations, the possibility of assessing the airworthiness and environmental compatibility of the design of products and parts without the need to issue a certificate is being proposed. This possibility could be implemented especially for certain aircraft used in the general aviation sector. It is also expected that the manufacturers of aircraft listed in Annex I to the Regulation would make use of this flexibility when opting into the Union regulatory system under Article 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental compatibility of products, as set out in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, is now also dealt with in Articles 9-18 of the proposed Regulation (Airworthiness and environmental protection). New provisions on environmental protection have been also added under Article 75.\n\n\nArticles 19-25: Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 has been restructured into Articles 19 to 25. The scope of the articles is extended to include cabin crew and the relevant provisions on cabin crew from Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 are moved to this section. The text concerning the leisure pilot licence has been simplified and the text concerning the general medical practitioner has been moved to Chapter IV which deals with certification activities.\n\n\nArticles 26-28: Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 has been restructured into Articles 26-28. The certification requirement is now limited to commercial air transport operations. Other types of operations to be subject to a certification or declaration requirement are to be defined in the delegated acts based on a risk assessment.\n\n\nArticles 29-34: Article 8a of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 has been restructured into Articles 29-34. Ground handling services have been added to the scope of this section. It is also proposed that providers of apron management services are allowed to declare their compliance with the applicable requirements instead of being certified. \n\n\nArticles 35-39: Article 8b of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 has been restructured into Articles 35-39. The text is based on the compromise reached in the Council on the SES II+ initiative. In particular the provisions dealing with declarations by organisations involved in the design, manufacture and maintenance of ATM/ANS systems and constituents have been added. \n\n\nArticle 40-44: Article 8c of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 has been restructured into Articles 40-44. The substance of the provisions has not changed as compared to the Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. \n\n\nArticles 45-47: These Articles create the legal basis to provide for more detailed rules on unmanned aircraft, in view of the extended scope of the proposed Regulation. \n\n\nMore specifically:\n\n\nArticle 45 refers to the relevant Annex IX which contains the essential requirements concerning the design, production, operation and maintenance of unmanned aircraft that need to be complied with to ensure safe operations. \n\n\nArticle 46 describes the range of means to demonstrate that the essential requirements are complied with. As unmanned aircraft are able to perform operations that were not possible with manned aircraft, the range of risks associated with unmanned aircraft operations is very wide - ranging from the traditional high risk operations similar to \u2018manned aviation risks\u2019 to very low risk. In order to keep the rules and procedures proportionate to the risk of the operation, it is necessary to move towards an operation centric approach that assesses the exact risk of an operation or of a type of operations. \n\n\nFor mass produced unmanned aircraft which pose a low risk, it is proposed to use existing market surveillance mechanisms, as governed by Regulation 765/2008 and Decision 768/2008, which are specifically devised for the production and marketing of such type of products. However even in this case, aviation authorities remain indirectly involved, as the operational capability limitations that would be imposed (e.g. that the unmanned aircraft should not fly higher as, for instance, 50m to keep risks low) will have to stem directly from traditional aviation requirements. While the Agency would not be responsible for the oversight of the market surveillance mechanisms, the Commission is always entitled to verify if the Member States fulfil their responsibilities. Moreover, the market surveillance mechanism relies on justified complaints from citizens or undertakings to detect non-compliant products. Findings of non-compliance in one particular Member State are then communicated throughout the common market.\n\n\nArticles 48-50: Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 has been restructured into Articles 48-50. The authorisation requirement is now limited to third country operators engaged in commercial air transport. Other categories of third country operations to be subject to an authorisation or declaration requirement are to be defined in the delegated acts based on a risk assessment. It has also been clarified, in line with the current practice, that the requirement of an authorisation for a third country operator does not apply to overflights.\n\n\nChapter IV 'Joint Oversight and Enforcement System':\n\n\nArticle 51: All the provisions of the present Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 concerning the certification, oversight and enforcement tasks of the national competent authorities and of the Agency have been concentrated in this Article. Furthermore a clear legal basis is being proposed to empower the Commission to adopt, by means of delegated acts, requirements with respect to management systems of authorities, qualification of inspectors, conditions for conducting the inspections and other oversight activities, ramp inspections, and grounding of aircraft in case of non-compliances.\n\n\nArticles 52-54: A set of new provisions has been added as compared to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, concerning the cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States, the Commission and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency as regards certification, oversight and enforcement. A mechanism for pooling and sharing of aviation inspectors and other experts is introduced, along with a dedicated financing mechanism to assist Member States in cooperative oversight. Furthermore, the possibility to transfer responsibilities from Member States to the Agency (which today exists for production facilities and flight simulation training devices) is extended to all types of activities. Similarly a framework is introduced for transfers of responsibilities between Member States. Article 54 introduces possibility for organisations operating multi-nationally to opt for the Agency as their competent authority. Most of the measures proposed under these Articles are of voluntary nature.\n\n\nArticle 55: A new provision for mitigating possible systemic safety oversight deficiencies identified at Member State level is proposed. This emergency oversight mechanism is to be used as a measure of last resort of temporary nature and it is proposed that it can be activated/deactivated by a decision taken by the Commission based on clear criteria established in law.\n\n\nArticle 56: Declarations are added to the scope of this provision. \n\n\nArticle 57: The possibility of accepting foreign certificates and similar documentation on the basis of conditions specified in delegated acts is added to this Article. It is further proposed that the provisions of the current Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 dealing with national bilateral aviation safety agreements are deleted.\n\n\nArticle 58: The provisions on accreditation of qualified entities have been clarified. It is proposed that qualified entities may be granted a privilege to issue, revoke, and suspend certificates on behalf of the Agency or national competent authority. The principle of recognition of accreditations of qualified entities is introduced. This is without prejudice to the rights of Member States to decide to which qualified entity they wish to allocate certification and oversight tasks. It is also proposed that Member States may accredit a qualified entity jointly.\n\n\nArticles 59 and 60: Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 has been split into two separate articles. Article 59 deals with measures of urgent nature, while Article 60 deals with flexibility measures. In line with the risk-based approach, it is proposed that the Agency and the Commission assess only those measures which last longer than one airline scheduling season (eight months).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticles 61-63: These articles deal with information, including data, relevant for the implementation of the proposed new Regulation. The new elements concern the role of the Agency in coordinating the gathering, exchange and analysis of information at Union level. The provisions on protection of information and information sources are aligned with Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 on occurrence reporting. A legal basis is created for a new repository of information relevant for certification, oversight and enforcement activities, to be managed by the Agency. It is proposed that this repository is also used by the Member States for the purpose of exchanging information concerning medical fitness of pilots.\n\n\nChapter V 'The European Union Aviation Safety Agency':\n\n\nArticles 64-65: Three new functions of the Agency have been added in Article 64 (assistance to national competent authorities, support to the Commission in the implementation of aviation performance schemes, and cooperation with other Union bodies, such as the European Chemicals Agency or the European Defence Agency on technical matters related to civil aviation). Articles 18 and 19 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 on Agency measures have been merged into Article 65. \n\n\nArticles 66-67: These articles have been aligned with the changes made in Sections I and II of Chapter III of the proposed Regulation. The responsibility of the Agency to approve organisations not established in the Union has been limited to organisations located outside the territory for which a Member State is responsible under the Chicago Convention. This clarifies the issue of competent authority for approval of organisations located in Member State overseas countries and territories. Changes have also been made, based on experience gained, with respect to the responsibility of the Agency to approve flight simulation training devices.\n\n\nArticle 22 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008: Its provisions on flight time limitations have been added to Articles 28(1)(f) and 65(7), while its provisions on the measures to be taken by the Agency in case of urgency have been moved to Article 65(6).\n\n\nArticle 68: The changes are largely based on the compromise reached in the Council on the SES II+ initiative. In particular the concept of declarations of conformity is reflected in this Article. For the sake of clarity this article proposes a new structure, where paragraph 1 deals with organisations and paragraph 2 deals with systems and constituents. With respect to the systems and constituents, the competence of the Agency is conditional \u2013 the Agency will be responsible for certification of systems and constituents only if the delegated acts adopted by the Commission so provide.\n\n\nArticle 69: The responsibility of the Agency to approve organisations not established in the Union has been limited to organisations located outside the territory for which a Member State is responsible under the Chicago Convention. This clarifies the issue of competent authority for approval of organisations located in Member State overseas countries and territories.\n\n\nArticle 70: As compared to the corresponding provision of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, a new paragraph has been added concerning the assistance the Agency provides to the Commission in the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005.\n\n\nArticle 71: This provision corresponds to Article 55 of the Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. The language of this Article has been updated to reflect the latest approach of the Commission to investigations conducted by Union institutions and bodies in the territories of the Member States. In particular it has been further clarified that the investigative powers of the Agency must be exercised in compliance with the applicable provisions of national law of the Member State where the investigation takes place. \n\n\nArticle 72: The Article has been adapted based on experience from implementation so far. In particular, it has been clarified that fines are in principle to be imposed only if other enforcement measures would be inadequate or disproportionate.\n\n\nArticle 73: Article 24 and Article 54 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 have been merged into this article. The language of this Article has been updated to reflect the latest approach of the Commission to investigations conducted by EU institutions and bodies in the territories of the Member States. In particular it has been further clarified that the investigative powers of the Agency must be exercised in compliance with the applicable provisions of national law of the Member State where the investigation takes place. A provision has been also added obliging the Agency to include in its Annual Safety Review a summary of information about the application by each of the Member States of the provisions of the new regulation and of the detailed rules adopted on the basis thereof.\n\n\nArticle 74: The existing article has been expanded by mandating the Agency to assist the Commission in identifying key research themes related to the areas covered by the Regulation. The Agency is furthermore given a supporting role in the preparation and implementation of Union research programmes. In addition, the Article gives the Agency the possibility to participate in research projects in the area of its expertise on the basis of ad hoc grants under the Union Framework Programme for research and innovation or other funding programmes.\n\n\nArticle 75: A new article has been added dealing with environmental protection in civil aviation. While not extending the current scope of Union action, this article focuses on interdependencies which may exist between environmental measures (e.g. banning certain chemical substances) and other technical domains of aviation regulation. It also mandates the Agency to assist the Commission in the definition and coordination of aviation environmental protection policies, and it creates a legal basis for an aviation environmental review to be published by the Agency every three years.\n\n\nArticle 76: A new article has been added concerning technical aspects of aviation security directly linked with safety. The article first of all deals with interdependencies which may exist between aviation security measures (e.g. cockpit door locking systems) and aviation safety. The article also opens the possibility for the Commission to rely on the Agency's expertise when implementing Regulation (EC) No 300/2008. Finally, the article proposes to establish a process allowing the Agency to take measures which are within the scope of its competence, such as airworthiness directives or safety information bulletins, to protect civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference. It is proposed that such measures be taken by the Agency in agreement with the Commission and following consultation of the Member States. Prior to granting its agreement to the measure envisaged by the Agency, the Commission could seek the opinion of the aviation security committee established under Regulation (EC) No 300/2008.\n\n\nArticle 77: The new provisions in this article propose in paragraph 4 to establish a repository of information on differences between ICAO standards and recommended practices on the one hand, and the provisions of this proposed Regulation and the delegated and implementing acts to be adopted on the basis thereof on the other hand. A provision on the collaboration of the Commission, the Agency and the national competent authorities through a network of experts is proposed in paragraph 5. Finally paragraph 6 clarifies the possibility for the Agency to engage in technical cooperation with and assistance to third countries on the basis of ad hoc grants.\n\n\nArticles 78-80: These three new articles are proposed dealing with the role of the Agency in crisis management, provision of aviation training and the implementation of the Single European Sky.\n\n\nArticles: 81-103: The changes proposed as compared to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 reflect the experience to date and the standard clauses for Union Agencies introduced on the basis of the 2012 'Common Approach on decentralised agencies'. In particular, the creation of an Executive Board assisting the Management Board of the Agency is proposed. The establishment of local offices has been made dependent upon the approval of the Commission, the Management Board and the Member State concerned. The rules for the Board of Appeal have been clarified. \n\n\nArticles 104-105: The provisions on the Agency's working methods have been revised, taking into account the existing practice. \n\n\nArticles 106-108: The changes proposed as compared to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 reflect the experience to date and the standard clauses for Union Agencies introduced on the basis of the 2012 'Common Approach on decentralised agencies' as well as Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013 of 30 September 2013 on the framework financial regulation for the bodies referred to in Article 208 of Regulation (EU,\u00a0Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n8\n. In addition, the provisions on translation of documents by the Agency have been simplified (translation will be done taking into account the safety relevance of the document).\n\n\nArticle 109-114: The changes proposed as compared to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 reflect the experience to date and the standard clauses for Union Agencies introduced on the basis of the 2012 'Common Approach on decentralised agencies' as well as Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013. Furthermore, under Article 109(1), it is proposed to authorise the Agency to receive ad hoc grants by introducing grants as additional source of revenue of the Agency. Air navigation charges for authority tasks related to ATM/ANS are identified as a further source of revenue. Those two additional sources of funding as well as the possibility to adjust the staffing levels financed from fees and charges according to market demand were also elements suggested by the European Parliament in the context of the discussion of the Commission's SESII+ initiative. Article 109(5) sets out that the Agency has to have a staff planning and management of resources related to fees and charges that enable it to swiftly respond to fluctuation in revenue from fees and charges. This should be read in connection with Article 109(6) which sets out that the draft establishment plan with regard to the Agency's staff financed from budget related to fees and charges proposed by the Agency on the basis of workload and efficiency indicators, reflects the resources required to meet industry demand for certification and other services in an efficient and timely manner, thus contributing to the competitiveness of the European aviation sector. This approach should also apply to possible transfers of responsibilities from Member States to the Agency as proposed under Articles 53 to 55. Finally, resources required to meet market demand should also be taken into account in the preparation of the draft general budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 115: The article has been modified to more clearly describe which activities are to be financed from fees and charges. Furthermore, the article clarifies that fees and charges have to be adapted where significant positive or negative budget results become recurrent.\n\n\nChapter VI 'Final Provisions':\n\n\nArticles 116-117: These provisions concern the Commission's empowerments to adopt the delegated and implementing acts necessary under the new Regulation and they establish the conditions for the exercise of this delegation.\n\n\nArticle 118: The article has been modified to clarify participation of European third countries in the work of the Agency as well as the role of the Agency in establishing working arrangements with these countries.\n\n\nArticle 119: This is a new article stemming from the 2012 'Common Approach on decentralised agencies' which establishes the requirement for a Headquarters Agreement between the Agency and the host Member State.\n\n\nArticle 120: This article refers to penalties laid down by Member States for infringement of rules and corresponds to Article 68 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n\n\nArticle 121: This article sets out the applicable rules on the processing of personal data.\n\n\nArticle 122: This article repeals the current Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n\n\nArticle 123: This article introduces amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 which are necessary to enable the transfers of competences for Air Operator Certificates (AOC) between a Member State and the Agency, as well as between Member States. Furthermore, it is proposed to remove the requirement of prior approval for wet leasing arrangements which do not involve a third country operator. Finally, the amendment clarifies that an aircraft used by a Union air carrier can also be registered in a third country in case of a dry leasing. \n\n\nArticle 124: This article introduces amendments to the Union rules on accident investigation laid down in Regulation (EU) No 996/2010, to avoid that the competent bodies have to initiate a full accident investigation for accidents occurred between small unmanned aircraft, which would not have system wide implications.  \n\n\nArticle 125: This article amends the Union rules on occurrence reporting as laid down in Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 to avoid that occurrences with small unmanned aircraft having a negligible impact on the safety of the aviation system would create a bottle neck for the lines of occurrence reporting. \n\n\nArticle 126: This article provides for transitional arrangements with respect to the definitions which are being removed from or altered by the Regulation that is now proposed, but which are still reflected in the implementing regulations adopted on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n\n\n\nAnnex I: It is proposed to add to the scope of the Annex light electric aircraft (change of the propulsion system and addition of batteries increases the mass of the aircraft for an equivalent type of aircraft). It is also proposed to exclude from the scope of the new Regulation small, single occupancy hot air balloons and to adjust the weight limits for sail planes. Unmanned aircraft have been moved to Annex IX.\n\n\n\nAnnex II: The main change as compared to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 concerns clarification that cyber-security aspects are to be taken into account in the design of the aircraft (1.3.5). Furthermore, experience gained through the practical implementation of that Regulation is reflected and the concept of non-installed equipment is introduced (including essential requirements for non-installed equipment).\n\n\n\nAnnex III: A new Annex with essential requirements for environmental compatibility related to products was added, as provided in Article 9.\n\n\n\nAnnex IV: The main change concerns introduction of additional essential requirements for cabin crew. Furthermore, experience gained through the practical implementation of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 is reflected.\n\n\nAnnex V: The environmental compatibility aspects are included in Section 6. Essential requirements for cabin crew included in Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 have been deleted, as they are now comprehensively addressed in Annex IV of the new Regulation. Section 8, dealing with additional essential requirements for certain more complex categories of operations, has been aligned with the wording used in Article 27 of the new Regulation. Cyber-security aspects have been added in Section 8.4. Finally, experience gained through the practical implementation of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 is reflected.\n\n\nAnnex VI: Clarification has been added concerning conditions under which an organisation created with the aim of promoting aerial sport or leisure aviation can be accredited as a qualified entity. These conditions concern management and prevention of conflict of interest. \n\n\nAnnex VII: Essential requirements for ground handling services have been added (Section 4). Furthermore, experience gained through the practical implementation of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 has been reflected.\n\n\nAnnex VIII: Cyber-security aspects have been added in the essential requirements dealing with aeronautical information and data (Point 2.1.3) and system and constituent integrity (Point 3.3). Furthermore, the changes reflect the compromise reached in the Council on the SES II+ initiative proposed earlier by the Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex IX: This annex, referred to in Articles 45, 46 and 47, contains the essential requirements to cover unmanned aircraft with regard to airworthiness, operations and undertakings involved. The essential requirements also provide the basis for developing more detailed rules that would constitute the 'Community harmonisation legislation' within the meaning of Regulation (EC) 765/2008. \n\n\nAnnex X: The cross-reference table includes correlation between the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 and the provisions contained in the present proposal for a new Regulation.\n\n\n\n2015/0277 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\non common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n9\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n10\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)A high and uniform level of civil aviation safety and environmental protection should be ensured at all times through the adoption of common safety rules and by measures ensuring that any goods, persons and organisations involved in civil aviation activity in the Union comply with such rules and with those adopted to protect the environment.\n\n\n(2)In addition, third-country aircraft operated into, within or out of the territory where the relevant provisions of the Treaty on European Union ('TEU') and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU') apply (the 'Treaties'), should be subject to appropriate oversight at Union level within the limits set by the Convention on International Civil Aviation, signed in Chicago on 7 December 1944 (the 'Chicago Convention'), to which all Member States are parties.\n\n\n(3)It would not be appropriate to subject all aircraft to common rules. In particular, in light of their limited risk to civil aviation safety, aircraft that are of simple design or operate mainly on a local basis and those which are home-built or particularly rare or only exist in a small number should remain under the regulatory control of the Member States, without any obligation under this Regulation on other Member States to recognise such national arrangements. \n\n\n(4)However, the possibility should be provided to apply certain provisions under this Regulation to certain types of aircraft which are excluded from the provisions of this Regulation, especially those which are produced in an industrial manner and which could draw benefits from free circulation within the Union. Therefore, organisations involved in the design of such aircraft should be allowed to request the Commission to decide that Union requirements regarding design, manufacture and maintenance of aircraft apply to new types of aircraft which are to be put on the market by such organisations.\n\n\n(5)It would not be appropriate to subject all aerodromes to common rules. Aerodromes which are not open to public use and aerodromes mainly used for recreational flying or serving commercial air transport other than in accordance with instrument flight procedures and with paved runways of less than 800 metres should remain under the regulatory control of the Member States, without any obligation under this Regulation on other Member States to recognise such national arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n(6)Member States should be allowed to exempt from the provisions of this Regulation aerodromes with low volumes of traffic, subject to a prior authorisation by the Commission, provided that the aerodromes concerned nevertheless meet the minimum common safety objectives laid down in the relevant essential requirements. When a Member State grants such exemptions, those exemptions should also apply to the equipment used at the aerodrome concerned and to the providers of ground handling and apron management services operating at the exempted aerodromes. Exemptions granted by Member States to aerodromes before the entry into force of this Regulation should remain valid, while it should be ensured that information about these exemptions is made available to the public. \n\n\n(7)Member States may consider it preferable, notably with a view to achieving safety, interoperability or efficiency gains, to apply the provisions of this Regulation, instead of their national law, to state aircraft and air traffic management ('ATM') and air navigation services ('ANS') provided by the military. They should be allowed to do so. The Commission should be given the necessary implementing powers to decide on such requests. Member States making use of this possibility should cooperate with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (hereinafter 'the Agency'), in particular by providing all the information necessary for confirming that the aircraft and activities concerned comply with the relevant provisions of this Regulation.\n\n\n(8)The measures taken in accordance with this Regulation to regulate civil aviation in the Union, including the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof, should correspond to and be proportionate to the nature and risks associated with the different types of operations and activities they address. They should also, in as far as possible, be formulated in a manner which focuses on objectives to be achieved, while allowing different means of achieving those objectives. This should contribute to a more cost-efficient achievement of required safety levels and to stimulating technical and operational innovation. Use should be made of recognised industry standards and practices, where it has been found that they ensure compliance with the essential requirements set out in this Regulation.\n\n\n(9)Application of sound safety management principles is essential for continuous improvement of civil aviation safety in the Union, anticipating emerging safety risks, and making best use of limited technical resources. It is therefore necessary to establish a common framework for planning and implementing safety improvement actions. To that end a European Plan for Aviation Safety and a European Aviation Safety Programme should be drawn up at Union level. Each Member State should also draw up a National Aviation Safety Programme in accordance with the requirements contained in Annex 19 to the Chicago Convention. That programme should be accompanied by a plan describing the actions to be taken by the Member State to mitigate the identified safety risks.\n\n\n(10)In accordance with the provisions laid down in Annex 19 to the Chicago Convention, Member States are to establish an acceptable level of safety performance in relation to the aviation activities under their responsibility. In order to assist the Member States in meeting this requirement in a coordinated manner, the European Plan for Aviation Safety should lay down an acceptable level of safety performance for the Union in respect to the different categories of aviation activities. That acceptable level of safety performance should not have a binding character but express the ambition of the Union and of the Member States with regard to civil aviation safety.\n\n\n(11)The Chicago Convention provides for minimum standards to ensure the safety of civil aviation and environmental protection relating thereto. The Union's essential requirements and further rules for their implementation established in this Regulation should ensure that Member States fulfil, in a uniform manner, the obligations laid down in the Chicago Convention, including those vis-\u00e0-vis third countries. Where Union rules differ from the minimum standards established by the Chicago Convention, Member States should notify the International Civil Aviation Organization accordingly. \n\n\n(12)In line with standards and recommended practices set by the Chicago Convention, essential requirements applicable to aeronautical products, parts, non-installed equipment, aerodromes and the provision of ATM/ANS should be established. Furthermore, essential requirements applicable to persons and organisations involved in the operation of aircraft, the operation of aerodromes and in the provision of ATM/ANS, and essential requirements applicable to persons and products involved in the training and medical examination of aircrew and air traffic controllers should also be established.\n\n\n(13)The essential requirements concerning environmental compatibility of the design of aeronautical products should address both aircraft noise as well as emissions, and allow the Union to set detailed technical standards which are necessary to protect the environment and human health from harmful effects of aviation operations. Those requirements should be based on the standards and recommended practices set by the Chicago Convention.\n\n\n(14)The Union should also lay down essential requirements for the safe provision of ground handling services.\n\n\n(15)In view of  the increasing reliance of civil aviation on modern information and communication technologies essential requirements should be laid down to ensure the security of information used by the civil aviation sector. \n\n\n(16)Aeronautical products, parts and non-installed equipment, aerodromes and their equipment, operators of aircraft and aerodromes, ATM/ANS systems and providers, as well as pilots, air traffic controllers and persons, products and organisations involved in their training and medical examination, should be certified or licensed once they have been found to comply with relevant essential requirements or, where relevant, the other requirements established in or pursuant to this Regulation. The Commission should be empowered to adopt the necessary detailed rules for the issuance of those certificates and where relevant, the declarations to be made to this effect, taking into account the objectives of the Regulation and the nature and risk of the particular activity concerned.\n\n\n(17)The possibility should be given to the organisations involved in the design and manufacture of aeronautical products and parts to declare the compliance of the design of products and parts with the relevant industry standards, where this is considered to ensure an acceptable level of safety. This possibility should be limited to products used in light and sport aviation, and under appropriate limitations and conditions to ensure safety.\n\n\n(18)Since unmanned aircraft also operate within the airspace alongside with traditional aircraft, this Regulation should cover such aircraft, regardless of their operating mass. Technologies for unmanned aircraft now allow for a wide range of operations possible that should be subject to rules that are proportionate to the risk of the particular operation or type of operations.\n\n\n(19)The rules regarding unmanned aircraft should as much as possible contribute to achieving compliance with relevant rights guaranteed under Union law, in particular the right to respect for private and family life, as set out in Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and with the right to protection of personal data, as set out in Article\u00a08 of that Charter and in Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFUE') and as regulated in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\n11\n.\n\n\n(20)For some types of unmanned aircraft, the application of the provisions of this Regulation related to certification, oversight and enforcement, as well as the provisions regarding the Agency is not necessary for the purpose of reaching adequate levels of safety. Market surveillance mechanisms provided by Union product harmonisation legislation should be made applicable to those cases.\n\n\n(21)In order to achieve the objectives of this Regulation, the Commission, the Agency and the competent authorities of the Member States should, by sharing resources and working jointly, act as a single European aviation safety system.\n\n\n(22)The Agency and the national competent authorities should work in partnership in order to better detect unsafe conditions and take remedial measures as appropriate. Member States should in particular be able to transfer to each other or to the Agency the responsibilities under this Regulation related to certification, oversight and enforcement, especially where that is necessary for enhanced safety or more efficient use of resources. It is also necessary, according to the case, to support the Member States in performing those tasks, in particular cooperative and cross-border oversight, by establishing an efficient framework for pooling and sharing of aviation inspectors and other specialists with relevant expertise.\n\n\n(23)An emergency oversight mechanism, to be activated by the Commission when verified evidence points to a serious and persisting inability of a Member State in effectively ensuring certain or all of its certification, oversight and enforcement tasks under this Regulation, should be established. Accordingly, where such situation endangers safety and is not adequately resolved by the Member State concerned, the Agency should be able to temporarily exercise the responsibility for the tasks in question.\n\n\n(24)In order to achieve the main objectives of this Regulation, as well as objectives related to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, the certificates issued and declarations made in accordance with this Regulation and the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof, should be valid, without further requirements or evaluation, in all Member States.\n\n\n(25)When issuing certificates pursuant to this Regulation, account may need to be taken of certificates, or other relevant documentation attesting compliance, issued in accordance with the laws of third countries. That should be done where the relevant international agreements concluded by the Union with third countries or the delegated acts adopted by the Commission pursuant to this Regulation so provide, and in accordance with those agreements or delegated acts.\n\n\n\n\n(26)In light of the rules on the acceptance of certificates and other relevant documentation attesting compliance, issued in accordance with the laws of third countries, for which this Regulation provides, any international agreements concluded between a Member State and third countries should be terminated or adjusted where such agreements are not compatible with those rules.\n\n\n(27)A degree of flexibility should be provided for with respect to the application of the rules set out in this Regulation or adopted on the basis thereof, in order to allow Member States to take the necessary measures to react immediately to problems relating to civil aviation safety or to grant exemptions in the event of certain urgent unforeseeable circumstances or urgent operational needs, subject to appropriate conditions to ensure, in particular, proportionality, objective control and transparency. For reasons of proportionality, the Agency and the Commission should only assess the measures or exemptions in question with a view to issuing a recommendation or taking a decision, respectively, where their duration exceeds the duration of one airline scheduling season, that is, eight months,\u00a0without prejudice to the powers of the Commission under Article 258 of the TFEU. Where the Agency is the competent authority with respect to the issuing of certain certificates in accordance with this Regulation, it should also be empowered to grant such exemptions, in the same situations and subject to the same conditions as those that apply with respect to the Member States. In this connection provision should also be made for possible amendments, where appropriate, of the relevant rules as laid down in delegated or implementing acts adopted on the basis of this Regulation, in particular so as to allow other means of compliance while still ensuring an acceptable level of civil aviation safety in the Union.\n\n\n(28)With a view to ensuring the proper application of this Regulation and having regard to the need to identify, assess and mitigate the risks for civil aviation safety, the Commission, the Agency and the national competent authorities should exchange any information available to them in the context of the application of this Regulation. For this purpose, the Agency should be allowed to organise a structured cooperation on gathering, exchange and analysis of relevant safety-related information. To this end it should be allowed to enter into the necessary administrative arrangements.\n\n\n(29)In order to facilitate the exchange between the Member States, the Commission and the Agency of information, including data, which is relevant for certification, oversight and enforcement activities, an electronic repository of such information should be established and managed by the Agency in cooperation with the Member States and the Commission.\n\n\n(30)Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and the Council applies to the processing of personal data carried out in application of this Regulation. Pursuant to that Directive, Member States may provide for exemptions and restrictions in respect of some of the rights and obligations provided for therein, including as regards the processing of medical and health data. The processing of personal data, and in particular medical and health data, in the context of the repository pursuant to Article 63 of this Regulation is necessary to enable effective cooperation between the Member States in certification and oversight of medical fitness of pilots. Exchange of personal data should be subject to strict conditions, and limited to what is absolutely necessary for achieving the objectives of this Regulation. In view of the above, the principles set out in Directive 95/46/EC should be supplemented or clarified in this Regulation, where necessary.\n\n\n(31)Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n12\n  and in particular the provisions thereof concerning confidentiality and security of processing, apply to the processing of personal data by the Agency when carrying out its responsibilities in application of this Regulation and more specifically in the management of the repository pursuant to Article 63 of this Regulation. In view of the above, the principles set out in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 should be supplemented or clarified in this Regulation, where necessary.\n\n\n(32)The Agency has been established by Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council\n13\n within the Union's existing institutional structure and balance of powers, is independent in relation to technical matters and has legal, administrative and financial autonomy. The Agency has received further competences in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. Certain adjustments should be made in its structure and functioning in order to better accommodate the new tasks conferred on it by this Regulation.\n\n\n(33)Under the institutional system of the Union, implementation of Union law is primarily the responsibility of the Member States. Certification, oversight and enforcement tasks required by this Regulation, and by the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof, should therefore in principle\u00a0be carried out at national level by one or more competent authorities of the Member States. In certain clearly defined cases, however, the Agency should also be empowered to conduct those tasks as specified in this Regulation. In those cases the Agency should also be allowed to take the necessary measures related to the operation of aircraft, the qualification of aircrew or the use of third-country aircraft, where this is the best means to ensure uniformity and facilitate the functioning of the internal market.\n\n\n(34)The Agency should provide the technical expertise to the Commission in the preparation of the necessary legislation and assist, where appropriate, the Member States and industry in its implementation. It should be able to issue certification specifications and guidance material and to make technical findings and issue certificates or register declarations as required.\n\n\n(35)Global navigation satellite systems, and in particular the Union Galileo programme, will play a pivotal role in the implementation of a European air traffic management system. In this regard, the Agency should be empowered to develop the necessary technical specifications and to certify organisations providing pan-European ATM/ANS to ensure a high, uniform level of safety, interoperability and operational efficiency. \n\n\n(36)Regulation (EC) No\u00a02111/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n14\n imposes a duty on the Agency to communicate all information that could be relevant for the updating of the list of air carriers which, for safety reasons, are subject to an operating ban in the Union. The Agency should also assist the Commission in the implementation of Regulation (EC) No\u00a02111/2005, by conducting the necessary evaluations of third country operators and authorities responsible for their oversight, and making appropriate recommendations to the Commission.\n\n\n(37)In order to ensure compliance with this Regulation, it should be possible to impose fines or periodic penalty payments, or both, on holders of certificates issued by the Agency and on undertakings that made declarations to the Agency, where they infringed the rules applicable to them pursuant to this Regulation. Such fines and periodic penalty payments should be imposed by the Commission acting upon a recommendation of the Agency. In this regard, the Commission should, in light of the circumstances of each individual case, respond to such infringements in a proportionate and adequate manner, taking account of other possible measures such as the withdrawal of a certificate.\n\n\n(38)With a view to contributing to the uniform application of this Regulation, the Agency should be empowered to monitor such application by Member States, including by conducting inspections.\n\n\n(39)On the basis of its technical expertise, the Agency should assist the Commission in the definition of research policy and to the implementation of Union research programmes. It should be allowed to conduct research which is immediately needed and to participate in ad hoc research projects under the Union Framework Programme for Research and Innovation or other Union and non-Union private or public funding programmes.\n\n\n(40)Having regard to the existing interdependencies between safety and security in civil aviation, the Agency should take part in the cooperation concerning the area of aviation security, including cyber-security. It should contribute its expertise to the implementation, by the Commission and by Member States, of Union rules in that area.\n\n\n(41)The Agency should, on request, assist the Member States and Commission in the field of international relations relating to matters covered by this Regulation, in particular as regards the harmonisation of rules and the mutual recognition of certificates. It should be entitled to establish the appropriate relations, through working arrangements, with the authorities of third countries and international organisations competent in matters covered by this Regulation, subject to the Commission's prior approval. In order to promote safety at the worldwide level, in light of the high standards applied within the Union, the Agency should be allowed to engage, within its field of competence, in ad hoc technical cooperation, research and assistance projects with third countries and international organisations. The Agency should also assist the Commission in the implementation of Union legislation in other technical domains of civil aviation regulation, such as security or the Single European Sky, where the Agency has the relevant expertise.\n\n\n(42)In order to promote best practices and a uniform implementation of Union aviation safety legislation, the Agency may provide training.\n\n\n(43)The Agency should be governed and operated in line with the principles of the Joint Statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission on decentralised agencies of 19 July 2012.\n\n\n(44)The Member States and the Commission should be represented within the Management Board of the Agency in order to effectively control its functions. That Management Board should be entrusted with the necessary powers notably to appoint the Executive Director, and to adopt the consolidated annual activity report, the programming document, the annual budget, and the financial rules applicable to the Agency.\n\n\n(45)In the interests of transparency, interested parties should be given observer status within the Management Board of the Agency.\n\n\n\n\n(46)In order for the Management Board to properly fulfil its tasks, is should be assisted by an Executive Board, which should notably prepare decisions of the Management Board and advise the Executive Director of the Agency on the implementation of those decisions.\n\n\n(47)Public interest requires the Agency to base its safety-related action solely on independent expertise, strictly applying this Regulation and the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof. To that end, safety-related decisions of the Agency should be made by its Executive Director, who should enjoy a high degree of flexibility to obtain advice and to organise the internal functioning of the Agency.\n\n\n(48)It is necessary to ensure that parties affected by decisions made by the Agency enjoy the necessary remedies in a manner which is suited to the special character of the field of aviation. Therefore, an appropriate appeal mechanism should be set up so that decisions of the Agency can be subject to appeal to a specialised Board of Appeal, the decisions of which can be subject to action before the Court of Justice of the European Union (the 'Court of Justice') in accordance with the TFEU.\n\n\n(49)All decisions taken by the Commission under this Regulation are subject to review by the Court of Justice in accordance with the TFEU. The Court of Justice should, in accordance with Article 261 of the TFEU, be given unlimited jurisdiction in respect of decisions by which the Commission imposes fines or periodic penalty payments. \n\n\n(50)When the Agency develops draft rules of a general nature to be implemented by national authorities, Member States should be consulted. Furthermore, where rules could have important social implications, stakeholders, including Union social partners, should be appropriately consulted when the Agency prepares corresponding draft rules.\n\n\n(51)With a view to effectively carrying out its tasks under this Regulation, the Agency should cooperate, as necessary, with other Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in areas where their activities affect technical aspects of civil aviation. In particular, the Agency should collaborate with the European Chemicals Agency in the exchange of information on the safety of chemical substances, their impact on aviation safety and related scientific and technical aspects. When consultation relating to military aspects is required, the Agency should involve the European Defence Agency.  \n\n\n(52)It is necessary to provide the public with adequate information pertaining to the level of civil aviation safety and environmental protection relating thereto, taking into account Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council and relevant national legislation. \n\n\n(53)In order to guarantee the full autonomy and independence of the Agency, it should be granted an autonomous budget principally funded from a contribution from the Union and from fees and charges paid by the users of the European aviation safety system. Any financial contribution received by the Agency from Member States, third countries, or other entities or persons should not compromise its independence and impartiality. The Union budgetary procedure should be applicable as far as the Union contribution and any other subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the European Union are concerned, while the auditing of accounts should be carried out by the Court of Auditors. In order to enable the Agency to participate in all relevant future projects, it should be provided with the possibility to receive grants. The revenue of the Agency should include charges paid in accordance with Regulation (EU) No XXXX/XXXX on the implementation of the Single European Sky, so as to reflect the 'user pays' principle.\n\n\n(54)In order to ensure that the Agency can respond to demand for the activities it carries out, in particular as regards certification and activities related to possible transfers of responsibility from Member States, in an efficient and timely manner, while respecting sound financial management, the establishment plan should take into account the resources required to meet demands for certification and for other activities of the Agency in an efficient and timely manner, including those resulting from transfers of responsibility in accordance with Articles 53, 54 and 55. To this end, a set of indicators should be established to measure the Agency's workload and efficiency in relation to activities financed through fees and charges. Having regard to those indicators the Agency should adapt its staff planning and management of resources related to fees and charges so as to be able to adequately respond to such demand and to any fluctuations in revenue from fees and charges. \n\n\n(55)It is necessary to establish appropriate measures to ensure the necessary protection of sensitive safety-related information. \n\n\n(56)The fees and charges levied by the Agency should be set in a transparent, fair, non-discriminatory and uniform manner. They should not jeopardize the competitiveness of the Union's industry concerned. Furthermore, they should be established on a basis which takes due account of the ability of the legal or natural persons concerned to pay, in particular regarding small and medium-sized enterprises. \n\n\n(57)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n15\n.\n\n\n(58)The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to exemptions from the provisions of this Regulation, the emergency oversight mechanism, corrective action and safeguard measures, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n\n\n(59)In order to take into account technical, scientific, operational or safety needs, by amending or supplementing the provisions on airworthiness, environmental protection, air crew, air operations, aerodromes, ATM/ANS, air traffic controllers, third-country operators, unmanned aircraft, oversight and enforcement, flexibility provisions, fines and periodic penalty payments, and fees and charges, as well as requirements set out in annexes to this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n\n\n(60)The involvement of European third countries should be pursued to ensure the improvement of civil aviation safety throughout Europe. Those countries that have concluded international agreements with the Union to adopt and apply the Union acquis in the field covered by this Regulation should be associated with the work of the Agency in accordance with conditions set in the framework of those agreements.\n\n\n(61)This Regulation sets common rules in the field of civil aviation and maintains the establishment of the Agency. Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n16\n should therefore be repealed.\n\n\n(62)The changes brought about by this Regulation have an impact on the implementation of other Union legislation. Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n17\n, Regulation (EU) No 996/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n18\n, and Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n19\n, should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n\n(63)Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 should be amended to take due account of the possibility established by this Regulation that the Agency may become the competent authority for the issuance and oversight of air operator certificates. Moreover, given the growing importance of air carriers with operational bases in several Member States which results in the competent authority for the operating licences and the competent authority for air operator certificates no longer being necessarily identical, there is a need to reinforce the efficient supervision of those air carriers. Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 should therefore be amended to ensure close cooperation between the authorities responsible for the oversight in respect of the air operator certificate and the operating licence respectively.\n\n\n(64)Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely establishing and maintaining a high uniform level of civil aviation safety, while ensuring a high uniform level of environmental protection, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the largely transnational nature of aviation and its complexity, but can rather, by reason of the Union-wide scope of this Regulation, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nPrinciples\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nSubject matter and objectives\n\n\n1.The principal objective of this Regulation is to establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in the Union, while ensuring a high uniform level of environmental protection.\n\n\n2.This Regulation further aims at:\n\n\n(a)contributing to the wider Union aviation policy and to the improvement of the overall performance of the civil aviation sector;\n\n\n(b)facilitating, in the fields covered by this Regulation, the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, providing a level playing field for all actors in the internal aviation market, and improving  the competitiveness of the Union's aviation industry;\n\n\n(c)promoting cost-efficiency and effectiveness in the regulatory and certification processes as well as an optimal use of resources at national and Union level;\n\n\n(d)contributing, in the fields covered by this Regulation, to establishing and maintaining a high uniform level of civil aviation security;\n\n\n(e)assisting Member States in fulfilling their obligations under the Chicago Convention, by ensuring a common interpretation and uniform implementation of its provisions;\n\n\n(f)promoting, worldwide, the  views of the Union regarding civil aviation standards and civil aviation rules by establishing appropriate cooperation with third countries and international organisations;\n\n\n(g)promoting research and innovation, amongst others in regulatory and certification processes;\n\n\n(h)promoting, in the fields covered by this Regulation, technical and operational interoperability.\n\n\n3.The objectives set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be achieved by, inter alia: \n\n\n(a)the preparation, adoption and uniform application of all necessary acts;\n\n\n(b)ensuring that the declarations and certificates issued in accordance with this Regulation and its delegated and implementing acts are valid throughout the Union, without any additional requirements;\n\n\n(c)the development, with the involvement of standardisation and other industry bodies, of detailed technical standards to be used as means of compliance with this Regulation and the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof, where appropriate;\n\n\n(d)the establishment of an independent European Union Aviation Safety Agency (the 'Agency');\n\n\n(e)the uniform implementation of all necessary acts by the national competent authorities and the Agency within their respective areas of responsibility;\n\n\n\n\n(f)the gathering, analysis and exchange of information to inform evidence-based decision making;\n\n\n(g)the undertaking of awareness and promotion initiatives, including training, communication and dissemination of relevant safety information.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nScope\n\n\n1.This Regulation shall apply to:\n\n\n(a)the design and production of aircraft by a natural or legal person under the oversight of the Agency or a Member State;\n\n\n(b)the design, production, maintenance and operation of aircraft, as well as associated products, parts and non-installed equipment, where the aircraft is:\n\n\n(i)registered in a Member State, unless and to the extent that the Member State has transferred its responsibilities pursuant to the Chicago Convention to a third country and the aircraft is operated by a third country operator;\n\n\n(ii)registered in a third country and operated by an operator established, residing or with a principal place of business in the territory to which the Treaties apply;\n\n\n(c)the operation of aircraft into, within, or out of the Single European Sky airspace by a third country operator;\n\n\n(d)the design, production, maintenance and operation of aerodrome equipment used or intended for use at the aerodromes referred to in point (e) and the provision of ground handling services and apron management services at those aerodromes;\n\n\n(e)the design, maintenance and operation of aerodromes located in the territory to which the Treaties apply, which are:\n\n\n(i)open to public use;\n\n\n(ii)serve commercial air transport;\n\n\n(iii)serve operations using instrument approach or departure procedures; and\n\n\n(iv)have a paved runway of 800 metres or more, or exclusively serve helicopters; \n\n\n(f)without prejudice to Union and national legislation on environment and land-use planning, the safeguarding of surroundings of the aerodromes referred to in point (e);\n\n\n(g)the provision of air traffic management and air navigation services ('ATM/ANS') in the Single European Sky airspace, and the design, production, maintenance and operation of systems and constituents used in the provision of those ATM/ANS;\n\n\n(h)the design, production, maintenance and operation of unmanned aircraft, their engines, propellers, parts and non-installed equipment, as well as the equipment to control unmanned aircraft remotely, where such aircraft are operated within the Single European Sky airspace by an operator established or residing within the territory to which the Treaties apply.\n\n\n2.This Regulation shall also apply to the personnel and organisations involved in the activities referred to in paragraph 1.\n\n\n\n\n3.This Regulation shall not apply to:\n\n\n(a)state aircraft, and their products, parts and non-installed equipment, and the personnel and organisations involved in the activities and services performed by state aircraft;\n\n\n(b)aerodromes or parts thereof, as well as equipment, personnel and organisations, that are controlled and operated by the military;\n\n\n(c)ATM/ANS, including systems and constituents, personnel and organisations, that are provided or made available by the military;\n\n\n(d)the design, production, maintenance and operation of aircraft the operation of which involves low risk for aviation safety, as listed in Annex I, and to the personnel and organisations involved therein.\n\n\nAs regards point (a), Member States shall ensure that activities and services performed by the state aircraft referred to in that point are carried out having due regard to the objectives of this Regulation. Member States shall also ensure that, where appropriate, state aircraft are separated from other aircraft.\n\n\nAs regards point (d), the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 117 in order to adjust, where this is necessary to in light of technical or operational developments, in particular the introduction of new manufacturing techniques or new technologies, and in as far as this is justified in light of the low risk for aviation safety involved in the operation of the aircraft concerned, the following criteria set out in Annex I:\n\n\n (i)the dates referred to in point (a)(i) of that Annex;\n\n\n(ii)the weight, speed, and hot air volume limits referred to in points (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j) of that Annex. \n\n\n4.An organisation responsible for the design of an aircraft type may request the Commission to decide that the provisions of Section I of Chapter III apply to the design, production and maintenance of that aircraft type and to the personnel and organisations involved in those activities, where:\n\n\n(a)the aircraft type concerned falls within the scope of points (e), (f), (g), (h)  (i), or (j) of Annex I;\n\n\n(b)that aircraft type is intended for serial production; and \n\n\n(c)the design of that aircraft type has not been approved in accordance with the national laws of a Member State.\n\n\nThe Commission shall decide on the basis of that request, after having consulted the Agency and the Member State where the organisation concerned has its principal place of business, whether the criteria of the first subparagraph have been fulfilled. That decision shall be adopted by means of an implementing act which shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article\u00a0116(2) and shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The Agency shall also include that decision in the repository referred to in Article\u00a063. \n\n\nFrom the date specified in that implementing decision, the design, production and maintenance of the aircraft type concerned and the personnel and organisations involved in those activities shall be solely regulated by the provisions of Section I of Chapter III and of the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis of those provisions. In that case, the provisions of Chapter IV and Chapter V relating to the application of the provisions of Section I of Chapter III shall also apply with respect to the aircraft type concerned.\n\n\n5.Without prejudice to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No XXX/XXXX on the implementation of the Single European Sky (recast), Member States shall ensure that the military facilities referred to in paragraph 3(b) of this Article that are open to general air traffic and the ATM/ANS referred to in paragraph 3(c) of this Article that are provided or made available by the military to general air traffic offer a level of safety that is equivalent to that resulting from the application of the essential requirements set out in Annexes VII and VIII of this Regulation.\n\n\n6.Member States may decide to apply the provisions of any of the Sections\u00a0I,\u00a0II, III, V, VI or VII of Chapter III to some or all activities referred to in paragraph 3(a) and 3(c) of this Article and to the personnel and organisations involved in those activities. \n\n\nIn that case, the Member State concerned shall notify the Commission and the Agency of its intention. That notification shall contain all relevant information, and in particular:\n\n\n(a)the Section or Sections which it intends to apply;\n\n\n(b)the activities, personnel and organisations concerned;\n\n\n\n\n(c)the reasons for the intended decision; and\n\n\n(d)the date as of which the intended decision shall be applicable.\n\n\nThe Commission shall decide, after having consulted the Agency, whether, in light of the characteristics of the activities, personnel and organisations in question and the purpose and content of the provisions of the Section or Sections notified to it, the provisions in question can be effectively applied and, where appropriate, under what conditions. The Commission decision, taken by means of an implementing act, shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article\u00a0116(2) and shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.  The Agency shall include that decision in the repository referred to in Article\u00a063.\n\n\nThe Member State concerned shall apply the provisions of the Section or Sections notified to the Commission only after a positive Commission decision and, where relevant, after having ensured that the conditions attached to that decision have been fulfilled. In that case, from the date specified in the Member State's decision, the activities, personnel and organisations concerned shall solely be regulated by those provisions and by the provisions of the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof. In that case, the provisions of Chapter IV and Chapter V relating to the application of the provisions of the Section or the Sections notified with respect to the activities, personnel and organisations concerned shall also apply.\n\n\nThe Commission, the Agency and the competent authorities of the Member State concerned shall cooperate for the purpose of the application of this paragraph.\n\n\nMember States may decide to revoke their decisions adopted pursuant to this paragraph. In that case the Member State concerned shall notify the Commission and the Agency. That notification shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, and the Agency shall include it in the repository referred to in Article\u00a063. An appropriate transition period shall be provided for by the Member State concerned.\n\n\n7.Member States may decide to exempt from the provisions of this Regulation the design, maintenance and operation of an aerodrome, and the equipment used at that aerodrome, where that aerodrome handles no more than 10 000 passengers per year and no more than 850 movements related to cargo operations per year, and provided that such exemption does not endanger compliance with the essential requirements referred to in Article 29. \n\n\nIn such a case, the Member State concerned shall notify, through a reasoned submission, the Commission and the Agency of its intention to take such a decision. That submission shall contain all relevant information relating to the intended decision.\n\n\nThe Commission shall decide, after having consulted the Agency, whether the conditions of the first subparagraph have been fulfilled. The Commission decision, taken by means of an implementing act, shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 116(2) and shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The Agency shall include that decision in the repository referred to in Article\u00a063.\n\n\nThe Member State concerned shall only adopt the intended decision after a positive Commission decision. In that case, from the date specified in the Member State's decision, the design, maintenance and operation of the aerodrome concerned, and its equipment, shall no longer be regulated by the provisions of this Regulation and of the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof.\n\n\nMember States shall, on an annual basis, examine the traffic figures of the aerodromes that they have exempted pursuant to this paragraph. Where that examination demonstrates that, over three consecutive years, one of those aerodromes handles more than 10 000 passengers per year and more than 850 movements related to cargo operations per year, the Member State concerned shall revoke the exemption of that aerodrome. In that case, it shall inform the Commission and the Agency accordingly.

These conditions shall take into account the certificates issued by the state of registry or the state of the operator, and be without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005 and its implementing rules;\n\n\n(e)the privileges and responsibilities of the holders of the authorisations referred to in Article 49(1) and (2), and, where relevant, operators that made declarations in accordance with Article 49(2);\n\n\n(f)the conditions under which the operation of the aircraft referred to in Article 2(1)(c), shall be prohibited, limited or subject to certain conditions in the interest of safety.\n\n\n2.When adopting the rules referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission shall ensure, in particular, that:\n\n\n(a)use is made, as appropriate, of ICAO recommended practices and guidance documents;\n\n\n(b)no requirement exceeds what is required under this Regulation from aircraft referred to in Article\u00a02(1)(b)(i) and from the aircrew and operators of such aircraft;\n\n\n(c)the process through which the authorisations referred to in Article 49(1) and (2) are obtained is simple, proportionate, effective and cost-efficient and allows for demonstrations of compliance which are proportionate to the complexity of the operation and the risk involved in that operation. The Commission shall in particular ensure that account is taken of:\n\n\n(i)the results of the ICAO Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme;\n\n\n\n\n(ii)information collected under ramp inspection programmes established in accordance with the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 51(10); \n\n\n(iii)other recognised information on safety aspects with regard to the operator concerned;\n\n\n(iv)certificates issued in accordance with the laws of a third country. \n\n\n(d)aspects related to ATM/ANS are taken into account. \n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nJOINT CERTIFICATION, OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\nArticle 51\n\n\nCertification, oversight and enforcement\n\n\n1.The Member States, the Commission and the Agency shall cooperate within a single European aviation safety system to ensure compliance with this Regulation and the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof.\n\n\n2.To ensure compliance with the provisions of this Regulation and of the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof, the Agency and the national competent authorities shall in accordance with this Regulation:\n\n\n(a)receive and assess the applications made to them, issue, and, where applicable, renew the certificates and receive declarations made to them, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter III;\n\n\n(b)perform oversight of holders of certificates, of legal and natural persons that made declarations, and of products, parts, equipment, ATM/ANS systems, ATM/ANS constituents, flight simulation training devices and aerodromes subject to the provisions of Chapter III;\n\n\n(c)conduct the necessary investigations, inspections, audits and other monitoring activities to identify possible infringements by the persons referred to in point (b) of the requirements set out in this Regulation and in the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof that are applicable to them;\n\n\n(d)take all necessary enforcement measures, including amending, suspending or revoking certificates issued by them, grounding of aircraft and imposing penalties, in order to terminate identified infringements.\n\n\n3.The responsibilities for the tasks related to certification, oversight and enforcement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions.\n\n\nThe Agency shall be responsible where those tasks have been attributed to it pursuant to Articles 53, 54, 55, 66, 67, 68, 69 and 70.\n\n\nThe national competent authority of the Member State where the aerodrome is located shall be responsible for those tasks with respect to the aerodrome certificate referred to in Article 30(1) and the certificate for an organisation responsible for the operation of an aerodrome referred to in Article 32(1). The certificate for an organisation responsible for the operation of an aerodrome may be either combined with the certificate for an aerodrome or issued separately.\n\n\nIn all other cases, the national competent authority of the Member State where the natural person applying for the certificate or making the declaration resides, or, in case of legal persons, where the person has its primary establishment, shall be responsible for those tasks, unless the delegated acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 10 provide otherwise.\n\n\nHowever, where the delegated acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 14 so provide:\n\n\n(a)aero-medical examiners, aero-medical centres and general medical practitioners shall be responsible for issuing the pilot medical certificates referred to in Article 20(3) and the air traffic controller medicals certificates referred to in Article 41(1);\n\n\n\n\n(b)pilot and cabin crew training organisations that have been issued an approval in accordance with Article 22 and operators that have been issued a certificate in accordance with Article 27 shall be responsible for issuing the cabin crew attestations referred to in Article 21.\n\n\n4.The oversight conducted by the Agency and national competent authorities shall be continuous and based on priorities set in the light of the risks to civil aviation. \n\n\n5.The Agency shall manage and operate the tools and procedures necessary for the collection, exchange and analysis of safety-related information obtained from ramp inspection programmes established by the delegates acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 10.\n\n\n6.In order to facilitate the exercise of their tasks related to certification, oversight and enforcement, the Commission, the Agency and national competent authorities, shall exchange information, including on possible or\u00a0identified infringements.\n\n\n7.The Agency shall promote a common understanding and application of the requirements contained in this Regulation and in the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof, inter alia by developing the guidance material referred to in Article\u00a065(3) in consultation with the national competent authorities. \n\n\n8.Any legal or natural person subject to this Regulation may bring to the attention of the Agency any alleged differences in the application of the rules between the Member States. Where such differences seriously hamper the operation of those persons, or otherwise lead to substantial difficulties, the Agency and the national competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall cooperate to eliminate those differences without undue delay. Where those differences cannot be eliminated, the Agency shall present the matter to the Commission.\n\n\n9.The Agency and the national competent authorities shall undertake the necessary actions to increase and promote awareness of civil aviation safety and disseminate safety-related information relevant for the prevention of accidents and incidents.\n\n\n10.With regard to the tasks of the Agency and the national competent authorities related to certification, oversight and enforcement under this Regulation, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article\u00a0117 in order to lay down detailed rules concerning:\n\n\n(a)the conditions for the gathering, exchange and dissemination of information between the Agency and the national competent authorities for the performance of their tasks;\n\n\n(b)the conditions for conducting certification and for conducting the investigations, inspections, audits and other monitoring activities necessary to ensure effective oversight of the legal and natural persons, products, parts, equipment, ATM/ANS systems, ATM/ANS constituents, flight simulation training devices and aerodromes  subject to this Regulation;\n\n\n(c)the conditions for the qualifications of inspectors and of the organisations involved in their training;\n\n\n(d)the conditions for conducting ramp inspections and for the grounding of aircraft when the aircraft, its operator or its aircrew do not comply with the requirements of this Regulation or the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof; \n\n\n(e)the conditions for the administration and management systems of the Agency and of the national competent authorities relating to the exercise of the certification, oversight and enforcement tasks;\n\n\n(f)in respect of paragraph 3, the conditions for allocation of responsibilities between the national competent authorities, with a view to ensuring the effective performance of the tasks related to certification, oversight and enforcement;\n\n\n(g)in respect of paragraph 3, the conditions for allocation of responsibilities to aero-medical examiners and aero-medical centres for the purpose of issuing pilot medical certificates and air traffic controller medical certificates, as well as the conditions under which general medical practitioners shall be given such responsibilities, with a view to ensuring effective performance of the tasks related to medical certification of pilots and air traffic controllers;\n\n\n(h)in respect of paragraph 3, the conditions for allocation of responsibilities to pilot and cabin crew training organisations for the purpose of issuing cabin crew attestations, with a view to ensuring effective performance of the tasks related to certification of cabin crew.\n\n\nArticle 52\n\n\nEuropean aviation inspectors\n\n\n1.The Agency shall establish, in cooperation with the national competent authorities, a mechanism for the pooling and sharing of inspectors and other personnel with expertise relevant for the exercise of the certification and oversight tasks under this Regulation. To that end, the Agency shall define and communicate to the national competent authorities the required qualification and experience profiles on the basis of which those authorities shall designate, subject to availability, candidates for participation in the pooling and sharing mechanism in the role of European aviation inspectors. \n\n\n2.The Agency and each national competent authority may request assistance from the European aviation inspectors in the performance of oversight and certification activities. The Agency shall coordinate those requests and develop appropriate procedures for that purpose, in consultation with the national competent authorities.\n\n\n\n\n3.The European aviation inspectors shall perform their oversight and certification activities under the control, instructions and responsibility of the Agency or the national competent authority that requested their assistance.\n\n\n4.The costs of the assistance provided by the European aviation inspectors designated by national competent authorities shall be covered by fees. To that end, the Agency shall invoice, on behalf of the national competent authority\u00a0that incurred the costs, the legal or natural person which was subject to the certification and oversight activities performed by those inspectors. The Agency shall transfer the amount collected from that person to the national competent authority concerned.\n\n\n5.As regards the mechanism for the pooling and sharing referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article\u00a0117 in order to lay down detailed rules with regard to:\n\n\n(a)the rights and obligations of the Agency and the national competent authorities that request, receive or provide assistance through that mechanism;\n\n\n(b)the authorisations of and the rules applicable to the European aviation inspectors when they are providing such assistance;\n\n\n(c)the fixing and collection of the fees referred to in paragraph 4.\n\n\nArticle 53\n\n\nTransfer of responsibility \n\n\n1.Member States may transfer to the Agency the responsibility for the certification, oversight and enforcement with respect to any or all organisations, operators, personnel, aircraft, flight simulation training devices or aerodromes for which the Member State concerned is responsible under this Regulation. \n\n\nUpon such transfer, the Agency shall become the competent authority for the purposes of the transferred responsibility and the Member State concerned shall be relieved of that responsibility. In relation to the exercise of that responsibility by the Agency, the provisions of Chapters IV and V shall apply.\n\n\n2.Member States may, subject to mutual consent, transfer to another Member State the responsibility for the certification, oversight and enforcement with respect to any or all organisations, operators, personnel, aircraft, flight simulation training devices or aerodromes for which they are responsible under this Regulation. \n\n\nUpon such transfer, the national competent authority of the Member State to which the responsibility is transferred shall become the competent authority for the purposes of the transferred responsibility and the Member State transferring the responsibility shall be relieved of that responsibility. \n\n\nIn relation to the exercise of that responsibility, the provisions of Chapters II and IV and Articles 120 and 121, as well as the applicable provisions of the national law of the Member State to which the responsibility is transferred shall apply.\n\n\n3.The Agency or a Member State, as applicable, shall only agree to the transfer of responsibilities referred to in paragraphs 1 or 2 when it is satisfied that it can effectively exercise the transferred responsibility in compliance with this Regulation and the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof. \n\n\n4.When a Member State intends to transfer certain responsibilities in accordance with paragraphs 1 or 2, it shall establish jointly with the Agency or with the other Member State, as applicable, a transition plan that ensures an orderly transfer of those responsibilities. The legal and natural persons concerned by the transfer and, in case of a transfer referred to in paragraph 2, the Agency shall be consulted on that transition plan before it is finalised.\n\n\nThe Agency and the Member State or Member States concerned, as applicable, shall ensure that the transfer of the responsibilities is carried out in accordance with the transition plan.\n\n\n5.The Agency shall make available, through the repository established under Article\u00a063, a list of Member States that have transferred certain responsibilities in accordance with this Article. That list shall include details about the responsibilities transferred, allowing for the clear identification of the responsibilities after the transfer and of the affected organisations, operators, personnel, aircraft, flight simulation training devices or aerodromes, as applicable. \n\n\nThe Agency shall take account of the transferred responsibilities when conducting inspections and other monitoring activities in accordance with Article\u00a073.\n\n\n6.This Article shall be without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Member States under the Chicago Convention. When a Member State transfers responsibilities in accordance with this Article which are attributed to it by the Chicago Convention, it shall notify the ICAO about the fact that the Agency or another Member State acts as its authorised representative for the fulfilment of its obligations under the Chicago Convention.\n\n\nArticle 54\n\n\n\n\nOrganisations operating multi-nationally\n\n\n1.An organisation may\u00a0request the Agency to act as the competent authority responsible for the certification, oversight and enforcement with respect to that organisation, in deviation from Article 51(3), where that organisation holds or is eligible to apply for a certificate in accordance with the provisions of Chapter III to the national competent authority from one Member State, but it has or it intends to have substantial facilities and personnel covered by that certificate located in one or more other Member States.\n\n\nSuch a request may also be made by two or more organisations, each of which has a principal place of business in a different Member State and each of which holds or is eligible to apply for a certificate in accordance with the provisions of Chapter III for the same type of aviation activity.\n\n\nWhere the organisations referred to in the first and second subparagraph make such a request, they shall inform the national competent authorities of the Member States in which they have their principal places of business. \n\n\n2.Where the Agency considers that it can effectively exercise the responsibilities for the certification, oversight and enforcement, as requested, in compliance with this Regulation and the delegated acts adopted on the basis thereof, it shall establish, jointly with the Member State or Member States concerned, as applicable, a transition plan that ensures an orderly transfer of those responsibilities. The organisations that requested the transfer shall be consulted on this transition plan before it is finalised.\n\n\nThe Agency and the Member State or Member States concerned, as applicable, shall ensure that the transfer of the responsibilities is carried out in accordance with the transition plan.\n\n\n3.Upon the transfer of responsibility pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2, the Agency shall become the competent authority for the purposes of the transferred responsibility and the Member State or Member States concerned shall be relieved of that responsibility. In relation to the exercise of that responsibility by the Agency, the provisions of Chapters IV and V shall apply. \n\n\n4.The provisions of Article 53(5) and (6) shall apply accordingly to any transfer of responsibility pursuant to this Article. \n\n\nArticle 55\n\n\nEmergency oversight mechanism\n\n\n1.The Agency shall recommend to a Member State the transfer of responsibilities in accordance with Article 53, where all of the following conditions have been met:\n\n\n(a)the results of inspections and other monitoring activities conducted by the Agency in accordance with Article\u00a073 indicate a serious and persisting inability of a Member State to effectively perform certain or all of its certification, oversight and enforcement tasks under this Regulation, \n\n\n(b)the Commission has requested the Member State concerned to remedy the deficiencies identified in accordance with point (a),\n\n\n(c)the Member State has not remedied the deficiencies in a satisfactory manner and the resulting situation endangers civil aviation safety.\n\n\n2.Where the Member State concerned did not either give effect to the Agency's recommendation or remedy the deficiencies within 3 months from the date of that recommendation, the Commission may decide, when it considers that the conditions of paragraph 1 are met, that the responsibility for the certification, oversight and enforcement tasks concerned shall be temporarily transferred to the Agency. That decision shall be taken by means of implementing acts which shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article\u00a0116(2). On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to aviation safety, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article\u00a0116(4).\n\n\n3.From the date at which the implementing decision referred to in paragraph 2 takes effect, the Agency shall assess on a regular basis whether the condition of paragraph 1(c) continues to be met. Where it considers that that condition is no longer met, it shall issue a recommendation to the Commission to terminate the temporary transfer of responsibilities. \n\n\n4.When the Commission considers, taking into account that recommendation, that the condition of paragraph 1(c) is no longer met, the Commission shall decide that the temporary transfer of responsibilities to the Agency shall be terminated. \n\n\nThat decision shall be taken by means of implementing acts which shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article\u00a0116(2). On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to aviation safety, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article\u00a0116(4).\n\n\n5.Upon the transfer of responsibility pursuant to paragraph 2, the Agency shall become the competent authority for the purposes of the transferred responsibility and the Member State concerned shall be relieved of that responsibility. In relation to the exercise of that responsibility by the Agency, the provisions of Chapters IV and V shall apply. \n\n\n6.The provisions of Article 53(5) and (6) shall apply accordingly to any transfer of responsibility pursuant to this Article. The Agency shall also include in the repository established under Article\u00a063 the Commission implementing decisions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 56\n\n\nValidity of certificates and declarations\n\n\n1.Certificates issued and declarations made in accordance with this Regulation and the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof shall be valid in all Member States, without further requirements or evaluation.\n\n\n2.In case the Commission considers that a legal or a natural person to which a certificate has been issued or which has made a declaration no longer complies with the applicable requirements of this Regulation or of the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof, the Commission shall, based on a recommendation from the Agency, require the Member State responsible for the oversight of that person to take appropriate corrective action and safeguard measures, including limitation or suspension of the certificate. \n\n\nThat decision shall be taken by means of implementing acts which shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article\u00a0116(2). On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to aviation safety, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article\u00a0116(4). \n\n\nFrom the date at which that implementing decision takes effect, the certificate or declaration concerned shall, in deviation from paragraph 1, no longer be valid in all Member States.\n\n\n3.When the Commission considers that the Member State referred to in paragraph 2 has taken appropriate corrective action and safeguard measures, it shall decide, based on a recommendation from the Agency, that the certificate or declaration concerned shall again be valid in all Member States, in accordance with paragraph 1. That decision shall be taken by means of implementing acts adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article\u00a0116(2). On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to aviation safety, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article\u00a0116(4).\n\n\n4.This Article shall be without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005.\n\n\nArticle 57\n\n\nAcceptance of third-country certification\n\n\nThe Agency and the national competent authorities may either issue the certificates provided for in this Regulation and the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof on the basis of certificates issued in accordance with the laws of a third country, or accept certificates and other relevant documentation attesting compliance with civil aviation rules which were issued in accordance with the laws of a third country, where such possibility is provided for in:\n\n\n(a)international agreements concerning the recognition of certificates concluded between the Union and a third country; or\n\n\n(b)the delegated acts adopted on the basis of Articles 18(1)(l), 25(1)(f) and 44(1)(e).\n\n\nArticle 58\n\n\nQualified entities\n\n\n1.The Agency and the national competent authorities may allocate their tasks related to certification and oversight under this Regulation to qualified entities that have been accredited as being compliant with the criteria set out in Annex VI. The Agency and the national competent authorities which make use of the qualified entities shall establish a system for that accreditation and for the assessment of the compliance of qualified entities with those criteria, both at the moment of accreditation and continuously thereafter.\n\n\nA qualified entity shall be accredited either individually by the Agency or by a national competent authority, or jointly by two or more national competent authorities or by the Agency and one or more national competent authorities. \n\n\n2.The Agency or the national competent authority or authorities, as applicable, shall revoke or suspend the accreditation of a qualified entity that they granted, when that entity no longer complies with the criteria set out in Annex VI. \n\n\n3.The Agency or the competent national authority or authorities accrediting a qualified entity may grant it a privilege to issue, amend, suspend and revoke certificates, or to receive declarations, on behalf of the Agency or the national competent authority. That privilege shall be included in the scope of the accreditation.\n\n\n4.The Agency and the national competent authorities shall recognise, without further technical requirements or evaluation, accreditations of qualified entities granted by the Agency and by other national competent authorities in accordance with paragraph 1.   \n\n\n\n\nHowever, the Agency and the national competent authorities shall not be obliged to use the full scope of the accreditation granted by another national competent authority or the Agency, nor to recognise privileges granted to a qualified entity by another competent authority in accordance with paragraph 3.\n\n\n5.The Agency and the national competent authorities shall exchange information about the accreditations granted, suspended and revoked. The Agency shall make that information available through the repository referred to in Article\u00a063.\n\n\nArticle 59\n\n\nSafeguard provisions\n\n\n1.This Regulation and the delegated acts and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof shall not prevent a Member State from reacting immediately to a problem relating to civil aviation safety, where all of the following conditions have been met:\n\n\n(a)the problem involves a serious risk to aviation safety and immediate action by that Member State is required to address it;\n\n\n(b)it is not possible for the Member State to adequately address the problem in compliance with the provisions of this Regulation and the delegated acts and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof;\n\n\n(c)the action taken is proportionate to the severity of the problem.\n\n\nIn such a case, the Member State concerned shall immediately notify the Commission, the Agency and the other Member States, through the repository established under Article\u00a063, of the measures taken and the reasons for taking them.\n\n\n2.Where the duration of the measures referred to in paragraph 1 exceeds eight consecutive months or where a Member State has taken the same measures repetitively and their total duration exceeds eight months, the Agency shall assess whether the conditions of paragraph 1 have been met and issue, within three months from the date of the reception of the notification referred to in paragraph 1, a recommendation to the Commission as regards the outcome of that assessment. The Agency shall include that recommendation in the repository established under Article 63.\n\n\nIn that case, the Commission shall assess, taking account of that recommendation, whether those conditions have been met. Where the Commission considers that those conditions have not been met or where it departs from the outcome of the assessment by the Agency, it shall adopt, within three months from the date of the reception of that recommendation, an implementing decision to that effect, which shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and\u00a0entered into the repository established under Article 63.\n\n\nThe Member State concerned shall immediately terminate the measures taken pursuant to paragraph 1 upon the notification of that implementing decision.\n\n\n3.Upon the reception of the notification referred to in paragraph 1, the Agency shall, without undue delay, also assess whether the problem identified by the Member State can be addressed by the Agency by taking the decisions referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 65(4), so that the measures taken by the Member State are no longer needed. Where the Agency considers that the problem can be addressed in that manner, it shall take the appropriate decision to that effect.

This was manifested already by the initial adoption of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 and its predecessor Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002. The safety of the European civil aviation system depends inter alia on how well the elements of this system interlink. Any interface in this system constitutes a risk that requires coordination. Common legislation does away with the need to coordinate between Member States regulatory systems and as such contributes to an increase in safety. Promoting a common European safety system can most effectively be achieved only at EU level. Similarly, efficiency gains will stem from a single European civil aviation safety system countering costly fragmentation. \n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThe initiative is based inter alia on a thorough analysis of the experience gained from the application of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 and its predecessor Regulation (EC) 1592/2002 including the 2013 evaluation of the functioning of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 conducted under Article 62 of that Regulation. \n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nThis initiative constitutes a deliverable under the Aviation package due to be adopted at the end of 2015 and will contribute to the competitiveness of the EU aviation sector.\n\n\nThe initiative is in line with the Transport White Paper of 2011 aiming at Europe becoming the safest region for aviation.\n\n\nThe initiative is furthermore in line with the Europe 2020 strategy and the Commission priorities by developing the internal market and fostering innovation thus positively impacting jobs and growth, and global competitiveness of the aviation sector.\n\n\nAs regards governance issues of EASA, the initiative is consistent with and implements recommendations of the Joint Statement of the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council on decentralised agencies.\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n35\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u2327 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nAmple mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation already exist and can be used, due to the fact that in the field of civil aviation safety the monitoring of performance is an integral element of the Union regulatory framework. The effectiveness of the proposed measure, once adopted, will be subject to a mandatory evaluation every five years, as is the case under the current Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. \n\n\nThe annual reporting requirements of the Agency include the preparation of the consolidated annual activity report and the preparation of the final accounts. \n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified \n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nAs a Union agency EASA applies the applicable control methods of decentralised agencies which have already been laid down in Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. \n\n\nThe EASA Financial Regulation which is based on the Framework Financial Regulation for Agencies sets out the appointment of an internal auditor and internal audit requirements. \n\n\n\n2.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \n\n\n\nn. a. \n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 111 of the proposed regulation regards combating fraud.

Compliance with all requirements must be shown by assessment or analysis, supported, where necessary, by tests.\n\n\n1.1.Structures and materials: \n\n\n1.1.1.The integrity of the structure must be ensured throughout, and sufficiently beyond, the operational envelope for the aircraft, including its propulsion system, and maintained for the operational life of the aircraft.\n\n\n1.1.2.All parts of the aircraft, the failure of which could reduce the structural integrity, must comply with the following conditions without detrimental deformation or failure. This includes all items of significant mass and their means of restraint.\n\n\n(a)All combinations of load reasonably expected to occur within and sufficiently beyond, the weights, centre of gravity range, operational envelope and life of the aircraft must be considered. This includes loads due to gusts, manoeuvres, pressurisation, movable surfaces, control and propulsion systems both in flight and on the ground.\n\n\n\n\n(b)Consideration must be given to the loads and likely failures induced by emergency landings either on land or water.\n\n\n(c)As appropriate to the type of operation, dynamic effects must be covered in the structural response to these loads, taking into account the size and configuration of the aircraft.\n\n\n1.1.3.The aircraft must be free from any aeroelastic instability and excessive vibration.\n\n\n1.1.4.The manufacturing processes and materials used in the construction of the aircraft must result in known and reproducible structural properties. Any changes in material performance related to the operational environment must be accounted for.\n\n\n1.1.5.It must be ensured, to the extent practicable, that the effects of cyclic loading, environmental degradation, accidental and discrete source damage do not reduce the structural integrity below an acceptable residual strength level. All necessary instructions for ensuring continued airworthiness in this regard must be promulgated.\n\n\n1.2.Propulsion: \n\n\n1.2.1.The integrity of the propulsion system (i.e. engine and, where appropriate, propeller) must be demonstrated throughout and sufficiently beyond, the operational envelope of the propulsion system and must be maintained for the operational life of the propulsion system, taking into account the role of the propulsion system in the overall safety concept of the aircraft.\n\n\n1.2.2.The propulsion system must produce, within its stated limits, the thrust or power demanded of it at all required flight conditions, taking into account environmental effects and conditions.\n\n\n1.2.3.The manufacturing process and materials used in the construction of the propulsion system must result in known and reproducible structural behaviour. Any changes in material performance related to the operational environment must be accounted for.\n\n\n1.2.4.The effects of cyclic loading, environmental and operational degradation and likely subsequent part failures must not reduce the integrity of the propulsion system below acceptable levels. All necessary instructions for ensuring continued airworthiness in this regard must be promulgated.\n\n\n1.2.5.All necessary instructions, information and requirements for the safe and correct interface between the propulsion system and the aircraft must be promulgated.\n\n\n1.3.Systems and equipment (other than non-installed equipment):\n\n\n1.3.1.The aircraft must not have design features or details that experience has shown to be hazardous.\n\n\n1.3.2.The aircraft, including those systems, and equipment required for the assessment of the type design, or by operating rules, must function as intended under any foreseeable operating conditions, throughout and sufficiently beyond, the operational envelope of the aircraft, taking due account of the system or equipment operating environment. Other systems or equipment not required for type-certification, or by operating rules, whether functioning properly or improperly, must not reduce safety and must not adversely affect the proper functioning of any other system or equipment. Systems and equipment must be operable without needing exceptional skill or strength.\n\n\n1.3.3.The aircraft systems and equipment, considered separately and in relation to each other, must be designed such that any catastrophic failure condition does not result from a single failure not shown to be extremely improbable and an inverse relationship must exist between the probability of a failure condition and the severity of its effect on the aircraft and its occupants. With respect to the single failure criterion above, it is accepted that due allowance must be made for the size and broad configuration of the aircraft and that this may prevent this single failure criterion from being met for some parts and some systems on helicopters and small aeroplanes.\n\n\n1.3.4.Information needed for the safe conduct of the flight and information concerning unsafe conditions must be provided to the crew or maintenance personnel, as appropriate, in a clear, consistent and unambiguous manner. Systems, equipment and controls, including signs and announcements must be designed and located to minimise errors which could contribute to the creation of hazards.\n\n\n1.3.5.Design precautions must be taken to minimise the hazards to the aircraft and occupants from reasonably probable threats, including information security threats, both inside and external to the aircraft, including protecting against the possibility of a significant failure in, or disruption of, any non-installed equipment.\n\n\n1.4.Non-installed equipment:\n\n\n1.4.1.Non-installed equipment must perform its safety function or function relevant for safety as intended under any foreseeable operating conditions unless that function can also be performed by other means.\n\n\n1.4.2.Non-installed equipment must be operable without needing exceptional skill or strength.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3.Non-installed equipment must be designed to minimise errors which could contribute to the creation of hazards.\n\n\n1.4.4.Non-installed equipment, whether functioning properly or improperly, must not reduce safety and must not adversely affect the proper functioning of any other equipment, system or appliance.\n\n\n1.5.Continuing airworthiness:\n\n\n1.5.1.All necessary documents including instructions for continuing airworthiness must be established and made available to ensure that the airworthiness standard related to the aircraft type and any associated part is maintained throughout the operational life of the aircraft.\n\n\n1.5.2.Means must be provided to allow inspection, adjustment, lubrication, removal or replacement of parts and non-installed equipment as necessary for continuing airworthiness.\n\n\n1.5.3.The instructions for continuing airworthiness must be in the form of a manual, or manuals, as appropriate for the quantity of data to be provided. The manuals must cover maintenance and repair instructions, servicing information, trouble-shooting and inspection procedures, in a format that provides for a practical arrangement.\n\n\n1.5.4.The instructions for continuing airworthiness must contain airworthiness limitations that set forth each mandatory replacement time, inspection interval and related inspection procedure.\n\n\n2.Airworthiness aspects of product operation\n\n\n2.1.The following must be shown to have been addressed to ensure a satisfactory level of safety for those on board or on the ground during the operation of the product:\n\n\n(a)The kinds of operation for which the aircraft is approved must be established and limitations and information necessary for safe operation, including environmental limitations and performance, must be established.\n\n\n(b)The aircraft must be safely controllable and manoeuvrable under all anticipated operating conditions including following the failure of one or, if appropriate, more propulsion systems, taking into account the size and configuration of the aircraft. Due account must be taken of pilot strength, flight deck environment, pilot workload and other human-factor considerations and of the phase of flight and its duration.\n\n\n(c)It must be possible to make a smooth transition from one flight phase to another without requiring exceptional piloting skill, alertness, strength or workload under any probable operating condition.\n\n\n(d)The aircraft must have such stability as to ensure that the demands made on the pilot are not excessive taking into account the phase of flight and its duration.\n\n\n(e)Procedures for normal operations, failure and emergency conditions must be established.\n\n\n(f)Warnings or other deterrents intended to prevent exceedance of the normal flight envelope, must be provided, as appropriate to the aircraft type.\n\n\n(g)The characteristics of the aircraft and its systems must allow a safe return from extremes of the flight envelope that may be encountered.\n\n\n2.2.The operating limitations and other information necessary for safe operation must be made available to the crew members.\n\n\n2.3.Product operations must be protected from hazards resulting from adverse external and internal conditions, including environmental conditions.\n\n\n(a)In particular, and as appropriate to the type of operation, no unsafe condition must occur from exposure to phenomena such as, but not limited to, adverse weather, lightning, bird strike, high frequency radiated fields, ozone, etc., reasonably expected to occur during product operation, taking into account the size and configuration of the aircraft.\n\n\n(b)Cabin compartments, as appropriate to the type of operations, must provide passengers with suitable transport conditions and adequate protection from any expected hazard arising in flight operations or resulting in emergency situations, including fire, smoke, toxic gases and rapid decompression hazards, taking into account the size and configuration of the aircraft. Provisions must be made to give occupants every reasonable chance of avoiding serious injury and quickly evacuating the aircraft and to protect them from the effect of the deceleration forces in the event of an emergency landing on land or water. Clear and unambiguous signs or announcements must be provided, as necessary, to instruct occupants in appropriate safe behaviour and the location and correct use of safety equipment. Required safety equipment must be readily accessible.\n\n\n\n\n(c)Crew compartments, as appropriate to the type of operations, must be arranged in order to facilitate flight operations, including means providing situational awareness, and management of any expected situation and emergencies. The environment of crew compartments must not jeopardise the crew's ability to perform their tasks and its design must be such as to avoid interference during operation and misuse of the controls.\n\n\n3.Organisations (including natural persons undertaking design, manufacture or maintenance)\n\n\n3.1.As appropriate to the type of activity, organisation approvals must be issued when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n(a)the organisation must have all the means necessary for the scope of work.
