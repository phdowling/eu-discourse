"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nStrasbourg, 15.12.2015\nCOM(2015) 671 final\n2015/0310(COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\non the European Border and Coast Guard and repealing Regulation (EC) No\u00a02007/2004, Regulation (EC) No 863/2007 and Council Decision 2005/267/EC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nThe present proposal has the objective of setting up a European Border and Coast Guard in order to ensure a European integrated border management of the EU\u2019s external borders, with a view to managing migration effectively and ensuring a high level of security within the Union, while safeguarding the free movement of persons therein. It is part of a package of measures presented by the Commission in order to better ensure the protection of the EU\u2019s external borders as set out in the accompanying Commission Communication.\n\n\nIn 2015, the European Union witnessed extraordinary pressures at its external borders with an estimated 1,5 million persons having crossed the borders illegally between January and November this year. The sheer scale of the mixed migratory flows which have crossed the external borders of the European Union and the consequent secondary movements, demonstrated that existing structures at Union and Member State level are inadequate to address the challenges arising from such a large influx. In an area without internal borders, irregular migration through the external borders of one Member State affects all other Member States within the Schengen area. The significant secondary movements have led several Member States to reintroduce border control at their internal borders. This has put considerable strain on the functioning and coherence of the Schengen area.\n\n\nThroughout the current migration crisis, it became clear that the Schengen area without internal borders is only sustainable if the external borders are effectively secured and protected. The control of the Union\u2019s external borders is a common and shared interest which must be carried out in accordance with high and uniform Union standards.\n\n\nThe intensified security concerns following the terrorist attacks of this year have added to citizens\u2019 concerns. Whilst borders can never provide complete security, they can make a significant contribution in terms of increasing security and intelligence and thwarting future attacks. This function has become even more important in the light of the increasing phenomenon of foreign fighters involved in terrorist attacks. Reinforcing security at the external borders is therefore essential to restoring public confidence.\n\n\nA single travel area without internal borders is only sustainable if the external borders are effectively protected. A chain is always only as strong as its weakest link. A decisive step towards an integrated management system for external borders therefore is needed. This is only possible as a shared task among all Member States, in line with the principles of solidarity and responsibility to which all the EU\u2019s institutions have agreed as the guiding principles addressing the migration crisis.\n\n\nThe European Agenda on Migration identified the need to move to a shared management of the external borders, in line with the objective of the \u2018gradual introduction of an integrated management system for external borders\u2019 set out in Article 77 TFEU. In his State of the Union speech in September, President Juncker announced that the Commission would present ambitious steps in this respect before the end of the year in the form of a fully operational European Border and Coast Guard, as was subsequently confirmed in the Commission Work Programme 2016\n1\n.\n\n\nThe draft Regulation lays down the general principles of European integrated border management; it establishes a European Border and Coast Guard and a European Border and Coast Guard Agency built from Frontex. The objective of this draft Regulation is to provide for a more integrated management of the EU\u2019s external borders, inter alia by providing the European Border and Coast Guard Agency with more competences in the fields of external border management and return than Frontex currently has. This draft Regulation affords the European Border and Coast Guard Agency the additional competences needed for it to effectively implement integrated border management at Union level, to address deficiencies of border management at national level, and to respond to unprecedented migratory flows such as those which have arrived at the external borders of the European Union this year. \n\n\nGranting these additional competences to the European level of the European Border and Coast Guard is essential to prevent that deficiencies of external border management or unpredicted migratory flows undermine the proper functioning of the Schengen area. The challenges which have arisen from the migratory crisis cannot be adequately dealt with by Member States acting in an uncoordinated manner. Integrated border management is a shared responsibility of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the national authorities responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks, and together they constitute the European Border and Coast Guard.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThis draft Regulation responds to the calls of the European Parliament and the European Council to effectively manage the external borders of the European Union. Clear orientations were set out by the European Council in October 2015\n2\n to strengthen the external borders of the European Union namely by working towards the establishment of an integrated management system for the external borders and by enhancing the mandate of Frontex in the context of discussions over the development of a European Border and Coast Guard System, including as regards the deployment of Rapid Border Intervention Teams in cases where Schengen evaluations or risk analysis demonstrate the need for robust and prompt action, in cooperation with the Member State concerned. The European Council also considered that the mandate of Frontex on return should be expanded to include the right to organise joint return operations on its own initiative, and enhance its role regarding the acquisition of travel documents for returnees. \n\n\nIn the European Agenda on Migration, the Commission proposed to make the management of the external borders into shared responsibility of the Member States and the European Union. On this basis, the European Agenda on Migration proposed changes to the legal basis of Frontex so as to strengthen its role and capacity. Among the other suggested steps to be taken by the Commission was the foundation of a European Border and Coast Guard, an increased role for the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in the organisation and coordination of returns, inter-agency cooperation, better management of Agency and Member State assets and the initiation of the new \u2018hotspot\u2019 approach.\n\n\nWith this draft Regulation, the Commission contributes to rendering border management more effective and reliable by bringing it to a new level of responsibility and solidarity. Over the past few years, the European Union established a policy to enable Member States to build and maintain sound external borders. However, in the absence of strategic implementation of integrated border management at Union level, there are discrepancies in implementation that still remain at national level among Member States. Hence, there is a need, as identified by the Commission in the European Agenda on Migration, to have Union standards for border management to cover all aspects of the Union\u2019s external border management.\n\n\nThis proposal builds on the existing border management policy, including the Frontex Agency but brings it to a qualitatively different level. Frontex was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 which was subsequently amended by Regulation (EC) 863/2007,\n3\n which introduced the rapid border interventions, and by Regulation (EU) No 1168/2011,\n4\n which highlighted the responsibility of Frontex as regards the protection of fundamental rights. This proposal substantially expands upon the ability of the Agency to respond effectively to present or future threats at the external borders by proactively reinforcing, assessing, and coordinating the actions of Member States in the implementation of appropriate measures at the external borders.\n\n\nThe proposal complements existing legislation by following a similar approach as the one on the European Border Surveillance System (Eurosur)\n5\n in further fostering a spirit of cooperation, information exchange and the coordination of efforts between the Member States and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, as well as among national authorities and Union Agencies, with concrete and binding commitments. It also builds upon Regulation (EU) No 656/2014\n6\n establishing rules for the surveillance of the external sea borders in the context of operational cooperation coordinated by Frontex. The proposal also develops and reinforces the rapid border interventions.\n\n\nThe proposal, and in particular the establishment of a vulnerability assessment, complements the Schengen evaluation mechanism established by Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013.\n7\n The Schengen evaluation mechanism is intended to maintain mutual trust among Member States. It consists of a technical and legal assessment intended to verify the correct application of the Schengen acquis and the necessary conditions for the lifting of internal border control. In cases where it results from a Schengen evaluation that there are serious deficiencies at the external border, the Commission may recommend initiating the deployment of European Border and Coast Guard Teams or presenting strategic plans to the Agency for its opinion. The present proposal is also without prejudice to the measures which may be adopted under Article 19a and 26 of the Schengen Borders Code.\n\n\nThe vulnerability assessment focuses on prevention so as to avoid reaching a crisis situation. It is an assessment of the operational capabilities of Member States at the external borders and for this purpose it looks into the technical equipment, capacities, resources and contingency plans. That assessment is carried out by the Agency, the Supervisory Board advises the Executive Director, who in turn decides on the necessary measures. Where a Member State would fail to comply with the decision of the Executive Director and as a result it would risk putting in jeopardy the functioning of the Schengen area, the Commission can adopt an implementing decision requiring the direct intervention by the Agency on the ground.\n\n\n\n\nThis proposal builds upon and further develops those existing policy provisions and brings them together in the European Border and Coast Guard, thus establishing an integrated management system for external borders at Union level as provided for in Article 77(2)(d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThis proposal is closely linked and complements other Union policies, namely:\n\n\n(a)The Common European Asylum System with the setting up of migration management support teams at hotspot areas which is closely linked to the relocation of persons in clear need of international protection;\n\n\n(b)Internal security as was underlined in the European Agenda on Security, common high standards of border management are essential to prevent cross-border crime and terrorism; this proposal further contributes to achieving a high level of internal security by enabling the Agency to cover aspects of cross-border crime and terrorism in its risk analysis, by enabling it to process personal data of persons suspected to be involved in acts of terrorism and by providing that the Agency cooperates with other Union Agencies and international organisations on the prevention of terrorism. As regards access to national databases and European databases, the draft Regulation provides for an obligation for Member States to allow access to members of the European Border and Coast Guard Teams to such databases. The Commission will explore the possibility of giving the Agency access to European databases, such as SIS and EURODAC, and will consider presenting proposals to modify the legal acts on which these databases are based;\n\n\n(c)The Union Customs Risk Management and Supply Chain Security Strategy, which provides for promoting inter-agency cooperation and information sharing among customs, law enforcement and security agencies to ensure complementarity of roles, the development of common risk criteria and sharing of risk information;\n\n\n(d)Maritime security and safety, as well as maritime surveillance with the establishment of European cooperation on coast guard functions among the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency;\n\n\n(e)External relations policy of the Union given that the European Border and Coast Guard Agency should facilitate and encourage operational cooperation between Member States and third countries, including by coordinating such operational cooperation in the field of management of external borders and by deploying liaison officers to third countries, as well as by cooperating with the authorities of third countries on return, including as regards the acquisition of travel documents.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThis legislative proposal is based on Article 77(2)(b) and (d) and Article 79(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n\n\nArticle 77(1)(b) and (d) provides that the Union shall develop a policy with a view to carrying out checks on persons and efficient monitoring of the crossing of external borders, and the gradual introduction of an integrated management system for external borders. For those purposes, under Article 77(2)(b) and (d), the European Parliament and the Council acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, shall adopt measures concerning the checks to which persons crossing external borders are subject, and any measure necessary for the gradual establishment of an integrated management system for external borders.\n\n\nArticle 79(2)(c) authorises the European Parliament and the Council to adopt measures in the area of irregular immigration and unauthorised residence, including removal and repatriation of persons residing without authorisation.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity \n\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to ensure a European integrated border management of the EU\u2019s external borders, with a view to managing migration effectively and ensuring a high level of security within the Union, while safeguarding the free movement of persons therein. In an area without internal borders, irregular migration through the external borders of one Member State affects all other Member States within the Schengen area. An area without internal borders is only sustainable if the external borders are effectively secured and protected. \n\n\nSince the control of the Union\u2019s external borders is a common and shared interest which must be carried out in accordance with high and uniform Union standards, the objectives of this proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Members States, and can be better accomplished at the level of the Union, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe draft Regulation is intended to respond to the new challenges and political realities faced by the Union, both as regards migration management and internal security. It puts in place a tool box of measures to deal with border management comprehensively. It ensures that rules on integrated border management are fully and correctly implemented by Member States, that appropriate action is taken to prevent crisis situations and to intervene at an early stage at the external borders, and it is only if the situation still becomes critical, that urgent action is taken at Union level for direct intervention on the ground. In view of its objectives and in accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nOnly a regulation can provide for the necessary degree of uniformity required for ensuring the integrated management of the external borders. Moreover, having regard to the fact that the Frontex Agency, renamed European Border and Coast Guard Agency, was established by means of a Regulation, the same legal instrument is also appropriate for this proposal. \n\n\n\n\n3.CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES\n\n\nIn preparation of this proposal, the Commission has relied upon the discussions that have been regularly taking place in the European Council and in the Council of Ministers, as well as in the European Parliament on border management and the measures needed to address the migratory crisis. The future of border management and, in particular, the reinforcement of the Frontex Agency has recently been the subject of discussion in the Council of Ministers meeting of 8 October 2015.\n8\n This was followed by a meeting of the European Council on 15 October 2015,\n9\n which in its orientations on the future of border management, called for the strengthening of the external borders of the European Union by, amongst others, working towards the establishment of an integrated management system for external borders and by enhancing the mandate of Frontex.\n\n\nSince Frontex took up its responsibilities on 1 May 2005, there have been continued discussions with relevant stakeholders at European and national level. In particular, there have been regular discussions in the context of reporting by the Agency in the European Parliament and in the Council. The Agency continuously reports on its activities at the Management Board meetings and through various reports it issues during the year. There have also been regular information exchanges with other Union Agencies in particular the European Asylum Support Office, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, and Europol, as well as with the European Ombudsman. Also, several discussions have been organised with civil society and academia. \n\n\nIn 2014, the Commission launched a Study on the feasibility of the creation of a European System of Border Guards to control the external borders of the Union, the results of which were taken into account in the preparation of this proposal.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Commission has made sure to also take into account the views of relevant stakeholders by closely considering the results of the external evaluation of the Frontex Agency. This external evaluation, based on Article 33 of Regulation (EU) No 2007/2004, was carried out between July 2014 and June 2015, and covers the period from July 2008 to July 2014. The final report was discussed in the Management Board of Frontex on 10 September 2015, and the Management Board has issued recommendations regarding possible modifications to the founding Regulation of Frontex. This proposal reflects the majority of recommendations made by decision of the Management Board on 28 October 2015. \n\n\nThe Commission has also taken into account the Report of the European Parliament on the Special Report of the European Ombudsman in own-initiative inquiry OI/5/2012/BEH-MHZ concerning Frontex in developing a complaint mechanism for the Agency.\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular Articles 18 and 19.\n\n\nThis proposal safeguards fundamental rights by setting out the need for the European Border and Coast Guard Agency to have a Fundamental Rights Strategy, by establishing a Consultative Forum on fundamental rights, by providing for an expanded role for the Fundamental Rights Officer and by including a complaint mechanism by which any person who considers himself or herself to have been the subject of a breach of fundamental rights during activities carried out by the Agency, or any third party intervener, may make a complaint to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency.\n\n\nThe proposal is thus in line with Articles 2 and 6 of the Treaty on European Union and with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe European Border and Coast Guard Agency, to be built from the existing Frontex, is tasked with the management of the external borders alongside the Member States. The subsidy for Frontex, which is to be renamed European Border and Coast Guard Agency, already forms part of the Union\u2019s budget.\n\n\nThe Agency\u2019s budgets for 2015 and 2016 have been reinforced in 2015 in order to enable it to address the migratory crisis, in particular by tripling the financial resources for joint operations Poseidon and Triton, extending the Agency\u2019s support to the Member States in the area of returns and giving to necessary resources to implement hotspots. The final EU subsidy for 2016 as adopted by the Budgetary Authority is EUR\u00a0238\u00a0686\u00a0000. \n\n\nGiven the necessity that the Agency continues with its work in external border management at the same level of intensity, including as regards search and rescue and in the area of return, it is essential that in the future the level of the 2016 subsidy is maintained as the basis for the annual budget of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. \n\n\nHowever, for the Agency to adequately address its new tasks as foreseen in this proposal, in 2017 an amount of at least EUR\u00a031,5 million will need to be added to the Agency\u2019s Union budget in addition to that one for 2016 and an additional 602 posts until 2020 together with the corresponding financial resources are necessary, including 329 establishment plan posts and 273 external staff. \n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe European Border and Coast Guard Agency has a number of duties to report upon its activities and to monitor its work. Most importantly the Agency must compile a consolidated annual activity report which is to include an evaluation of joint operations and rapid border interventions. The Commission must conduct an evaluation in accordance with its guidelines every three years to assess the impact, effectiveness and efficiency of the Agency in all of its activities. The evaluation\u2019s findings must be forwarded by the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the Management Board of the Agency. These findings are to be made public. Furthermore, the European Parliament or the Council can also invite the Executive Director of the Agency to report to those institutions as to the carrying out of his or her tasks.\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nThis proposal lays down the general principles for a European integrated border management with the objective of managing migration effectively and ensuring a high level of internal security within the European Union, whilst safeguarding the free movement of persons within the European Union.\n\n\n\n\nEuropean integrated border management consists of measures in third countries, measures implemented in conjunction with neighbouring third countries, border control measures at the external border and measures implemented inside the area of free movement including the return of third country nationals who illegally stay in a Member State. \n\n\nThis proposal establishes the European Border and Coast Guard which is responsible for integrated border management and, in comparison to the mandate afforded to Frontex, enhances the European Border and Coast Guard Agency\u2019s powers in all aspects of integrated border management. The European Border and Coast Guard is composed of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the national authorities which are responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks. The task of the European Border and Coast Guard is to implement the European integrated border management in accordance with the principle of shared responsibility. Since all national border guards, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks, implement the European integrated border management, they are European Border and Coast Guards at the same time as they are national border guards and coast guards.\n\n\nTo reflect the changes to the competences of Frontex, the Agency is to be renamed European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The key role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency is to establish an operational and technical strategy for the implementation of an integrated border management at Union level, to oversee the effective functioning of border control at the external borders of Member States, to carry out vulnerability assessments and to ensure that deficiencies in the management of the external border by national authorities are addressed, to provide increased operational and technical assistance to Member States through joint operations and rapid border interventions, and to ensure the practical execution of measures in case of a situation requiring urgent action at the external borders, as well as to organise, coordinate and conduct return operations and return interventions. \n\n\nThe European Border and Coast Guard Agency will need to have a broad and effective overview to be able to determine whether a Member State is able to implement applicable EU legislation, and to determine whether there are weaknesses in the border management of a Member State so as to avoid that increases in migration flows lead to serious problems at the external borders. For these purposes, this proposal sets outs out the following elements reinforcing the role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, as compared to that of Frontex:\n\n\n\uf0b7Establishing a monitoring and risk analysis centre with the capacity to monitor migratory flows towards and within the European Union and to carry out risk analysis which is to be applied by Member States and which covers all aspects relevant to integrated border management, in particular, border control, return, irregular secondary movements of third-country nationals with the European Union, the prevention of cross-border crime including facilitation of irregular immigration, trafficking in human beings and terrorism, as well as the situation at neighbouring third countries with a view to developing a pre-warning mechanism which analyses the migratory flows towards the EU.\n\n\n\uf0b7Liaison officers of the Agency to be deployed to Member States so that the Agency can ensure proper and effective monitoring not only through risk analysis, information exchange and Eurosur, but also through its presence on the ground. The task of the liaison officer is to foster cooperation between the Agency and the Member States and in particular, to support the collection of information required by the Agency for carrying out the vulnerability assessment and to monitor the measures taken by Member States at the external borders.\n\n\n\uf0b7Supervisory role for the Agency by establishing a mandatory vulnerability assessment by the Agency to assess the capacity of Member States to face challenges at their external borders, including by means of an assessment of the equipment and resources of Member States as well as of their contingency planning. The Executive Director, on the advice of a Supervisory Board created within the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, will identify the measures that need to be taken by the Member State concerned and should set a time-limit within which those measures need to be taken. The decision of the Executive Director will be binding on the Member State concerned, and where the necessary measures are not taken within the set time-limit, the matter will be referred to the Management Board for a further decision. If the Member State would still fail to act, thereby risking putting in jeopardy the functioning of the Schengen area, the Commission may adopt an implementing decision for direct intervention by the Agency.\n\n\n\uf0b7New procedures to deal with situations requiring urgent action where a Member State does not take the necessary corrective action in line with the vulnerability assessment or in the event of disproportionate migratory pressure at the external borders, rendering the control of the external borders ineffective to an extent that risks putting in jeopardy the functioning of the Schengen area. This will involve a Commission implementing decision identifying the measures to be implemented by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency as outlined in this Regulation and requiring the Member State concerned to cooperate with the Agency in the implementation of those measures. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency will then determine the actions needed to be taken for the practical execution of the measures indicated in the Commission decision, and it will intervene directly in the Member State concerned.\n\n\n\uf0b7Enhanced tasks for the Agency consisting of the setting up and deployment of European Border and Coast Guard Teams for joint operations and rapid border interventions, the setting up of a technical equipment pool, assisting the Commission in coordinating the activities of the migration management support teams at hotspot areas, and a strengthened role in return, risk analysis, training and research.\n\n\n\uf0b7Mandatory pooling of human resources by establishing a rapid reserve pool which will be a standing corps composed of a small percentage of the total number of border guards in the Member States on a yearly basis. The deployment of European Border and Coast Guard Teams from the rapid reserve pool should be immediately complemented by additional European Border and Coast Guard Teams as appropriate.\n\n\n\uf0b7Deployment of an own technical equipment pool by acquiring itself or in co-ownership with a Member State and managing a pool of technical equipment provided by the Member States, based on the needs identified by the Agency and by requiring that the technical equipment pool be completed by means of transport and operating equipment purchased by Member States under the Specific Actions of the Internal Security Fund.\n\n\n\uf0b7Key role in assisting the Commission with the coordination of migration management support teams at hotspot areas, characterised by mixed migratory flows and where the European Border and Coast Guard Agency together with the European Asylum Support Office, Europol and other relevant Union Agencies provides coordinated and enhanced technical and operational support to Member States.\n\n\n\uf0b7Stronger role for the Agency on return by establishing a Return Office within the Agency, which should provide Member States with all necessary operational reinforcement to effectively return illegally staying third country nationals. The Agency will coordinate and organise return operations and return interventions from one or more Member States, and promote their organisation on its own initiative to reinforce the return system of the Member States which are subject to particular pressure. The Agency will need to have at its disposal pools of forced return monitors, forced return escorts and return specialists to be made available by Member States, forming European Return Intervention Teams to be deployed in the Member States.\n\n\n\uf0b7Participation by the Agency in the management of research and innovation activities relevant for the control of external borders, including the use of advanced surveillance technology such as remotely piloted aircraft systems and develop pilot projects regarding matters covered by this Regulation.\n\n\n\uf0b7European cooperation on coast guard functions by developing cross-sectoral cooperation among the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coast guard functions.\n\n\n\uf0b7Increased cooperation with third countries by coordinating operational cooperation between Member States and third countries in border management, including the coordination of joint operations, and by deploying liaison officers to third countries, as well as by cooperating with the authorities of third countries on return, including as regards the acquisition of travel documents. \n\n\n\uf0b7Strengthen the mandate of the Agency to process personal data by also allowing for the processing of personal data in the organisation and coordination of joint operations, pilot projects, rapid border interventions, return operations, return interventions and in the framework of the migration management support teams, as well as in the exchange of information with Member States, the European Asylum Support Office, Europol, Eurojust or other Union Agencies. \n\n\n\uf0b7Guaranteeing the protection of fundamental rights by setting up a complaint mechanism to handle complaints concerning possible violations of fundamental rights in the course of activities carried out by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The complaint mechanism is an administrative mechanism since the Agency cannot itself investigate allegations of violations of fundamental rights by members of the European Border and Coast Guard Teams.\n\n\n2015/0310 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\non the European Border and Coast Guard \nand repealing Regulation (EC) No\u00a02007/2004, Regulation (EC) No 863/2007 and Council Decision 2005/267/EC\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 77(2)(b) and (d) and Article 79(2)(c) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\n\n10\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee,\n\n\n\n11\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of Regions,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas: \n\n\n(1)On 25 and 26 June 2015,\n12\n the European Council called for wider efforts in resolving the migrant crisis in a comprehensive manner, including through the reinforcement of the management of borders to better manage growing mixed migratory flows. Furthermore, on 23 September 2015,\n13\n the European Council stressed the need to tackle the dramatic situation at the external borders as well as to strengthen the controls at those borders, notably through additional resources for the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, the European Asylum Support Office and Europol, with human resources and technical contributions from Member States.\n\n\n(2)The objective of Union policy in the field of external border management is to develop and implement European integrated border management at national and Union level, which is a necessary corollary to the free movement of persons within the Union and is a fundamental component of an area of freedom, security and justice. European integrated border management is central to improving migration management and ensuring a high level of internal security within the Union. \n\n\n(3)European integrated border management, based on the four-tier access model, comprises measures in third countries, such as under the common visa policy, measures with neighbouring third countries, border control measures at the external border itself as well as risk analysis, and measures within the area of free movement, including return.\n\n\n(4)To ensure the effective implementation of the European integrated border management, a European Border and Coast Guard should be established. The European Border and Coast Guard, which comprises the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and national authorities which are responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks, relies upon the common use of information, capabilities and systems at national level and the response of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency at Union level.\n\n\n(5)European integrated border management is a shared responsibility of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the national authorities responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks. While Member States retain the primary responsibility for the management of their section of the external borders in their interest and in the interest of all Member States which have abolished internal border control, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency should ensure the application of Union measures relating to the management of the external borders by reinforcing, assessing and coordinating the actions of Member States which implement those measures.\n\n\n(6)The development of the policy and legislation on external border control and return remains a responsibility of the Union institutions. Close coordination between the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and those institutions should be guaranteed.\n\n\n(7)The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, commonly referred to as Frontex, was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004.\n14\n Since taking up its responsibilities on 1 May 2005, it has been successful in assisting Member States with implementing the operational aspects of external border management through joint operations and rapid border interventions, as well as risk analysis, information exchange, relations with third countries and the return of third-country nationals illegally staying on the territory of Member States.\n\n\n(8)Having regard to the increasing migratory pressures at the external borders, to the necessity of ensuring a high level of internal security within the Union and to safeguard the functioning of the Schengen area as well as the overarching principle of solidarity, it is necessary to reinforce the management of the external borders by building on the work of Frontex and further develop it into an Agency with a shared responsibility for the management of the external borders.\n\n\n(9)The tasks of Frontex should therefore be expanded and to reflect those changes, it should be renamed European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The key role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency should be to establish an operational and technical strategy for the implementation of an integrated border management at Union level, to oversee the effective functioning of border control at the external borders, to provide increased operational and technical assistance to Member States through joint operations and rapid border interventions, and to ensure the practical execution of measures in case of a situation requiring urgent action at the external borders, as well as to organise, coordinate and conduct return operations and return  interventions.\n\n\n(10)The European Border and Coast Guard Agency relies on the cooperation of Member States to be able to perform its tasks effectively. In this respect, it is important for the Agency and the Member States to act in good faith and to have a timely and accurate exchange of information.\n\n\n\n\n(11)The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should prepare general and tailored risk analysis based on a common integrated risk analysis model, to be applied by the Agency itself and by Member States. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should, based also on information provided by Member States, provide adequate information and intelligence covering all aspects relevant to European integrated border management, especially border control, return, irregular secondary movements of third-country nationals within the Union, prevention of cross-border crime including facilitation of irregular immigration, trafficking in human beings and terrorism, as well as the situation at neighbouring third countries, so as to allow for appropriate measures to be taken or to tackle identified threats and risks with a view to improving the integrated management of external borders.\n\n\n(12)In a spirit of shared responsibility, the role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency should be to regularly monitor the management of the external borders. The Agency should ensure proper and effective monitoring not only through risk analysis, information exchange and Eurosur, but also through presence of experts from its own staff in Member States. The Agency should therefore be able to deploy liaison officers to specific Member States for a period of time during which the liaison officer reports to the Executive Director. The report of the liaison officers should form part of the vulnerability assessment.\n\n\n(13)The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should carry out a vulnerability assessment to assess the capacity of the Member States to face challenges at their external borders, including by assessing the equipment and resources of Member States as well as their contingency plans to address possible crises at the external borders. Member States should take corrective action to address any deficiencies identified in that assessment. The Executive Director, on the advice of a Supervisory Board created within the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, should identify the measures to be taken by the Member State concerned and should set a time-limit within which those measures should be taken. That decision should be binding on that Member State and where the necessary measures are not taken within the set time-limit, the matter needs to be referred to the Management Board for a further decision. \n\n\n(14)The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should organise the appropriate technical and operational assistance to Member States so as to reinforce their capacity to implement their obligations with regard to the control of the external borders, and to face challenges at the external border resulting from irregular immigration or cross-border crime. In this respect, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency should, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, organise and coordinate joint operations for one or more Member States and deploy European Border and Coast Guard Teams as well as the necessary technical equipment, and it may deploy experts from its own staff.\n\n\n(15)In cases where there is a specific and disproportionate pressure at the external borders, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency should, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, organise and coordinate rapid border interventions and deploy European Border and Coast Guard Teams from a rapid reserve pool as well as technical equipment. Rapid border interventions should provide reinforcement in situations where immediate response is required and where such an intervention would provide an effective response. To ensure the effective operation of such intervention, Member States should make border guards and other relevant staff available to the rapid reserve pool.\n\n\n(16)At particular areas of the external borders where Member States face disproportionate migratory pressures characterised by large influxes of mixed migratory flows, referred to as hotspot areas, the Member States should be able to rely on the increased operational and technical reinforcement by the migration management support teams composed of teams of experts deployed from Member States by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the European Asylum Support Office, and from Europol or other relevant Union Agencies, as well as experts from the staff of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should assist the Commission in the coordination among the different agencies on the ground.\n\n\n(17)In cases where a Member State does not take the necessary corrective action in line with the vulnerability assessment or in the event of disproportionate migratory pressure at the external borders, rendering the control at the external border ineffective to an extent which risks putting in jeopardy the functioning of the Schengen area, a unified, rapid and effective response should be delivered at Union level. For this purpose, and to ensure better coordination at Union level, the Commission should identify the measures to be implemented by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and require the Member State concerned to cooperate with the Agency in the implementation of those measures. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should then determine the actions to be taken for the practical execution of the measures indicated in the Commission decision, and an operational plan should be drawn up with the Member State concerned.\n\n\n(18)The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should have the necessary equipment and staff at its disposal to be deployed in joint operations or rapid border interventions. To this end, when launching rapid border interventions at the request of a Member State or in the context of a situation requiring urgent action, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency should be able to deploy European Border and Coast Guard Teams from a rapid reserve pool which should be a standing corps composed of a small percentage of the total number of border guards in the Member States, which should amount to a minimum of 1\u00a0500. The deployment of the European Border and Coast Guard Teams from the rapid reserve pool should be immediately complemented by additional European Border and Coast Guard Teams as appropriate.\n\n\n(19)Having regard to the rapidity with which deployment of equipment and staff would need to take place in particular at areas of the external borders facing sudden large influxes of migratory flow, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency should also be able to deploy its own technical equipment which it should acquire itself or in co-ownership with a Member State. That technical equipment should be made available to the Agency upon its request. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should also manage a pool of technical equipment provided by the Member States, based on the needs identified by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and which should be completed by the means of transport and operating equipment purchased by Member States under the Specific Actions of the Internal Security Fund.\n\n\n(20)On 8 October 2015, the European Council called for enlarging the mandate of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union to assist Member States in ensuring the effective return of illegally staying third-country nationals, including by organising return operations on its own initiative and enhancing its role regarding the acquisition of travel documents. For this purpose, the European Council called for the establishment of a Return Office within the European Border and Coast Guard Agency which should be tasked with the coordination of the Agency\u2019s activities in the field of return.\n\n\n(21)The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should step up its assistance to Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals, subject to the Union return policy and in compliance with Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n15\n In particular, it should coordinate and organise return operations from one or more Member States and it should organise and conduct return interventions to reinforce the return system of Member States requiring increased technical and operational assistance when complying with their obligation to return illegally staying third-country nationals in accordance with that Directive.\n\n\n(22)The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should establish pools of forced return monitors, forced return experts and return specialists made available by Member States, who should be deployed during return operations and that should form part of tailor-made European Return Intervention Teams deployed in return interventions. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should provide them with the necessary training. \n\n\n(23)The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should develop specific training tools and it should provide training at Union level for national instructors of border guards and additional training and seminars related to control at external borders and return of third-country nationals illegally staying on the territory of Member States for officers of the competent national bodies. The Agency should be authorised to organise training activities in cooperation with Member States and third countries on their territory.\n\n\n(24)The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should monitor and contribute to the developments in research relevant for the control of the external borders, including the use of advanced surveillance technology, and it should disseminate this information to the Member States and to the Commission.\n\n\n(25)Effective implementation of an integrated management of the external borders necessitates regular, swift and reliable exchange of information among the Member States regarding the management of the external borders, irregular immigration and return. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should develop and operate information systems facilitating such exchange in accordance with Union data protection legislation.\n\n\n(26)For the purpose of fulfilling its mission and to the extent required for the accomplishment of its tasks, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency may cooperate with Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as with international organisations in matters covered by this Regulation in the framework of working arrangements concluded in accordance with Union law and policy. Those working arrangements should receive the Commission\u2019s prior approval.\n\n\n(27)National authorities carrying out coast guard functions are responsible for a wide range of tasks, including but not limited to maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental protection. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency established by Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005\u00a0\n16\n and the European Maritime Safety Agency established by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0\n17\n\u00a0should therefore strengthen their cooperation both with each other and with the national authorities carrying out coast guard functions to increase maritime situational awareness as well as to support coherent and cost-efficient action.\n\n\n(28)The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should facilitate and encourage operational cooperation between Member States and third countries in the framework of the external relations policy of the Union, including by coordinating operational cooperation between Member States and third countries in the field of management of external borders and by deploying liaison officers to third countries, as well as by cooperating with the authorities of third countries on return, including as regards the acquisition of travel documents. In their cooperation with third countries, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and Member States should comply with norms and standards at least equivalent to those set by Union legislation also when the cooperation with third countries takes place on the territory of those countries. \n\n\n(29)This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Articles 2 and 6 of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, this Regulation seeks to ensure full respect for human dignity, the right to life, the right to liberty and security, the right to the protection of personal data, the right to access to asylum, the right to effective remedy, the rights of the child, the prohibition of torture and of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the prohibition of trafficking in human beings, and to promote the application of the principles of non-discrimination and non-refoulement. \n\n\n(30)This Regulation establishes a complaint mechanism for the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, in cooperation with the Fundamental Rights Officer, to monitor and ensure the respect for fundamental rights in all the activities of the Agency. This should be an administrative mechanism whereby the Fundamental Rights Officer should be responsible for handling complaints received by the Agency in accordance with the right to good administration. The Fundamental Rights Officer should review the admissibility of a complaint, register admissible complaints, forward all registered complaints to the Executive Director, forward complaints concerning border guards to the home Member State and register the follow-up by the Agency or that Member State. Criminal investigations should be conducted by the Member States. \n\n\n\n\n(31)In order to ensure the uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, in particular as regards situations requiring urgent action at the external borders, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No\u00a0182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n18\n\n\n\n(32)The European Border and Coast Guard Agency should be independent as regards operational and technical matters and have legal, administrative and financial autonomy. To that end, it is necessary and appropriate that it should be a Union body having legal personality and exercising the implementing powers, which are conferred upon it by this Regulation.\n\n\n(33)The Commission and the Member States should be represented within a Management Board to exercise policy and political oversight over the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The Board should, where possible, consist of the operational heads of the national services responsible for border guard management or their representatives. This Board should be entrusted with the necessary powers to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt the appropriate financial rules, establish transparent working procedures for decision making by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and appoint the Executive Director and the Deputy Executive Director. The Agency should be governed and operated in line with the principles of the common approach on Union decentralised agencies adopted on 19 July 2012 by the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission.\n\n\n(34)In order to guarantee the autonomy of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, it should be granted an autonomous budget whose revenue comes essentially from a contribution from the Union. The Union budgetary procedure should be applicable as far as the Union contribution and any other subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the European Union are concerned. The auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the Court of Auditors.\n\n\n(35)Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0\n19\n should apply without restriction to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, which should accede to the Inter-institutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).\n20\n\n\n\n(36)Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents\u00a0\n21\n should apply to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency.\n\n\n(37)Any processing of personal data by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency within the framework of this Regulation should be conducted in accordance Regulation (EC) No\u00a045/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n22\n\u00a0\n\n\n(38)Any processing of personal data by Member States within the framework of this Regulation should be conducted in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council,\n23\n Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA\u00a0\n24\n and the respect of the principles of necessity and proportionality.\n\n\n(39)Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the development and implementation of a system of integrated management of the external borders, thus also ensuring the proper functioning of the Schengen area, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting in an uncoordinated manner but can rather, because of the absence of controls at internal borders and in view of the significant migratory pressures at the external borders and the need to safeguard a high level of internal security within the Union, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n\n(40)As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters\u2019 association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis,\n25\n which fall within the area referred to in point A of Article 1 of Council Decision 1999/437/EC.\n26\n The arrangement between the European Community and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway on the modalities of the participation by those States in the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union\u00a0\n27\n\u00a0provides for rules on\u00a0the participation by those countries in the work of the Agency, including provisions on financial contributions and staff.\n\n\n(41)As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation\u2019s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\u00a0\n28\n which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, points A, B and G of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC.\n29\n\n\n\n(42)As regards Liechtenstein, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation\u2019s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\u00a0\n30\n which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, points A, B and G of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2011/350/EU.\n31\n\n\n\n(43)The arrangement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein, of the other part, on the modalities of the participation by those States in the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union\u00a0\n32\n provides for rules on the participation by those countries in the work of the Agency, including provisions on financial contributions and staff.\n\n\n(44)In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it, or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark should, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law or not.\n\n\n(45)This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision\u00a02000/365/EC;\n33\n the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n\n\n(46)This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC;\n34\n Ireland is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n\n\n(47)The Agency should facilitate the organisation of specific activities in which the Member States may avail themselves of the expertise and facilities which Ireland and the United Kingdom may be willing to offer, in accordance with modalities to be decided on a case-by-case basis by the Management Board. To that end, representatives of Ireland and the United Kingdom may be invited to attend meetings of the Management Board which allow them to participate fully in the preparation of such specific activities.\n\n\n(48)A controversy exists between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom on the demarcation of the borders of Gibraltar.\n\n\n(49)The suspension of the applicability of this Regulation to the borders of Gibraltar does not imply any change in the respective positions of the States concerned.\n\n\n(50)The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article\u00a028(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on [\u2026]\u00a0\n35\n.\n\n\n\n\n(51)This Regulation aims to amend and expand the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004, Regulation (EC) No 863/2007\u00a0\n36\n of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Decision 2005/267/EC.\n37\n Since the amendments to be made are of substantial number and nature, those acts should, in the interests of clarity, be replaced and repealed. References to the repealed regulations should be construed as references to this Regulation.\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\n\nEUROPEAN BORDER AND COAST GUARD\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nSubject matter\n\n\nA European Border and Coast Guard is hereby set up to ensure a European integrated border management at the external borders with a view to managing migration effectively and ensuring a high level of internal security within the Union, while safeguarding the free movement of persons therein. \n\n\nArticle 2 \n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n\n(1)\u2018external borders\u2019 means the land and sea borders of the Member States and their airports and seaports, to which the provisions of Title II of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0\n38\n apply;\n\n\n(2)\u2018border control\u2019 means border control as defined in point 9 of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006;\n\n\n(3)\u2018European Border and Coast Guard Teams\u2019 mean teams of border guards and other relevant staff from participating Member States, including national experts that are seconded by Member States to the Agency, to be deployed during joint operations, rapid border interventions as well as in the framework of migration management support teams;\n\n\n(4)\u2018host Member State\u2019 means a Member State in which a joint operation or a rapid border intervention, a return operation or a return intervention takes place or from which it is launched;\n\n\n(5)\u2018home Member State\u2019 means the Member State of which a member of the European Border and Coast Guard Teams is a border guard or other relevant staff member;\n\n\n(6)\u2018participating Member State\u2019 means a Member State which participates in a joint operation, rapid border intervention, return operation, return  intervention or migration management support teams by providing technical equipment, border guards and other relevant staff deployed as part of the European Border and Coast Guard Teams, as well as a Member States which participate in return operations or return interventions by providing technical equipment or staff;\n\n\n(7)\u2018members of the European Border and Coast Guard Teams\u2019 mean the officers of border guard services or other relevant staff of Member States other than the host Member State, including national experts and border guards from Member States seconded to the Agency, who are participating in joint operations or rapid border interventions;\n\n\n(8)\u2018members of the teams\u2019 mean members of the European Border and Coast Guard Teams or teams of staff involved in return-related tasks participating in return operations or return interventions;\n\n\n(9)\u2018migration management support teams\u2019 mean teams of experts which provide operational and technical reinforcement to Member States at hotspot areas and which are composed of experts deployed from Member States by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the European Asylum Support Office, and from Europol or other relevant Union Agencies;\n\n\n(10)\u2018return\u2019 means return as defined in point 3 of Article 3 of Directive 2008/115/EC;\n\n\n\n\n(11)\u2018return decision\u2019 means a return decision as defined in point 4 of Article 3 of Directive 2008/115/EC;\n\n\n(12)\u2018returnee\u2019 means an illegally staying third-country national subject to a return decision;\n\n\n(13)\u2018return operation\u2019 means an operation to return illegally staying third-country nationals, that is coordinated by the Agency and involves technical and operational reinforcement being provided by one or more Member States under which returnees from one or more Member States are returned either through forced return or in voluntary compliance with an obligation to return;\n\n\n(14)\u2018return intervention\u2019 means an operation to return illegally staying third-country nationals providing for enhanced technical and operational assistance consisting of the deployment of European Return Intervention Teams to Member States and the organisation of return operations.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nEuropean Border and Coast Guard\n\n\n1.The European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the national authorities of Member States which are responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks, shall constitute the European Border and Coast Guard. \n\n\n2.The European Border and Coast Guard Agency shall establish an operational and technical strategy for the European integrated border management.

It is part of a package of measures presented by the Commission in order to better ensure the protection of the EU\u2019s external borders as set out in the accompanying Commission Communication entitled \u2018A European Border and Coast Guard and effective management of Europe\u2019s external borders\u2019.\n\n\nIn 2015, the European Union witnessed extraordinary pressures at its external borders with an estimated 1,5 million persons having crossed the borders illegally between January and November this year. The sheer scale of the mixed migratory flows which have crossed the external borders of the European Union and the consequent secondary movements, demonstrated that existing structures at Union and Member State level are inadequate to address the challenges arising from such a large influx. In an area without internal borders, irregular immigration through the external borders of one Member State affects all other Member States within the Schengen area. The significant secondary movements have led several Member States to reintroduce border control at their internal borders. This has put considerable strain on the functioning and coherence of the Schengen area.\n\n\nThroughout the current migration crisis, it became clear that the Schengen area without internal borders is only sustainable if the external borders are effectively secured and protected. The control of the Union\u2019s external borders is a common and shared interest which must be carried out in accordance with high and uniform Union standards.\n\n\nThe intensified security concerns following the terrorist attacks of this year have added to citizens\u2019 concerns. Whilst borders can never provide complete security, they can make a significant contribution in terms of increasing security and intelligence and thwarting future attacks. This function has become even more important in the light of the increasing phenomenon of foreign fighters involved in terrorist attacks. Reinforcing security at the external borders is therefore essential to restoring public confidence.\n\n\nA single travel area without internal borders is only sustainable if the external borders are effectively protected. A chain is always only as strong as its weakest link. A decisive step towards an integrated management system for external borders therefore is needed. This is only possible as a shared task among all Member States, in line with the principles of solidarity and responsibility to which all the EU\u2019s institutions have agreed as the guiding principles addressing the migration crisis.\n\n\nThe European Agenda on Migration identified the need to move to a shared management of the external borders, in line with the objective of the \u2018gradual introduction of an integrated management system for external borders\u2019 set out in Article 77 TFEU. In his State of the Union speech in September, President Juncker announced that the Commission would present ambitious steps in this respect before the end of the year in the form of a fully operational European Border and Coast Guard, as was subsequently confirmed in the Commission Work Programme 2016. \n\n\nThe proposed Regulation lays down the general principles of European integrated border management; it establishes a European Border and Coast Guard and a European Border and Coast Guard Agency built from Frontex. The objective of this draft Regulation is to provide for a more integrated management of the EU\u2019s external borders, inter alia by providing the European Border and Coast Guard Agency with more competences in the fields of external border management and return than Frontex currently has. This draft Regulation affords the European Border and Coast Guard Agency the additional competences needed for it to effectively implement integrated border management at Union level, to address deficiencies of border management at national level, and to respond to unprecedented migratory flows such as those which have arrived at the external borders of the European Union this year. \n\n\nGranting these additional competences to the European level of the European Border and Coast Guard is essential to prevent that deficiencies of external border management or unpredicted migratory flows undermine the proper functioning of the Schengen area. The challenges which have arisen from the migratory crisis cannot be adequately dealt with by Member States acting in an uncoordinated manner. Integrated border management is a shared responsibility of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the national authorities responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks, and together they constitute the European Border and Coast Guard.\n\n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objectives and ABM/ABB activity concerned \n\n\n\n\n\nThe following specific objectives are defined on the basis of the Agency's tasks set out in Article 7 of the proposal. However, the breakdown of specific objectives takes into account the ABM/ABB framework established by the Frontex Agency for the purpose of its 2016 Programme of Work taking into account the new tasks established by the Regulation and some necessary adaptations\n59\n.\n\n\nSpecific objective No 1: Support in the external borders management\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0coordinating operational cooperation between Member States in the field of management of the external borders, \n\n\n- \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0assisting Member States in circumstances requiring increased technical and operational assistance at the external borders by coordinating and organising joint operations, taking into account that some situations may involve humanitarian emergencies and rescue at sea;\n\n\n- \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0assisting Member States in circumstances requiring increased technical and operational assistance at the external borders, by launching rapid border interventions at the external borders of those Member States facing specific and disproportionate pressures, taking into account that some situations may involve humanitarian emergencies and rescue at sea;

The European Border and Coast Guard is composed of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the national authorities which are responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks. The task of the European Border and Coast Guard is to implement the European integrated border management in accordance with the principle of shared responsibility. Since all national border guards, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks, implement the European integrated border management, they are European Border and Coast Guards at the same time as they are national border guards and coast guards.\n\n\nTo reflect the changes to the competences of Frontex, the Agency is to be renamed European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The key role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency is to establish an operational and technical strategy for the implementation of an integrated border management at Union level, to oversee the effective functioning of border control at the external borders of Member States, to carry out vulnerability assessments and to ensure that deficiencies in the management of the external border by national authorities are addressed, to provide increased operational and technical assistance to Member States through joint operations and rapid border interventions, and to ensure the practical execution of measures in case of a situation requiring urgent action at the external borders, as well as to organise, coordinate and conduct return operations and return interventions. \n\n\nThe European Border and Coast Guard Agency will need to have a broad and effective overview to be able to determine whether a Member State is able to implement applicable EU legislation, and to determine whether there are weaknesses in the border management of a Member State so as to avoid that increases in migration flows lead to serious problems at the external borders. For these purposes, this proposal sets outs out the following elements reinforcing the role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, as compared to that of Frontex:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishing a monitoring and risk analysis centre with the capacity to monitor migratory flows towards and within the European Union and to carry out risk analysis which is to be applied by Member States and which covers all aspects relevant to integrated border management, in particular, border control, return, irregular secondary movements of third-country nationals with the European Union, the prevention of cross-border crime including facilitation of irregular immigration, trafficking in human beings and terrorism, as well as the situation at neighbouring third countries with a view to developing a pre-warning mechanism which analyses the migratory flows towards the EU.\n\n\nLiaison officers of the Agency to be deployed to Member States so that the Agency can ensure proper and effective monitoring not only through risk analysis, information exchange and Eurosur, but also through its presence on the ground. The task of the liaison officer is to foster cooperation between the Agency and the Member States and in particular, to support the collection of information required by the Agency for carrying out the vulnerability assessment and to monitor the measures taken by Member States at the external borders.\n\n\nSupervisory role for the Agency by establishing a mandatory vulnerability assessment by the Agency to assess the capacity of Member States to face challenges at their external borders, including by means of an assessment of the equipment and resources of Member States as well as of their contingency planning. The Executive Director, on the advice of a Supervisory Board created within the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, will identify the measures that need to be taken by the Member State concerned and should set a time-limit within which those measures need to be taken. The decision of the Executive Director will be binding on the Member State concerned, and where the necessary measures are not taken within the set time-limit, the matter will be referred to the Management Board for a further decision. If the Member State would still fail to act, thereby risking putting in jeopardy the functioning of the Schengen area, the Commission may adopt an implementing decision for direct intervention by the Agency.\n\n\nNew procedures to deal with situations requiring urgent action where a Member State does not take the necessary corrective action in line with the vulnerability assessment or in the event of disproportionate migratory pressure at the external borders, rendering the control of the external borders ineffective to an extent that risks putting in jeopardy the functioning of the Schengen area. This will involve a Commission implementing decision identifying the measures to be implemented by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency as outlined in this Regulation and requiring the Member State concerned to cooperate with the Agency in the implementation of those measures. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency will then determine the actions needed to be taken for the practical execution of the measures indicated in the Commission decision, and it will intervene directly in the Member State concerned.\n\n\nEnhanced tasks for the Agency consisting of the setting up and deployment of European Border and Coast Guard Teams for joint operations and rapid border interventions, the setting up of a technical equipment pool, assisting the Commission in coordinating the activities of the migration management support teams at hotspot areas, and a strengthened role in return, risk analysis, training and research.\n\n\nMandatory pooling of human resources by establishing a rapid reserve pool which will be a standing corps composed of a small percentage of the total number of border guards in the Member States on a yearly basis. The deployment of European Border and Coast Guard Teams from the rapid reserve pool should be immediately complemented by additional European Border and Coast Guard Teams as appropriate.\n\n\nDeployment of an own technical equipment pool by acquiring itself or in co-ownership with a Member State and managing a pool of technical equipment provided by the Member States, based on the needs identified by the Agency and by requiring that the technical equipment pool be completed by means of transport and operating equipment purchased by Member States under the Specific Actions of the Internal Security Fund.\n\n\nKey role in assisting the Commission with the coordination of migration management support teams at hotspot areas, characterised by mixed migratory flows and where the European Border and Coast Guard Agency together with the European Asylum Support Office, Europol and other relevant Union Agencies provides coordinated and enhanced technical and operational support to Member States.\n\n\nStronger role for the Agency on return by establishing a Return Office within the Agency, which should provide Member States with all necessary operational reinforcement to effectively return illegally staying third country nationals. The Agency will coordinate and organise return operations and return interventions from one or more Member States, and promote their organisation on its own initiative to reinforce the return system of the Member States which are subject to particular pressure. The Agency will need to have at its disposal pools of forced return monitors, forced return escorts and return specialists to be made available by Member States, forming European Return Intervention Teams to be deployed in the Member States.\n\n\nParticipation by the Agency in the management of research and innovation activities relevant for the control of external borders, including the use of advanced surveillance technology such as remotely piloted aircraft systems and develop pilot projects regarding matters covered by this Regulation.\n\n\nEuropean cooperation on coast guard functions by developing cross-sectoral cooperation among the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coast guard functions.\n\n\nIncreased cooperation with third countries by coordinating operational cooperation between Member States and third countries in border management, including the coordination of joint operations, and by deploying liaison officers to third countries, as well as by cooperating with the authorities of third countries on return, including as regards the acquisition of travel documents. \n\n\nStrengthen the mandate of the Agency to process personal data by also allowing for the processing of personal data in the organisation and coordination of joint operations, pilot projects, rapid border interventions, return operations, return interventions and in the framework of the migration management support teams, as well as in the exchange of information with Member States, the European Asylum Support Office, Europol, Eurojust or other Union Agencies. \n\n\nGuaranteeing the protection of fundamental rights by setting up a complaint mechanism to handle complaints concerning possible violations of fundamental rights in the course of activities carried out by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The complaint mechanism is an administrative mechanism since the Agency cannot itself investigate allegations of violations of fundamental rights by members of the European Border and Coast Guard Teams.\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number, duration and effectiveness of joint operations, rapid interventions and pilot projects coordinated by the Agency in relation to external borders;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number of irregular migrants apprehended per type of border (air, sea, land);\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number of rapid interventions financed from the Agency's operational reserve\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0effective implementation of the code of conduct for border guards;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number of incidents, products and permanent services provided by EFCA and EMSA to the Agency, leading to an enhanced maritime situational awareness for border guards and national authorities carrying out coast guard functions;\n\n\n- \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Number of multipurpose operations to support coast guard functions (in cooperation with EMSA and EFCA)\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number of return operations coordinated by the Agency;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0numbers of persons returned under the operations and the interventions organised and conducted by the Agency;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0effective implementation of the code of conduct on return operations;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number and frequency of risk analysis reports delivered by the Agency;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0quality and efficiency of tailored risk analysis reports;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number and vulnerability assessments delivered by the Agency each year\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number or training modules and numbers of trainees;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number of training courses delivered; \n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number of Erasmus type exchanges of border guards;\n\n\n- \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number of assets experts registered in the Agency's pools\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number of own assets purchased/leased by the Agency\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0effective management of resources and personnel and effect measurement via the Frontex Situation Centre;\n\n\n- \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0quantity and quality  of data, information and intelligence exchanged in close-to-real time via Eurosur communication network, the Common Pre-frontier Intelligence Picture and the European Situational Picture;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0use of data fusion combined with technological capabilities for detecting and tracking cross-border movements as well as cross-sectoral information exchange with other actors by providing the common application of surveillance tools at EU level and environmental information (Eurosur fusion services).\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0user satisfaction of the activities of the Agency.\n\n\n- \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number of liaison officers posted in third countries\n\n\n- \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0number of liaison officers posted in Member States \n\n\nThe following horizontal indicators have an impact on the overall management of the Agency:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0implementation and the correct functioning of the European Border and Coast Guard Teams;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0management and completeness of the technical equipment pool;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0identification, prioritisation and impact of the working arrangements with third countries in full respect of the EU external policy;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0flexibility to implement recommendations from the Management Board, other stakeholders  and independent evaluations. [\u2026]\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirements to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nIn the short run, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency is expected to continue conducting the Frontex's core activities in relation to the management of the external borders and returns. The Frontex Agency\u2019s budgets for 2015 and 2016 have been reinforced in 2015 in order to enable it to address the migratory crisis, in particular by tripling the financial resources for joint operations Poseidon and Triton, extending the Agency\u2019s support to the Member States in the area of returns and giving to necessary resources to implement hotspots. The final EU subsidy for 2016 as proposed by the Commission is EUR 238\u00a0686\u00a0000. \n\n\nIt is necessary that the Agency continues with its work in external border management at the same level of intensity, including its regular and important contribution to search and rescue missions and in the area of return. The new tasks proposed in the Regulation will enhance the Agency's capabilities to suppport the Member States in those areas of intervention. In that context, it is essential that in the future the level of the 2016 subsidy is maintained as the basis for the annual budget of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency as of 2017 in order to: \n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to continue with the scaled up operational activities within Joint Operations at sea, in particular Triton and Poseidon, with the reinforced number of assets and extended the territorial scope of those operations, thus allowing to increase the search and rescue possibilities within the mandate of the Agency;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to continue the Agency's participation in the Migration Management Support Teams working in 'hotspot' areas, where the EBA and other relevant Agencies will work on the ground with frontline Member States, by providing support to those Member States for screening, registration and fingerprinting as well as playing a particularly active role with regard to return operations and dismantling of smuggling networks; \n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to further enhance the Agency's role in the area of returns in assisting Member States in return operations and other relevant activities within the new mandate, in particular through the creation of a dedicated Return Office enabling the Agency to scale up its support to Member States in order, inter alia, to facilitate, organise and fund return operations;\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to further reinforce the cooperation with the other Home Affairs agencies, in particular EASO, Europol and EU-Lisa\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to further enhance the Agency's important role on migrant smuggling in general as well as the contribution to the implementation of the EU Action Plan against smuggling\n\n\nHowever, this proposal substantially expands upon the ability of the Agency to respond effectively to present or future threats at the external borders by proactively supporting the actions of Member States in the implementation of appropriate measures, in particular in cases of specific and disproportionate pressures at the external borders.\n\n\nIn the medium term, the Agency's structure, capabilities, tasks will be strengthened through this Regulation.  For the Agency to adequately address its new tasks, in 2017 an additional amount will need to be added to the Agency\u2019s EU subsidy on the top of the amount foreseen for 2016. In particular, the additional finacial resources shall enable the Agency: \n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to establish the operational reserve allowing to finance the deployment of rapid border interventions and return support interventions. The financial operational reserve should amount to at least to 4% of the allocation foreseen for the operational activities and shall be maintained throughout the year. At least an amount of EUR 10\u00a0000\u00a0000 should be added to the Agency's subsidy to ensure a possibility of launching such interventions in line with the timeframe foreseen in the Regulation. \n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to acquire, maintain and lease its own equipment. In this regard, additional amount of EUR 10\u00a0000\u00a0000 should be added to the EU subsidy to enable the Agency to finance in the first place the purchase of small and medium size operational equipment (ie. Eurodac devices). The Agency's own equipment should complement a pool of technical equipment provided by the Member States, in particular the means of transport and operating equipment purchased by Member States under the Specific Actions of the Internal Security Fund.\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to carry out the new takes related to Agency's cooperation with the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency to support \"Coast Guard Functions\". Details of this cooperation will be clarified in a dedicated pilot project in 2016. However, an amount of EUR 5\u00a0000\u00a0000 is needed in order to enable the Agency to efficiently coordinate with EMSA and EFCA with regard to common provision of services, information, equipment and training in the context of coast guard functions as well as to  extend  joint operations at sea borders to become multipurpose operations covering other coast guard functions. \n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to reinforce the Agency's cooperation with third countries including and the involvement of the Agency's in operational activities with neighbouring countries, technical assistance projects, cooperation on return matters , including on the acquisition of travel documents. In this regard, an amount of EUR 5\u00a0000\u00a0000 should be added to the Agency's budget annually. This amount will enable the Agency to proactively cooperate with third countries without prejudices to the Agency benefiting from any Union funding in accordance with the provisions of the relevant instruments supporting the external relations policy of the Union. \n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to increase the number of Agency's liaison officers in third countries. In order to support the deployment of 10 additional liaison officers, in addition to the staff costs, the Agency's budget should be top up with EUR 1\u00a0000\u00a0000 annually to cover costs related to office, communication, logistical and technical support. Moreover, additional EUR 1\u00a0000\u00a0000 in 2017 should be foreseen in relation to the installation costs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to support the establishment of the complaint mechanism and streamlining other fundamental rights related activities an amount of EUR 500\u00a0000 should be added annually to the agency's budget. \n\n\nIn addition to the financial resources, additional 602 staff members  are considered necessary in order to enable the Agency to fulfil the new tasks including 329 establishment plan posts and 273 external staff. The precise needs for human resources are defined in section 3.2.3.\n\n\nIn the short and medium term, the activities of the Agency will contribute to the achievements of the goals of  the European Agenda on Migration and the European Agenda on Security.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to ensure a European integrated border management of the EU\u2019s external borders, with a view to managing migration effectively and ensuring a high level of security within the Union, while safeguarding the free movement of persons therein. In an area without internal borders, irregular immigration through the external borders of one Member State affects all other Member States within the Schengen area. An area without internal borders is only sustainable if the external borders are effectively secured and protected. \n\n\nSince the control of the Union\u2019s external borders is a common and shared interest which must be carried out in accordance with high and uniform Union standards, the objectives of this proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Members States, and can be better accomplished at the level of the Union, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThe Frontex Agency was set up in 2004 and became operational in 2005. As requested by the Hague programme, the Commission adopted on 13 February 2008 a Communication on the evaluation and future development of the Frontex Agency (COM(2008) 67 final). \n\n\nThe Communication issued recommendations for the short to medium term and launched ideas for the future development of the Agency in the longer term. For the longer term perspective the crucial role of Frontex in the development of the European Union\u2019s integrated border management system was underlined.\n\n\nIn conclusion the Commission recommended a number of improvements for how the Agency operates within its mandate and that in the medium-term the mandate should be revised.\n\n\nIn addition to the abovementioned Commission Report on the evaluation and future development of the Frontex Agency an independent evaluation took place during 2008. That evaluation contracted by the Frontex Management Board as requested by Article 33 of the Frontex Regulation, provided additional points of view and factual elements on the working practices of the Agency. It also issued a series of recommendations to the Frontex Management Board. \n\n\nAgainst this background, the Agency\u2019s mandate was amended in 2011 to enable it to respond to the new challenges. \n\n\nDespite the improvements introduced by the 2011 amendment, following the clear political guidance provided by the European Council in the course of 2015 on the role of the Frontex Agency in addressing the increasing migratory pressures and the external evaluation of the Frontex Agency in 2014/2015, the further revamping of the Agency's mandate is needed. The present proposal serves is presented accordingly. \n\n\nIn preparation of this proposal, the Commission has relied upon the discussions that have been regularly taking place in the European Council and in the Council of Ministers, as well as in the European Parliament on border management and the measures needed to address the migratory crisis. The future of border management and, in particular, the reinforcement of the Frontex Agency has recently been the subject of discussion in the Council of Ministers meeting of 8 October 2015.  This was followed by a meeting of the European Council on 15 October 2015, which in its orientations on the future of border management, called for the strengthening of the external borders of the European Union by, amongst others, working towards the establishment of an integrated management system for external borders and by enhancing the mandate of Frontex.\n\n\nSince Frontex took up its responsibilities on 1 May 2005, there have been continued discussions with relevant stakeholders at European and national level. In particular, there have been regular discussions in the context of reporting by the Agency in the European Parliament and in the Council. The Agency continuously reports on its activities at the Management Board meetings and through various reports it issues during the year. There have also been regular information exchanges with other Union Agencies in particular the European Asylum Support Office, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, and Europol, as well as with the European Ombudsman. Also, several discussions have been organised with civil society and academia. \n\n\nIn 2014, the Commission had launched a Study on the feasibility of the creation of a European System of Border Guards to control the external borders of the Union, the results of which were taken into account in the preparation of this proposal. \n\n\nThe Commission has made sure to also take into account the views of relevant stakeholders by closely considering the results of the external evaluation of the Frontex Agency. This external evaluation, which is based on Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2007/2004, was carried out between July 2014 and June 2015, and covers the period from July 2008 to July 2014. The final report was discussed in the Management Board of Frontex on 10 September 2015, and the Management Board has issued recommendations regarding possible modifications to the founding Regulation of Frontex. This proposal reflects the majority of recommendations made by decision of the Management Board on 28 October 2015. \n\n\nThe Commission has also taken into account the Report of the European Parliament on the Special Report of the European Ombudsman in own-initiative inquiry OI/5/2012/BEH-MHZ concerning Frontex in developing a complaint mechanism for the Agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cooperation of the Frontex Agency with EMSA and EFCA which, however, is limited to border surveillance, has been established in the framework of the European Border Surveillance System (Eurosur). This cooperation can now be extended from border surveillance to all coast guard functions, also taking into account the testing of multipurpose missions in selected Frontex-coordinated joint operations (e.g. Indalo).\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nThis draft Regulation responds to the calls of the European Parliament and the European Council to effectively manage the external borders of the European Union. Clear orientations were set out by the European Council in October 2015  to strengthen the external borders of the European Union namely by working towards the establishment of an integrated management system for the external borders and by enhancing the mandate of Frontex in the context of discussions over the development of a European Border and Coast Guard System, including as regards the deployment of Rapid Border Intervention Teams in cases where Schengen evaluations or risk analysis demonstrate the need for robust and prompt action, in cooperation with the Member State concerned. The European Council also considered that the mandate of Frontex on return should be expanded to include the right to organise joint return operations on its own initiative, and enhance its role regarding the acquisition of travel documents for returnees. \n\n\nIn the European Agenda on Migration, the Commission proposed to make the management of the external borders into shared responsibility of the Member States and the European Union. On this basis, the European Agenda on Migration proposed changes to the legal basis of Frontex so as to strengthen its role and capacity. Among the other suggested steps to be taken by the Commission was the foundation of a European Border and Coast Guard, an increased role for the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in the organisation and coordination of returns, inter-agency cooperation, better management of Agency and Member State assets and the initiation of the new \u2018hotspot\u2019 approach.\n\n\nWith this draft Regulation, the Commission contributes to rendering border management more effective and reliable by bringing it to a new level of responsibility and solidarity. Over the past few years, the European Union established a policy to enable Member States to build and maintain sound external borders. However, in the absence of strategic implementation of integrated border management at Union level, there are discrepancies in implementation that still remain at national level among Member States. Hence, there is a need, as identified by the Commission in the European Agenda on Migration, to have Union standards for border management to cover all aspects of the Union\u2019s external border management.\n\n\nThis proposal builds on the existing border management policy, including the Frontex Agency but brings it to a qualitatively different level. Frontex was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 which was subsequently amended by Regulation (EC) 863/2007,  which introduced the rapid border interventions, and by Regulation (EU) No 1168/2011,  which highlighted the responsibility of Frontex as regards the protection of fundamental rights. This proposal substantially expands upon the ability of the Agency to respond effectively to present or future threats at the external borders by proactively reinforcing, assessing, and coordinating the actions of Member States in the implementation of appropriate measures at the external borders.\n\n\nThe proposal complements existing legislation by following a similar approach as the one on the European Border Surveillance System (Eurosur)  in further fostering a spirit of cooperation, information exchange and the coordination of efforts between the Member States and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, as well as among national authorities and Union Agencies, with concrete and binding commitments. It also builds upon Regulation (EU) No 656/2014  establishing rules for the surveillance of the external sea borders in the context of operational cooperation coordinated by Frontex. The proposal also develops and reinforces the rapid border interventions.\n\n\nThe proposal, and in particular the establishment of a vulnerability assessment, complements the Schengen evaluation mechanism established by Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013.  The Schengen evaluation mechanism is intended to maintain mutual trust among Member States. It consists of a technical and legal assessment intended to verify the correct application of the Schengen acquis and the necessary conditions for the lifting of internal border control. In cases where it results from a Schengen evaluation that there are serious deficiencies at the external border, the Commission may recommend initiating the deployment of European Border and Coast Guard Teams or presenting strategic plans to the Agency for its opinion. The present proposal is also without prejudice to the measures which may be adopted under Article 19a and 26 of the Schengen Borders Code.\n\n\nThe vulnerability assessment focuses on prevention so as to avoid reaching a crisis situation. It is an assessment of the operational capabilities of Member States at the external borders and for this purpose it looks into the technical equipment, capacities, resources and contingency plans. That assessment is carried out by the Agency, the Supervisory Board advises the Executive Director, who in turn decides on the necessary measures. Where a Member State would fail to comply with the decision of the Executive Director and as a result it would risk putting in jeopardy the functioning of the Schengen area, the Commission can adopt an implementing decision requiring the direct intervention by the Agency on the ground.\n\n\nThis proposal builds upon and further develops those existing policy provisions and brings them together in the European Border and Coast Guard, thus establishing an integrated management system for external borders at Union level as provided for in Article 77(2)(d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n\nThis proposal is closely linked and complements other Union policies, namely:\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Common European Asylum System with the setting up of migration management support teams at hotspot areas which is closely linked to the relocation of persons in clear need of international protection; \n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Internal security provided that in the European Agenda on Security, the Commission considers that common high standards of border management are considered to be essential to prevent cross-border crime and terrorism; this proposal further contributes to achieving a high level of internal security by enabling the Agency to cover aspects of cross-border crime and terrorism in its risk analysis, by enabling it to process personal data of persons suspected to be involved in acts of terrorism and by providing that the Agency cooperates with other Union Agencies and international organisations on the prevention of terrorism. As regards access to national databases and European databases, the draft Regulation provides for an obligation for Member States to allow access to members of the European Border and Coast Guard Teams to national and European databases. \n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maritime security and safety, as well as maritime surveillance with the establishment of European cooperation on coast guard functions among the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency;\n\n\n(d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0External relations policy of the Union given that the European Border and Coast Guard Agency should facilitate and encourage operational cooperation between Member States and third countries, including by coordinating such operational cooperation in the field of management of external borders and by deploying liaison officers to third countries, as well as by cooperating with the authorities of third countries on return, including as regards the acquisition of travel documents..\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY\n\n\n\n\n\u2611 Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from 2017,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management modes planned\u00a0\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Direct management by the Commission through\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u2611\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2611 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209;\n\n\n\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title\u00a0V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe Agency is subject to regular monitoring and reporting requirments. The Management Board of the Agency shall adopt each year a consolidated annual activity of the Agency for the previous year and forward it by 1 July at the latest to the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Court of Auditors. This report shall be made public. Every three years, the Commission shall conduct an evaluation in accordance with the evaluation criteria of the Commission guidelines to assess particularly the impact, effectiveness and efficiency of the Agency\u2019s performance and its working practices in relation to its objectives, mandate and tasks. The evaluation shall, in particular, address the possible need to modify the mandate of the Agency, and the financial implications of any such modification \n\n\nOn the occasion of every second evaluation, there shall also be an assessment of the results achieved by the Agency having regard to its objectives, mandate and tasks. If, on the basis of its evaluation, the Commission considers that the continuation of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency is no longer justified with regard to its assigned objectives, mandate and tasks, it may propose that this Regulation be amended accordingly or repealed.\n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risks identified \n\n\n\nThe high migratory pressure on the external borders of the European Union requires a creation of the European Borders Guard composed of the Member States's authorities and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. An extension of the competences of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency is also necessary as compared with the mandate of the existing Frontex Agency. \n\n\nReinforcement of the Agency's staffing and financial resources is necessary in order to comply with the extended mandate and requirements laid down by the proposed Regulation.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Control methods envisaged \n\n\n\nThe Agency\u2019s accounts will be submitted for the approval of the Court of Auditors, and subject to the discharge procedure. The Commission\u2019s Internal Audit Service will carry out audits in cooperation with the Agency's internal auditor. \n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\nFor the Agency\n\n\nThe Executive Directive will implement the Agency\u2019s budget. He/she will each year submit to the Commission, the Management Board and the Court of Auditors the detailed accounts of all revenue and expenditure from the previous financial year. In addition, the Commission\u2019s Internal Audit Service will assist in the management of the Agency\u2019s financial operations by controlling risks, monitoring compliance by providing an independent opinion on the quality of management and control systems and making recommendations in order to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of operations and to ensure economy in the use of the Agency\u2019s resources.\n\n\n\nThe Agency will adopt its Financial Regulation following Regulation No 1271/2013, after having received the agreement of the Commission and the Court of Auditors. The Agency will put in place an internal audit system similar to that introduced by the Commission in the framework of its own restructuring.\n\n\n\nCooperation with OLAF\n\n\nThe staff subject to the Commission\u2019s Staff Regulations will cooperate with OLAF to combat fraud.\n\n\n\nFor the Court of Auditors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Court of Auditors will examine the accounts in accordance with Article 248 of the Treaty and publish an annual report on the Agency\u2019s activities.\n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n3.1.Headings of the multiannual financial framework
