For preferential treatment the products should be transported directly between the two Parties but may under certain conditions pass via a third country.\n\n\nChile and the European Union have agreed to introduce certain amendments to the rules of direct transport contained in Article 12 of Annex III to the Agreement. The aim is to clarify that when a consignment passes via a third country, and subject to fulfilling the conditions in Article 12, a consignment may be split for onward transport to a Party of the Agreement without affecting the preferential treatment of those products. Moreover, the splitting of consignments should not of itself give rise to doubt as to the origin of the products unless there is evidence to the contrary.    \n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nArticle 207(4) first subparagraph in conjunction with Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n The proposal does not go beyond what is necessary or appropriate to achieve the expected objectives.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nNot relevant. This proposal introduces amendments to a previous text.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThere was no need for external expertise.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nNot relevant. This proposal introduces amendments to an existing bilateral trade agreement. There are no other options to be considered.\n\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union budget.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\nNone\n\n\n2015/0145 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union within the EU-Chile Association Committee relating to Article 12 of Annex III to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part, concerning direct transport\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Association Council set up by Article 3 to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part, (EU-Chile Association Agreement) is established to examine and adopt proposals from the Parties for the improvement of the EU-Chile Association Agreement.

The conditions for transport via a third country have been clarified to expressly allow for the splitting of consignments but without any relaxation of the existing restrictions.\n\n\n(4)The amendment to Article 12 of Annex III to the EU-Chile Association Agreement will provide legal certainty to importers and exporters, and consistency of interpretation for the Parties.\n\n\n(5)The position of the Union within the EU-Chile Association Committee should be based on the attached draft decision,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position to be adopted by the Union within the Association Committee relating to Article 12 of Annex III to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part, shall be based on the attached draft decision of the Association Committee.\n\n\n\n\nMinor changes to the draft decision of the Association Committee may be agreed to by the representatives of the Union in the Association Committee without further decision of the Council.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision of the Association Committee shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 13.7.2015\nCOM(2015) 333 final\nANNEX\nAttachment\nto the\nproposal for a Council Decision\n\non the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union within the EU-Chile Association Committee relating to Article 12 of Annex III to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part, concerning direct transport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft\n\n\nDECISION No \u2026 OF THE EU-CHILE ASSOCIATION COMMITTEE\n\n\nof\n\n\namending article 12 of Title III of Annex III to the Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Chile concerning direct transport\n\n\n\nTHE ASSOCIATION COMMITTEE,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Union and the Republic of Chile, and in particular Article 38 of Annex III;\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 12 of Title III of Annex III establishes that preferential treatment applies only to goods satisfying the requirements of Annex III which are transported directly between Chile and the European Union,\n\n\n(2)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chile and the European Union have concluded numerous agreements with trade content since the entry into force of the Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Chile, which gave economic operators the possibility to adapt their export strategy in order to save costs and better respond to market demand,\n\n\n(3)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chile and the European Union have agreed to amend the provisions of article 12 of Title III of Annex III, in order to allow for more flexibility for economic operators. \n\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nArticle 12 of Title III of Annex III concerning direct transport is replaced with the text set out in the Annex to this Decision. \n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force ninety (90) days after the day of the last notification on which the Parties communicate the completion of the necessary domestic legal procedures.\n\n\nDone at\u2026\n\n\nFor the Association Committee\n\n\nThe President\n\n\nAnnex\n\n\n\n\nArticle 12\n\n\nDirect Transport\n\n\n1.
