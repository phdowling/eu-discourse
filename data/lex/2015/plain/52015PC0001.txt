Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1006/2008 of 29 September 2008 (Fishing Authorisation Regulation)[1], and in particular\r\nArticle 21 thereof, presupposes the existence of an international fisheries\r\nagreement when granting fishing authorisations to third-country vessels within\r\nEU waters. The EU has not concluded such an international fisheries agreement\r\nwith Venezuela. \nHowever, in view of the economic and social\r\nimportance of these fishing activities, and as the Council and the Commission considered\r\ntheir discontinuation inappropriate, a different practice has been followed,\r\nwhereby access for Venezuelan fishing vessels operating in EU waters off the\r\ncoast of the French department of Guiana has been provided in the form of a\r\nCouncil Declaration which, in accordance with the case-law of the International\r\nCourt of Justice, has legal effects under international law. \nThis international instrument is not\r\nconfined to the mere granting of fishing opportunities to foreign vessels but\r\nis rather designed to furnish an international basis for making access subject\r\nto a quid pro quo (e.g. the requirement to land a certain proportion of the\r\ncatches into French Guiana) and for imposing an array of conservation and\r\ncontrol measures upon the vessels in question (e.g. specific fishing gear,\r\nlog-book and observer coverage requirements). In this mechanism, it is the TAC\r\nand Quota Regulation that provides in its Annex for a certain number of fishing\r\nauthorisations to be granted to Venezuelan vessels operating in French Guiana waters.\nBy its judgement of 26 November 2014 on the\r\njoined cases C-103/12 and C-165/12 (European Parliament and the Commission v.\r\nCouncil), the Court of Justice annulled Council Decision 2012/19/EU of 16\r\nDecember 2011 on the Declaration on the granting of fishing opportunities in EU\r\nwaters to Venezuelan fishing vessels in the exclusive economic zone off the\r\ncoast of French Guiana: the Court of Justice clearly confirmed that decisions\r\nrelating to the conclusion of external fisheries agreements fall fully within\r\nthe scope of Article 43(2) TFEU (in conjunction with the applicable procedure\r\nof Article 218 TFEU, i.e. Article 218(6)a(v) for the decisions on the\r\nconclusion) and rejected the position that such decisions could fall within the\r\nscope of Article 43(3) TFEU. \nThe Court of Justice maintained the effects\r\nof the Council Decision until the entry into force, within a reasonable period\r\nof time after the date of the judgement, of a new decision to be adopted on an\r\nappropriate legal basis. Hence, the present proposal.\nThe proposal does not have budgetary\r\nimplications.\n2015/0001 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nOn the approval, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, of the Declaration on the granting of fishing opportunities in EU waters\r\nto fishing vessels flying the flag of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in\r\nthe exclusive economic zone off the coast of French Guiana\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43 paragraph 2\r\nin conjunction with Article 218, paragraph 6 a) v) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subject to their compliance with the applicable legally\r\nbinding Union acts on the conservation and management of fishery resources,\r\nfishing vessels flying the flag of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (hereinafter\r\n\u201cVenezuela\u201d) have operated in EU waters in the exclusive economic zone off the\r\ncoast of French Guiana for many decades.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The processing industry\r\nbased in the French Guiana depends on the landings from those fishing vessels\r\nand therefore the continuity of those operations should be ensured.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 16 December 2011 the Council\r\nadopted Council Decision 2012/19/EU on the Declaration on the granting of\r\nfishing opportunities in EU waters to Venezuelan fishing vessels in the\r\nexclusive economic zone off the coast of French Guiana[2] which was annulled by the\r\njudgement of the Court of Justice of 26 November 2014[3] which its effects\r\nmainatained for a reasonable time. In order to ensure the continuity of the\r\naccess following the judgement of the Court it is necessary that the Council\r\nre-adopts a Decision on the declaration addressed to Venezuela confirming its\r\nreadiness to issue fishing authorisations to a limited number of fishing vessels\r\nflying the flag of Venezuela on the condition that they comply with the\r\napplicable legally binding Union acts, and, as the Declaration had already been\r\nnotified, there is no need to notify again,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe Declaration addressed to the Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela by the European Union on the granting of fishing\r\nopportunities in EU waters to fishing vessels flying the flag of the Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela in the exclusive economic zone off the coast of the French\r\nGuiana (hereinafter \u201cthe Declaration\u201d) is hereby approved on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union.\nThe text of the Declaration is attached to\r\nthis Decision.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\nthird day following that of its publication in the Official\nJournal of the European Union.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 33.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 6, 10.1.2012, p. 8.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Joined cases C-103 and 165/12, European Parliament\r\nand Commission v.
