After signing the political chapters of the\r\nEU-Ukraine Association Agreement at the EU summit of 21 March 2014, both\r\nparties signed the remaining sections of the Agreement - including the Deep and\r\nComprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) - in the margins of the EU summit of 27\r\nJune 2014. On 16 September 2014, the Association Agreement was ratified by the\r\nUkrainian Parliament and consent was given by the European Parliament, enabling\r\nthe provisional application of the relevant provisions of the Association\r\nAgreement as of 1 November 2014, and the DCFTA-part as of 1 January 2016.\u00a0 \nIn order to\r\nensure that the EU and Ukraine would be able to enjoy the full benefits of the\r\nAgreement, starting with its partial provisional application, the Association\r\nAgenda (earlier version) was adopted by the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council on\r\n23 November 2009. Its operational part was amended several times and the last\r\nupdate was endorsed by the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council in Luxembourg, on 24\r\nJune 2013. \nGiven recent\r\ndevelopments - the provisional application of the Association Agreement and the\r\nurgent need for reforms in Ukraine - it became an important political priority\r\nto update the Association Agenda so as to reflect the current state of play of\r\nthe relations between the EU and Ukraine. \nThe aim of the\r\nAssociation Agenda is to prepare and facilitate the implementation of the\r\nAssociation Agreement, by creating a practical\r\nframework through which the overall objectives of political association and\r\neconomic integration can be realised and by providing a list of priorities for\r\njoint work on a sector by sector basis. \nThe Association\r\nAgenda is also a vehicle for monitoring and assessment of Ukraine\u2019s progress in\r\nimplementing the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, achieving\r\nthe overall objectives of political association and economic integration, ensuring respect\r\nfor common values, and converging with the EU's acquis in specific areas, as\r\nforeseen in the Association Agreement.\nThe fact that\r\nthe Association Agenda focuses on a more limited number of priorities does not\r\naffect the scope or the mandate of existing dialogues under the PCA or other\r\nagreements nor should it prejudge the implementation of\r\nthe commitments made in the Association Agreement/DCFTA. \nThe High Representative of the European\r\nUnion for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission request the\r\nCouncil to adopt the draft Council Decision attached.\n2015/0038 (NLE)\nJoint Proposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the Union position within

and\r\nfacilitate the implementation of the Association Agreement through creating a\r\npractical framework to realise their overriding objectives of political\r\nassociation and economic integration. \n(5)         \r\nThe Association Agenda serves the dual purpose\r\nof setting out concrete steps in bringing the fulfilment of the Parties'\r\nobligations set out in the Association Agreement, and of

Association Agenda set out in the Annex,\r\ninsofar as such implementation is directed towards attainment of the objectives\r\nof the Association Agreement between the European\r\nUnion, the European Atomic Energy Community and its Member States, of the one\r\npart and Ukraine, of the other part.\nDone at [\u2026]\nFor the Association Council\nThe President\nANNEX 2\nANNEX 2\r\n\nEU-Ukraine Association Agenda\nto prepare and facilitate the implementation of the\r\nAssociation Agreement\r\n\nI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strategic part \nThe European\r\nUnion and Ukraine ('the Parties') recognise that the context of their relations\r\nhas changed in a significant and positive way. Relations between the EU and\r\nUkraine are currently based on those parts of the Association Agreement which\r\nare provisionally applied, on the parts of the Partnership and Co-operation\r\nAgreement (PCA) remaining in force, as well as on the\r\nEuropean Neighborhood Policy framework. The Parties\r\nhave also developed and launched a Visa Liberalisation Action Plan, the\r\nsuccessful implementation of which is a fundamental element underpinning the\r\npolitical association and economic integration of Ukraine with the European\r\nUnion set out in the Association Agreement, namely regarding the substantial\r\nenhancement of mobility and people-to-people contacts.\nThe Parties\r\nbegan negotiations of an Association Agreement in 2007, and of a Deep and\r\nComprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), to form an integral part of that\r\nAgreement, in 2008. The negotiations of the Association Agreement were\r\nfinalised on 19 December 2011, and the Agreement was initialled on 30 March\r\n2012, followed by the DCFTA-part of the Agreement on 19 July 2012. After\r\nsigning the political chapters of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement at the\r\nEU summit of 21 March 2014, both parties signed the remaining sections of the\r\nAgreement - including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) - in\r\nthe margins of the EU summit of 27 June 2014. \nOn 16 September\r\n2014, the Association Agreement was ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament and\r\nconsent was given by the European Parliament, enabling the provisional application\r\nof the relevant provisions of the Association Agreement on 1 November 2014, and\r\nthe DCFTA-part on 1 January 2016.\u00a0 \nAction is needed\r\nto ensure that the Parties are able to enjoy the full benefits of the Agreement\r\nstarting with its partial provisional application. The aim of the present\r\nAssociation Agenda is to prepare and facilitate the implementation of the\r\nAssociation Agreement, by creating a practical framework through which the\r\noverall objectives of political association and economic integration can be\r\nrealised and by providing a list of priorities for joint work on sector by\r\nsector basis. The fact that it focuses on a limited number of priorities should\r\nnot affect the scope or the mandate of existing dialogues under the Partnership\r\nand Cooperation Agreement, other relevant Agreements or under the multilateral\r\ntrack of the Eastern Partnership, as well as scope and\r\nmandate of future dialogues under the Association Agreement, in particular should\r\nnot prejudge implementation of commitments made in the AA/DCFTA once it enters\r\ninto force or is provisionally applied.\nII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Principles, instruments\r\nand resources for implementing the Association Agenda\nThe following\r\ncommon principles will guide the implementation of the Association Agenda:\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe Association Agenda is a practical instrument aimed to\r\nprepare and facilitate the full implementation of the EU-Ukraine Association\r\nAgreement as well as the achievement of the overall objectives of political association and economic integration;\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe priorities for action of the Association\r\nAgenda complement the responsibilities of the Parties to implement the\r\nprovisionally applied parts of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement and to\r\nimplement all its provisions once it enters into force, as well as to consolidate the Parties\u2019 common\r\nunderstanding of actions needed for further deepening\r\nof political association and economic\r\nintegration;\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe priorities for action of the Association\r\nAgenda should be defined taking into account the structure of the institutional\r\nframework as set out in the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement acknowledging the\r\nrespective duties and responsibilities of each body, namely as regards Parliamentary Association Committee and Civil Society Platform;\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe Association Agenda should be implemented in\r\nfull respect of the principles of transparency, accountability and\r\ninclusiveness;\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe Association Agenda involves an engagement\r\nfrom both sides in its implementation; \n\u00b7                        \r\nThe Association Agenda aims to achieve tangible\r\nand defined results through the progressive implementation of practical\r\nmeasures;\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe Parties recognise the importance of\r\nsupporting the agreed priorities through appropriate and sufficient political,\r\ntechnical and financial means; and\n\u00b7                        \r\nThis Association Agenda is the principal vehicle for the monitoring and assessment of Ukraine\u2019s progress in the implementation of the EU-Ukraine\r\nAssociation Agreement as well as for the monitoring and assessment of the achievement of the overall\r\nobjectives of political association and economic integration in general, in particular\r\nregarding Ukraine's track record in ensuring respect for common values, and\r\nprogress in achieving convergence with the EU in political, economic and legal\r\nareas. The implementation of the Association Agenda\r\nwill be subject to and part of annual\r\nreporting, monitoring and assessment. Progress made will be reviewed within the\r\nstructures created under the Association Agreement, the Partnership and\r\nCooperation Agreement or other relevant Agreements. In\r\nthis process the Parties will aim to reach, so far as is possible, an overall\r\ncommon assessment of annual progress made.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe European\r\nUnion will support Ukraine in implementing the objectives and priorities set\r\nout in the Association Agenda. It will do so through using all available\r\nsources of EU support, as well as expertise and advice, best practices and know\r\nhow, the sharing of information, including the\r\nprovision of advice and a structured process of approximation to EU acquis, support to capacity-building and institutional strengthening.\u00a0 In\r\nthis context, Ukraine is to make full use of the role of the EU Advisory\r\nMission for Civilian Security Sector Reform as part of the overall EU\r\ncontribution to the reform process. It will also encourage and seek\r\ncoordination of support from other partners of Ukraine. The relevant EU\r\nfinancial instruments will also be available to help in the implementation of\r\nthe Association Agenda. Notwithstanding this, the latter is not in itself a\r\nfinancial programming document and does not substitute for the programming or\r\nformulation exercises undertaken by the Parties.\nEU support will\r\nbe provided in the context of the overall priorities for assistance in favour\r\nof Ukraine, as outlined in the multi-year programming under the European\r\nNeighbourhood Instrument (ENI) as part of the overall funding available for\r\nUkraine and in full respect of the relevant implementation rules and procedures\r\nof EU external assistance.\u00a0 \nIn the period\r\n2007 - 2013, the EU committed EUR 1.0056 billion for bilateral assistance to\r\nUkraine, focusing mainly on Support for democratic development and good\r\ngovernance, Support for regulatory reform and administrative capacity building,\r\nSupport for infrastructure development (National Indicative Programme\r\n2007-2010) and on Good governance and the rule of law, Facilitation of the\r\nentry into force of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement including DCFTA,\r\nSustainable development (National Indicative Programme 2011-2013). Several\r\nproject funded under this framework are still under implementation.\nThe indicative\r\nfinancial allocation for bilateral assistance to Ukraine in the period\r\n2014-2020 is between EUR 828 million to EUR 1.013 billion. As the other ENI\r\ncountries, Ukraine can also benefit from additional allocations from the\r\numbrella programme.\nIn 2014, in\r\nresponse to the fast moving events in Ukraine and the urgent need to mobilise\r\nconsiderable assistance to contribute to the stabilisation and development of\r\nthe country, the EU adopted a EUR 365 million Special Measure, including a EUR\r\n355 million State Building Contract and a EUR 10 million support programme to\r\ncivil society.\nFor 2015, a possible Special Measure could focus on private\r\nsector development and recovery actions. EU bilateral assistance should be\r\nincluded in the Single Support Framework (SSF) as a/the\r\nresult of the forthcoming multi-annual programming exercise for the period\r\n2016-2017, depending on the situation on the ground.\nCivil society, in particular the EU-Ukraine Civil Society\r\nPlatform, as well as the Parliamentary Association\r\nCommittee, will also be\r\nencouraged to focus their monitoring activities on the Association Agenda. This\r\nAssociation Agenda may be amended or updated at any time as necessary by\r\nagreement of the EU-Ukraine Association Council.\nIII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Operational part\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Short-term Priorities for\r\nAction \nThe Association Committee as set\r\nup by the Association Agreement will define priorities for action and provide\r\nguidance for the implementation of the Association Agenda in line with the\r\nprovisions set up in section III 8 below.\nAmong the priorities in the\r\nAssociation Agenda, the following short-term reform actions should be addressed\r\nas a matter of priority:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00b7              \r\nConstitutional reform\nRe-start constitutional reform through an\r\ninclusive and participatory process including active consultations with civil\r\nsociety and in line with the Venice Commission recommendations, including\r\nlegislative steps towards amending the constitution, enabling decentralisation\r\nreform and the reform of the judiciary;\n\u00b7              \r\nElection reform \nTake steps towards harmonisation of electoral\r\nlegislation through its unification and reform of political party financing,\r\nincluding state financing.
