In 2013, total waste generation in the EU amounted to approximately 2.5 billion tons of which 1.6 billion tons were not reused or recycled and therefore lost for the European economy. It is estimated that an additional 600 million tons could be recycled or reused. By way of example, only a limited share (43%) of the municipal waste generated in the Union was recycled, with the rest being landfilled (31%) or incinerated (26%). The Union thus misses out on significant opportunities to improve resource efficiency and create a more circular economy. \n\n\nWith respect to waste management, the Union also faces large differences amongst its Member States. In 2011, while six Member States landfilled less than 3% of their municipal waste, 18 landfilled over 50%, with some exceeding 90%. This uneven situation needs to be redressed as a matter of urgency.\n\n\nThe proposals to amend Directive 2008/98/EC on waste\n1\n, Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste\n2\n, Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste\n3\n, Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles\n4\n, Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators\n5\n and Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment\n6\n form part of a Circular Economy Package which also includes a Commission Communication \"Closing the loop \u2013 An EU action plan for the Circular Economy\".\n\n\n1.2Grounds for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nRecent trends suggest that further progress on resource efficiency is possible and that it can bring major economic, environmental and social benefits. Turning waste into a resource is an essential part of increasing resource efficiency and closing the loop in a circular economy.\n\n\nThe legally binding targets in EU waste legislation have been a key driver to improve waste management practices, stimulate innovation in recycling, limit the use of landfilling, and create incentives to change consumer behaviour. Taking waste policy further can bring significant benefits: sustainable growth and job creation, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, direct savings linked with better waste management practices, and a better environment.\n\n\nThe proposal to amend Directive 2008/98/EC responds to the legal obligation to review the waste management targets in that Directive. The proposals which form part of the Circular Economy Package and amend the six Directives mentioned above build in part on the proposal that the Commission tabled in July 2014 and subsequently withdrew in December 2014. They are in line with the objectives of the Resource Efficiency Roadmap\n7\n and the 7th Environment Action Programme\n8\n, including full implementation of the waste hierarchy\n9\n in all Member States, decline in absolute and per capita waste generation, ensuring high quality recycling and the use of recycled waste as a major, reliable source of raw materials for the Union. They also contribute to the implementation of the EU Raw Materials Initiative\n10\n and .address the need to prevent food waste. In addition, these proposals simplify the reporting requirements included in all six Directives.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\n\n2.1Studies\n\n\nThe proposals and the accompanying impact assessment assess technological, socio-economic and cost-benefit aspects related to the implementation and further development of EU waste legislation. A supplement to the Impact Assessment was produced to analyse the potential effects of additional variants of the main policy options defined in the Impact Assessment.\n\n\n2.2Internal consultation\n\n\nWithin the Commission an Impact Assessment Steering Group composed of various Commission services (SG, ECFIN, GROW, CLIMA, JRC, and ESTAT) followed the preparation of the legislative proposals. \n\n\n2.3External consultation\n\n\nAn indicative list of issues to be tackled was developed by the Commission and the first interviews with key stakeholders started in February 2013. An online public consultation in line with the minimum standards for consultation was launched in June 2013, closing in September 2013. 670 responses were submitted, reflecting high public concern about the waste management situation in the EU and high expectations for EU action in this area. A specific consultation of Member States was held between June and September 2015 as well as a broader consultation on the circular economy. \n\n\n2.4Impact assessment\n\n\n\n\nAn impact assessment report and an executive summary were published together with the proposal adopted in July 2014\n11\n. The impact assessment, which remains valid as the main analytical basis for the revised legislative proposals, evaluates the main environmental, social and economic impacts of various policy options to improve waste management in the EU. Various levels of ambition are assessed and compared to a \"baseline scenario\" in order to identify the most appropriate instruments and targets while minimizing costs and maximizing benefits.\n\n\nThe Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment Board delivered a positive opinion on the impact assessment on 8 April 2014, while making a number of recommendations to fine-tune the report. The Board requested to further clarify the problem definition and the need for new mid-term targets, strengthen the arguments in favour of a landfill ban from a subsidiarity and proportionality point of view and of uniform targets for all Member States, and explain in more detail how the varying performances of Member States are taken into account in the proposal.\n\n\nThe impact assessment led to the conclusion that a combination of Options will bring the following benefits: \n\n\n\u2013Administrative burden reduction in particular for small establishments or undertakings, simplification and better  implementation including by keeping targets \u2018fit for purpose\u2019;\n\n\n\u2013Job creation \u2013 more than 170.000 direct jobs could be created by 2035, most of them impossible to delocalize outside the EU; \n\n\n\u2013GHG emission reduction \u2013 more than 600 millions of tons of green house gas could be avoided between 2015 and 2035;\n\n\n\u2013Positive effects on the competitiveness of the EU waste management and recycling sectors as well as on the EU manufacturing sector (better extended producer responsibility schemes, reduced risks associated with raw material access);\n\n\n\u2013Reinjection into the EU economy of secondary raw materials which in turn will reduce the dependency of the EU on raw materials imports.\n\n\nAn analytical note supplementing the impact assessment was issued together with the legislative proposal. In this note, a number of additional options and variants were analysed with the aim to better take into account the different starting positions of each Member State.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSALS\n\n\n3.1Summary of the proposed action\n\n\nThe main elements of the proposals to amend EU waste legislation are: \n\n\n\u2013Alignment of definitions;\n\n\n\u2013Increase of the preparing for re-use and recycling target for municipal waste to 65% by 2030; \n\n\n\u2013Increase of the preparing for reuse and recycling targets for packaging waste and the simplification of the set of targets;\n\n\n\u2013Gradual limitation of the landfilling of municipal waste to 10% by 2030; \n\n\n\u2013Greater harmonisation and simplification of the legal framework on by-products and end-of-waste status;\n\n\n\u2013New measures to promote prevention, including for food waste, and re-use; \n\n\n\u2013Introduction of minimum operating conditions for Extended Producer Responsibility;\n\n\n\u2013Introduction of an Early Warning System for monitoring compliance with the recycling targets;\n\n\n\n\n\u2013Simplification and streamlining of reporting obligations;\n\n\n\u2013Alignment to Articles 290 and 291 TFEU on delegated and implementing acts.\n\n\n3.2Legal basis and right to act\n\n\nThe proposals amend six Directives addressing the management of different wastes. The proposals to amend Directive 2008/98/EC, Directive 1999/31/EC, Directive 2000/53/EC, Directive 2006/66/EC and Directive 2012/19/EU are based on Article 192(1) TFEU, whilst the proposal to amend Directive 94/62/EC is based on Article 114 TFEU. \n\n\nArticle 11(2) of Directive 2008/98/EC sets down a 50% target for preparing for re-use and recycling of household and similar waste and a 70% target for preparing for re-use, recycling and other material recovery of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste by 2020. Pursuant to Article 11(4), by 31 December 2014 at the latest, the Commission had to examine those targets with a view to, if necessary, reinforcing them and considering the setting of targets for other waste streams, taking into account the relevant environmental, economic and social impacts of setting the targets. According to Article 9(c), the Commission had to set, by the end of 2014, waste prevention and decoupling objectives for 2020, based on best available practices including, if necessary, a revision of the indicators referred to in Article 29(4). Finally, pursuant to Article 37(4), in the first report that intervenes by 12 December 2014, the Commission had to assess a number of measures including producer responsibility schemes for specific waste streams, targets, indicators and measures related to recycling, as well as material and energy recovery operations that may contribute to fulfilling the objectives set in Articles 1 and 4 more effectively.\n\n\nArticle 5(2) of Directive 1999/31/EC sets down three targets for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfills and bans the landfilling of certain waste streams. The last target for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfills has to be met by the Member States by 16 July 2016. Pursuant to Article 5(2), it shall be re-examined by 16 July 2014 with a view to confirming or amending it in order to ensure a high level of environmental protection and in light of the practical experience gained by Member States in the pursuance of the two previous targets.\n\n\nArticle 6(1) of Directive 94/62/EC sets down targets for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste which, pursuant to Article 6(5), shall be fixed every five years based on the practical experience gained in Member States and the findings of scientific research and evaluation techniques such as life-cycle assessments and cost-benefit analysis.\n\n\n3.3Subsidiarity and proportionality principle\n\n\nThe proposals are in conformity with the subsidiarity and proportionality principles set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union. They are limited to amending the abovementioned Directives by providing a framework establishing shared objectives, while leaving Member States free to decide about precise implementation methods.\n\n\n3.4Explanatory documents\n\n\nThe Commission considers that documents explaining Member States' measures transposing the Directives are necessary in order to improve the quality of information on the transposition of the Directives.\n\n\nWaste legislation is often transposed in a highly decentralised manner in the Member States, including on the regional or local level and in multiple legal acts, depending on the administrative structure of a Member State. As a result, in transposing the amended Directives Member States may have to amend a wide variety of legislative acts at national, regional and local levels.\n\n\nThe proposals amend six different waste Directives and affects an important number of legally binding obligations, including a comprehensive amendment of the targets contained in Directive 2008/98/EC, Directive 1999/31/EC and Directive 94/62/EC and a simplification of Directive 2000/53/EC, Directive 2006/66/EC and Directive 2012/19/EU. This is a complex review of waste legislation that will potentially affect a number of pieces of national legislation.\n\n\nThe revised targets for waste management contained in the amended Directives are inter-connected, and should be carefully transposed into national legislation and later on incorporated into national waste management systems.\n\n\nThe proposed provisions will affect a wide range of private and public stakeholders in the Member States and will have an important impact on future investments in waste management infrastructure. The complete and correct transposition of the new legislation is essential to guarantee that their objectives (i.e. protecting human health and the environment, increased resource efficiency, and ensuring the functioning of the internal market and avoiding obstacles to trade and restriction of competition within the EU) are achieved.\n\n\nThe requirement to provide explanatory documents may create an additional administrative burden on some Member States. However, explanatory documents are necessary to allow effective verification of complete and correct transposition, which is essential for the reasons mentioned above, and there are no less burdensome measures to allow efficient verification. Moreover, explanatory documents can contribute significantly to reducing the administrative burden of compliance monitoring by the Commission; without them, considerable resources and numerous contacts with national authorities would be required to track the methods of transposition in all Member States. \n\n\nIn view of the above it is appropriate to ask Member States to accompany the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the provisions of the Directives amending EU waste legislation and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.\n\n\n3.5Delegated and implementing powers of the Commission\n\n\nThe delegated and implementing powers of the Commission are identified and the corresponding procedures for adoption of these acts are established in paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 21, 22 of Article 1 of the proposal concerning Directive 2008/98/EC, paragraphs 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 of Article 1 of the proposal concerning Directive 94/62/EC, paragraphs 6 and 7 of Article 1 of the proposal concerning Directive 1999/31/EC and the amendments proposed in Articles 1 and 3 of the proposal concerning Directives 2000/53/EC and 2012/19/EU.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\n\n\n\n\nThe proposals will not have an impact on the European Union budget and is therefore not accompanied by the financial statement provided for under Article 31 of the Financial Regulation (Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No1605/2002).\n\n\n2015/0274 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n12\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n13\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Waste management in the Union should be improved, with a view to protecting, preserving and improving the quality of the environment, protecting human health, ensuring prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources and promoting a more circular economy.\n\n\n(2)The targets laid down in Council Directive 1999/31/EC\n14\n setting landfill restrictions should be amended to make them better reflect the Union's ambition to move to a circular economy and make progress in the implementation of the Raw Materials Initiative\n15\n\u00a0by reducing landfilling of waste destined for landfills for non-hazardous waste.\n\n\n(3)To ensure that targets are set based on available data and to enable proper monitoring, municipal waste should be clearly defined in line with the definition used for statistical purposes by the European Statistical Office and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, on the basis of which Member States have been reporting data for several years.\n\n\n(4)In order to ensure greater coherence in waste legislation, the definitions in Directives 1999/31/EC should be aligned to those of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n16\n.\n\n\n(5)Clear environmental, economic and social benefits would be derived from further restricting landfilling, starting with waste streams that are subject to separate collection (e.g. plastics, metals, glass, paper, bio-waste). Technical, environmental or economical feasibility of recycling or other recovery of residual waste resulting from separately collected waste should be taken into account in the implementation of these landfill restrictions.\n\n\n(6)Biodegradable municipal waste accounts for a large proportion of municipal waste. Landfilling of untreated biodegradable waste poses significant negative enviornmental effects in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution of surface water, groundwater, soil and air. While Directive 1999/31/EC already sets landfill diversion targets for biodegradable waste it is appropriate to put in place further restrictions on the landfilling of biodegradable waste by prohibiting the landfilling of biodegradable waste that has been separately collected in accordance with Article 22 of Directive 2008/98/EC.\n\n\n\n\n(7)Many Member States have not yet completely developed the necessary waste management infrastructure. The setting of landfill reduction targets will further facilitate separate collection, sorting and recycling of waste and avoid locking potentially recyclable materials at the bottom of the waste hierarchy. \n\n\n(8)A progressive reduction of landfilling is necessary to prevent detrimental impacts on human health and the environment and to ensure that economically valuable waste materials are gradually and effectively recovered through proper waste management and in line with the waste hierarchy. This reduction should avoid the development of excessive capacity for the treatment of residual waste facilities, such as through energy recovery or low grade mechanical biological treatment of untreated municipal waste, as this could result in undermining the achievement of the Union's long-term preparation for reuse and recycling targets for municipal waste as laid down in Article 11 of Directive 2008/98/EC.\u00a0Similarly, and to prevent detrimental impacts on human health and the environment, while Member States should take all necessary measures to ensure that only waste that has been subject to treatment is landfilled, compliance with such obligation should not lead to the creation of overcapacities for the treatment of residual municipal waste. In addition, in order to ensure consistency between the targets laid down in Article 11 of Directive 2008/98/EC and the landfill reduction target defined in Article 5 of this Directive and to ensure a coordinated planning of the infrastructures\u00a0and investments needed to meet those targets, Member States which may obtain additional time for the attainment of the municipal waste recycling targets should also be given additional time to attain the landfill reduction target for 2030 as laid down in this Directive.\n\n\n(9)In order to ensure better, timelier, and more uniform implementation of this Directive and anticipate implementation weaknesses, an early warning system should be established to detect shortcomings and allow taking action ahead of the deadlines for meeting the targets.\n\n\n(10)Implementation reports prepared by Member States every three years have not proved to be an effective tool for verifying compliance and ensuring correct implementation, and are generating unnecessary administrative burden. It is therefore appropriate to repeal provisions obliging Member States to produce such reports and for compliance monitoring purposes use exclusively the statistical data which Member States report every year to the Commission.\n\n\n(11)Statistical data reported by Member States are essential for the Commission to assess compliance with waste legislation across the Member States. The quality, reliability and comparability of statistics should be improved by introducing a single entry point for all waste data, deleting obsolete reporting requirements, benchmarking national reporting methodologies and introducing a data quality check report. Reliable reporting of statistical data concerning waste management is paramount to efficient implementation and to ensuring comparability of data among Member States. Therefore, when preparing the reports on compliance with the targets set out in Directive 19991/31/EC, Member States should be required to use the most recent methodology developed by the Commission and the national statistical offices of the Member States.\n\n\n(12)In order to supplement or amend Directive 1999/31/EC, in particular with the view to adapting its Annexes to scientific and technical progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of Article 16. It is particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. Any amendments to the Annexes should only be made in line with the principles laid down in this Directive. To this end, as regards Annex II, the Commission should take into account the general principles and general procedures for testing and acceptance criteria as set out in Annex II. Moreover, specific criteria and test methods and associated limit values should be set for each class of landfill, including if necessary specific types of landfill within each class, including underground storage. Proposals for the standardisation of control, sampling and analysis methods in relation to the Annexes should be considered for adoption by the Commission  where appropriate within two years after the entry into force of this Directive.\n\n\n(13)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Directive 1999/31/EC, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of Articles 3(3), Annex I, paragraph 3.5 and Annex II, paragraph 5. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n17\n.\n\n\n(14)Directive 1999/31/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n\n(15)In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents\n18\n, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified.\n\n\n(16)Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to improve the management of waste in the Union, and thereby contributing to the protection, preservation and improvement of the quality of the environment and to the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the measures, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives, \n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nAmendments\n\n\nDirective 1999/31/EC is amended as follows:\n\n\n(1) Article 2 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(a) point (a) is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\n'(a) the definitions of \u2018waste\u2019, \u2018municipal waste\u2019, \u2018hazardous waste\u2019, \u2018waste producer\u2019, \u2018waste holder\u2019,\u2018waste management\u2019, \u2018separate collection\u2019, \u2018recovery\u2019, \u2018recycling\u2019 and \u2018disposal\u2019 laid down in Article 3 of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(*) shall apply;\n\n\n\n(*) Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives (OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3).';\n\n\n(b) points (b), (c), (d) and (n) are deleted;\n\n\n\n\n(2) Article 5 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(a) in paragraph 2 the following sentence is deleted: \n\n\n'Two years before the date referred to in paragraph c) the Council shall reexamine the above target, on the basis of a report from the Commission on the practical experience gained by Member States in the pursuance of the targets laid down in paragraph a) and b) accompanied, if appropriate, by a proposal with a view to confirming or amending this target in order to ensure a high level of environmental protection.' \n\n\n(b) in paragraph 3 the following point (f) is added:\n\n\n'(f)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0waste that has been separately collected pursuant to Article 11(1) and 22 of Directive 2008/98/EC.';\n\n\n(c) the following paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 are added:\n\n\n'5.

The Member State shall notify the Commission of its intention to make use of this provision at the latest 24 months before the deadline laid down in paragraph 5. In the event of an extension, the Member State shall take the necessary measures to reduce by 2030 the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 20% of the total amount of municipal waste generated.\n\n\nThe notification shall be accompanied by an implementation plan presenting the measures needed to ensure compliance with the targets before the new deadline. The plan shall also include a detailed timetable for the implementation of the proposed measures and an assessment of their expected impacts. \n\n\n7. By 31 December 2024 at the latest, the Commission shall examine the target laid down in paragraph 5 with a view to reducing it and introducing restrictions to the landfilling of non-hazardous waste other than municipal waste. To this end, a report of the Commission accompanied by a proposal, if appropriate, shall be sent to the European Parliament and the Council.';\n\n\n(3) the following Article 5a is inserted:\n\n\n'Article 5a\n\n\nEarly warning report\n\n\n1.
