In fact, Article 3(4) of the Act of Accession simply provides that Croatia accedes to the conventions and protocols by virtue of the Act.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nArticles 3(4) and (5) of the Act of Accession provide that the Council shall adopt a decision in order to determine the date on which these conventions and protocols shall enter into force for Croatia and to make all the necessary adjustments to these conventions and protocols required by reason of the accession of Croatia. The Council shall act on a recommendation of the Commission, after consulting the European Parliament.\n\n\nAnnex I to the Act of Accession gives the list of conventions and protocols concerned in the Justice and Home Affairs area. \n\n\nThis list includes the Convention of 18 December 1997, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations\n2\n.\n\n\nThe accession of Croatia to the aforementioned Convention does not require adjustments thereto. \n\n\nHence this Commission Recommendation for a Council Decision is intended to only determine the date on which the Convention of 18 December 1997 shall enter into force for Croatia. \n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nBecause the Act of Accession already foresees the accession of Croatia to the conventions and protocols listed in Annex I to the Act, it is not necessary to proceed with a consultation of interested parties and an impact assessment of such an accession. \n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nThe Commission is invited to adopt the Recommendation for a Council Decision and to transmit it to the Council and the European Parliament.\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\nconcerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the Convention of 18 December 1997, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty of the European Union, on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations\n\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European Union,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty of Accession of the Republic of Croatia,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Act of Accession of the Republic of Croatia, and in particular Articles 3(4) and (5) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission \n3\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament \n4\n,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Convention drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations (\"the Convention\") was signed at Brussels on 18 December 1997.
