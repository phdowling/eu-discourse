Member States also signed agreements with\r\nthe dependent territories of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.\nMore recently, the importance of automatic\r\nexchange of information as a means to combat cross-border tax fraud and tax\r\nevasion by ensuring full tax transparency and cooperation between tax\r\nadministrations worldwide has also been recognised at the international level.\r\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was mandated\r\nby the G20 to develop a single global standard for automatic exchange of\r\nfinancial account information. The Global Standard was released by the OECD\r\nCouncil in July 2014.\nFollowing the adoption of a proposal to update\r\nthe Savings Directive, the Commission adopted on 17 June 2011 a recommendation\r\nfor a mandate to initiate negotiations with Switzerland, Liechtenstein,\r\nAndorra, Monaco and San Marino, in order to upgrade the EU\u2019s Agreements with\r\nthose countries in line with international developments and to ensure that\r\nthose countries continue to apply measures equivalent to those in the EU. On 14\r\nMay 2013, the Council reached an agreement on the Negotiating Mandate by\r\nconcluding that negotiations should be aligned with the recent developments at\r\nglobal level where it was agreed to promote automatic exchange of information\r\nas an international standard.\nIn its communication of 6 December 2012\r\ncontaining an Action Plan to strengthen the fight against tax fraud and tax\r\nevasion, the Commission highlighted the need to promote vigorously the\r\nautomatic exchange of information as the future European and international\r\nstandard for transparency and exchange of information in tax matters.\nOn the basis of a proposal presented by the\r\nCommission in June 2013, the Council on 9 December 2014 adopted Directive\r\n2014/107/EU amending Directive 2011/16/EU and extending the mandatory automatic\r\nexchange of information between EU tax authorities to a full range of financial\r\nitems in accordance with the Global Standard. The amendment ensures a coherent,\r\nconsistent and comprehensive Union-wide approach to the automatic exchange of\r\nfinancial account information in the Internal Market.\nAs Directive\r\n2014/107/EU is generally broader in scope than Directive 2003/48/EC and\r\nprovides that in cases of overlap of scope, Directive 2014/107/EU prevails, on\r\n18 March 2015 the Commission adopted a proposal to repeal Directive 2003/48/EC.\nIn order to\r\nminimise costs and administrative burdens both for tax administrations and for\r\neconomic operators, it is crucial to ensure that the amendment of the existing\r\nSavings Agreement with Switzerland is in line with EU and international\r\ndevelopments. This will increase tax transparency in Europe and will be the\r\nlegal basis for implementing the OCDE Global Standard on automatic exchange of\r\ninformation between Switzerland and the EU. \nGiven the Swiss\r\nconstitutional requirements for ratification, for Switzerland to be able to\r\ncommence due diligence procedures in January 2017, with first exchanges under\r\nthe Global Standard by September 2018, the Amending Protocol would need to be\r\nsigned by May 2015. This would grant to all Member States the earliest possible\r\ncooperation to which Switzerland is committed at international level.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Amending\r\nProtocol implements the Global Standard between EU Member States and\r\nSwitzerland. The different stakeholders were already consulted on various\r\noccasions during the development of the OECD Global Standard.\nEU Member States\r\nhave also been consulted and informed during the negotiations between the\r\nCommission and Switzerland. The Commission reported to the European Council at\r\nits meetings in March and December 2014 on the state of play of the\r\nnegotiations with Switzerland. \nThe Commission\r\nhas also consulted the new Expert Group on automatic exchange of financial\r\naccount information that provides advice to ensure that EU legislation on\r\nautomatic exchange of information in direct taxation is effectively aligned and\r\nfully compatible with the OECD Global Standard. The Expert Group includes\r\nrepresentatives from organisations representing the financial sector and\r\norganisations campaigning against tax evasion and tax avoidance.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis\r\nfor this proposal is provided by Article 115 of the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union, in conjunction with Article 218(5) and (8) second\r\nsubparagraph. The substantive legal basis is provided by Article 115 TFEU. \nArticle 1 of the\r\nAmending Protocol annexed to this Proposal for Council Decision changes the\r\ntitle of the existing Agreement in order to better reflect the contents of the\r\nAgreement, as amended by that Amending Protocol. \nArticle 2 replaces\r\nthe existing articles and Annexes with a new set of provisions comprising 11\r\nArticles, an Annex I that reflects the OECD Common Reporting Standard which is\r\npart of the Global Standard, an Annex II that reflects important parts of the\r\nOECD Commentaries to the Global Standard and an Annex III that lists the\r\nCompetent Authorities of Switzerland and of each Member State.\nThe new Articles\r\nreflect the articles of the OECD Model Competent Authority agreement for the\r\nimplementation of the Global Standard, with minor adaptations to reflect the\r\nparticular legal context of an EU Agreement. In Article 1 there is no\r\ndefinition of\u00a0 Tax Identification Number (TIN), since there is already a\r\ndefinition of TIN in Section VIII(E)(5) of Annex I. Article 5 includes a full\r\nset of provisions on exchange of information upon request that follows the\r\nlatest text of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Article 6 includes a more\r\ndetailed set of provisions on data protection. Article 7 provides for an\r\nadditional stage of consultation before any Member State or Switzerland\r\nundertakes to suspend the Agreement. Article 8 features provisions on\r\namendments to the Agreement, including a quick mechanism for provisional\r\napplication by one of the Contracting Parties of amendments to the Global Standard,\r\non the condition of consent by the other Party. Article 9 takes over the full\r\nset of provisions of Article 15 of the Agreement before its amendment by the\r\nAmending Protocol, because the negotiators of the Contracting Parties agreed\r\nnot to make any change to these provisions which relate to business taxation\r\nand are not influenced by the Global Standard. Article 11 defines the\r\nterritorial scope.\nAnnex I follows\r\nboth the OECD Common Reporting Standard and Annex I to the Directive on\r\nAdministrative Cooperation. Annex II implements key parts of the CRS\r\nCommentaries and corresponds to Annex II to the Directive on Administrative\r\nCooperation. The minor deviations from Annex I or II to the Directive on\r\nAdministrative Cooperation are justified by the re-alignment of the text to the\r\nOECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) requested by the Swiss negotiators. Those\r\ninclude the following:\n1. In Section\r\nI(D) the reference to the reporting of place of birth is realigned to the CRS.\n2. Section I(A)\r\non insurances that are effectively prevented by law from being sold to\r\nresidents of a Reportable Jurisdiction is reintroduced. In order to avoid risks\r\nof abuse of that exemption, a corresponding Joint Declaration is included at\r\nthe end of the Amending Protocol.\n3. All the relevant\r\noptions provided for in the OECD CRS Commentaries and in the Directive on\r\nAdministrative Cooperation have been left at the discretion of each Member\r\nState and Switzerland and are not exercised directly in the Agreement. There is\r\ninstead an obligation on Member States and Switzerland to notify each other and\r\nthe Commission whether they have exercised any particular option. This is meant\r\nas a safeguard for the correct application of the alternative definition of\r\n\u201cRelated Entity\u201d in connection with the option on new accounts of current\r\ncustomers.\n4. The\r\ndefinitions of \u201cInternational Organisation\u201d and \u201cCentral Bank\u201d in Section\r\nVIII(B)(3) and (4) have been realigned to the CRS in order to enable them to\r\napply also in the context of the exemption from the look-through for Passive\r\nnon-financial entities (NFEs) in Section VIII(D)(9)(c).\n5. In Annex II\r\nthe definition of \u201cResidence of a Financial Institution\u201d is aligned to the CRS\r\nCommentaries in order to cover cases where the residence of another Financial\r\nInstitution should be determined, e.g. for the look-through for Passive NFEs.\nArticle 3 of the\r\nAmending Protocol includes provisions on the entry into force and application.\r\nIt deals with issues on the transition from the existing Agreement to the\r\namended Agreement, with regard to requests for information, credits available\r\nto beneficial owners for withholding tax, final payments of withholding tax by\r\nSwitzerland to Member States and final exchanges of information under the\r\nvoluntary disclosure mechanism.\nArticle 4\r\nincludes a Protocol on additional safeguards related to the exchange of\r\ninformation on request, which Switzerland includes in its tax treaties. The\r\ntext specifies that exchanges on the basis of a group request are not\r\nprevented. The Protocol on additional safeguards is in line with the Global\r\nForum's Terms of Reference for exchange of information on request.\nArticle 5 lists\r\nthe languages in which the Amending Protocol is signed.\nThe revised\r\nAgreement is supplemented by four Joint Declarations of the contracting parties\r\nand one Unilateral Declaration by Switzerland.\nThe first Joint\r\nDeclaration concerns the expected date of entry into force of the revised\r\nAgreement. The second and third Declarations make a link respectively to the\r\nCommentaries to the Global Standard and Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax\r\nConvention on Income and on Capital. The fourth Declaration aims at preventing\r\nmisinterpretation of Section III(A) of Annex I and establishes a mechanism of\r\nmutual notification of the cases where that exemption would have grounds to\r\napply. The fifth Declaration is a unilateral one from the Swiss side.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal does not entail have any budgetary\r\nimplications.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n2015/0075 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community\r\nand the Swiss Confederation providing for measures equivalent to those laid\r\ndown in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form\r\nof interest payments\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 115 in conjunction\r\nwith Article 218(5) and the second paragraph of Article 218(8) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 14 May 2013 the Council\r\nauthorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Swiss Confederation to\r\namend the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation\r\nproviding for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive\r\n2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments, in\r\norder to align that Agreement with the recent developments at global level\r\nwhere it was agreed to promote automatic exchange of information as an\r\ninternational standard.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The text of the Amending\r\nProtocol which is the result of the negotiations duly reflects the negotiating\r\ndirectives issued by the Council as it aligns the Agreement with the latest\r\ndevelopments at international level concerning automatic exchange of\r\ninformation, namely the Global Standard for automatic exchange of financial\r\naccount information in tax matters developed by the Organisation for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD). The Union, its Member States and the Swiss\r\nConfederation have actively participated in the work of the OECD.

referred to as \u2018Contracting\r\nParty\u2019 or \u2018Contracting Parties\u2019,\nWith a view to implementing the OECD\r\nStandard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, hereinafter\r\nreferred to as \u2018Global Standard\u2019, within a framework of cooperation which takes\r\naccount of the legitimate interests of both Contracting Parties,\nWhereas, the Contracting Parties have a\r\nlongstanding and close relationship with respect to mutual assistance in tax\r\nmatters, in particular on the application of measures equivalent to those laid\r\ndown in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form\r\nof interest payments, and desire to improve international tax compliance by\r\nfurther building on that relationship,\nWhereas, the Contracting Parties desire to\r\nconclude an agreement to improve international tax compliance based on\r\nreciprocal automatic exchange of information, subject to certain\r\nconfidentiality and other protections, including provisions limiting the use of\r\nthe information exchanged,\nWhereas Article 10 of the Agreement in the\r\nform prior to its amendment with this Amending Protocol, which currently\r\nprovides for exchange of information upon request limited to conduct\r\nconstituting tax fraud and the like should be aligned to the OECD standard on\r\ntransparency and exchange of information in tax matters,\nWhereas, the Contracting Parties will apply\r\ntheir respective data protection laws and practices to the processing of\r\npersonal data exchanged in accordance with the Agreement as amended by this\r\nAmending Protocol and undertake to notify each other without undue delay in the\r\nevent of any change in the substance of these laws and practices,\nWhereas, the Member States and Switzerland\r\nhave in place (i) appropriate safeguards to ensure that the information\r\nreceived pursuant to the Agreement as amended by this Amending Protocol remains\r\nconfidential and is used solely for the purposes of and by the persons or\r\nauthorities concerned with the assessment or collection or recovery of, the\r\nenforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in\r\nrelation to taxes, or the oversight of these, as well as for other authorised\r\npurposes, and (ii) the infrastructure for an effective exchange relationship\r\n(including established processes for ensuring timely, accurate, secure and\r\nconfidential information exchanges, effective and reliable communications, and\r\ncapabilities to promptly resolve questions and concerns about exchanges or\r\nrequests for exchanges and to administer the provisions of Article 4 of the\r\nAgreement as amended by this Amending Protocol),\nWhereas the categories of Reporting\r\nFinancial Institutions and Reportable Accounts covered by the Agreement as\r\namended by this Amending Protocol are designed to limit the opportunities for\r\ntaxpayers to avoid being reported by shifting assets to Financial Institutions\r\nor investing in financial products that are outside the scope of the Agreement\r\nas amended by this Amending Protocol. However, certain Financial Institutions\r\nand accounts that present a low risk of being used to evade tax should be excluded\r\nfrom the scope. Thresholds should not be generally included as they could\r\neasily be circumvented by splitting accounts into different Financial\r\nInstitutions. The financial information which is required to be reported and\r\nexchanged should concern not only all relevant income (interests, dividends and\r\nsimilar types of income) but also account balances and sale proceeds from\r\nFinancial Assets, in order to address situations where a taxpayer seeks to hide\r\ncapital that in itself represents income or assets with regard to which tax has\r\nbeen evaded. Therefore, the processing of information under the Agreement as\r\namended by this Amending Protocol is necessary and proportionate for the\r\npurpose of enabling Member States\u2019 and Switzerland\u2019s tax administrations to correctly\r\nand unequivocally identify the taxpayers concerned, to administer and enforce\r\ntheir tax laws in cross-border situations, to assess the likelihood of tax\r\nevasion being perpetrated and to avoid unnecessary further investigations,\nHAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nThe title of the Agreement shall be\r\nreplaced by the following title:\n\u201cAgreement between the European Union and\r\nthe Swiss Confederation on the automatic exchange of financial account\r\ninformation to improve international tax compliance\u201d\nArticle 2\nArticles 1 through 22 as well as the\r\nAnnexes shall be replaced by the following:\n\u201cArticle 1\nDefinitions\n1.

In relation to issues of interpretation the European Commission\r\nmay take part in consultations at the request of any of the Competent\r\nAuthorities.\n2. If the question relates to significant non-compliance with the\r\nprovisions of this Agreement, and the procedure described in paragraph 1 does\r\nnot provide for an adequate settlement, the Competent Authority of a Member\r\nState or Switzerland may suspend the exchange of information under this\r\nAgreement towards, respectively, Switzerland or a specific Member State, by\r\ngiving notice in writing to the other Competent Authority concerned. Such\r\nsuspension will have immediate effect.

If the Reporting Financial Institution\u2019s electronically\r\nsearchable databases include fields for, and capture all of the information\r\ndescribed in, subparagraph C(3), then a further paper record search is not\r\nrequired. If the electronic databases do not capture all of this information,\r\nthen with respect to a High Value Account, the Reporting Financial Institution\r\nmust also review the current customer master file and, to the extent not\r\ncontained in the current customer master file, the following documents\r\nassociated with the account and obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution\r\nwithin the last five years for any of the indicia described in subparagraph\r\nB(2): \na)\r\nthe most recent Documentary Evidence collected with respect to the account; \nb)\r\nthe most recent account opening contract or documentation; \nc)\r\nthe most recent documentation obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution\r\npursuant to AML/KYC Procedures or for other regulatory purposes; \nd)\r\nany power of attorney or signature authority forms currently in effect; and \ne)\r\nany standing instructions (other than with respect to a Depository Account) to\r\ntransfer funds currently in effect. \n3. Exception To The Extent Databases Contain Sufficient\r\nInformation. A Reporting Financial Institution is not required to perform the\r\npaper record search described in subparagraph C(2) to the extent the Reporting\r\nFinancial Institution\u2019s electronically searchable information includes the\r\nfollowing: \na)\r\nthe Account Holder\u2019s residence status; \nb)\r\nthe Account Holder\u2019s residence address and mailing address currently on file\r\nwith the Reporting Financial Institution; \nc)\r\nthe Account Holder\u2019s telephone number(s) currently on file, if any, with the\r\nReporting Financial Institution; \nd)\r\nin the case of Financial Accounts other than Depository Accounts, whether there\r\nare standing instructions to transfer funds in the account to another account\r\n(including an account at another branch of the Reporting Financial Institution\r\nor another Financial Institution); \ne)\r\nwhether there is a current \u201cin-care-of\u201d address or \u201chold mail\u201d instruction for\r\nthe Account Holder; and \nf)\r\nwhether there is any power of attorney or signatory authority for the account. \n4.\r\nRelationship Manager Inquiry for Actual Knowledge. In addition to the\r\nelectronic and paper record searches described in subparagraphs C(1) and (2),\r\nthe Reporting Financial Institution must treat as a Reportable Account any High\r\nValue Account assigned to a relationship manager (including any Financial\r\nAccounts aggregated with that High Value Account) if the relationship manager\r\nhas actual knowledge that the Account Holder is a Reportable Person. \n5.\r\nEffect of Finding Indicia. \na)\r\nIf none of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2) are discovered in the\r\nenhanced review of High Value Accounts described in paragraph C, and the account\r\nis not identified as held by a Reportable Person in subparagraph C(4), then\r\nfurther action is not required until there is a change in circumstances that\r\nresults in one or more indicia being associated with the account. \nb)\r\nIf any of the indicia listed in subparagraphs B(2)(a) through (e) are\r\ndiscovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described in paragraph\r\nC, or if there is a subsequent change in circumstances that results in one or\r\nmore indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting Financial\r\nInstitution must treat the account as a Reportable Account with respect to each\r\nReportable Jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified unless it elects to\r\napply subparagraph B(6) and one of the exceptions in that subparagraph applies\r\nwith respect to that account. \nc)\r\nIf a \u201chold mail\u201d instruction or \u201cin-care-of\u201d address is discovered in the\r\nenhanced review of High Value Accounts described in paragraph C, and no other\r\naddress and none of the other indicia listed in subparagraphs B(2)(a) through\r\n(e) are identified for the Account Holder, the Reporting Financial Institution\r\nmust obtain from such Account Holder a self-certification or Documentary\r\nEvidence to establish the residence(s) for tax purposes of the Account Holder.\r\nIf the Reporting Financial Institution cannot obtain such self-certification or\r\nDocumentary Evidence, it must report the account to the Competent Authority of\r\nits Member State or Switzerland, as the context requires, as an undocumented\r\naccount. \n6.\r\nIf a Preexisting Individual Account is not a High Value Account as of 31\r\nDecember preceding the entry into force of the Amending\r\nProtocol signed on [XXXX], but\r\nbecomes a High Value Account as of the last day of a subsequent calendar year,\r\nthe Reporting Financial Institution must complete the enhanced review\r\nprocedures described in paragraph C with respect to such account within the\r\ncalendar year following the year in which the account becomes a High Value\r\nAccount. If based on this review such account is identified as a Reportable\r\nAccount, the Reporting Financial Institution must report the required\r\ninformation about such account with respect to the year in which it is\r\nidentified as a Reportable Account and subsequent years on an annual basis,\r\nunless the Account Holder ceases to be a Reportable Person. \n7.\r\nOnce a Reporting Financial Institution applies the enhanced review procedures\r\ndescribed in paragraph C to a High Value Account, the Reporting Financial\r\nInstitution is not required to re-apply such procedures, other than the relationship\r\nmanager inquiry described in subparagraph C(4), to the same High Value Account\r\nin any subsequent year unless the account is undocumented where the Reporting\r\nFinancial Institution should re-apply them annually until such account ceases\r\nto be undocumented. \n8.\r\nIf there is a change of circumstances with respect to a High Value Account that\r\nresults in one or more indicia described in subparagraph B(2) being associated\r\nwith the account, then the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the\r\naccount as a Reportable Account with respect to each Reportable Jurisdiction\r\nfor which an indicium is identified unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(6)\r\nand one of the exceptions in that subparagraph applies with respect to that\r\naccount. \n9.\r\nA Reporting Financial Institution must implement procedures to ensure that a\r\nrelationship manager identifies any change in circumstances of an account. For\r\nexample, if a relationship manager is notified that the Account Holder has a\r\nnew mailing address in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial\r\nInstitution is required to treat the new address as a change in circumstances\r\nand, if it elects to apply subparagraph B(6), is required to obtain the\r\nappropriate documentation from the Account Holder. \nD. Review of Preexisting High Value\r\nIndividual Accounts must be completed within one year of the entry into force\r\nof the Amending Protocol signed on [XXXX]. Review of Preexisting Lower Value\r\nIndividual Accounts must be completed within two years of the entry into force\r\nof the Amending Protocol signed on [XXXX].\nE. Any Preexisting Individual Account that\r\nhas been identified as a Reportable Account under this Section must be treated\r\nas a Reportable Account in all subsequent years, unless the Account Holder\r\nceases to be a Reportable Person. \nSection IV: Due Diligence\r\nfor New Individual Accounts \nThe following procedures apply\r\nfor purposes of identifying Reportable Accounts among New Individual Accounts. \nA. With respect to New Individual Accounts,\r\nupon account opening, the Reporting Financial Institution must obtain a\r\nself-certification, which may be part of the account opening documentation,\r\nthat allows the Reporting Financial Institution to determine the Account\r\nHolder\u2019s residence(s) for tax purposes and confirm the reasonableness of such\r\nself-certification based on the information obtained by the Reporting Financial\r\nInstitution in connection with the opening of the account, including any\r\ndocumentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. \nB. If the self-certification establishes that\r\nthe Account Holder is resident for tax purposes in a Reportable Jurisdiction,\r\nthe Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable\r\nAccount and the self-certification must also include the Account Holder\u2019s TIN\r\nwith respect to such Reportable Jurisdiction (subject to paragraph D of Section\r\nI) and date of birth. \nC. If there is a change of circumstances with\r\nrespect to a New Individual Account that causes the Reporting Financial\r\nInstitution to know, or have reason to know, that the original\r\nself-certification is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Financial\r\nInstitution cannot rely on the original self-certification and must obtain a\r\nvalid self-certification that establishes the residence(s) for tax purposes of\r\nthe Account Holder. \nSection V: Due Diligence for\r\nPreexisting Entity Accounts \nThe following procedures apply for purposes of\r\nidentifying Reportable Accounts among Preexisting Entity Accounts. \nA. Entity Accounts Not Required to Be\r\nReviewed, Identified or Reported. Unless the Reporting Financial Institution\r\nelects otherwise, either with respect to all Preexisting Entity Accounts or,\r\nseparately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, a\r\nPreexisting Entity Account with an aggregate account balance or value that does\r\nnot exceed USD 250 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic\r\ncurrency of each Member State or Switzerland as of 31 December preceding the\r\nentry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on\r\n[XXXX], is not required to be\r\nreviewed, identified, or reported as a Reportable Account until the aggregate\r\naccount balance or value exceeds that amount as of the last day of any\r\nsubsequent calendar year. \nB. Entity Accounts Subject to Review. A\r\nPreexisting Entity Account that has an aggregate account balance or value that\r\nexceeds USD 250 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic\r\ncurrency of each Member State or Switzerland, as of 31 December preceding the\r\nentry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on\r\n[XXXX], and a Preexisting\r\nEntity Account that does not exceed as of 31 December preceding the entry into\r\nforce of the Amending Protocol signed on [XXXX], that amount but the aggregate account\r\nbalance or value of which exceeds\u00a0 such amount as of the last day of any\r\nsubsequent calendar year, must be reviewed in accordance with the procedures\r\nset forth in paragraph D. \nC. Entity Accounts With Respect to Which\r\nReporting Is Required. With respect to Preexisting Entity Accounts described in\r\nparagraph B, only accounts that are held by one or more Entities that are\r\nReportable Persons, or by Passive NFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who\r\nare Reportable Persons, shall be treated as Reportable Accounts. \nD. Review Procedures for Identifying Entity\r\nAccounts With Respect to Which Reporting Is Required. For Preexisting Entity\r\nAccounts described in paragraph B, a Reporting Financial Institution must apply\r\nthe following review procedures to determine whether the account is held by one\r\nor more Reportable Persons, or by Passive NFEs with one or more Controlling\r\nPersons who are Reportable Persons: \n1. Determine Whether the Entity Is a Reportable Person. \na)\r\nReview information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes\r\n(including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures) to determine\r\nwhether the information indicates that the Account Holder is resident in a\r\nReportable Jurisdiction. For this purpose, information indicating that the\r\nAccount Holder is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction includes a place of\r\nincorporation or organisation, or an address in a Reportable Jurisdiction. \nb)\r\nIf the information indicates that the Account Holder is resident in a\r\nReportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the\r\naccount as a Reportable Account unless it obtains a self-certification from the\r\nAccount Holder, or reasonably determines based on information in its possession\r\nor that is publicly available, that the Account Holder is not a Reportable\r\nPerson. \n2. Determine Whether the Entity is a Passive NFE with\r\nOne or More Controlling Persons Who Are Reportable Persons. With respect to an\r\nAccount Holder of a Preexisting Entity Account (including an Entity that is a\r\nReportable Person), the Reporting Financial Institution must determine whether\r\nthe Account Holder is a Passive NFE with one or more Controlling Persons who\r\nare Reportable Persons. If any of the Controlling Persons of a Passive NFE is a\r\nReportable Person, then the account must be treated as a Reportable Account. In\r\nmaking these determinations the Reporting Financial Institution must follow the\r\nguidance in subparagraphs D(2)(a) through (c) in the order most appropriate\r\nunder the circumstances. \na) Determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive\r\nNFE. For purposes of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE,\r\nthe Reporting Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification from the\r\nAccount Holder to establish its status, unless it has information in its\r\npossession or that is publicly available, based on which it can reasonably\r\ndetermine that the Account Holder is an Active NFE or a Financial Institution\r\nother than an Investment Entity described in subparagraph A(6)(b) of Section\r\nVIII that is not a Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution. \nb) Determining the Controlling Persons of an Account\r\nHolder. For the purposes of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account\r\nHolder, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on information collected and\r\nmaintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. \nc) Determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive\r\nNFE is a Reportable Person. For the purposes of determining whether a\r\nControlling Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, a Reporting\r\nFinancial Institution may rely on: \ni. information collected and maintained pursuant to\r\nAML/KYC Procedures in the case of a Preexisting Entity Account held by one or\r\nmore NFEs with an aggregate account balance or value that does not exceed USD 1\r\n000 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic currency of each\r\nMember State or Switzerland; or \nii. a\r\nself-certification from the Account Holder or such Controlling Person of the\r\njurisdiction(s) (being a Member State, Switzerland or other jurisdictions) in\r\nwhich the Controlling Person is resident for tax purposes. \nE. Timing of Review and Additional Procedures Applicable to\r\nPreexisting Entity Accounts. \n1. Review of\r\nPreexisting Entity Accounts with an aggregate account balance or value that\r\nexceeds USD 250 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic\r\ncurrency of each Member State or Switzerland, as of 31 December preceding the\r\nentry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on\r\n[XXXX], must be completed\r\nwithin two years of the entry into force. \n2. Review of\r\nPreexisting Entity Accounts with an aggregate account balance or value that\r\ndoes not exceed USD 250 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic\r\ncurrency of each Member State or Switzerland, as of 31 December preceding the\r\nentry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on\r\n[XXXX], but exceeds that\r\namount as of 31 December of a subsequent year, must be completed within the\r\ncalendar year following the year in which the aggregate account balance or\r\nvalue exceeds such amount. \n3. If there is a\r\nchange of circumstances with respect to a Preexisting Entity Account that\r\ncauses the Reporting Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know,\r\nthat the self-certification or other documentation associated with an account\r\nis incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Financial Institution must\r\nre-determine the status of the account in accordance with the procedures set\r\nforth in paragraph D. \nSection VI: Due Diligence\r\nfor New Entity Accounts \nThe following\r\nprocedures apply for purposes of identifying Reportable Accounts among New\r\nEntity Accounts. \nA. Review Procedures for\r\nIdentifying Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting Is Required. For\r\nNew Entity Accounts, a Reporting Financial Institution must apply the following\r\nreview procedures to determine whether the account is held by one or more\r\nReportable Persons, or by Passive NFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who\r\nare Reportable Persons: \n1. Determine Whether the Entity Is a Reportable Person. \na) Obtain a self-certification, which may be part of the\r\naccount opening documentation, that allows the Reporting Financial Institution to\r\ndetermine the Account Holder\u2019s residence(s) for tax purposes and confirm the\r\nreasonableness of such self-certification based on the information obtained by\r\nthe Reporting Financial Institution in connection with the opening of the\r\naccount, including any documentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures.\r\nIf the Entity certifies that it has no residence for tax purposes, the\r\nReporting Financial Institution may rely on the address of the principal office\r\nof the Entity to determine the residence of the Account Holder. \nb) If the self-certification indicates that the Account\r\nHolder is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial\r\nInstitution must treat the account as a Reportable Account unless it reasonably\r\ndetermines based on information in its possession or that is publicly\r\navailable, that the Account Holder is not a Reportable Person with respect to\r\nsuch Reportable Jurisdiction. \n2. Determine Whether the Entity is a Passive NFE with\r\nOne or More Controlling Persons Who Are Reportable Persons. With respect to an\r\nAccount Holder of a New Entity Account (including an Entity that is a\r\nReportable Person), the Reporting Financial Institution must determine whether\r\nthe Account Holder is a Passive NFE with one or more Controlling Persons who\r\nare Reportable Persons. If any of the Controlling Persons of a Passive NFE is a\r\nReportable Person, then the account must be treated as a Reportable Account. In\r\nmaking these determinations the Reporting Financial Institution must follow the\r\nguidance in subparagraphs A(2)(a) through (c) in the order most appropriate\r\nunder the circumstances. \na) Determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive\r\nNFE. For purposes of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE,\r\nthe Reporting Financial Institution must rely on a self-certification from the\r\nAccount Holder to establish its status, unless it has information in its\r\npossession or that is publicly available, based on which it can reasonably\r\ndetermine that the Account Holder is an Active NFE or a Financial Institution\r\nother than an Investment Entity described in subparagraph A(6)(b) of Section\r\nVIII that is not a Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution . \nb) Determining the Controlling Persons of an Account\r\nHolder. For purposes of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account\r\nHolder, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on information collected and\r\nmaintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. \nc) Determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive\r\nNFE is a Reportable Person. For purposes of determining whether a Controlling\r\nPerson of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, a Reporting Financial\r\nInstitution may rely on a self-certification from the Account Holder or such\r\nControlling Person. \nSection VII:\r\nSpecial Due Diligence Rules \nThe following\r\nadditional rules apply in implementing the due diligence procedures described\r\nabove: \nA. Reliance on Self-Certifications and\r\nDocumentary Evidence. A Reporting Financial Institution may not rely on a\r\nself-certification or Documentary Evidence if the Reporting Financial\r\nInstitution knows or has reason to know that the self-certification or\r\nDocumentary Evidence is incorrect or unreliable. \nB. Alternative Procedures for Financial\r\nAccounts Held by Individual Beneficiaries of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or\r\nan Annuity Contract and for a Group Cash Value Insurance Contract or Group\r\nAnnuity Contract. A Reporting Financial Institution may presume that an\r\nindividual beneficiary (other than the owner) of a Cash Value Insurance\r\nContract or an Annuity Contract receiving a death benefit is not a Reportable\r\nPerson and may treat such Financial Account as other than a Reportable Account\r\nunless the Reporting Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to\r\nknow, that the beneficiary is a Reportable Person. A Reporting Financial\r\nInstitution has reason to know that a beneficiary of a Cash Value Insurance\r\nContract or an Annuity Contract is a Reportable Person if the information\r\ncollected by the Reporting Financial Institution and associated with the\r\nbeneficiary contains indicia as described in paragraph B of Section III. If a\r\nReporting Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that\r\nthe beneficiary is a Reportable Person, the Reporting Financial Institution\r\nmust follow the procedures in paragraph B of Section III. \nA Member State or\r\nSwitzerland shall have the option to allow Reporting Financial Institutions to\r\ntreat a Financial Account that is a member\u2019s interest in a Group Cash Value\r\nInsurance Contract or Group Annuity Contract as a Financial Account that is not\r\na Reportable Account until the date on which an amount is payable to the\r\nemployee/certificate holder or beneficiary, if the Financial Account that is a\r\nmember\u2019s interest in a Group Cash Value Insurance Contract or Group Annuity\r\nContract meets the following requirements:\na)\u00a0\u00a0 the\r\nGroup Cash Value Insurance Contract or Group Annuity Contract is issued to an\r\nemployer and covers 25 or more employees/certificate holders;\nb)\u00a0\u00a0 the\r\nemployee/certificate holders are entitled to receive any contract value related\r\nto their interests and to name beneficiaries for the benefit payable upon the\r\nemployee\u2019s death; and\nc)\u00a0\u00a0 the\r\naggregate amount payable to any employee/certificate holder or beneficiary does\r\nnot exceed USD 1 000 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic\r\ncurrency of each Member State or Switzerland .\nThe term \u201cGroup\r\nCash Value Insurance Contract\u201d means a Cash Value Insurance Contract that (i)\r\nprovides coverage on individuals who are affiliated through an employer, trade\r\nassociation, labour union, or other association or group; and (ii) charges a\r\npremium for each member of the group (or member of a class within the group)\r\nthat is determined without regard to the individual health characteristics\r\nother than age, gender, and smoking habits of the member (or class of members)\r\nof the group. \nThe term \u201cGroup Annuity Contract\u201d means an Annuity\r\nContract under which the obligees are individuals who are affiliated through an\r\nemployer, trade association, labour union, or other association or group.\nBefore the entry into force of the Amending\r\nProtocol signed on [XXXX], Member States shall\r\ncommunicate to Switzerland and Switzerland shall communicate to the European\r\nCommission whether they have exercised the option foreseen in this paragraph.\r\nThe European Commission may coordinate the transmission of the communication\r\nfrom Member States to Switzerland and the European Commission shall transmit\r\nthe communication from Switzerland to all Member States. All further changes to\r\nthe exercise of that option by a Member State or Switzerland shall be\r\ncommunicated in the same manner.\nC. Account Balance Aggregation and Currency Rules. \n1.\r\nAggregation of Individual Accounts. For purposes of determining the aggregate\r\nbalance or value of Financial Accounts held by an individual, a Reporting\r\nFinancial Institution is required to aggregate all Financial Accounts\r\nmaintained by the Reporting Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity, but\r\nonly to the extent that the Reporting Financial Institution\u2019s computerised\r\nsystems link the Financial Accounts by reference to a data element such as\r\nclient number or TIN, and allow account balances or values to be aggregated.\r\nEach holder of a jointly held Financial Account shall be attributed the entire\r\nbalance or value of the jointly held Financial Account for purposes of applying\r\nthe aggregation requirements described in this subparagraph. \n2.\r\nAggregation of Entity Accounts. For purposes of determining the aggregate\r\nbalance or value of Financial Accounts held by an Entity, a Reporting Financial\r\nInstitution is required to take into account all Financial Accounts that are\r\nmaintained by the Reporting Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity, but\r\nonly to the extent that the Reporting Financial Institution\u2019s computerised\r\nsystems link the Financial Accounts by reference to a data element such as\r\nclient number or TIN, and allow account balances or values to be aggregated.\r\nEach holder of a jointly held Financial Account shall be attributed the entire\r\nbalance or value of the jointly held Financial Account for purposes of applying\r\nthe aggregation requirements described in this subparagraph. \n3.\r\nSpecial Aggregation Rule Applicable to Relationship Managers. For purposes of\r\ndetermining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by a\r\nperson to determine whether a Financial Account is a High Value Account, a\r\nReporting Financial Institution is also required, in the case of any Financial\r\nAccounts that a relationship manager knows, or has reason to know, are directly\r\nor indirectly owned, controlled, or established (other than in a fiduciary\r\ncapacity) by the same person, to aggregate all such accounts. \n4.\r\nAmounts Read to Include Equivalent in Other Currencies. All dollar amounts or\r\namounts denominated in the domestic currency of each Member State or\r\nSwitzerland shall be read to include equivalent amounts in other currencies, as\r\ndetermined by domestic law. \nSection VIII: Defined Terms \nThe following\r\nterms have the meanings set forth below: \nA.

In the case of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity\r\nContract, the Account Holder is any person entitled to access the Cash Value or\r\nchange the beneficiary of the contract. If no person can access the Cash Value\r\nor change the beneficiary, the Account Holder is any person named as the owner\r\nin the contract and any person with a vested entitlement to payment under the\r\nterms of the contract.

For this purpose\r\ncontrol includes direct or indirect ownership of more than 50 per cent of the\r\nvote and value in an Entity. A Member State or Switzerland shall have the\r\noption of defining an Entity as a \u201cRelated Entity\u201d of another Entity if (a)\r\neither Entity controls the other Entity; (b) the two Entities are under common\r\ncontrol; or (c) the two Entities are Investment Entities described in\r\nsubparagraph A(6)(b), are under common management, and such management fulfils\r\nthe due diligence obligations of such Investment Entities.

The\r\nEuropean Commission may coordinate the transmission of the communication from\r\nMember States to Switzerland and the European Commission shall transmit the\r\ncommunication from Switzerland to all Member States.

The term \u2018standardised industry\r\ncoding system\u2019 means a coding system used to classify establishments by\r\nbusiness type for purposes other than tax purposes.\nBefore the entry into force of the Amending Protocol signed on [XXXX], Member States shall communicate to Switzerland and\r\nSwitzerland shall communicate to the European Commission whether they have\r\nexercised the option foreseen in this subparagraph. The European Commission may\r\ncoordinate the transmission of the communication from Member States to\r\nSwitzerland and the European Commission shall transmit the communication from\r\nSwitzerland to all Member States. All further changes to the exercise of that\r\noption by a Member State or Switzerland shall be communicated in the same\r\nmanner.\nSection\r\nIX: Effective Implementation \nEach Member State and\r\nSwitzerland must have rules and administrative procedures in place to ensure\r\neffective implementation of, and compliance with, the reporting and due\r\ndiligence procedures set out above including: \n1. rules to prevent any Financial Institutions,\r\npersons or intermediaries from adopting practices intended to circumvent the\r\nreporting and due diligence procedures; \n2. rules requiring Reporting Financial\r\nInstitutions to keep records of the steps undertaken and any evidence relied\r\nupon for the performance of the above procedures and adequate measures to\r\nobtain those records; \n3. administrative procedures to verify Reporting\r\nFinancial Institutions\u2019 compliance with the reporting and due diligence\r\nprocedures; administrative procedures to follow up with a Reporting Financial Institution\r\nwhen undocumented accounts are reported; \n4. administrative procedures to ensure that the\r\nEntities and accounts defined in domestic law as Non-Reporting Financial\r\nInstitutions and Excluded Accounts continue to have a low risk of being used to\r\nevade tax; and \n5. effective enforcement provisions to address\r\nnon-compliance. \nANNEX II\nComplementary\r\nReporting and Due Diligence rules for financial account information\n1. Change in circumstances\nA \u2018change in\r\ncircumstances\u2019 includes any change that results in the addition of information\r\nrelevant to a person's status or otherwise conflicts with such person's status.\r\nIn addition, a change in circumstances includes any change or addition of\r\ninformation to the Account Holder's account (including the addition,\r\nsubstitution, or other change of an Account Holder) or any change or addition\r\nof information to any account associated with such account (applying the\r\naccount aggregation rules described in subparagraphs C(1) through (3) of\r\nSection VII of Annex I) if such change or addition of information affects the\r\nstatus of the Account Holder. \nIf a Reporting Financial\r\nInstitution has relied on the residence address test described in subparagraph\r\nB(1) of Section III of Annex I and there is a change in circumstances\u00a0 that\r\ncauses the Reporting Financial Institution to know or have reason to know that\r\nthe original Documentary Evidence (or other equivalent documentation ) is\r\nincorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Financial Institution must, by the later\r\nof the last day of the relevant calendar year or other appropriate reporting\r\nperiod, or 90 calendar days following the notice or discovery of such change in\r\ncircumstances, obtain a self-certification and new Documentary Evidence to\r\nestablish the residence(s) for tax purposes of the Account Holder. If the\r\nReporting Financial Institution cannot obtain the self-certification and new\r\nDocumentary Evidence by such date, the Reporting Financial Institution must\r\napply the electronic record search procedure described in subparagraphs B(2)\r\nthrough (6) of Section III of Annex I.\n2. Self-certification for New Entity\r\nAccounts\nWith respect to New Entity\r\nAccounts, for the purposes of determining whether a Controlling Person of a\r\nPassive NFE is a Reportable Person, a Reporting Financial Institution may only\r\nrely on a self-certification from either the Account Holder or the Controlling\r\nPerson.\n3. Residence of a Financial Institution\nA Financial Institution is\r\n\u2018resident\u2019 in a Member State, Switzerland or another Participating Jurisdiction\r\nif it is subject to the jurisdiction of such Member State, Switzerland or\r\nanother Participating Jurisdiction (i.e., the Participating Jurisdiction is\r\nable to enforce reporting by the Financial Institution). In general, where a\r\nFinancial Institution is resident for tax purposes in a Member State,\r\nSwitzerland or another Participating Jurisdiction, it is subject to the\r\njurisdiction of such Member State, Switzerland or another Participating\r\nJurisdiction and it is, thus, a Member State Financial Institution, Swiss Financial\r\nInstitution or another Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution. In the\r\ncase of a trust that is a Financial Institution (irrespective of whether it is\r\nresident for tax purposes in a Member State, Switzerland or another\r\nParticipating Jurisdiction), the trust is considered to be subject to the\r\njurisdiction of a Member State, Switzerland or another Participating\r\nJurisdiction if one or more of its trustees are resident in such Member State,\r\nSwitzerland or another Participating Jurisdiction except if the trust reports\r\nall the information required to be reported pursuant to this Agreement or\r\nanother agreement implementing the Global Standard with respect to Reportable\r\nAccounts maintained by the trust to another Participating Jurisdiction (being a\r\nMember State, Switzerland or another Participating Jurisdiction), because it is\r\nresident for tax purposes in such other Participating Jurisdiction. However,\r\nwhere a Financial Institution (other than a trust) does not have a residence\r\nfor tax purposes (e.g., because it is treated as fiscally transparent, or it is\r\nlocated in a jurisdiction that does not have an income tax), it is considered\r\nto be subject to the jurisdiction of a Member State, Switzerland or another\r\nParticipating Jurisdiction and it is, thus, a Member State, Switzerland or\r\nanother Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution if:\na)\r\nit is incorporated under the laws of the Member State, Switzerland or another\r\nParticipating Jurisdiction ;\nb)\r\nit has its place of management (including effective management) in the Member\r\nState, Switzerland or another Participating Jurisdiction ; or\nc)\r\nit is subject to financial supervision in the Member State, Switzerland or\r\nanother Participating Jurisdiction.\nWhere a Financial Institution (other than a\r\ntrust) is resident in two or more Participating Jurisdictions (being a Member\r\nState, Switzerland or another Participating Jurisdiction), such Financial\r\nInstitution will be subject to the reporting and due diligence obligations of\r\nthe Participating Jurisdiction in which it maintains the Financial Account(s).\n4. Account maintained\nIn general, an account\r\nwould be considered to be maintained by a Financial Institution as follows:\na) in the case of a Custodial Account, by the Financial\r\nInstitution that holds custody over the assets in the account (including a\r\nFinancial Institution that holds assets in street name for an Account Holder in\r\nsuch institution).\nb) in case of a Depository Account, by the Financial\r\nInstitution that is obligated to make payments with respect to the account\r\n(excluding an agent of a Financial Institution regardless of whether such agent\r\nis a Financial Institution).\nc) in the case of any equity or debt interest in a Financial\r\nInstitution that constitutes a Financial Account, by such Financial Institution.\nd) in the case of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an\r\nAnnuity Contract, by the Financial Institution that is obligated to make\r\npayments with respect to the contract.\n5. Trusts that are Passive\r\nNFEs\nAn Entity such as a\r\npartnership, limited liability partnership or similar legal arrangement that\r\nhas no residence for tax purposes, according to subparagraph D(3) of Section\r\nVIII of Annex I, shall be treated as resident in the jurisdiction in which its\r\nplace of effective management is situated. For these purposes, a legal person\r\nor a legal arrangement is considered \u2018similar\u2019 to a partnership and a limited\r\nliability partnership where it is not treated as a taxable unit in a Reportable\r\nJurisdiction under the tax laws of such Reportable Jurisdiction. However, in\r\norder to avoid duplicate reporting (given the wide scope of the term\r\n\u201cControlling Persons\u201d in the case of trusts), a trust that is a Passive NFE may\r\nnot be considered a similar legal arrangement.\n6. Address of Entity\u2019s\r\nprincipal office\nOne of the requirements\r\ndescribed in subparagraph E(6)(c) of Section VIII of Annex I is that, with\r\nrespect to an Entity, the official documentation includes either the address of\r\nthe Entity\u2019s principal office in the Member State, Switzerland or other\r\njurisdiction in which it claims to be a resident or the Member State,\r\nSwitzerland or other jurisdiction in which the Entity was incorporated or\r\norganised. The address of the Entity\u2019s principal office is generally the place\r\nin which its place of effective management is situated. The address of a\r\nFinancial Institution with which the Entity maintains an account, a post office\r\nbox, or an address used solely for mailing purposes is not the address of the\r\nEntity\u2019s principal office unless such address is the only address used by the\r\nEntity and appears as the Entity's registered address in the Entity's\r\norganisational documents. Further, an address that is provided subject to\r\ninstructions to hold all mail to that address is not the address of the\r\nEntity\u2019s principal office.\nANNEX III\nLIST OF COMPETENT AUTHORITIES

The Contracting\r\nParties shall notify each other of the completion of these procedures. The\r\nAmending Protocol shall enter into force on the first day of January following\r\nthe last notification. \n2.\r\nIn respect of information exchange upon request, the exchange of information\r\nprovided for in this Amending Protocol shall be applicable to requests made on\r\nor after the date of its entry into force for information that relates to\r\nfiscal years beginning on or after the first day of January of the year of the\r\nentry into force of this Amending Protocol. Article 10 of the Agreement in the\r\nform prior to its amendment with this Amending Protocol shall continue to apply\r\nunless Article 5 of the Agreement as amended by this Amending Protocol applies.\r\n\n3. The claims of individuals in accordance with Article 9 of the\r\nAgreement in the form prior to its amendment with this Amending Protocol shall\r\nremain unaffected after the entry into force of this Amending Protocol.\n4.\r\nSwitzerland shall establish a final account by the end of the period of\r\napplicability of the Agreement in the form prior to its amendment with this\r\nAmending Protocol, make a final payment to the Member States and report the\r\ninformation, that it received from paying agents established in Switzerland, in\r\naccordance with Article 2 of the Agreement in the form prior to its amendment\r\nwith this Amending Protocol with respect to the last year of applicability of\r\nthe Agreement in the form prior to its amendment with this Amending Protocol,\r\nor to any preceding year, if applicable. \nArticle 4\nThe Agreement is supplemented by a Protocol\r\nwith the following content:\n\u201cProtocol to the Agreement between the\r\nEuropean Union and the Swiss Confederation on the automatic exchange of\r\nfinancial account information to improve international tax compliance.\nOn the occasion of the signature of this\r\nAmending Protocol between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation the\r\nduly authorized undersigned have agreed the following provisions which shall\r\nform an integral part of the Agreement as amended by this Amending Protocol:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is understood that an exchange of information under\r\nArticle 5 of this Agreement will only be requested once the requesting State\r\n(being a Member State or Switzerland) has exhausted all regular sources of information\r\navailable under the internal taxation procedure.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is understood that the Competent Authority of the\r\nrequesting State (being a Member State or Switzerland) shall provide the\r\nfollowing information to the Competent Authority of the requested State (being,\r\nrespectively, Switzerland or a Member State) when making a request for\r\ninformation under Article 5 of this Agreement:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the identity of the person under examination or\r\ninvestigation;\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the period of time for which the information is requested;\n(iii) \u00a0 a statement of the information sought including its nature\r\nand the form in which the requesting State wishes to receive the information\r\nfrom the requested State;\n(iv)\u00a0\u00a0 the tax purpose for which the information is sought;\n(v)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to the extent known, the name and address of any person\r\nbelieved to be in possession of the requested information.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is understood that the reference to \u201cforeseeable\r\nrelevance\u201d is intended to provide for exchange of information under Article 5\r\nof this Agreement to the widest possible extent and, at the same time, to\r\nclarify that Member States and Switzerland are not at liberty to engage in\r\n\u201cfishing expeditions\u201d or to request information that is unlikely to be relevant\r\nto the tax affairs of a given taxpayer. While paragraph 2 contains important\r\nprocedural requirements that are intended to ensure that fishing expeditions do\r\nnot occur, clauses (i) through (v) of paragraph 2 nevertheless are not to be\r\ninterpreted in order to frustrate effective exchange of information. The standard of \u201cforeseeable\r\nrelevance\u201d can be met both in cases dealing with one taxpayer (whether\r\nidentified by name or otherwise) or several taxpayers (whether identified by\r\nname or otherwise). \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is understood that this Agreement does not include\r\nexchange of information on a spontaneous basis.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is understood that in case of an exchange of information\r\nunder Article 5 of this Agreement, the administrative procedural rules\r\nregarding taxpayers\u2019 rights provided for in the requested State (being a Member\r\nState or Switzerland) remain applicable. It is further understood that these\r\nprovisions aim at guaranteeing the taxpayer a fair procedure and not at\r\npreventing or unduly delaying the exchange of information process.\u201d\nArticle 5\nLanguages\nThis Amending Protocol is drawn up in\r\nduplicate in the Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian,\r\nFinnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian,\r\nMaltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish\r\nlanguages, each of these language versions being equally authentic.\n\u00a0\nTo be\r\nupdated in all languages\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned\r\nPlenipotentiaries have hereunto set their hands.\nTo be\r\nupdated in all languages\nDone at [XXXX] on [XX] day of [XXXX] in the\r\nyear [XXXX].\nTo be\r\nupdated in all languages\nFor the European Union\nF\u00fcr die Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft\nPour la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration suisse\nPer la Confederazione svizzera\nDeclarations of the Contracting Parties:\nJoint declaration of\r\nthe Contracting Parties on the entry into force of the Amending Protocol\nThe Contracting Parties declare that they expect that\r\nthe constitutional requirements of Switzerland and the requirements of European\r\nUnion law concerning entering into international agreements will be fulfilled\r\nin time to enable the Amending Protocol to enter into force on the first day of\r\nJanuary 2017. They will take all the measures in their power to achieve this\r\ngoal.\nJoint declaration of\r\nthe Contracting Parties on the Agreement and the Annexes\nThe Contracting Parties agree, regarding the\r\nimplementation of the Agreement and the Annexes, that the Commentaries to the\r\nOECD Model Competent Authority Agreement and Common Reporting Standard should\r\nbe a source of illustration or interpretation in order to ensure consistency in\r\napplication.\nJoint declaration of\r\nthe Contracting Parties on Article 5 of the Agreement\nThe Contracting Parties agree, regarding the\r\nimplementation of Article 5 on Exchange of Information upon Request, that the\r\ncommentary to Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on\r\nCapital should be a source of interpretation.\nJoint declaration of\r\nthe Contracting Parties on Section III (A) of Annex I of the Agreement\nThe Contracting\r\nParties agree that they will examine the practical relevance of Section III (A)\r\nof Annex I which provides that preexisting Cash Value Insurance Contracts and\r\nAnnuity Contracts are not required to be reviewed, identified or reported,\r\nprovided the Reporting Financial Institution is effectively prevented by law\r\nfrom selling such Contracts to residents of a Reportable Jurisdiction. \nThe Contracting Parties have a common\r\ninterpretation that under Section III (A) of Annex I the Reporting Financial\r\nInstitution is effectively prevented by law from selling Cash Value Insurance\r\nContracts and Annuity Contracts to residents of a Reportable Jurisdiction only\r\nwhere the EU and domestic law of Member States or Swiss law applicable to a\r\nReporting Financial Institution resident in a Participating Jurisdiction (being\r\na Member State or Switzerland) does not only effectively prevent that Reporting\r\nFinancial Institution by law from selling Cash Value Insurance Contracts or\r\nAnnuity Contracts in a Reportable Jurisdiction (being, respectively,\r\nSwitzerland or a Member State), but those laws also effectively prevent the\r\nReporting Financial Institution by law from selling Cash Value Insurance\r\nContracts or Annuity Contracts to residents of that Reportable Jurisdiction in\r\nany other circumstances.\nIn this context, each Member State will\r\ninform the European Commission, which will in turn notify Switzerland, in case\r\nReporting Financial Institutions in Switzerland are prevented by law from\r\nselling such Contracts to its residents based on applicable EU and domestic law\r\nof that Member State. Accordingly, Switzerland will notify the European\r\nCommission, which will in turn inform Member States, in case Reporting\r\nFinancial Institutions of one or more Member States are prevented by law from\r\nselling such Contracts to Swiss residents based on Swiss law. These\r\nnotifications will be made prior to the entry into force of the Amending\r\nProtocol regarding the foreseen legal situation as of the entry into force. In\r\nthe absence of such notification it will be considered that Reporting Financial\r\nInstitutions are not effectively prevented by the law of the Reportable\r\nJurisdiction in one or more circumstances from selling Cash Value Insurance\r\nContracts or Annuity Contracts to residents of that Reportable Jurisdiction.\r\nProvided the law of the jurisdiction of the Reporting Financial Institution\r\nalso does not effectively prevent Reporting Financial Institutions from selling\r\nCash Value Insurance Contracts or Annuity Contracts to residents of the\r\nReportable Jurisdiction, Section III (A) of Annex I shall not apply to the\r\nrelevant Reporting Financial Institutions and Contracts.\nDeclaration of\r\nSwitzerland on Article 5 of the Agreement\nThe Swiss delegation has informed the\r\nEuropean Commission that Switzerland will not exchange information in relation\r\nto a request based on data obtained illegally. The European Commission took\r\nnote of the Swiss position.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
