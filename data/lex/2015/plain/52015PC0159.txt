The EU regime has been based on the pre-existing\r\nstructure of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (PMoU) on Port State Control\r\nwhich has existed since 1982. Directive 2009/16/EC (as amended) incorporates\r\nthe procedures and tools of the PMoU. All maritime EU Member States as well as\r\nCanada, Russia, Iceland and Norway are members of the PMoU.\u00a0 The European Union\r\nis not a member of the PMoU.\nSince 1 January 2011 a new inspection\r\nregime (NIR) for Port State Control is in place, both in the EU and the PMoU\r\nframeworks.\u00a0 In order for the NIR to function a certain number of decisions\r\nhave to be taken each year in the context of the PMoU. These decisions are\r\ntaken by consensus at the annual \"Port State Control Committee\"\r\n(PSCC) which meets in May of each year. By virtue of Directive 2009/16/EC\r\ndecisions taken by the appropriate competent body of the PMoU become binding on\r\nEU Member States.\nPursuant to Article 218(9) of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union, the position to be adopted on behalf of\r\nthe Union in international organisations such as the PMoU when they are called\r\nupon to adopt acts having legal effects, must be adopted by Council Decision,\r\non a proposal from the Commission.\nIt is proposed that the EU position for\r\nPSCC is established according to a two tier approach. A Council Decision sets\r\nout the guiding principles and orientations of the Union's position on a\r\nmultiannual basis, whereas it is thereafter adjusted for each annual PSCC\r\nmeeting by Commission non-papers to be discussed in the Council Shipping Working\r\nParty. This proposal aims at setting out the Union's position for PSCC for the\r\nperiod 2015-2018. It also aims at incorporating the principles and orientations\r\nof European Union policy to improve maritime safety, pollution prevention and\r\non-board living and working conditions. The Union's position also takes into\r\naccount the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty. \nThe Commission proposes this approach due\r\nto the characteristics of the decisional process in PMoU. The internal rules of\r\nthe PMoU fix the latest date for submission of any documents by its members and\r\nthe task forces charged with the development of guidelines and instructions at\r\nsix weeks before the meeting of the PSCC. It is only at that point that all\r\nsubmissions are available and the Commission can begin its analysis with a view\r\nto preparing a proposal for a coordinated Union position under Article 218(9)\r\nof the TFEU which has then to be adopted by the Council. As the time available\r\nfor this analysis, the preparation of the Commission proposal and its adoption\r\nby Council is short, the process for the year to year specification of the\r\nUnion position is set out in Annex II. The following Decision shall cover the\r\nperiod 2015-2018.\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe following Decision is based on the Treaty\r\non the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) which provides that the Council, on a proposal\r\nfrom the Commission shall adopt a decision establishing the positions to be\r\nadopted on the Union's behalf in a body set up by an agreement, when that body\r\nis called upon to adopt acts having legal effects. This shall apply to the\r\nposition to be adopted by the Member States, on behalf of the Union, in the\r\nPSCC of the PMoU. \nDirective 2009/16/EC of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on port State control (as\r\namended) is the legal basis setting up the principles\r\nto be adhered to by the Member States within the PSCC of the PMoU.\u00a0 \n2015/0081 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf\r\nof the European Union, in the Port State Control Committee of the Paris\r\nMemorandum of Understanding on Port State Control\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maritime\r\nsafety, pollution prevention and on-board living and working conditions may be effectively\r\nenhanced through a drastic reduction of substandard ships from European Union\r\nwaters, by strictly applying Conventions, international codes and resolutions. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While\r\nthe primary responsibility for monitoring the compliance of ships with the international\r\nstandards for safety, pollution prevention and on-board living and working\r\nconditions lies with the flag State, responsibility for maintenance of the\r\ncondition of the ship and its equipment after survey to comply with the\r\nrequirements of Conventions applicable to the ship lies with the ship company.\r\nThere has however, been a serious failure on the part of a number of flag\r\nStates to implement and enforce international standards.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore,\r\nas a second line of defence against substandard shipping, the monitoring of\r\ncompliance with the international standards for safety, pollution prevention\r\nand on-board living and working conditions should also be ensured by port\r\nStates, while recognising that port State control inspection is not a survey and\r\nthe relevant inspection forms are not seaworthiness certificates. A harmonised\r\napproach to the effective enforcement of these international standards by EU\r\ncoastal Member States in respect of ships sailing in the waters under their\r\njurisdiction and using their ports should avoid distortions of competition.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive\r\n2009/16/EC[2] (as amended), sets out the EU regime on port State control\r\nreformulating and reinforcing the previous EU legislation in this field in\r\nplace since 1995. The EU regime is based on the pre-existing structure of the\r\nParis Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control, an international\r\norganisation which has existed since 1982. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nregards EU Member States, Directive 2009/16/EC effectively brings the\r\nprocedures, tools and work of the PMoU on Port State control within the scope\r\nof EU law. By virtue of Directive 2009/16/EC decisions taken by the appropriate\r\ncompetent body of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control\r\nbecome binding on EU Member States.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPort State Control Committee of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port\r\nState Control meets each year and during its deliberations decides on a number\r\nof agenda items necessary for the operation of Directive 2009/16/EC. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant\r\nto Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the\r\nposition to be adopted on behalf of the Union in international organsiations\r\nwhen they are called upon to adopt acts having legal effects, must be adopted\r\nby Council decision, on a proposal from the Commission.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ninternal rules of the PMoU fix the latest date for submission of any documents\r\nby its members and the task forces charged with the development of guidelines\r\nand instructions at six weeks before the meeting of PSCC. It is only at that point\r\nthat all submissions are available and the Commission can begin its analysis\r\nwith a view to preparing a proposal for a coordinated Union position under\r\nArticle 218(9) of the TFEU. As the time available for this analysis and for the\r\nadoption of a proposal is short, it is necessary to establish the guiding\r\nprinciples and orientations of the Union's position on a multiannual basis,\r\ntogether with the framework for the year-to-year specification of the Union\r\nposition. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\r\ndecision should cover the period 2015-2018.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe\r\nposition to be taken by the European Union in the annual Port State Control\r\nCommittee of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control when\r\nthat body is called upon to adopt decisions having legal effects is set out in\r\nAnnex I to this Decision.\nArticle 2 \nThe\r\nyear-to-year specification of the Union position to be taken in the annual Port\r\nState Control Committee of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State\r\nControl shall be conducted in accordance with Annex II to this Decision.\nArticle 3\nThe\r\nUnion position set out in Annex I to the present Decision shall be assessed\r\nand, where appropriate, revised by the Council upon a proposal from the\r\nCommission, at the latest for the annual Port State Control Committee of the\r\nParis Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control in 2018.\nArticle 4\nThis\r\nDecision shall enter into force on \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council of 23 April 2009 on port State control (Recast) (OJ L 131,\r\n28.5.2009, p. 57)\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 131, 28.5.2009, p. 57\nANNEX\nThe Union position in the Paris Memorandum\r\nof Understanding on Port State Control\nto the\nProposal for a Council Decision\non the position to be adopted, on\r\nbehalf of the European Union, in the Port State Control Committee of the Paris\r\nMemorandum of Understanding on Port State Control\nGuiding Principles\nIn the framework of the Paris Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding on Port State Control (PMoU), the Union shall:\n(a)                   \r\nact in accordance with the objectives pursued by\r\nthe Union, notably to improve maritime safety, pollution prevention and\r\non-board living and working conditions\u00a0 through a drastic reduction of\r\nsubstandard ships by strictly applying international Conventions and codes;\n(b)                   \r\npromote the implementation of a harmonised\r\napproach by Members of the PMoU to the effective enforcement of these\r\ninternational standards in respect of ships sailing in the waters under their\r\njurisdiction and using their ports;
