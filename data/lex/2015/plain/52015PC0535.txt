By Council Decision 97/836/EC, the Union acceded to the Revised 1958 Agreement.\n\n\nWP.29 agreed, at its 150th session in March 2010, to consider actions on the future direction for the harmonisation of vehicle regulations under the Revised 1958 Agreement, with the aim of fostering the participation of more countries and regional economic integration organisations in the activities of the World Forum and increasing the number of Contracting Parties to the Revised 1958 Agreement. This review should also aim at enhancing the functioning and reliability of the Revised 1958 Agreement, and at ensuring that it remains the key international framework for the harmonisation of technical regulations in the automotive sector.\n\n\nThe Commission obtained in July 2013 an authorisation from the Council to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, proposals for the revision of the Agreement. For that purpose it has steered the task force of the informal working group established by WP.29 to develop proposals for revising the Agreement. The result of that work was presented to WP.29 in March 2014 and WP.29 decided to \"freeze\" the draft proposals to enable Contracting Parties to start their national procedures for assessing these proposals. In November 2014 a number of Contracting Parties jointly submitted a proposal to WP.29 to increase the majority voting threshold, for establishing new UN Regulations and amendments to existing UN Regulations, from two-thirds to four-fifths.\n\n\nIn Commission Staff Working document SWD (2014) 178 final of 28 May 2014, entitled 'Progress report on the 2013 activities of the World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations' it is anticipated that if the matter of raising the majority voting threshold finds a positive solution, the chances to attract as new contracting parties such important EU partners as India, China, the ASEAN countries and even Brazil would be much higher. Also the CARS 2020 Action Plan recognises that the acceptance of internationally harmonised vehicle regulations established under the 1958 Agreement by the EU\u2019s trading partners is the best way to remove non-tariff barriers to trade, and that therefore the attractiveness of the 1958 Agreement needs to be enhanced. Having assessed the proposals for revising the Agreement, including the request to increase of the majority voting threshold to four-fifths, in the light of the above, it can be concluded that they are meeting the objectives of making the Agreement more attractive for third countries and at the same time increasing its effectiveness and reliability.\n\n\nTherefore, the European Union, as Contracting Party to the Agreement, should take the necessary steps towards the adoption of the proposed amendments to the 1958 Agreement in accordance with the procedures set out in Article 5(1) and Annex III, point 3 of Council Decision 97/836/EC. These procedures provide that the Council shall, on a proposal by the Commission, adopt a decision to conclude the revision of the Agreement and to submit, on behalf of the Union, the proposed amendments to the Agreement to the Contracting Parties. Article 13(1) of the Agreement provides that this shall be done by means of a notification of the text of the proposed amendment to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall transmit it to all Contracting Parties. \n\n\nArticle 13(2) and (3) of the Agreement specify that the proposed amendments shall be deemed to be accepted if no Contracting Party expresses an objection within a period of six months following the date of transmission of the proposed amendment by the Secretary-General. Considering the need for the consent of all Contracting Parties to the Agreement, WP.29 decided to organise an informal vote to verify whether all Contracting Parties to the current Agreement can accept to the proposed amendment, prior to launching the procedure for amending the Agreement under Article 13. Therefore, the Commission should be authorised to vote, on behalf of the EU, in favour of the proposed amendments.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nRegular consultations on the draft proposals for reviewing the Revised 1958 Agreement have taken place with all stakeholders in the automotive sector, by means of an exchange of views in the context of the Motor Vehicles Working Group. During the negotiations, consultation with the Member States has taken place in the context of the Technical Committee Motor Vehicles (TCMV) as provided for in the negotiation directives the Council issued in July 2013. Representatives of Member States and industry associations also participated in the informal working group set up by WP.29 and in particular the task force for preparing the draft proposals for revision 3 of the Agreement, which was chaired by the Commission services.\n\n\nThis consultation has enabled to achieve a consensus on the draft proposals for Revision 3 of the Agreement as developed by the informal group and submitted to WP.29, as well as to obtain a positive response to the proposal to increase the majority voting threshold for the establishment of UN Regulations and amendments thereto.\n\n\nNo Impact Assessment was conducted for this Decision, but a cost-benefit study has been carried out by the Commission services with a view to verifying that the envisaged changes to the Agreement will achieve the expected benefits in terms of making the Agreement more attractive and as a result enhance the global competitiveness of the EU automotive industry through facilitating market access in countries that may join the Agreement after its revision.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE DECISION\n\n\nThe legal basis for this Decision is Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as specified in Article 5(1) of Council Decision 97/836/EC.\n\n\nThe envisaged changes to the Agreement would address the procedures for developing, amending and adopting technical regulations for motor vehicles, and their implementation by Contracting Parties, as well as the conditions for granting type approvals and their mutual recognition, and as such will continue to serve as a basis for granting approvals under EU type-approval legislation. \n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \n\n\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union budget.\n\n\n5.OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \n\n\nThe proposed act does not concern an EEA matter and should therefore not extend to the European Economic Area.\n\n\n\n\n\n2015/0249 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the conclusion of Revision 3 of the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for the reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions ('Revised 1958 Agreement')\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 thereof, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to Council Decision 97/836/EC of 27 November 1997 on the accession by the European Community to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for the reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions\n1\n, and in particular Article 5(1) and Annex III, point 3 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for the reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (hereinafter referred to as 'the Agreement') entered into force on 16 October 1995.\n\n\n(2)Article 13 of the Agreement provides for amendments regarding the Agreement itself and of its Appendices to be adopted by means of a notification by a Contracting Party of the text of the proposed amendments to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall transmit it to all Contracting Parties. If no Contracting Party expresses an objection within a period of six months following the date of transmission of the proposed amendments by the Secretary-General, the amendments shall enter into force for all Contracting Parties three months after the expiry of that six months\u2019 period. \n\n\n(3)WP.29 agreed, at its 150th session in March 2010, to establish an informal group with a view to assisting WP.29 in considering actions on the future direction for the harmonisation of vehicle regulations under the Revised 1958 Agreement. This future direction should aim at fostering the participation of more countries and regional economic integration organisations in the activities of the World Forum and to increase the number of Contracting Parties to the Revised 1958 Agreement, by improving its functioning and reliability, and thus ensuring that it remains the key international framework for the harmonisation of technical regulations in the automotive sector. \n\n\n(4)On 15 July 2013 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations within WP.29 for amending the Agreement. The Commission has negotiated, on behalf of the Union, proposals for amending the Agreement within the informal group established by WP.29.\n\n\n(5)WP.29 at its 162th session in March 2014 took note of the proposals for Revision 3 of the 1958 Agreement prepared by the informal group and invited Contracting Parties to the Agreement to start their national procedures of consideration of the proposals for amending the Agreement.\n\n\n(6)At its 164th session in November 2014 WP.29 took note of a proposal submitted by a number of Contracting Parties to the Agreement to increase the voting majority threshold, for the establishment of new UN Regulations and amendments to existing UN Regulations, from the two-thirds to a four-fifths majority. The representative of the EU announced the intention to establish a coordinated position of the EU Member States on this proposal.\n\n\n(7)The proposals for Revision 3 of the Agreement and for increasing the voting majority threshold from two-thirds to four-fifths meet the negotiation objectives specified in the Council Decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations within WP.29 for Revision 3 of the Agreement. \n\n\n(8)Therefore, Articles 1 to 15 and Appendices 1 and 2 of the Agreement should be amended accordingly.\n\n\n(9)Those amendments to the Agreement should be approved on behalf of the European Union.\n\n\n\n\n(10)An informal vote will be organised by WP.29 to verify whether the consent of all Contracting Parties can be obtained on those amendments to the Agreement before launching the procedure specified in Article 13 for amending the Agreement. The Union should vote in favour of those modifications.\n\n\n(11)After the informal vote in WP.29 has confirmed that consent of all Contracting Parties on the proposed amendments to the Agreement has been obtained, the President of the Council should nominate the representative of the European Union empowered to notify, as provided for in Annex III, point 3 of Council Decision 97/836/EC, the text of the proposed amendments to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 13.1 of the Agreement.\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nRevision 3 of the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for the reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions is hereby approved on behalf of the Union. \n\n\nThe text of Revision 3 of the Agreement is attached to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe President of the Council shall designate the person empowered to proceed, on behalf of the European Union, with the notification provided for in Article 13.1 of the Agreement, in order to initiate the procedure for the conclusion of Revision 3 of the Agreement and to express the consent of the European Union to be bound by Revision 3 of the Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Union\n2\n.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ L 346, 17.12.1997, p. 78.\n\n\n\n(2)\nThe date of entry into

27.10.2015\nCOM(2015) 535 final\nANNEX\nto the\nCouncil Decision\non the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of Revision 3 of the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for the reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions ('Revised 1958 Agreement')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX\n\n\nAgreement concerning the Adoption of Harmonized Technical United Nations Regulations for Wheeled Vehicles, Equipment and Parts which can be Fitted and/or be Used on Wheeled Vehicles and the Conditions for Reciprocal Recognition of Approvals Granted on the Basis of these United Nations Regulations\n1\n\n\n\nRevision 3\n\n\nPreamble\n\n\nTHE CONTRACTING PARTIES,\n\n\nHAVING DECIDED to amend the Agreement Concerning the Adoption of Uniform Conditions of Approval and Reciprocal Recognition of Approval for Motor Vehicle Equipment and Parts, done at Geneva on 20 March 1958, as amended on 16\u00a0October 1995, and,\n\n\nDESIRING to reduce technical barriers to international trade by defining harmonized technical UN Regulations that it will suffice for certain wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts to fulfil in order to be used in their countries or regions,\n\n\nRECOGNIZING the importance of safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency and anti-theft performance of wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts, which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles for the development of regulations that are technically and economically feasible and adapted to technical progress,\n\n\nDESIRING to apply these UN Regulations whenever possible in their countries or regions,\n\n\nDESIRING to facilitate the acceptance in their countries of the vehicles, equipment and parts, where approved according to these UN Regulations by the approval authorities of another Contracting Party,\n\n\nDESIRING to establish an International Whole Vehicle Type Approval scheme (IWVTA) within the framework of the Agreement to increase the advantages of individual UN Regulations annexed to the Agreement and so create opportunities to simplify implementation by Contracting Parties and the wider adoption of mutual recognition of type approvals for whole vehicles, and,\n\n\nDESIRING to increase the number of Contracting Parties to the Agreement by improving its functioning and reliability, and thus ensure that it remains the key international framework for the harmonization of technical regulations in the automotive sector,\n\n\nHAVE AGREED as follows:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n1.The Contracting Parties shall establish, through an Administrative Committee made up of all the Contracting Parties in conformity with the rules of procedure set out in the appendix to this Agreement and on the basis of the following articles and paragraphs, UN\u00a0Regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles. Conditions for granting type approvals and their reciprocal recognition will be included for use by Contracting Parties which choose to implement Regulations through type approval.\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n\nThe term \"wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts\" shall include any wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts whose characteristics have a bearing on vehicle safety, protection of the environment, energy saving and the performance of anti-theft technology;\n\n\nThe term \"type approval pursuant to a UN Regulation\" indicates an administrative procedure by which the approval authorities of one Contracting Party declare, after carrying out the required verifications that a type of vehicle, equipment or part submitted by the manufacturer conforms to the requirements of the given UN\u00a0Regulation. Afterwards the manufacturer certifies that each vehicle, equipment or parts put on the market were produced to be identical with the approved product.\n\n\nThe term \"whole vehicle type approval\" indicates that type approvals granted pursuant to applicable UN Regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts of a vehicle are integrated into an approval of the whole vehicle according to the provisions of the administrative IWVTA system.\n\n\n\n\nThe term \"version of a UN Regulation\" indicates that a UN Regulation, following its adoption and establishment, may subsequently be amended following the procedures described in this Agreement, in particular Article 12. The unamended UN\u00a0Regulation as well as the UN Regulation, after integration of any subsequent amendment(s), are considered to be separate versions of that UN Regulation.\n\n\nThe term \"applying a UN Regulation\" indicates that a UN Regulation enters into force for a Contracting Party. When doing so, Contracting Parties have the possibility to keep their own national/regional legislation. If they wish, they may substitute their national/regional legislation by the requirements of the UN Regulations they are applying, but they are not bound by the Agreement to do so. However, Contracting Parties shall accept, as an alternative to the relevant part of their national/regional legislation, UN type approvals granted pursuant to the latest version of UN Regulations applied in their country/region. The rights and obligations of Contracting Parties applying a UN Regulation are detailed in the various articles of this Agreement.\n\n\nFor the application of the UN Regulations there could be various administrative procedures alternative to type approval. The only alternative procedure generally known and applied in certain member states of the Economic Commission for Europe is the self-certification by which the manufacturer certifies, without any preliminary administrative control, that each product put on the market conforms to the given UN Regulation; the competent administrative authorities may verify by random sampling on the market that the self-certified products comply with the requirements of the given UN Regulation.\n\n\n2.The Administrative Committee shall be composed of all the Contracting Parties in accordance with the rules of procedure set out in the appendix.\n\n\nA UN Regulation, after having been established in accordance with the procedure indicated in the appendix, shall be communicated by the Administrative Committee to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, hereinafter called \"Secretary-General\". As soon as possible thereafter, the Secretary-General shall give notification of this UN Regulation to the Contracting Parties.\n\n\nThe UN Regulation will be considered as adopted unless, within a period of six months from its notification by the Secretary-General, more than one-fifth of the Contracting Parties at the time of notification have informed the Secretary-General of their disagreement with the UN Regulation.\n\n\nThe UN Regulation shall cover the following:\n\n\n(a)Wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts concerned;\n\n\n(b)Technical requirements, which shall be performance oriented wherever appropriate and not design-restrictive, that give objective consideration to available technologies, costs and benefits as appropriate, and may include alternatives;\n\n\n(c)Test methods by which any performance requirements are to be demonstrated;\n\n\n(d)Conditions for granting type approval and their reciprocal recognition including administrative provisions, any approval markings and conditions for ensuring conformity of production;\n\n\n(e)The date(s) on which the UN Regulation enters into force, including the date when Contracting Parties applying it can issue approvals pursuant to that UN Regulation, and the date from which they shall accept approvals (if different);\n\n\n(f)An information document to be provided by the manufacturer.\n\n\nThe UN Regulation may, if needed, include references to the laboratories accredited by the approval authorities where acceptance tests of the types of wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts submitted for approval shall be carried out.\n\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned UN Regulations, this Agreement provides for establishing a UN Regulation to introduce a system of Whole Vehicle Type Approval. This UN Regulation shall set the scope, administrative procedures, and technical requirements that can include different levels of stringency in one version of the said UN Regulation.\n\n\nNotwithstanding other provisions of Article 1 and Article 12, a Contracting Party applying the UN Regulation on IWVTA shall only be obliged to accept those type approvals granted pursuant to the highest level of stringency of the latest version of the said UN Regulation.\n\n\nThis Agreement also includes Schedules of Administrative and Procedural Provisions applicable to all UN Regulations annexed to this Agreement and to all Contracting Parties applying one or more UN Regulations.\n\n\n3.When a UN Regulation has been adopted, the Secretary-General shall so notify as soon as possible all the Contracting Parties, specifying which Contracting Parties have objected, or have notified their agreement but have the intention not to begin applying the UN Regulation at the date of entry into force, and in respect of which the UN Regulation shall not enter into force.\n\n\n4.The adopted UN Regulation shall enter into force on the date(s) specified therein as a UN Regulation annexed to this Agreement for all Contracting Parties which have not notified either their disagreement or their intention not to apply it on that date.\n\n\n5.When depositing its instrument of accession, any new Contracting Party may declare that it will not apply certain UN Regulations then annexed to this Agreement or that it will not apply any of them. If, at that time, the procedure laid down in paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of this Article is in progress for a draft or adopted UN Regulation, the Secretary-General shall communicate such draft or adopted UN Regulation to the new Contracting Party and it shall enter into force as a UN Regulation for the new Contracting Party unless this Contracting Party notifies its disagreement with the adopted UN Regulation within a period of six months after the deposit of its instrument of accession. The Secretary-General shall notify all the Contracting Parties of the date of such entry into force. The Secretary-General shall also communicate to them all declarations concerning the non-application of certain UN Regulations that any Contracting Party may make in accordance with the terms of this paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n6.Any Contracting Party applying a UN Regulation may at any time notify the Secretary-General, subject to one year's notice, about its intention to cease applying that UN Regulation. Such notification shall be communicated by the Secretary-General to the other Contracting Parties.\n\n\nApprovals previously granted pursuant to that UN Regulation by that Contracting Party shall remain valid unless they are withdrawn in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.\n\n\nIf a Contracting Party ceases to issue approvals to a UN Regulation it shall:\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maintain proper supervision on conformity of production of products for which it previously granted type approval;\n\n\n(b)Take the necessary steps set out in Article 4 when advised of non-conformity by a Contracting Party that continues to apply the UN Regulation;\n\n\n(c)Continue to notify the other Contracting Parties of withdrawal of approvals as set out in Article 5;\n\n\n(d)Continue to grant extensions to existing approvals.\n\n\n7.Any Contracting Party not applying a UN Regulation may at any time notify the Secretary-General that it intends henceforth to apply it and the UN Regulation will then enter into force for this Party on the sixtieth day after this notification. The Secretary-General shall notify all the Contracting Parties of every entry into force of a UN Regulation for a new Contracting Party affected in accordance with the terms of this paragraph.\n\n\n8.The Contracting Parties for which a UN Regulation is in force shall hereinafter be referred to as \"the Contracting Parties applying a UN Regulation\".\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\n1.Each Contracting Party applying UN Regulations largely through type approval shall grant the type approvals and approval markings described in any UN Regulation for the types of wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts covered by the UN Regulation, provided that it has the technical competence and is satisfied with the arrangements for ensuring conformity of the product with the approved type. Each Contracting Party which grants type approval shall take the necessary measures as set out in Schedule 1 annexed to this Agreement to verify that adequate arrangements have been made to ensure that wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts are manufactured in conformity with the approved type.\n\n\n2.Each Contracting Party issuing type approvals pursuant to a UN Regulation shall specify an approval authority for the UN Regulation. The approval authority shall have the responsibility for all aspects of type approval pursuant to the said UN Regulation. This approval authority may designate Technical Services to carry out on its behalf the testing and inspections necessary for the verifications required in paragraph 1 of this article. Contracting Parties shall ensure that Technical Services are assessed, designated and notified in accordance with the requirements set out in Schedule 2 annexed to this Agreement.\n\n\n3.The type approvals, approval markings and identifiers for the types of wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts shall be specified in the UN Regulation and granted in accordance with the procedures set out in Schedules 3 to 5 annexed to this Agreement.\n\n\n4.Each Contracting Party applying a UN Regulation shall refuse to grant the type approvals and approval markings covered by the UN Regulation if the above-mentioned conditions are not complied with.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\n1.Wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts for which type approvals have been issued by a Contracting Party in accordance with Article 2 of this Agreement shall be held to be in conformity with the relevant part of the national legislation of all the Contracting Parties applying the said UN Regulation.\n\n\n2.Contracting Parties applying UN Regulations shall, by mutual recognition, accept for the placement in their markets, and subject to the provisions of Articles 1, 8 and 12 as well as any special provisions within these UN Regulations, type approvals granted pursuant to these UN Regulations, without requiring any further testing, documentation, certification or marking concerning these type approvals.\n\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\n1.Should a Contracting Party applying a UN Regulation find that certain wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts bearing approval markings issued under the said UN Regulation by one of the Contracting Parties do not conform to the approved types or the requirements of the said UN Regulation, it shall advise the approval authority of the Contracting Party which issued the approval.\n\n\nThe Contracting Party that issued the approval shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the non-conformity is rectified.\n\n\n\n\n2.When the non-conformity is due to non-compliance with the technical requirements specified in a UN Regulation, as referred to in Article 1.2.(b), the Contracting Party that issued the approval shall immediately inform all other Contracting Parties about the situation and shall provide regular advice to Contracting Parties of the steps it is taking, which may include, if necessary, the withdrawal of the approval.\n\n\nAfter having considered the potential impact on vehicle safety, protection of the environment, energy saving or the performance of anti-theft technology, Contracting Parties may prohibit the sale and use of such wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts in their territory until this non-conformity is rectified. In such a case, these Contracting Parties shall inform the secretariat of the Administrative Committee of the measures taken. For resolution of disputes between the Contracting Parties, the procedure provided in Article 10.4 shall apply.\n\n\n3.Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, if a non-conforming product, as referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, has not been brought into conformity within a period of three months, the Contracting Party responsible for the approval shall temporarily or permanently withdraw the approval. By exception, this period may be extended by a period not exceeding three months unless one or more Contracting Parties applying the concerned UN Regulation object. When the period is being extended, the Contracting Party that issued the approval shall, within the initial three-month period, notify all Contracting Parties applying the concerned UN Regulation of its intention to extend the period in which the non-conformity shall be rectified and provide a justification for such extension.\n\n\n4.When the non-conformity is due to non-compliance with the administrative provisions, approval markings, conditions for conformity of production or the information document specified in a UN Regulation, as referred to in Article 1.2.(d) and 1.2.(f), the Contracting Party that issued the approval shall temporarily or permanently withdraw the approval if the non-conformity has not been rectified within a period of six months.\n\n\n5.Paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article also apply in the situation where the Contracting Party responsible for issuing of the approval itself finds that certain wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts bearing approval markings do not conform to the approved types or the requirements of a UN Regulation.\n\n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\n1.The approval authorities of each Contracting Party applying UN Regulations shall send upon request from the other Contracting Parties, a list of the wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts of which it has refused to grant or has withdrawn approvals.\n\n\n2.In addition, on receiving a request from another Contracting Party applying a UN Regulation, it shall send forthwith, in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 5 annexed to this Agreement, to that Contracting Party a copy of all relevant information on which it based its decision to grant, refuse to grant, or to withdraw an approval of a wheeled vehicle, equipment or part pursuant to that UN Regulation.\n\n\n3.The paper copy may be replaced by an electronic file in accordance with Schedule 5 annexed to this Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 6\n\n\n1.Member states of the Economic Commission for Europe, countries admitted to the Commission in a consultative capacity in accordance with paragraph 8 of the Commission's Terms of Reference, and regional economic integration organizations set up by member states of the Economic Commission for Europe to which their member states have transferred powers in the fields covered by this Agreement, including the power to make binding decisions on their member states, may become Contracting Parties to this Agreement.\n\n\nFor the determination of the number of votes referred to in Article 1, paragraph 2 and in Article 12, paragraph 2, regional economic integration organizations vote with the number of votes of their member states being members of the Economic Commission for Europe.\n\n\n2.Member states of the United Nations may participate in certain activities of the Economic Commission for Europe in accordance with paragraph 11 of the Commission's Terms of Reference and regional economic integration organizations of such countries to which their member states have transferred powers in the fields covered by this Agreement including power to make binding decisions on their member states may become Contracting Parties to this Agreement. \n\n\nFor the determination of the number of votes referred to in Article 1, paragraph 2 and in Article 12, paragraph 2, regional economic integration organizations vote with the number of votes of their member states being members of the United Nations.\n\n\n3.Accession to this Agreement by new Contracting Parties which are not Parties to the 1958 Agreement shall be effected by the deposit of an instrument with the Secretary-General, after the entry into force of this Agreement.\n\n\n\nArticle 7\n\n\n1.This Agreement shall be deemed to enter into force nine months after the date of its transmission by the Secretary-General to all the Contracting Parties to the 1958 Agreement.\n\n\n2.This Agreement shall be deemed not to enter into force if any objection from the Contracting Parties to the 1958 Agreement is expressed within a period of six months following the date of its transmission to them by the Secretary-General.\n\n\n3.For any new Contracting Party acceding to this Agreement, this Agreement shall enter into force on the sixtieth day after the deposit of the instrument of accession.\n\n\nArticle 8\n\n\n\n\n1.Any Contracting Party may denounce this Agreement by notifying the Secretary-General.\n\n\n2.Denunciation shall take effect twelve months after the date of receipt by the Secretary-General of such notification.\n\n\n3.Any type approvals granted by the Contracting Party shall remain valid for a period of twelve months after the denunciation has taken effect in accordance with Article 8.2.\n\n\nArticle 9\n\n\n1.Any Contracting Party as defined in Article 6 of this Agreement may, at the time of accession or at any time thereafter, declare by notification addressed to the Secretary-General that this Agreement shall extend to all or any of the territories for whose international relations it is responsible.

A consolidated, updated version of the information documents and test reports, accompanied by a detailed description of the modification, shall be deemed to meet this requirement.\n\n\n2.6.The amendment to a UN type approval shall be designated as an \"extension\" if, in addition to the change of the data recorded in the information documents:\n\n\n(a)Further inspections or tests are required; or\n\n\n(b)Any information on the communication document (with the exception of its attachments) has changed; or\n\n\n(c)Approval to a later series of amendments is requested after its entry into force, which can be granted provided that the requirements of a later series of amendments are fulfilled.\n\n\n2.7.Confirmation or refusal of amending the UN type approval, specifying the alterations, shall be communicated to the Contracting Parties to the 1958 Agreement applying the UN Regulation by means of a communication form. In addition, the index to the information documents and to the test reports, attached to the communication document, shall be amended accordingly to show the date of the most recent revision or extension.\n\n\n2.8.The type approval authority granting the extension of approval shall update the approval number with an extension number incremented in accordance with the number of successive extensions already granted in accordance with Schedule 4 annexed to the 1958 Agreement and issue a revised communication form denoted by this extension number.\n\n\n\n\nSchedule 4\n\n\nNumbering of UN type approvals\n\n\n1.As from the entry into force of the 1958 Agreement, Contracting Parties shall issue a type approval number according to paragraph 1.10 of Schedule\u00a03 for each new type approval and each extension of such an approval.\n\n\n2.As from the entry into force of the 1958 Agreement and notwithstanding that the provisions on approval markings in any version of UN Regulations may have stipulated otherwise, the manufacturer shall affix an approval mark, if requested, according the provisions of the relevant UN Regulations, however, utilizing in that marking the first two digits of Section 2 and the digits of Section 3 of the approval number as mentioned in this Schedule as approval number to each wheeled vehicle, equipment or part for which a new approval has been granted or for which such approvals have been extended. However, this provision does not apply where a UN Regulation requires an approval code or an identification code to be used in the approval mark instead of an approval number. The leading zeros to Section 3 may be omitted.\n\n\n3.An approval number shall be assigned to each type-approved. The type approval number shall consist of 4 sections. Each section shall be separated by the '*' character.\n\n\nSection 1:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The capital letter 'E' followed by the distinguishing number of the Contracting Party which has granted the type approval.\n\n\nSection 2:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The number of the relevant UN Regulation, followed by the letter 'R', successively followed by:\n\n\n(a)Two digits (with leading zeros as applicable) indicating the series of amendments incorporating the technical provisions of the UN Regulation applied to the approval (00 for the UN Regulation in its original form),\n\n\n(b)A slash and two digits (with leading zeros as applicable) indicating the number of supplement to the series of amendments applied to the approval (00 for the series of amendments in its original form),\n\n\n\n\n(c)A slash and one or two character(s) indicating the implementing stage, if applicable.\n\n\nSection 3:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A four-digit sequential number (with leading zeros as applicable). The sequence shall start from 0001.\n\n\nSection 4:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A two-digit sequential number (with leading zeros if applicable) to denote the extension. The sequence shall start from 00.\n\n\nAll digits shall be Arabic digits.\n\n\n4.The same Contracting Party shall not assign the same number to another approval.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\nExample of the second extension to the fourth type approval issued by the Netherlands according to UN Regulation No. 58 in its original version:\n\n\nE4*58R00/00*0004*02\n\n\nExample of the first extension to the 2439th type approval issued by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for a vehicle approval according to UN Regulation No. 83, third series of amendments, version for a vehicle of category M, N1 Class I with regard to the emission of pollutants according to engine fuel requirements:\n\n\nE11*83R03/00J*2439*01\n\n\n\n\nSchedule 5\n\n\nCirculation of approval documentation\n\n\n1.Where an approval authority is required to or is requested to provide a copy of an approval and its attachments, it shall send the documents as paper copies, or by e-mail in electronic format, or by utilizing the secure internet database established by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.\n\n\n2.Documents stored on the secure internet database shall consist of at least the documents specified in each UN Regulation. These shall include documentation communicating to Contracting Parties notice of approval, of extension, of refusal or withdrawal of approval or where production is definitely discontinued of a type of wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts pursuant to the UN Regulation.\n\n\n3.If the type approvals applicable to a wheeled vehicles, equipment or parts are stored on the secure internet database, then the approval markings required by UN Regulations may be replaced by a Unique Identifier\n\npreceded by the symbol, unless specified otherwise in the UN Regulations. Such unique identifier shall be generated by the database automatically.\n\n\n4.All Contracting Parties applying a UN Regulation shall have access to the information for that UN Regulation contained in the database by using the Unique Identifier and this will provide access to the relevant information relating to the specific approval(s).\n\n\n5.UN Regulations annexed to the 1958 Agreement may require the circulation of type approvals by electronic copies utilizing the secure internet database, where necessary for the efficient operation of the approval process, subject to the access rights as defined by the Contracting Parties.\n\n\n\n\nSchedule 6\n\n\nProcedures for resolving interpretation issues in relation to the application of UN Regulations and granting approvals pursuant to these UN Regulations\n\n\n1.Interpretation issues prior to UN type approval being granted\n\n\n\n\nWhen an application for UN type approval requires the approval authority to make a significant interpretation on the application of the UN Regulation, or if so requested by the applicant for approval, the approval authority shall actively inform and seek guidance from other approval authorities before making a decision.\n\n\nThe approval authority concerned shall notify the other approval authorities applying the UN Regulation of the issue and of their proposed solution for the interpretation, including any supporting information from the manufacturer. As a general rule, this should be done via electronic media. A period of fourteen days shall be allowed for replies from the other approval authorities.\n\n\n(a)The approval authority having taken account of any comments received, can then grant approvals in accordance with the new interpretation.\n\n\n(b)If it is not possible to take a decision according to the comments received, the approval authority shall seek further clarification by means of the procedure described in paragraph 3 below.\n\n\n2.Interpretation issues subsequent to UN type approval being granted\n\n\nIn situations where different interpretations exist between Contracting Parties but subsequent to an approval being issued the following procedures shall be followed.\n\n\nIn the first instance, the Contracting Parties concerned shall seek to resolve the issue by mutual agreement. This will require liaison and for each Contracting Party to review the procedures used to test and approve the wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts being the subject of the interpretation dispute. The following procedures will be applied:\n\n\n(a)In the event of an error being acknowledged by an approval authority, the approval authority shall take an action in accordance with the provisions of the 1958 Agreement, and in particular its Article 4.\n\n\n(b)Where agreement is reached which necessitates a new or different interpretation of existing practice (by either Contracting Party), then this shall be communicated to other Contracting Parties applying the UN Regulation concerned as a matter of urgency. The other Parties shall have fourteen days to comment upon the decision, following which the approval authorities, having taken account of any comments received, can issue UN type approvals in accordance with the new interpretation.\n\n\n(c)Where agreement cannot be reached, then the Contracting Parties concerned shall seek further review by the arbitration process described in paragraph 3 below.\n\n\n(d)In any event, the matter shall be brought to the attention of the competent Working Party subsidiary to the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29). If deemed necessary, the subsidiary Working Party shall submit to WP.29 proposals for suitable regulatory amendments aimed at resolving the difference of interpretations.\n\n\n3.Arbitration process through WP.29 and its subsidiary Working Parties\n\n\nThe Chairs of the subsidiary Working Parties shall identify the issues arising from diverging interpretations between Contracting Parties in relation to the application of UN Regulations and the granting of UN type approvals pursuant to these UN Regulations, with a view to put in place measures at the earliest opportunity to resolve the different interpretations.\n\n\nThe Chairs of the Working Parties shall develop suitable procedures to deal with such interpretation issues, in order to be able to demonstrate to WP.29 that:\n\n\n(a)Full consideration is given to the different opinions by the approval authorities of the Contracting Parties concerned, as well as to the views of other Contracting Parties applying the UN Regulation;\n\n\n(b)Decisions are based upon appropriate technical advice, taking full account of the subject area;\n\n\n(c)Wherever possible, a unanimous decision is reached; and\n\n\n(d)Procedures are transparent and auditable.\n\n\nIf it is necessary to resolve the issue, the Chair may submit a new agenda item on the issue to the next available session of the subsidiary Working Party, without obtaining prior approval from WP.29. In these circumstances, the Chair shall report on the progress to WP.29 at the earliest opportunity.\n\n\nAt the end of the arbitration process, the Chair shall provide a report to WP.29.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.Where the issue can be resolved within the current regulatory framework:\n\n\nThe interpretation of the UN Regulation as agreed in the Working Party shall be implemented and approval authorities shall issue UN type approvals accordingly.\n\n\n3.2.Where the issue cannot be resolved within the current regulatory framework:\n\n\nWP.29 shall be informed accordingly and shall request the relevant subsidiary Working Party to consider the issue as a priority item at its next session. The agenda of the session shall be amended accordingly.\n\n\nThe subsidiary Working Party shall consider any proposal on the interpretation issue and shall submit formal proposals to WP.29 to amend the UN Regulation concerned following the normal procedures. WP.29 shall consider the issue as a priority item at its next session.\n\n\n\n\nSchedule 7\n\n\nProcedure for exemption approvals concerning new technologies\n\n\n1.Contracting Parties applying a UN Regulation may, on application by the manufacturer, grant exemption approval pursuant to a UN Regulation in respect of a vehicle, equipment or part that incorporates technologies which are incompatible with one or more requirements of that UN Regulation, subject to authorization being granted by the Administrative Committee of the 1958 Agreement under the procedure described in paragraphs 2 to 12 of this Schedule.\n\n\n2.Pending the decision on whether or not authorization for such an exemption approval is granted, the Contracting Party applying the UN Regulation may grant provisional approval for its territory only.
