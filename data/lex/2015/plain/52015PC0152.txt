Grounds for and objectives of the\r\nproposal\nThe Convention on a common transit\r\nprocedure and the Convention on the simplification of formalities in trade in\r\ngoods were concluded on 20 May 1987 between the European Community and the EFTA\r\ncountries. \nThe Communication of 2001 from the European\r\nCommission to the European Parliament and the Council on a Strategy to prepare\r\nthe candidate countries for accession to the 1987 EC-EFTA Conventions on a\r\ncommon transit procedure and the simplification of formalities in trade in\r\ngoods, followed by the Communication of 2010 from the European Commission to\r\nthe European Parliament and the Council on a Strategy to prepare certain\r\nneighbouring countries for the accession to both Conventions and by the Council\r\nConclusions of 14 April 2011 confirming the approach adopted in two\r\nCommunications foresee support for a number of countries in their efforts to\r\njoin the Conventions. \nThe purpose is to adopt the common EU\r\nposition on the draft Decision No 1/2015 of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on\r\ncommon transit and on the draft Decision No 1/2015 of the EU-EFTA Joint\r\nCommittee on the simplification of formalities in trade in goods to invite the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to accede to the Conventions. \n1.2. General context\nThe Conventions establish measures\r\nfacilitating the movement of goods between the European Union, the Republic of\r\nIceland, the Kingdom of Norway, the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of\r\nTurkey.\nThe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\r\nwished formally to be able to accede to the Conventions after having satisfied\r\nthe legal, structural and information technology requirements, which are\r\npreconditions for accession.\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article\r\n15(3) of the Convention on a common transit procedure and with the provisions\r\nof Article 11(3) of the Convention on the simplifications of formalities in\r\ntrade in goods, the EU-EFTA Joint Committees shall by decision invite a third\r\ncountry within the meaning of, respectively, Article 3 (1)(c) and Article 1(2)\r\n, to accede to the Conventions in accordance with\u00a0 the procedure set out in,\r\nrespectively, Article 15a and Article 11a.\nThe EU-EFTA Joint Committees launch such\r\ninvitations where the country proves that it is in a position to conform to the\r\ndetailed rules for the application of provisions of the Conventions. \nMandated by the EU-EFTA common transit and\r\nthe simplification of formalities in trade in goods working group, an\r\nevaluation mission covering mainly the adaptation of the national customs\r\nlegislation of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the creation of the\r\nstructures necessary to manage the procedure and the implementation of the New\r\nComputerised Transit system (NCTS) allowing for the application of the common\r\ntransit procedure established that the conditions of invitations were met.\n1.3. Existing provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nThere are no existing provisions in the\r\narea of the proposal.\n1.4. Consistency with other policies and objectives\r\nof the Union\nThe proposal complies with the strategy to\r\npromote EU competitiveness and economic growth.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1. Consultation of interested parties\nConsultation methods, main sectors targeted\r\nand general profile of respondents\nConsultation with approval on the draft\r\nDecision No 1/2015 of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit and the\r\ndraft Decision No 1/2015 of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on the simplification\r\nof formalities in trade in goods to invite the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia to accede to the Conventions were carried out with the Member States\r\nwithin the Customs Code Committee \u2013 Customs Status and Transit Section and with\r\nContracting Parties to the Conventions within the EU-EFTA Working Groups on\r\n\"Common Transit\" and \"the Simplification of Formalities in Trade\r\nin Goods\". \nSummary of responses and how they have been\r\ntaken into account\nFavourable opinion\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\n2.2. Impact assessment\nThe accession to the Conventions can be\r\nseen within the framework of the pre-accession strategy of the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, to the European Union. It will lead to an alignment to\r\nthe \"aquis communautarie\" in the transit area. The introduction of\r\ncommon transit in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an alternative\r\nto the TIR procedure will bring further facilitation of transit, reduction of\r\ncosts and a possible increase in trade.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.

Legal basis\nArticle 15(a) of the Convention of 20 May\r\n1987 on a common transit and Article 11a of the Convention of 20 May 1987 on\r\nthe simplification of formalities in trade in goods.\n3.3. Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the European Union (common commercial policy) and therefore does\r\nnot deserve an examination with regard to the principle of subsidiarity\r\n(Article 5(3) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union). .\n3.4. Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The form of proposed action is\r\nthe only one possible.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The form of proposed action\r\ndoes not involve any financing cost.\n3.5.

for public authorities and\r\nsimplification of administrative procedures for the private sector. \nThe proposal introduces\r\none common transit procedure for all the Contracting Parties to the Convention.\r\n\nThe common transit\r\nprocedure allows the authorisation of simplifications concerning private\r\nparties. \n2015/0077 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be
