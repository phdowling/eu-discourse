"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 15.12.2015\nCOM(2015) 643 final\n2015/0293(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the People's Republic of China on the short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic passports\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nIn the context of the EU-China Mobility and Migration Dialogue, the European Union and the People's Republic of China agreed on a cooperation package comprising measures in the area of irregular migration and visa policy that would be negotiated or implemented in two interdependent phases. In the first phase, a reciprocal visa waiver agreement for holders of diplomatic passports would be negotiated and Member States would be authorised by the Chinese authorities to open visa application centres in 15 designated Chinese cities. Regular expert meetings on combating irregular migration, including the identification and readmission of irregular migrants, would also be established in the first phase. In the second phase, both sides would negotiate visa facilitation and readmission agreements. This package was finalised and endorsed by both sides' political leaders at the 17th EU-China Summit on 29 June 2015.\n\n\n\nOn 14 September 2015 the Council authorised the opening of negotiations with China for a short-stay visa waiver agreement for holders of diplomatic passports and addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations were opened on 21 September and conducted by exchange of written notes. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators of the EU and China respectively on 3 and 4 November 2015. Member States were regularly kept informed of the negotiations during meetings of the Visa Working Party of the Council.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No\u00a0539/2001\n1\n lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member\u00a0States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. Regulation (EC) No\u00a0539/2001 is applied by all Member\u00a0States, with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as by Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. \n\n\nChina is among those countries whose nationals are required to hold a visa when travelling to the Schengen area. EU citizens also need a visa to enter China. \n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe Migration and Mobility Dialogue between the EU and China was established in October 2013 and aims at exchanging views on respective migration policies along the four pillars of Global Approach to Migration and Mobility as well as at discussing possibilities for cooperation on issues of mutual interest. \n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nFor the Union, the legal basis for the agreement is point (a) of Article 77(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjunction with Article 218 thereof.\n\n\nThe attached proposal constitutes the legal instrument for concluding the agreement. The Council will decide by qualified majority after the signing of the agreement, on behalf of the Union, by a person designated by the presidency of the Council and after having obtained the consent of the European Parliament in accordance with point (a) of the second subparagraph of Article 218(6) TFEU.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nWhile Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 enables individual Member States to conclude bilateral agreements with third countries exempting holders of diplomatic passports, service/official passports or special passports from the visa requirement, only an EU-level agreement can achieve that effect for all Member States and thereby offer leverage for agreements with third countries in related areas, such as readmission of irregular migrants. \n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nOnly an international agreement can derogate from the general visa requirement for Chinese citizens, which is necessary to achieve the above-mentioned objectives. \n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\n\n\nSee above.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nMember States were consulted both in the Council's High-Level Working Group on Asylum and the Visa Working Party.\n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nNo Impact Assessment has been carried out, as the initiative is not expected to have any measurable economic or social benefits. It is essentially a political agreement. \n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nThe agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the agreement whose tasks include, among others, the monitoring of its implementation as well as suggesting amendments or additions.\n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nThe Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were fully attained. Its main provisions can be summarised as follows:\n\n\nPurpose and scope\n\n\nThe agreement provides for visa-free travel for citizens of the European Union holding a valid diplomatic passport or an EU laissez-passer\n2\n\u00a0and for citizens of China holding a valid diplomatic passport when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party. \n\n\nIn order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU Member States, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that China may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States.\n\n\nThe specific situation of the United Kingdom and Ireland is reflected in the preamble. \n\n\nDuration of stay\n\n\nThe agreement provides for visa-free travel for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. A joint declaration on the interpretation of this period of 90 days in any 180-day period is attached to the agreement. \n\n\nThe agreement takes into account the situation of the Member\u00a0States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the Chinese holders of diplomatic passports to stay for 90 days in any 180-day period on the territory of each of those Member\u00a0States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area.\n\n\nVisits by high officials\n\n\nThe agreement stipulates that officials at or above vice-ministerial level of the central government and officers of or above the rank of major general of the armed forces must inform the competent authorities of the country to be visited through diplomatic channels before they travel to its territory for official purposes.\n\n\nExchange of specimens\n\n\nThe agreement provides for the exchange of specimens of diplomatic passports and the EU laissez-passer no later than 90 days after the date of signature of the agreement.\n\n\nTerritorial application\n\n\nThe agreement clarifies that the visa waiver for Chinese holders of diplomatic passports only applies to the European territories of France and the Netherlands.\n\n\nJoint declarations\n\n\nIn addition to the joint declaration referred to above, two other joint declarations are attached to the agreement:\n\n\n\u2013on the association of Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis;\n\n\n\u2013on the relationship of this agreement to other fields of cooperation in the framework of the EU-China Mobility and Migration Dialogue.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nIn the light of the above-mentioned results, the Commission proposes that the Council approve, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, the Agreement between the European Union and China on the short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic passports.\n\n\n\n2015/0293 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the People's Republic of China on the short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic passports\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular point (a) of Article\u00a077(2), in conjunction with Article\u00a0218(6), thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament\n3\n,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Commission has negotiated on behalf of the European Union an agreement with the People's Republic of China on the shortstay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic passports (the 'Agreement').\n\n\n(2)In accordance with Council Decision (EU) 2015/\u2026\n4\n\n5\n, the Agreement has been signed and is applied on a provisional basis as from \u2026\n6\n.\n\n\n(3)The Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement. The Union is to be represented within that Joint Committee by the Commission, which should be assisted by the representatives of the Member\u00a0States.\n\n\n(4)This Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision\u00a02000/365/EC\n7\n; the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n\n\n(5)This Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision\u00a02002/192/EC\n8\n; Ireland is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n\n\n(6)The Agreement should be approved on behalf of the European Union,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n\n\nThe Agreement between the European Union and the

A Contracting Party that has suspended the application of this Agreement shall immediately inform the other Contracting Party should  the reasons for that suspension cease to exist and shall lift that suspension.\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Contracting Party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the other Party. This Agreement shall cease to be in force 90 days thereafter.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0China may suspend or terminate this Agreement only in respect of all the Member States.\n\n\n\n7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union may suspend or terminate this Agreement only in respect of all of its Member\u00a0States.\n\n\n\n\nDone in duplicate in the Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish and Chinese languages, each text being equally authentic. In case of divergence between authentic language versions, the English language version shall prevail.\n\n\nJOINT DECLARATION WITH REGARD TO ICELAND, NORWAY, SWITZERLAND\nAND LIECHTENSTEIN \n\n\n\nThe Contracting Parties take note of the close relationship between the European Union and Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, particularly by virtue of the Agreements of 18\u00a0May 1999 and 26 October 2004 concerning the association of those countries with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis. \n\n\n\nIn such circumstances it is desirable that the authorities of Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, on the one hand, and China, on the other hand, conclude, without delay, bilateral agreements on the short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic passports in terms similar to those of this Agreement. \n\n\n\n\n\nJOINT DECLARATION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE PERIOD OF 90 DAYS\nIN ANY 180-DAY PERIOD AS SET OUT IN ARTICLE 4 OF THIS AGREEMENT\n\n\n\nThe Contracting Parties understand that the maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period as provided for by Article 4 of this Agreement means either a continuous visit or several consecutive visits, the total duration of which does not exceed 90 days in any 180-day period.\n\n\n\nThe notion of \"any\" implies the application of a moving 180-day reference period, looking backwards at each day of the stay into the last 180-day period, in order to verify if the 90 days in any 180-day period requirement continues to be fulfilled. Inter alia, it means that an absence for an uninterrupted period of 90 days allows for a new stay for up to 90 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJOINT DECLARATION ON OTHER FIELDS OF COOPERATION IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EU-CHINA MOBILITY AND MIGRATION DIALOGUE\n\n\n\nThe Contracting Parties recall that this Agreement is one of the outcomes of the negotiation roadmap agreed upon in the minutes of the second round of the EU-China Mobility and Migration Dialogue and endorsed by political leaders in the joint statement of the 17th EU-China Summit. This roadmap includes, in the first stage, negotiation and signing of a reciprocal visa waiver agreement for holders of diplomatic passports, the opening of visa application centres in mutually agreed Chinese cities without consular presence, and launching practical cooperation in combating illegal migration, and, in the second stage, negotiation of agreements on visa facilitation and cooperation in combating illegal migration.  \n\n\n\nThe Contracting Parties reiterate their firm intention to respect the commitments taken in the roadmap and their common understanding that those commitments are interdependent and form part of an indivisible package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EU) No 1417/2013 of 17 December 2013 laying down the form of the laissez-passer issued by the European Union, OJ L 353, 28.12.2013, p. 26.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
