The EU and the Kingdom of Denmark in respect of the Faroe Islands signed the Convention on 15 June 2011.\nThe EU and the Kingdom of Denmark in respect of the Faroe Islands deposited their instrument of acceptance with the\r\ndepositary of the Convention on 26 March 2012 and 9 September 2013\r\nrespectively. As a consequence, in application of its Article 10(3), the\r\nConvention entered into force in relation to the EU and the Faroe Islands on\r\n1 May 2012 and on 1 November 2013 respectively.\nArticle 6 of the Convention provides that\r\neach Contracting Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the\r\nConvention is effectively applied. To that effect, the Joint Committee\r\nestablished by the Agreement between the European\r\nCommunity, of the one part, and the Government of Denmark and the Home\r\nGovernment of the Faroe Islands, of the other part[2],\r\nshould adopt a Decision replacing Protocol 3 concerning the definition of the\r\nconcept of 'originating products' and methods of administrative cooperation by\r\na new Protocol which, with regard to the rules of origin, refers to the\r\nConvention.

The Contracting Parties to the Convention were last consulted at the\r\nmeeting of the Pan-Euro-Med working group of 22 and 23 October 2014.\nNo recourse to external expertise has been\r\nnecessary. Furthermore, it has not been necessary to conduct an impact\r\nassessment, since the proposed amendments are technical in nature and do not\r\naffect the substance of the protocol on rules of origin currently in effect.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the Council Decision is\r\nthe first subparagraph of Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article\r\n218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union.
