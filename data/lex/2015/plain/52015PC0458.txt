K.3 TEU). It is indeed not anymore necessary, as in the past, to negotiate and conclude specific accession protocols to these conventions (which would have implied ratification by 28 Member States): Article 3(4) and 3(5) of the Act provides simply that Croatia accedes to these conventions and protocols by virtue of the Act of Accession.\n\n\nArticle 3(5) of the Act of Accession provides that, to that effect, the Council shall adopt a decision in order to determine the date on which these conventions shall enter into force for Croatia and to make all the necessary adjustments to these conventions required by reason of the accession of the new Member State (which would include, in any event, the adoption of the conventions in the Croatian language, so that these versions can be \"equally authentic\"). The Council shall act on a recommendation of the Commission, after consulting the European Parliament.\n\n\nAnnex I to the Act of Accession gives the list of the conventions and protocols concerned. The list includes the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests of 26.7.1995,\n2\n its Protocols of 27.9.1996\n3\n, of 29.11.1996\n4\n and the 2nd Protocol of 19.6.1997,\n5\n all adopted under Title VI EU Treaty, set out to establish a common base for the criminal-law protection of the EC\u2019s financial interests. The Convention and its Protocols of 27.9.1996 and of 29.11.1996 entered into force on 17 October 2002 following ratification by the then 15 Member States, the Protocol of 19. 6. 1997 entered into force on 19 May 2009 following ratification by the then 27 Member States.\n\n\nThere is no need for this Commission Recommendation to make the adjustments required by reason of the accession of Croatia to the aforementioned Convention and its Protocols, in accordance with Article 3(5) of the Act of Accession.\n\n\nIn view of the foregoing the Commission recommends that the Council takes a decision concerning the accession of Croatia to the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests and its Protocols.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nConsultations and impact assessments are not applicable for this proposal since Croatia's accession to this Convention and its Protocols was agreed in the Articles 3(4) and 3(5) of the Act concerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union.  \n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThe legal basis for this proposal is the Article 3.5 of the Act concerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union.\n\n\n2015/0210 (NLE)\n\n\nRecommendation for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\nconcerning the accession of Croatia to the Convention of 26 July 1995,\ndrawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on the protection\nof the European Communities' financial interests, the Protocol of 27 September 1996,\ndrawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, to the\nConvention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests, the\nProtocol of 29 November 1996, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union, on the interpretation, by way of preliminary rulings, by\nthe Court of Justice of the European Communities of the Convention on the protection\nof the European Communities' financial interests and the Second Protocol of 19 June\n1997, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, to the\nConvention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European Union,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Act of Accession of Croatia, and in particular Article 3(4) and 3(5) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the recommendation from the Commission\n6\n,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament\n7\n,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n1) The Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests\n8\n, signed on 26 July 1995 and drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests\u201d) entered into force on 17 October 2002. \n\n\n2) The Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests was complemented by the Protocol of 27 September 1996, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, to the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests \n9\n (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Protocol of 27 September 1996\u201d) and the Protocol of 29 November 1996, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on the interpretation, by way of preliminary rulings, by the Court of Justice of the European Communities of the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests \n10\n (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Protocol of 29 November 1996\u201d), which both entered into force on 17 October 2002.\n\n\n3) The Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests was further complemented by the Second Protocol of 19 June 1997, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, to the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests \n11\n (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Second Protocol of 19 June 1997\u201d) which entered into force on 19 May 2009.\n\n\n4) Article 3 (4) of the Act of Accession of Croatia\n12\n provides that Croatia accedes to the conventions and protocols concluded between the Member States, listed in Annex I to the Act of Accession.
