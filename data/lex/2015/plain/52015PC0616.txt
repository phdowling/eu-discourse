Considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\n\n\nFor this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and transparent.\n\n\n2.On 1\u00a0April 1987 the Commission decided\n1\n to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily understandable.\n\n\n3.The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December\u00a01992) confirmed this\n2\n, stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time.\n\n\nCodification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\n\n\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20\u00a0December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n\n\n4.The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Sixth Council Directive of 17\u00a0December 1982 based on Article\u00a054(3)(g) of the Treaty, concerning the division of public limited liability companies (82/891/EEC), Eleventh Council Directive of 21\u00a0December 1989 concerning disclosure requirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company governed by the law of another State (89/666/EEC), Directive 2005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\u00a0October 2005 on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies, Directive 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16\u00a0September 2009 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and third parties, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article\u00a048 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent, Directive 2011/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5\u00a0April 2011 concerning mergers of public limited liability companies, Directive 2012/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0October 2012 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article\u00a054 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent\n3\n. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it\n4\n; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.\n\n\n5.The codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in 23\u00a0official languages of Directives 82/891/EEC, 89/666/EEC, 2005/56/EC, 2009/101/EC, 2011/35/EU and 2012/30/EU and the instruments amending them, carried out by the Publications Office of the European Union, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex\u00a0IV to this Directive.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU (adapted)\n\n\n2015/0283 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\n\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0relating to certain aspects of company law\u00a0\u00d5 (\u00d6\u00a0codification\u00a0\u00d5)\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\u00a050(1) and\u00a0(2)(g) thereof,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n5\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0\n\n\n(1)Council Directive\u00a082/891/EEC\n6\n, Council Directive\u00a089/666/EEC\n7\n, Directive\u00a02005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n8\n, Directive\u00a02009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n9\n, Directive\u00a02011/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n10\n and Directive\u00a02012/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n11\n have been substantially amended several times\n12\n. In the interests of clarity and rationality those Directives should be codified.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU recital 2 (adapted)\n\n\n(2)The coordination provided for in Article\u00a050(2)(g) of the Treaty and in the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment, which was begun by the First Council Directive\u00a068/151/EEC\n13\n, \u00d6\u00a0facilitates the integration of the economies of the Member States. It\u00a0\u00d5 is especially important in relation to public limited liability companies, because their activities predominate in the economy of the Member States and frequently extend beyond their national boundaries.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU recital 3\n\n\n(3)In order to ensure minimum equivalent protection for both shareholders and creditors of public limited liability companies, the coordination of national provisions relating to their formation and to the maintenance, increase or reduction of their capital is particularly important.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU recital 4\n\n\n(4)In the Union, the statutes or instrument of incorporation of a public limited liability company must make it possible for any interested person to acquaint himself with the basic particulars of the company, including the exact composition of its capital.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/101/EC recital 9 (adapted)\n\n\n(5)The protection of third parties should be ensured by provisions which restrict to the greatest possible extent the grounds on which obligations entered into in the name of \u00d6\u00a0public or private limited liability\u00a0\u00d5 companies are not valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/101/EC recital 10\n\n\n(6)It is necessary, in order to ensure certainty in the law as regards relations between the companies and third parties, and also between members, to limit the cases in which nullity can arise and the retroactive effect of a declaration of nullity, and to fix a short time limit within which third parties may enter objection to any such declaration.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/101/EC recital 2\n\n\n(7)The coordination of national provisions concerning disclosure, the validity of obligations entered into by, and the nullity of, companies limited by shares or otherwise having limited liability, is of special importance, particularly for the purpose of protecting the interests of third parties.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/101/EC recital 3\n\n\n(8)The basic documents of a company should be disclosed in order for third parties to be able to ascertain their contents and other information concerning the company, especially particulars of the persons who are authorised to bind the company.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/101/EC recital 4\n\n\n(9)Without prejudice to substantive requirements and formalities established by the national law of the Member States, companies should be able to choose to file their compulsory documents and particulars by paper means or by electronic means.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/101/EC recital 5\n\n\n(10)Interested parties should be able to obtain from the register a copy of such documents and particulars by paper means as well as by electronic means.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/101/EC recital 6\n\n\n(11)Member States should be allowed to decide to keep the national gazette, designated for publication of compulsory documents and particulars, in paper form or electronic form, or to provide for disclosure by equally effective means.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/101/EC recital 7 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\n(12)Cross-border access to company information should be facilitated by allowing, in addition to the \u00d6\u00a0compulsory\u00a0\u00d5 disclosure made in one of the languages permitted in the company\u2019s Member State, the voluntary registration in additional languages of the required documents and particulars. Third parties acting in good faith should be able to rely on the translations thereof.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/101/EC recital 8\n\n\n(13)It is appropriate to clarify that the statement of the compulsory particulars set out in this Directive should be included in all company letters and order forms, whether they are in paper form or use any other medium. In the light of technological developments, it is also appropriate to provide that these statements be placed on any company website.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a089/666/EEC recital 3 (adapted)\n\n\n(14) The opening of a branch, like the creation of a subsidiary, is one of the possibilities currently open to companies in the exercise of their right of establishment in another Member State.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a089/666/EEC recital 4\n\n\n(15)In respect of branches, the lack of coordination, in particular concerning disclosure, gives rise to some disparities, in the protection of shareholders and third parties, between companies which operate in other Member States by opening branches and those which operate there by creating subsidiaries.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a089/666/EEC recital 5 (adapted)\n\n\n(16)\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0The\u00a0\u00d5 differences in the laws of the Member States may interfere with the exercise of the right of establishment \u00d6\u00a0of branches\u00a0\u00d5. It is therefore necessary to eliminate such differences in order to safeguard, inter alia, the exercise of that right.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a089/666/EEC recital 6 (adapted)\n\n\n(17)To ensure the protection of persons who deal with companies through the intermediary of branches, measures in respect of disclosure are required in the Member State in which a branch is situated. In certain respects, the economic and social influence of a branch may be comparable to that of a subsidiary company, so that there is public interest in disclosure of the company at the branch. To effect such disclosure, it is necessary to make use of the procedure already instituted for companies with share capital within the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 .\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a089/666/EEC recital 7\n\n\n(18)Such disclosure relates to a range of important documents and particulars and amendments thereto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a089/666/EEC recital 8 (adapted)\n\n\n(19)Such disclosure, with the exception of the powers of representation, the name and legal form, and the winding-up of the company and the insolvency proceedings to which it is subject, may be confined to information concerning a branch itself together with a reference to the register of the company of which that branch is part, since under existing \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 rules, all information covering the company as such is available in that register.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a089/666/EEC recital 9\n\n\n(20)National provisions in respect of the disclosure of accounting documents relating to a branch can no longer be justified following the coordination of national law in respect of the drawing up, audit and disclosure of companies' accounting documents. It is accordingly sufficient to disclose, in the register of the branch, the accounting documents as audited and disclosed by the company.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a089/666/EEC recital 10 (adapted)\n\n\n(21)Letters and order forms used by a branch \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 give at least the same information as letters and order forms used by the company, and state the register in which the branch is entered.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a089/666/EEC recital 11 (adapted)\n\n\n(22)To ensure that the purposes of this Directive are fully realised and to avoid any discrimination on the basis of a company's country of origin, this Directive \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 also cover branches opened by companies governed by the law of \u00d6\u00a0third\u00a0\u00d5 countries and set up in legal forms comparable to companies to which \u00d6\u00a0this Directive\u00a0\u00d5applies. For these branches it is necessary to apply \u00d6\u00a0specific\u00a0\u00d5 provisions \u00d6\u00a0that are\u00a0\u00d5 different from those that apply to the branches of companies governed by the law of other Member States since \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Directive does not apply to companies from \u00d6\u00a0third\u00a0\u00d5 countries.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a089/666/EEC recital 12\n\n\n(23)This Directive in no way affects the disclosure requirements for branches under other provisions of, for example, employment law on workers' rights to information and tax law, or for statistical purposes.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 5 (adapted)\n\n\n(24) The interconnection of central, commercial and companies registers is a measure required to create a more business-friendly legal and fiscal environment. \u00d6\u00a0It\u00a0\u00d5 should contribute to fostering the competitiveness of European business by reducing administrative burdens and increasing legal certainty and thus contributing to an exit from the global economic and financial crisis, which is one of the priorities of the agenda Europe\u00a02020. It should also improve cross-border communication between registers by using innovations in information and communication technology.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 8 (adapted)\n\n\n(25)The Multi-annual European e-Justice action plan\u00a02009\u20132013\n14\n\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0provided\u00a0\u00d5 for the development of a European e-Justice portal (\u2018the portal\u2019) as the single European electronic access point for legal information, judicial and administrative institutions, registers, databases and other services and considers the interconnection of central, commercial and companies registers to be important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 9\n\n\n(26)Cross-border access to business information on companies and their branches opened in other Member States can only be improved if all Member States engage in enabling electronic communication to take place between registers and transmitting information to individual users in a standardised way, by means of identical content and interoperable technologies, throughout the Union. This interoperability of registers should be ensured by the registers of Member States (\u2018domestic registers\u2019) providing services, which should constitute interfaces to the European central platform (\u2018the platform\u2019). The platform should be a centralised set of information technology tools integrating services and should form a common interface. That interface should be used by all domestic registers. The platform should also provide services constituting an interface to the portal serving as the European electronic access point, and to the optional access points established by Member States. The platform should be conceived only as an instrument for the interconnection of registers and not as a distinct entity possessing legal personality. On the basis of unique identifiers, the platform should be capable of distributing information from each of the Member States\u2019 registers to the competent registers of other Member States in a standard message format (an electronic form of messages exchanged between information technology systems, such as, for example, xml) and in the relevant language version.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 10\n\n\n(27)This Directive is not aimed at establishing any centralised registers database storing substantive information about companies. At the stage of implementation of the system of interconnection of central, commercial and companies registers (\u2018the system of interconnection of registers\u2019), only the set of data necessary for the correct functioning of the platform should be defined. The scope of those data should include, in particular, operational data, dictionaries and glossaries. It should be determined taking also into account the need to ensure the efficient operation of the system of interconnection of registers. Those data should be used for the purpose of enabling the platform to perform its functions and should never be made publicly available in a direct form. Moreover, the platform should modify neither the content of the data on companies stored in domestic registers nor the information about companies transmitted through the system of interconnection of registers.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 12 (adapted)\n\n\n(28) The portal \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 deal, through the use of the platform, with queries submitted by individual users concerning the information on companies and their branches opened in other Member States which is stored in the domestic registers. That \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 enable the search results to be presented on the portal, including the explanatory labels in all the official languages of the Union, listing the information provided. In addition, in order to improve the protection of third parties in other Member States, basic information on the legal value of documents and particulars disclosed pursuant to the laws of Member States adopted in accordance with \u00d6\u00a0this Directive\u00a0\u00d5 should be available on the portal.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 13\n\n\n(29)Member States should be able to establish one or more optional access points, which may have an impact on the use and operation of the platform. Therefore, the Commission should be notified of their establishment and of any significant changes to their operation, in particular of their closure. Such notification should not in any way restrict the powers of Member States as to the establishment and operation of the optional access points.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 14 (adapted)\n\n\n(30)Companies and their branches opened in other Member States should have a unique identifier allowing them to be unequivocally identified within the Union. The identifier is intended to be used for communication between registers through the system of interconnection of registers. Therefore, companies and branches should not be obliged to include the unique identifier in the company letters or order forms mentioned in \u00d6\u00a0this Directive\u00a0\u00d5. They should continue to use their domestic registration number for their own communication purposes.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 15\n\n\n(31)It should be made possible to establish a clear connection between the register of a company and the registers of its branches opened in other Member States, consisting in the exchange of information on the opening and termination of any winding-up or insolvency proceedings of the company and on the striking-off of the company from the register, if this entails legal consequences in the Member State of the register of the company. While Member States should be able to decide on the procedures they follow with respect to the branches registered in their territory, they should ensure, at least, that the branches of a dissolved company are struck off the register without undue delay and, if applicable, after liquidation proceedings of the branch concerned. This obligation should not apply to branches of companies that have been struck off the register but which have a legal successor, such as in the case of any change in the legal form of the company, a merger or division, or a cross-border transfer of its registered office.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 16 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\n(32)\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0The provisions of this Directive relating to the interconnection of registers\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0should not apply to a branch opened in a Member State by a company which is not governed by the law of a Member State.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 18\n\n\n(33)Member States should ensure that, in the event of any changes to information entered in the registers concerning companies, the information is updated without undue delay. The update should be disclosed, normally, within 21\u00a0days from receipt of the complete documentation regarding those changes, including the legality check in accordance with national law. That time limit should be interpreted as requiring Member States to make reasonable efforts to meet the deadline laid down in this Directive. It should not be applicable as regards the accounting documents which companies are obliged to submit for each financial year. This exclusion is justified by the overload on the domestic registers during reporting periods. In accordance with general legal principles common to all Member States, the time limit of\u00a021\u00a0days should be suspended in cases of force majeure.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 19 (adapted)\n\n\n(34)\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0If\u00a0\u00d5 the Commission decides to develop and/or operate the platform through a third party, this should be done in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\u00a0966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n15\n. An appropriate degree of Member States\u2019 involvement in this process should be ensured by establishing the technical specifications for the purpose of the public procurement procedure by means of implementing acts adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a05 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n16\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 20 (adapted)\n\n\n(35)\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0If\u00a0\u00d5 the Commission decides to operate the platform through a third party, the continuity of the provision of services by the system of interconnection of registers and a proper public supervision of the functioning of the platform should be ensured. Detailed rules on the operational management of the platform should be adopted by means of implementing acts adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a05 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0182/2011. In any case, the involvement of Member States in the functioning of the whole system should be ensured by means of a regular dialogue between the Commission and the representatives of Member States on the issues concerning the operation of the system of interconnection of registers and its future development.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 21\n\n\n(36)The interconnection of central, commercial and companies registers necessitates the coordination of national systems having varying technical characteristics. This entails the adoption of technical measures and specifications which need to take account of differences between registers. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to tackle these technical and operational issues. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a05 of Regulation\u00a0(EU) No\u00a0182/2011.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 22\n\n\n(37)This Directive should not limit the right of Member States to charge fees for obtaining information on companies through the system of interconnection of registers, if such fees are required under national law. Therefore, technical measures and specifications for the system of interconnection of registers should allow for the establishment of payment modalities. In this respect, this Directive should not prejudge any specific technical solution as the payment modalities should be determined at the stage of adoption of the implementing acts, taking into account widely available online payment facilities.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 23\n\n\n(38)It could be desirable for third countries to be able, in the future, to participate in the system of interconnection of registers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 24\n\n\n(39)An equitable solution regarding the funding of the system of interconnection of registers entails participation both by the Union and by its Member States in the financing of that system. The Member States should bear the financial burden of adjusting their domestic registers to that system, while the central elements \u2014 the platform and the portal serving as the European electronic access point \u2014 should be funded from an appropriate budget line in the general budget of the Union. In order to supplement non-essential elements of this Directive, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\u00a0290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the charging of fees for obtaining company information. This does not affect the possibility for the domestic registers to charge fees, but it may involve an additional fee in order to co-finance the maintenance and functioning of the platform. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU recital 5 (adapted)\n\n\n(40)Union provisions are necessary for maintaining the capital, which constitutes the creditors' security, in particular by prohibiting any reduction thereof by distribution to shareholders where the latter are not entitled to it and by imposing limits on the \u00d6\u00a0right of public limited liability companies\u00a0\u00d5 to acquire their own shares.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU recital 6 (adapted)\n\n\n(41)The restrictions on a \u00d6\u00a0public limited liability\u00a0\u00d5 company's acquisition of its own shares apply not only to acquisitions made by a company itself but also to those made by any person acting in his own name but on the company's behalf.\n\n\n\n\u00ea 2012/30/EU recital 7\n\n\n(42)In order to prevent a public limited liability company from using another company in which it holds a majority of the voting rights or on which it can exercise a dominant influence to make such acquisitions without complying with the restrictions imposed in that respect, the arrangements governing a company's acquisition of its own shares should be extended to cover the most important and most frequent cases of the acquisition of shares by such other companies. Those arrangements should be extended to cover subscription for shares in the public limited liability company.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU recital 8 (adapted)\n\n\n(43)In order to prevent the circumvention of this Directive, \u00d6\u00a0public limited liability\u00a0\u00d5 companies governed by \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Directive and companies governed by the laws of third countries, and having comparable legal forms, should also be covered by the arrangements referred to in recital\u00a042.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU recital 9\n\n\n(44)Where the relationship between a public limited liability company and another company such as referred to in recital\u00a042 is only indirect, it would appear to be justified to relax the provisions applicable when that relationship is direct, by providing for the suspension of voting rights as a minimum measure, for the purpose of achieving the aims of this Directive.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU recital 10\n\n\n(45)Furthermore, it is justifiable to exempt cases in which the specific nature of a professional activity rules out the possibility that the attainment of the objectives of this Directive may be endangered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU recital 11\n\n\n(46)It is necessary, having regard to the objectives of Article\u00a050(2)(g) of the Treaty, that the Member States' laws relating to the increase or reduction of capital ensure that the principles of equal treatment of shareholders in the same position and of protection of creditors whose claims exist prior to the decision on reduction are observed and harmonised.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU recital 12\n\n\n(47)In order to enhance standardised creditor protection in all Member States, creditors should be able to resort, under certain conditions, to judicial or administrative proceedings where their claims are at stake, as a consequence of a reduction in the capital of a public limited liability company.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU recital 13\n\n\n(48)In order to ensure that market abuse is prevented, Member States should take into account, for the purpose of the implementation of this Directive, the provisions of Directive\u00a02003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n17\n, Commission Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a02273/2003\n18\n and\u00a0Commission Directive\u00a02004/72/EC\n19\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02011/35/EU recital 4 (adapted)\n\n\n(49)The protection of the interests of members and third parties requires that the laws of the Member States relating to mergers of public limited liability companies be coordinated, and that provision for mergers be made in the laws of all the Member States.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02011/35/EU recital 5\n\n\n(50)In the context of such coordination, it is particularly important that the shareholders of merging companies be kept adequately informed in as objective a manner as possible, and that their rights be suitably protected. However, there is no reason to require an examination of the draft terms of a merger by an independent expert for the shareholders if all the shareholders agree that it may be dispensed with.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02011/35/EU recital 7\n\n\n(51)Creditors, including debenture holders, and persons having other claims on the merging companies should be protected so that the merger does not adversely affect their interests.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02011/35/EU recital 8 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\n(52)The disclosure requirements \u00d6\u00a0for the protection of the interests of members and third parties\u00a0\u00d5 should include mergers so that third parties are kept adequately informed.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02011/35/EU recital 9 (adapted)\n\n\n(53)The safeguards afforded to members and third parties in connection with mergers \u00d6\u00a0of public limited liability companies\u00a0\u00d5 should be extended to cover certain legal practices which in important respects are similar to merger, so that the obligation to provide such protection cannot be evaded.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02011/35/EU recital 10 (adapted)\n\n\n(54)To ensure certainty in the law as regards relations between the companies concerned \u00d6\u00a0by a merger\u00a0\u00d5, between them and third parties, and between the members, it is necessary to limit the cases in which nullity can arise by providing that defects be remedied wherever that is possible, and by restricting the period within which nullification proceedings may be commenced.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC recital 2 (adapted)\n\n\n(55)This Directive \u00d6\u00a0also\u00a0\u00d5 facilitates the cross-border merger of limited liability companies. The laws of the Member States \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 allow the cross-border merger of a national limited liability company with a limited liability company from another Member State if the national law of the relevant Member States permits mergers between such types of company.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC recital 3 (adapted)\n\n\n(56)In order to facilitate cross-border merger operations, it should be \u00d6\u00a0specified\u00a0\u00d5 that, unless this Directive provides otherwise, each company taking part in a cross-border merger, and each third party concerned, remains subject to the provisions and formalities of the national law which would be applicable in the case of a national merger. None of the provisions and formalities of national law, to which reference is made in this Directive, should introduce restrictions on freedom of establishment or on the free movement of capital, save where these can be justified in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice \u00d6\u00a0of the European Union\u00a0\u00d5 and in particular, by requirements of the general interest and are both necessary for, and proportionate to, the attainment of such overriding requirements.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC recital 4 (adapted)\n\n\n(57)The common draft terms of a cross-border merger \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 be drawn up in the same terms for each of the companies concerned in the various Member States. The minimum content of such common draft terms should therefore be specified, while leaving the companies free to agree on other items.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC recital 5 (adapted)\n\n\n(58)In order to protect the interests of members and others, both the common draft terms of the cross-border merger and the completion of the cross-border merger \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 be publicised for each merging company via an entry in the appropriate public register.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC recital 6 (adapted)\n\n\n(59)The laws of all the Member States should provide for the drawing-up at national level of a report on the common draft terms of the cross-border merger by one or more experts on behalf of each of the companies that are merging. In order to limit experts\u2019 costs connected with cross-border mergers, provision should be made for the possibility of drawing up a single report intended for all members of companies taking part in a cross-border merger operation. The common draft terms of the cross-border merger \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 be approved by the general meeting of each of those companies.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC recital 7\n\n\n(60)In order to facilitate cross-border merger operations, it should be provided that monitoring of the completion and legality of the decision-making process in each merging company should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over each of those companies, whereas monitoring of the completion and legality of the cross-border merger should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over the company resulting from the cross-border merger. The national authority in question may be a court, a notary or any other competent authority appointed by the Member State concerned. The national law determining the date on which the cross-border merger takes effect, this being the law to which the company resulting from the cross-border merger is subject, should also be specified.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC recital 8\n\n\n(61)In order to protect the interests of members and others, the legal effects of the cross-border merger, distinguishing as to whether the company resulting from the cross-border merger is an acquiring company or a new company, should be specified. In the interests of legal certainty, it should no longer be possible, after the date on which a cross-border merger takes effect, to declare the merger null and void.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC recital 9 (adapted)\n\n\n(62)This Directive is without prejudice to the application of the legislation on the control of concentrations between undertakings, both at \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 level, by Council Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a0139/2004\n20\n, and at Member State level.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC recital 10 (adapted)\n\n\n(63)This Directive does not affect \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 legislation regulating credit intermediaries and other financial undertakings and national rules made or introduced pursuant to such \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 legislation.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC recital 11\n\n\n(64)This Directive is without prejudice to Member State legislation demanding information on the place of central administration or the principal place of business proposed for the company resulting from the cross-border merger.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC recital 12\n\n\n(65)Employees\u2019 rights, other than rights of participation, should remain subject to the national provisions referred to in Council Directive\u00a098/59/EC\n21\n, Council Directive\u00a02001/23/EC\n22\n, Directive\u00a02002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n23\n and Directive\u00a02009/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n24\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC recital 13 (adapted)\n\n\n(66)If employees have participation rights in one of the merging companies under the circumstances set out in this Directive and, if the national law of the Member State in which the company resulting from the cross-border merger has its registered office does not provide for the same level of participation as operated in the relevant merging companies, including in committees of the supervisory board that have decision-making powers, or does not provide for the same entitlement to exercise rights for employees of establishments resulting from the cross-border merger, the participation of employees in the company resulting from the cross-border merger and their involvement in the definition of such rights \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 be regulated. To that end, the principles and procedures provided for in Council Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a02157/2001\n25\n and in Council Directive\u00a02001/86/EC\n26\n, \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 be taken as a basis, subject, however, to modifications that are deemed necessary because the resulting company will be subject to the national laws of the Member State where it has its registered office. A prompt start to negotiations under Article\u00a0132 of this Directive, with a view to not unnecessarily delaying mergers, may be ensured by Member States in accordance with Article\u00a03(2)(b) of Directive\u00a02001/86/EC.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC recital 14\n\n\n(67)For the purpose of determining the level of employee participation operated in the relevant merging companies, account should also be taken of the proportion of employee representatives amongst the members of the management group, which covers the profit units of the companies, subject to employee participation.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC recital 5\n\n\n(68)The protection of the interests of members and third parties requires that the laws of the Member States relating to divisions of public limited liability companies be coordinated where the Member States permit such operations.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC recital 6\n\n\n(69)In the context of such coordination, it is particularly important that the shareholders of the companies involved in a division be kept adequately informed in as objective a manner as possible, and that their rights be suitably protected.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC recital 8 (adapted)\n\n\n(70)Creditors, including debenture holders, and persons having other claims on the companies involved in a division \u00d6\u00a0of public limited liability companies\u00a0\u00d5, \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 be protected so that the division does not adversely affect their interests.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC recital 9 (adapted)\n\n\n(71)Disclosure requirements \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 include divisions so that third parties are kept adequately informed.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC recital 10 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\n(72)The safeguards afforded to members and third parties in connection with divisions \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 be extended to cover certain legal practices which in important respects are similar to division, so that the obligation to provide such protection cannot be evaded.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC recital 11 (adapted)\n\n\n(73)To ensure certainty in the law as regards relations between the \u00d6\u00a0public limited liability\u00a0\u00d5 companies involved in the division, between them and third parties, and between the members, the cases in which nullity can arise \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 be limited by providing that defects \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 be remedied wherever that is possible and by restricting the period within which nullification proceedings may be commenced.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/109/EC recital 4 (adapted)\n\n\n(74)Company websites or other websites offer, in certain cases, an alternative to publication via the companies registers. Member States should be able to designate those other websites which companies may use free of charge for such publication, such as websites of business associations or chambers of commerce or the central electronic platform referred to in \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Directive. Where the possibility exists of using company or other websites for publication of draft terms of merger and/or division and of other documents that have to be made available to shareholders and creditors in the process, guarantees relating to the security of the website and the authenticity of the documents should be met.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/109/EC recital 6 (adapted)\n\n\n(75)Member States should be able to provide that the extensive reporting or information requirements relating to the merger or division of companies, laid down in \u00d6\u00a0Chapter\u00a0I and Chapter\u00a0III of Title\u00a0II\u00a0\u00d5 , need not be complied with if all the shareholders of the companies involved in the merger or division agree that such compliance may be dispensed with.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/109/EC recital 7 (adapted)\n\n\n(76)Any modification of \u00d6\u00a0Chapter\u00a0I and Chapter\u00a0III of Title\u00a0II\u00a0\u00d5 allowing such agreement by shareholders, should be without prejudice to the systems of protection of the interests of creditors of the companies involved, and to rules aimed at ensuring the provision of necessary information to the employees of those companies and to public authorities, such as tax authorities, controlling the merger or division in accordance with existing \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/109/EC recital 8\n\n\n(77)It is not necessary to impose the requirement to draw up an accounting statement where an issuer whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market publishes half-yearly financial reports in accordance with Directive\u00a02004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n27\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/109/EC recital 9 (adapted)\n\n\n(78)An independent expert\u2019s report \u00d6\u00a0on consideration other than in cash\u00a0\u00d5 is often not needed where an independent expert\u2019s report protecting the interests of shareholders or creditors also has to be drawn up in the context of the merger or the division. Member States should therefore have the possibility in such cases of dispensing companies from the reporting requirement \u00d6\u00a0regarding consideration other than in cash\u00a0\u00d5 or of providing that both reports may be drawn up by the same expert. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/109/EC recital 10 (adapted)\n\n\n(79)Mergers between parent \u00d6\u00a0undertakings\u00a0\u00d5 and their subsidiaries have a reduced economic impact on shareholders and creditors where the parent \u00d6\u00a0undertaking\u2019s\u00a0\u00d5 holding in the subsidiary amounts to 90\u00a0% or more of the shares and other securities conferring the right to vote. The same applies to certain divisions, in particular when companies are split into new companies that are owned by the shareholders in the proportion to their rights in the company being divided. In those cases, the reporting requirements should therefore be reduced.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 25\n\n\n(80)Directive\u00a095/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n28\n and Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a045/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n29\n govern the processing of personal data, including the electronic transmission of personal data within the Member States. Any processing of personal data by the registers of Member States, by the Commission and, if applicable, by any third party involved in operating the platform should take place in compliance with those acts. The implementing acts to be adopted in relation to the system of interconnection of registers should, where appropriate, ensure such compliance, in particular by establishing the relevant tasks and responsibilities of all the participants concerned and the organisational and technical rules applicable to them.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU recital 28\n\n\n(81)This Directive\u00a0respects fundamental rights and observes the principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular Article\u00a08 thereof, which states that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0\n\n\n(82)This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for the transposition into national law and the dates of application of the directives set out in Annex\u00a0III, Part\u00a0B,\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU (adapted)\n\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nTitle I\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0General provisions and the establishment and functioning of limited liability companies\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nChapter\u00a0I\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Subject matter\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nArticle\u00a01\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Subject matter\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0This Directive lays down measures concerning the following:\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0the\u00a0\u00d5 coordination of safeguards which are required by Member States in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent;\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/101/EC (adapted)\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0the\u00a0\u00d5 coordination of safeguards which are required by Member States \u00d6\u00a0concerning disclosure requirements in respect of public and private limited liability companies \u00d5, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent;\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a089/666/EEC (adapted)\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0the\u00a0\u00d5 disclosure requirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company governed by the law of another State;\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02011/35/EU (adapted)\n\n\n\u2013 mergers of public limited liability companies;\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC (adapted)\n\n\n\u2013 cross-border mergers of limited liability companies;\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC (adapted)\n\n\n\u2013 the division of public limited liability companies.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU (adapted)\n\n\nChapter\u00a0II\n\n\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Incorporation and nullity of the company and validity of its obligations\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nSection\u00a01\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Incorporation of the public limited liability company\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nArticle\u00a02\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Scope\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1.

Where the uncalled part of the subscribed capital is not included in the assets shown in the balance sheet, that amount shall be deducted from the amount of subscribed capital referred to in paragraph\u00a01.\n\n\n3. The amount of a distribution to shareholders may not exceed the amount of the profits at the end of the last financial year plus any profits brought forward and sums drawn from reserves available for this purpose, less any losses brought forward and sums placed to reserve in accordance with the law or the statutes.\n\n\n4.

The laws of a Member State may provide for derogations from the first sentence of point\u00a0(a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph\u00a01 where the acquisition of a company's own shares is necessary to prevent serious and imminent harm to the company. In such a case, the next general meeting shall be informed by the administrative or management body of the reasons for and nature of the acquisitions effected, of the number and nominal value or, in the absence of a nominal value, the accountable par, of the shares acquired, of the proportion of the subscribed capital which they represent, and of the consideration for these shares.\n\n\n3. Member States may decide not to apply the first sentence point\u00a0(a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph\u00a01 to shares acquired by either the company itself or by a person acting in his own name but on the company's behalf, for distribution to that company's employees or to the employees of an associate company.

Point\u00a0(a) of the third subparagraph of Article\u00a055(7) shall apply. These acquisitions may not have the effect of reducing the net assets below the amount of the subscribed capital plus any reserves the distribution of which is forbidden by law.\n\n\n2.

If the shares are not disposed of within the period laid down in paragraph\u00a02, they \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be cancelled. The laws of a Member State may make this cancellation subject to a corresponding reduction in the subscribed capital. Such a reduction \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be prescribed where the acquisition of shares to be cancelled results in the net assets having fallen below the amount specified in Article\u00a055(1) and\u00a0(2).\n\n\nArticle\u00a061\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Consequences of illegal acquisition of own shares\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nShares acquired in contravention of Articles\u00a059 and 60 shall be disposed of within one year of their acquisition. \u00d6\u00a0If\u00a0\u00d5 they \u00d6\u00a0are\u00a0\u00d5 not disposed of within that period, Article\u00a060(3) shall apply.\n\n\nArticle\u00a062\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Holding of own shares and annual report in case of acquisition of own shares\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU\n\n\n1.

Where a third party by means of financial assistance from a company acquires that company's own shares within the meaning of Article\u00a059(1) or subscribes for shares issued in the course of an increase in the subscribed capital, such acquisition or subscription shall be made at a fair price.\n\n\n6. Paragraphs\u00a01 to\u00a05 shall not apply to transactions concluded by banks and other financial institutions in the normal course of business, nor to transactions effected with a view to the acquisition of shares by or for the company's employees or the employees of an associate company.\n\n\nHowever, these transactions may not have the effect of reducing the net assets below the amount specified in Article\u00a055(1).\n\n\n7. Paragraphs\u00a01 to 5 shall not apply to transactions effected with a view to acquisition of shares as described in of Article\u00a060(1)(h).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU (adapted)\n\n\nArticle\u00a064\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Additional safeguards in case of related party transactions\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nIn cases where individual members of the administrative or management body of the company being party to a transaction referred to in Article\u00a063(1), or of the administrative or management body of a parent undertaking within the meaning of Article\u00a022 of Directive\u00a02013/34/EU or such parent undertaking itself, or individuals acting in their own name, but on behalf of the members of such bodies or on behalf of such undertaking, are counterparties to such a transaction, Member States shall ensure through adequate safeguards that such transaction does not conflict with the company's best interests.\n\n\nArticle\u00a065\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Acceptance of the company's own shares as security\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. The acceptance of the company's own shares as security, either by the company itself or through a person acting in his own name but on the company's behalf, shall be treated as an acquisition for the purposes of Article\u00a059, Article\u00a060(1), and Articles\u00a062 and\u00a063.\n\n\n2.

The subscription, acquisition or holding of shares in a public limited liability company by another company \u00d6\u00a0of a type listed in Annex\u00a0II\u00a0\u00d5 in which the public limited liability company directly or indirectly holds a majority of the voting rights or on which it can directly or indirectly exercise a dominant influence shall be regarded as having been effected by the public limited liability company itself.\n\n\nThe first subparagraph shall also apply where the other company is governed by the law of a third country and has a legal form comparable to those listed in \u00d6\u00a0Annex\u00a0II\u00a0\u00d5.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU\n\n\nHowever, where the public limited liability company holds a majority of the voting rights indirectly or can exercise a dominant influence indirectly, Member States need not apply the first and the second subparagraphs if they provide for the suspension of the voting rights attached to the shares in the public limited liability company held by the other company.\n\n\n2. In the absence of coordination of national legislation on groups of companies, Member States may:\n\n\n(a)define the cases in which a public limited liability company shall be regarded as being able to exercise a dominant influence on another company; if a Member State exercises this option, its national law must in any event provide that a dominant influence can be exercised if a public limited liability company:\n\n\n(i)has the right to appoint or dismiss a majority of the members of the administrative organ, of the management organ or of the supervisory organ, and is at the same time a shareholder or member of the other company, or\n\n\n(ii)is a shareholder or member of the other company and has sole control of a majority of the voting rights of its shareholders or members under an agreement concluded with other shareholders or members of that company.\n\n\nMember States shall not be obliged to make provision for any cases other than those referred to in points\u00a0(i) and (ii) of the first subparagraph;\n\n\n(b)define the cases in which a public limited liability company shall be regarded as indirectly holding voting rights or as able indirectly to exercise a dominant influence;\n\n\n(c)specify the circumstances in which a public limited liability company shall be regarded as holding voting rights.\n\n\n3. Member States need not apply the first and second subparagraphs of paragraph\u00a01 where the subscription, acquisition or holding is effected on behalf of a person other than the person subscribing, acquiring or holding the shares, who is neither the public limited liability company referred to in paragraph\u00a01 nor another company in which the public limited liability company directly or indirectly holds a majority of the voting rights or on which it can directly or indirectly exercise a dominant influence.\n\n\n4. Member States need not apply the first and second subparagraphs of paragraph\u00a01 where the subscription, acquisition or holding is effected by the other company in its capacity and in the context of its activities as a professional dealer in securities, provided that it is a member of a stock exchange situated or operating within a Member State, or is approved or supervised by an authority of a Member State competent to supervise professional dealers in securities which, within the meaning of this Directive, may include credit institutions.\n\n\n5. Member States need not apply the first and second subparagraphs of paragraph\u00a01 where shares in a public limited liability company held by another company were acquired before the relationship between the two companies corresponded to the criteria laid down in paragraph\u00a01.\n\n\nHowever, the voting rights attached to those shares shall be suspended and the shares shall be taken into account when it is determined whether the condition laid down in Article\u00a059(1)(b) is fulfilled.\n\n\n6. Member States need not apply Article\u00a060(2) or\u00a0(3) or Article\u00a061 where shares in a public limited liability company are acquired by another company on condition that they provide for:\n\n\n(a)the suspension of the voting rights attached to the shares in the public limited liability company held by the other company; and\n\n\n(b)the members of the administrative or the management organ of the public limited liability company to be obliged to buy back from the other company the shares referred to in Article\u00a060(2) and\u00a0(3) and Article\u00a061 at the price at which the other company acquired them; this sanction shall be inapplicable only where the members of the administrative or the management organ of the public limited liability company prove that that company played no part whatsoever in the subscription for or acquisition of the shares in question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/30/EU (adapted)\n\n\nSection\u00a05\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Rules for the increase and reduction of capital\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nArticle\u00a067\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Decision by the general meeting on the increase of capital\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. Any increase in capital \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be decided upon by the general meeting. Both that decision and the increase in the subscribed capital shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article\u00a015.\n\n\n2. Nevertheless, the statutes or instrument of incorporation or the general meeting, the decision of which must be published in accordance with the rules referred to in paragraph\u00a01, may authorise an increase in the subscribed capital up to a maximum amount which they shall fix with due regard for any maximum amount provided for by law. Where appropriate, the increase in the subscribed capital shall be decided on within the limits of the amount fixed by the company body empowered to do so. The power of such body in this respect shall be for a maximum period of five years and may be renewed one or more times by the general meeting, each time for a period not exceeding five years.\n\n\n3. Where there are several classes of shares, the decision by the general meeting concerning the increase in capital referred to in paragraph\u00a01 or the authorisation to increase the capital referred to in paragraph\u00a02, shall be subject to a separate vote at least for each class of shareholder whose rights are affected by the transaction.\n\n\n4. This Article shall apply to the issue of all securities which are convertible into shares or which carry the right to subscribe for shares, but not to the conversion of such securities, nor to the exercise of the right to subscribe.\n\n\nArticle\u00a068\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Paying up shares issued for consideration\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nShares issued for consideration, in the course of an increase in subscribed capital, \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be paid up to at least 25\u00a0% of their nominal value or, in the absence of a nominal value, of their accountable par. Where provision is made for an issue premium, it \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be paid in full.\n\n\nArticle\u00a069\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Shares issued for consideration other than in cash\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. Where shares are issued for consideration other than in cash in the course of an increase in the subscribed capital, the consideration \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be transferred in full within a period of five\u00a0years from the decision to increase the subscribed capital.\n\n\n2. The consideration referred to in paragraph 1 shall be the subject of a report drawn up before the increase in capital is made by one or more experts who are independent of the company and appointed or approved by an administrative or judicial authority. Such experts may be natural persons as well as legal persons and companies and firms under the laws of each Member State.\n\n\nArticle\u00a048(2) and (3) and Articles\u00a049 and\u00a050 shall apply.\n\n\n3. Member States may decide not to apply paragraph\u00a02 in the event of an increase in subscribed capital made in order to give effect to a merger, a division or a public offer for the purchase or exchange of shares and to pay the shareholders of the company which is being absorbed or divided, or which is the object of the public offer for the purchase or exchange of shares.\n\n\nIn the case of a merger or a division, however, Member States shall apply the first subparagraph only where a report by one or more independent experts on the draft terms of merger or division is drawn up.\n\n\nWhere Member States decide to apply paragraph\u00a02 in the case of a merger or a division, they may provide that the report under this Article and the report by one or more independent experts on the draft terms of merger or division may be drawn up by the same expert or experts.\n\n\n\n\n4. Member States may decide not to apply paragraph\u00a02 if all the shares issued in the course of an increase in subscribed capital are issued for a consideration other than in cash to one or more companies, on condition that all the shareholders in the company which receive the consideration have agreed not to have an experts' report drawn up and that the requirements of Article\u00a048(4)(b) to\u00a0(f) are met.\n\n\nArticle\u00a070\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Increase in capital not fully subscribed\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nWhere an increase in capital is not fully subscribed, the capital will be increased by the amount of the subscriptions received only if the conditions of the issue so provide.\n\n\nArticle\u00a071\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Increase in capital by consideration in cash\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. Whenever the capital is increased by consideration in cash, the shares \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be offered on a pre-emptive basis to shareholders in proportion to the capital represented by their shares.\n\n\n2. The laws of a Member State:\n\n\n(a)need not apply paragraph\u00a01 to shares which carry a limited right to participate in distributions within the meaning of Article\u00a055 and/or in the company's assets in the event of liquidation; or\n\n\n(b)may permit, where the subscribed capital of a company having several classes of shares carrying different rights with regard to voting, or participation in distributions within the meaning of Article\u00a055 or in assets in the event of liquidation, is increased by issuing new shares in only one of these classes, the right of pre-emption of shareholders of the other classes to be exercised only after the exercise of this right by the shareholders of the class in which the new shares are being issued.\n\n\n3. Any offer of subscription on a pre-emptive basis and the period within which this right \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be exercised shall be published in the national gazette appointed in accordance with Article\u00a015. However, the laws of a Member State need not provide for such publication where all of a company's shares are registered. In such case, all the company's shareholders \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be informed in writing. The right of pre-emption \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be exercised within a period which shall not be less than\u00a014\u00a0days from the date of publication of the offer or from the date of dispatch of the letters to the shareholders. \n\n\n4. The right of pre-emption may not be restricted or withdrawn by the statutes or instrument of incorporation. This may, however, be done by decision of the general meeting. The administrative or management body shall be required to present to such a meeting a written report indicating the reasons for restriction or withdrawal of the right of pre-emption, and justifying the proposed issue price. The general meeting shall act in accordance with the rules for a quorum and a majority laid down in Article\u00a082. Its decision shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article\u00a015.\n\n\n5. The laws of a Member State may provide that the statutes, the instrument of incorporation or the general meeting, acting in accordance with the rules for a quorum, a majority and publication set out in paragraph\u00a04, may give the power to restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption to the company body which is empowered to decide on an increase in subscribed capital within the limit of the authorised capital. This power may not be granted for a longer period than the power for which provision is made in Article\u00a067(2).\n\n\n6. Paragraphs\u00a01 to\u00a05 shall apply to the issue of all securities which are convertible into shares or which carry the right to subscribe for shares, but not to the conversion of such securities, nor to the exercise of the right to subscribe.\n\n\n7. The right of pre-emption is not excluded for the purposes of paragraphs\u00a04 and\u00a05 where, in accordance with the decision to increase the subscribed capital, shares are issued to banks or other financial institutions with a view to their being offered to shareholders of the company in accordance with paragraphs\u00a01 and\u00a03.\n\n\nArticle\u00a072\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Decision by the general meeting on reduction in the subscribed capital\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nAny reduction in the subscribed capital, except under a court order, \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be subject at least to a decision of the general meeting acting in accordance with the rules for a quorum and a majority laid down in Article\u00a082 without prejudice to Articles\u00a078 and\u00a079. Such decision shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article\u00a015.\n\n\nThe notice convening the meeting \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 specify at least the purpose of the reduction and the way in which it is to be carried out.\n\n\nArticle\u00a073\n\n\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Reduction in the subscribed capital in case of several classes of shares\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nWhere there are several classes of shares, the decision by the general meeting concerning a reduction in the subscribed capital shall be subject to a separate vote, at least for each class of shareholders whose rights are affected by the transaction.\n\n\nArticle\u00a074\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Safeguards for creditors in case of reduction in the subscribed capital\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. In the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital, at least the creditors whose claims antedate the publication of the decision on the reduction shall at least have the right to obtain security for claims which have not fallen due by the date of that publication. Member States may not set aside such a right unless the creditor has adequate safeguards, or unless such safeguards are not necessary having regard to the assets of the company.\n\n\nMember States shall lay down the conditions for the exercise of the right provided for in the first subparagraph. In any event, Member States shall ensure that the creditors are authorised to apply to the appropriate administrative or judicial authority for adequate safeguards provided that they can credibly demonstrate that due to the reduction in the subscribed capital the satisfaction of their claims is at stake, and that no adequate safeguards have been obtained from the company.\n\n\n2. The laws of the Member States shall also stipulate at least that the reduction shall be void, or that no payment may be made for the benefit of the shareholders, until the creditors have obtained satisfaction or a court has decided that their application should not be acceded to.\n\n\n3. This Article shall apply where the reduction in the subscribed capital is brought about by the total or partial waiving of the payment of the balance of the shareholders' contributions.\n\n\nArticle 75\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Derogation from safeguards for creditors in case of reduction in the subscribed capital\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. Member States need not apply Article\u00a074 to a reduction in the subscribed capital whose purpose is to offset losses incurred or to include sums of money in a reserve provided that, following this operation, the amount of such reserve is not more than 10\u00a0% of the reduced subscribed capital. Except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital, this reserve may not be distributed to shareholders; it may be used only for offsetting losses incurred or for increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalisation of such reserve, in so far as the Member States permit such an operation.\n\n\n2. In the cases referred to in paragraph\u00a01, the laws of the Member States \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 at least provide for the measures necessary to ensure that the amounts deriving from the reduction of subscribed capital may not be used for making payments or distributions to shareholders, or discharging shareholders from the obligation to make their contributions.\n\n\nArticle\u00a076\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Reduction in the subscribed capital and the minimum capital\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nThe subscribed capital may not be reduced to an amount less than the minimum capital laid down in accordance with Article\u00a044.\n\n\nHowever, Member States may permit such a reduction if they also provide that the decision to reduce the subscribed capital may take effect only when the subscribed capital is increased to an amount at least equal to the prescribed minimum.\n\n\nArticle\u00a077\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Redemption of subscribed capital without reduction\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nWhere the laws of a Member State authorise total or partial redemption of the subscribed capital without reduction of the latter, they shall at least require that the following conditions are observed:\n\n\n(a)where the statutes or instrument of incorporation provide for redemption, the latter shall be decided on by the general meeting voting at least under the usual conditions of quorum and majority; where the statutes or instrument of incorporation do not provide for redemption, the latter shall be decided upon by the general meeting acting at least under the conditions of quorum and majority laid down in Article\u00a082; the decision \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be published in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article\u00a015;\n\n\n\n\n(b)only sums which are available for distribution within the meaning of Article\u00a055(1) to\u00a0(4) may be used for redemption purposes;\n\n\n(c)shareholders whose shares are redeemed shall retain their rights in the company, with the exception of their rights to the repayment of their investment and participation in the distribution of an initial dividend on unredeemed shares.\n\n\nArticle\u00a078\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Reduction in the subscribed capital by compulsory withdrawal of shares\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. Where the laws of a Member State may allow companies to reduce their subscribed capital by compulsory withdrawal of shares, they shall require that at least the \u00d6\u00a0following\u00a0\u00d5 conditions are observed:\n\n\n(a)compulsory withdrawal must be prescribed or authorised by the statutes or instrument of incorporation before the shares which are to be withdrawn are subscribed for;\n\n\n(b)where the compulsory withdrawal is merely authorised by the statutes or instrument of incorporation, it shall be decided upon by the general meeting unless it has been unanimously approved by the shareholders concerned;\n\n\n(c)the company body deciding on the compulsory withdrawal shall fix the terms and manner thereof, where they have not already been fixed by the statutes or instrument of incorporation;\n\n\n(d)Article\u00a074 shall apply except in the case of fully paid-up shares which are made available to the company free of charge or are withdrawn using sums available for distribution in accordance with Article\u00a055(1) to\u00a0(4); in these cases, an amount equal to the nominal value or, in the absence thereof, to the accountable par of all the withdrawn shares must be included in a reserve; except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital, this reserve may not be distributed to shareholders; it can be used only for offsetting losses incurred or for increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalisation of such reserve, in so far as Member States permit such an operation; and\n\n\n(e)the decision on compulsory withdrawal shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article\u00a015.\n\n\n2. The first paragraph of Article\u00a072 and Articles\u00a073, 75 and\u00a082 shall not apply to the cases to which paragraph\u00a01 of this Article refers.\n\n\nArticle\u00a079\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Reduction in the subscribed capital by the withdrawal of shares acquired by the\u00a0company\u00a0itself or on its behalf\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. In the case of a reduction in the subscribed capital by the withdrawal of shares acquired by the company itself or by a person acting in his own name but on behalf of the company, the withdrawal must always be decided on by the general meeting.\n\n\n2. Article\u00a074 shall apply unless the shares are fully paid up and are acquired free of charge or using sums available for distribution in accordance with Article\u00a055(1) to\u00a0(4); in these cases an amount equal to the nominal value or, in the absence thereof, to the accountable par of all the shares withdrawn \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be included in a reserve. Except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital, this reserve may not be distributed to shareholders. It may be used only for offsetting losses incurred or for increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalisation of such reserve, in so far as the Member States permit such an operation. \n\n\n3. Articles\u00a073, 75 and\u00a082 shall not apply to the cases to which paragraph\u00a01 of this Article refers.\n\n\nArticle\u00a080\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Redemption of the subscribed capital or its reduction by withdrawal of shares in case of several classes of shares\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nIn the cases covered by Article\u00a077, Article\u00a078(1)(b) and\u00a0Article\u00a079(1), when there are several classes of shares, the decision by the general meeting concerning redemption of the subscribed capital or its reduction by withdrawal of shares shall be subject to a separate vote, at least for each class of shareholders whose rights are affected by the transaction.\n\n\nArticle\u00a081\n\n\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Conditions for redemption of shares\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nWhere the laws of a Member State authorise companies to issue redeemable shares, they shall require that the following conditions, at least, are complied with for the redemption of such shares:\n\n\n(a)redemption must be authorised by the company's statutes or instrument of incorporation before the redeemable shares are subscribed for;\n\n\n(b)the shares must be fully paid up;\n\n\n(c)the terms and the manner of redemption must be laid down in the company's statutes or instrument of incorporation;\n\n\n(d)redemption can be only effected by using sums available for distribution in accordance with Article\u00a055(1) to\u00a0(4) or the proceeds of a new issue made with a view to effecting such redemption;\n\n\n(e)an amount equal to the nominal value or, in the absence thereof, to the accountable par of all the redeemed shares must be included in a reserve which cannot be distributed to the shareholders, except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital; it may be used only for the purpose of increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalisation of reserves;\n\n\n(f)point\u00a0(e) shall not apply to redemption using the proceeds of a new issue made with a view to effecting such redemption;\n\n\n(g)where provision is made for the payment of a premium to shareholders in consequence of a redemption, the premium may be paid only from sums available for distribution in accordance with Article\u00a055(1) to\u00a0(4), or from a reserve other than that referred to in point\u00a0(e) of this Article which may not be distributed to shareholders except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital; this reserve may be used only for the purposes of increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalisation of reserves or for covering the costs referred to in Article\u00a04(j) or the cost of issuing shares or debentures or for the payment of a premium to holders of redeemable shares or debentures;\n\n\n(h)notification of redemption shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article\u00a015.\n\n\nArticle\u00a082\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Voting requirements for the decisions of the general meeting\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nThe laws of the Member States shall provide that the decisions referred to in Article\u00a071(4) and\u00a0(5) and Articles\u00a072, 73, 77 and\u00a080 must be taken at least by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the votes attaching to the securities or the subscribed capital represented.\n\n\nThe laws of the Member States may, however, lay down that a simple majority of the votes specified in the first paragraph is sufficient when at least half the subscribed capital is represented.\n\n\nSection\u00a06\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Application and implementing arrangements\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nArticle\u00a083\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Derogation from certain requirements\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1.

Member States shall not subject that exemption to any requirements or constraints other than those which are necessary in order to ensure the security of the website and the authenticity of the documents, and may impose such requirements or constraints only to the extent that they are proportionate in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n\nBy way of derogation from the second paragraph of this Article, Member States may require that publication be effected via the central electronic platform referred to in Article\u00a015(5).

A merger shall require at least the approval of the general meeting of each of the merging companies. The laws of the Member States shall provide that this approval decision shall require a majority of not less than two thirds of the votes attached either to the shares or to the subscribed capital represented.\n\n\nThe laws of a Member State may, however, provide that a simple majority of the votes specified in the first subparagraph shall be sufficient when at least half of the subscribed capital is represented. Moreover, where appropriate, the rules governing alterations to the memorandum and articles of association shall apply.\n\n\n2. Where there is more than one class of shares, the decision concerning a merger shall be subject to a separate vote by at least each class of shareholders whose rights are affected by the transaction.\n\n\n3.

The administrative or management bodies of each of the companies involved shall inform the general meeting of their company, and the administrative or management bodies of the other companies involved, so that the latter may inform their respective general meetings of any material change in the assets and liabilities between the date of preparation of the draft terms of merger and the date of the general meetings which are to decide on the draft terms of merger.\n\n\n3. Member States may provide that the report referred to in paragraph\u00a01 and/or the information referred to in paragraph\u00a02 shall not be required if all the shareholders and the holders of other securities conferring the right to vote of each of the companies involved in the merger have so agreed.\n\n\nArticle\u00a095\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Examination of the draft terms of merger by experts\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. One or more experts, acting on behalf of each of the merging companies but independent of them, appointed or approved by a judicial or administrative authority, shall examine the draft terms of merger and draw up a written report to the shareholders. However, the laws of a Member State may provide for the appointment of one or more independent experts for all the merging companies, if such appointment is made by a judicial or administrative authority at the joint request of those companies. Such experts may, depending on the laws of each Member State, be natural or legal persons or companies or firms.\n\n\n2. In the report mentioned in paragraph\u00a01 the experts \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 in any case state whether in their opinion the share exchange ratio is fair and reasonable. Their statement \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 at least:\n\n\n(a)indicate the method or methods used to arrive at the share exchange ratio proposed;\n\n\n(b)state whether such method or methods are adequate in the case in question, indicate the values arrived at using each such method and give an opinion on the relative importance attributed to such methods in arriving at the value decided on.\n\n\nThe report shall also describe any special valuation difficulties which have arisen.\n\n\n3. Each expert shall be entitled to obtain from the merging companies all relevant information and documents and to carry out all necessary investigations.\n\n\n4.

Furthermore, Member States may provide that an accounting statement shall not be required if all the shareholders and the holders of other securities conferring the right to vote of each of the companies involved in the merger have so agreed.\n\n\n2. The accounting statement provided for in point\u00a0(c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be drawn up using the same methods and the same layout as the last annual balance sheet.\n\n\nHowever, the laws of a Member State may provide that:\n\n\n(a)it is not necessary to take a fresh physical inventory;\n\n\n(b)the valuations shown in the last balance sheet are to be altered only to reflect entries in the books of account; the following shall nevertheless be taken into account:\n\n\n\u2013interim depreciation and provisions,\n\n\n\u2013material changes in actual value not shown in the books.\n\n\n3. Every shareholder shall be entitled to obtain, on request and free of charge, full or, if so desired, partial copies of the documents referred to in paragraph\u00a01.\n\n\nWhere a shareholder has consented to the use by the company of electronic means for conveying information, such copies may be provided by electronic mail.\n\n\n4. A company shall be exempt from the requirement to make the documents referred to in paragraph\u00a01 available at its registered office if, for a continuous period beginning at least one\u00a0month before the day fixed for the general meeting which is to decide on the draft terms of merger and ending not earlier than the conclusion of that meeting, it makes them available on its website. Member States shall not subject that exemption to any requirements or constraints other than those which are necessary in order to ensure the security of the website and the authenticity of the documents and may impose such requirements or constraints only to the extent that they are proportionate in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n\nParagraph\u00a03 shall not apply if the website gives shareholders the possibility, throughout the period referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, of downloading and printing the documents referred to in paragraph\u00a01. However, in that case Member States may provide that the company is to make those documents available at its registered office for consultation by the shareholders.\n\n\nMember States may require companies to maintain the information on their website for a specific period after the general meeting. Member States may determine the consequences of temporary disruption of access to the website caused by technical or other factors.\n\n\nArticle\u00a097\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Protection of employees' rights\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n\n\nProtection of the rights of the employees of each of the merging companies shall be regulated in accordance with Directive\u00a02001/23/EC.\n\n\nArticle\u00a098\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Protection of the interests of creditors of the merging companies\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. The laws of the Member States \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 provide for an adequate system of protection of the interests of creditors of the merging companies whose claims antedate the publication of the draft terms of merger and have not fallen due at the time of such publication.\n\n\n2. To that end, the laws of the Member States shall at least provide that such creditors shall be entitled to obtain adequate safeguards where the financial situation of the merging companies makes such protection necessary and where those creditors do not already have such safeguards.\n\n\nMember States shall lay down the conditions for the protection provided for in paragraph\u00a01 and in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. In any event, Member States shall ensure that the creditors are authorised to apply to the appropriate administrative or judicial authority for adequate safeguards provided that they can credibly demonstrate that due to the merger the satisfaction of their claims is at stake and that no adequate safeguards have been obtained from the company.\n\n\n3. Such protection may be different for the creditors of the acquiring company and for those of the company being acquired.\n\n\nArticle\u00a099\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Protection of the interests of debenture holders of the merging companies\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nWithout prejudice to the rules governing the collective exercise of their rights, Article\u00a098 shall apply to the debenture holders of the merging companies, except where the merger has been approved by a meeting of the debenture holders, if such a meeting is provided for under national laws, or by the debenture holders individually.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0100\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Protection of holders of securities, other than shares, to which special rights are\u00a0attached\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nHolders of securities, other than shares, to which special rights are attached \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be given rights in the acquiring company at least equivalent to those they possessed in the company being acquired, unless the alteration of those rights has been approved by a meeting of the holders of such securities, if such a meeting is provided for under national laws, or by the holders of those securities individually, or unless the holders are entitled to have their securities repurchased by the acquiring company.\n\n\nArticle\u00a016101\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Drawing up and certification of documents in due legal form\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. Where the laws of a Member State do not provide for judicial or administrative preventive supervision of the legality of mergers, or where such supervision does not extend to all the legal acts required for a merger, the minutes of the general meetings which decide on the merger and, where appropriate, the merger contract subsequent to such general meetings shall be drawn up and certified in due legal form. In cases where the merger need not be approved by the general meetings of all the merging companies, the draft terms of merger \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be drawn up and certified in due legal form.\n\n\n2. The notary or the authority competent to draw up and certify the document in due legal form \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 check and certify the existence and validity of the legal acts and formalities required of the company for which that notary or authority is acting and of the draft terms of merger.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0102\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Date on which a merger takes effect\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nThe laws of the Member States shall determine the date on which a merger takes effect.\n\n\n\n\nArticle\u00a0103\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Publication formalities\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. A merger \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be publicised in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article\u00a015, in respect of each of the merging companies.\n\n\n2. The acquiring company may itself carry out the publication formalities relating to the company or companies being acquired.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0104\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Consequences of a merger\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. A merger shall have the following consequences ipso jure and simultaneously:\n\n\n(a)the transfer, both as between the company being acquired and the acquiring company and as regards third parties, to the acquiring company of all the assets and liabilities of the company being acquired;\n\n\n(b)the shareholders of the company being acquired become shareholders of the acquiring company;\n\n\n(c)the company being acquired ceases to exist.\n\n\n2.

The foregoing shall not affect the laws of Member States which require the completion of special formalities for the transfer of certain assets, rights and obligations by the acquired company to be effective as against third parties. The acquiring company may carry out these formalities itself; however, the laws of the Member States may permit the company being acquired to continue to carry out these formalities for a limited period which cannot, save in exceptional cases, be fixed at more than six months from the date on which the merger takes effect.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0105\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Civil liability of members of the administrative or management bodies of the\u00a0company\u00a0being\u00a0acquired\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nThe laws of the Member States shall at least lay down rules governing the civil liability, towards the shareholders of the company being acquired, of the members of the administrative or management bodies of that company in respect of misconduct on the part of members of those bodies in preparing and implementing the merger.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0106\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Civil liability of the experts responsible for drawing up the expert report on behalf of the\u00a0company being acquired\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nThe laws of the Member States shall at least lay down rules governing the civil liability, towards the shareholders of the company being acquired, of the experts responsible for drawing up on behalf of that company the report referred to in Article\u00a095(1), in respect of misconduct on the part of those experts in the performance of their duties.\n\n\n\n\nArticle\u00a0107\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Conditions for nullity of a merger\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. The laws of the Member States may lay down nullity rules for mergers in accordance with the following conditions only:\n\n\n(a)nullity must be ordered in a court judgment;\n\n\n(b)mergers which have taken effect pursuant to Article\u00a0102 may be declared void only if there has been no judicial or administrative preventive supervision of their legality, or if they have not been drawn up and certified in due legal form, or if it is shown that the decision of the general meeting is void or voidable under national law;\n\n\n(c)nullification proceedings may not be initiated more than six months after the date on which the merger becomes effective as against the person alleging nullity or if the situation has been rectified;\n\n\n(d)where it is possible to remedy a defect liable to render a merger void, the competent court shall grant the companies involved a period of time within which to rectify the situation;\n\n\n(e)a judgment declaring a merger void shall be published in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article\u00a015;\n\n\n(f)where the laws of a Member State permit a third party to challenge such a judgment, that party may do so only within six months of publication of the judgment in the manner prescribed by \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Directive ;\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02011/35/EU\n\n\n(g)a judgment declaring a merger void shall not of itself affect the validity of obligations owed by or in relation to the acquiring company which arose before the judgment was published and after the date on which the merger takes effect;\n\n\n(h)companies which have been parties to a merger shall be jointly and severally liable in respect of the obligations of the acquiring company referred to in point\u00a0(g).\n\n\n2. By way of derogation from \u00a0 paragraph\u00a01(a), the laws of a Member State may also provide for the nullity of a merger to be ordered by an administrative authority if an appeal against such a decision lies to a court.

Notwithstanding Article\u00a0118(2), this \u00d6\u00a0Chapter\u00a0\u00d5 shall also apply to cross-border mergers where the law of at least one of the Member States concerned allows the cash payment referred to in Article\u00a0118(2)(a) and\u00a0(b) to exceed 10\u00a0% of the nominal value, or, in the absence of a nominal value, of the accounting par value of the securities or shares representing the capital of the company resulting from the cross-border merger.\n\n\n2.

Member States shall not subject that exemption to any requirements or constraints other than those which are necessary in order to ensure the security of the website and the authenticity of the documents and may impose such requirements or constraints only to the extent that they are proportionate in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n\nBy way of derogation from the second subparagraph, Member States may require that publication be effected via the central electronic platform referred to in Article\u00a015(5). Member States may alternatively require that such publication be made on any other website designated by them for that purpose. Where Member States avail themselves of one of those possibilities, they shall ensure that companies are not charged a specific fee for such publication.\n\n\nWhere a website other than the central electronic platform is used, a reference giving access to that website shall be published on the central electronic platform at least one month before the day fixed for the general meeting. That reference shall include the date of publication of the common draft terms of cross-border merger on the website and shall be accessible to the public free of charge. Companies shall not be charged a specific fee for such publication.\n\n\nThe prohibition precluding the charging to companies of a specific fee for publication, laid down in the third and fourth subparagraphs, shall not affect the ability of Member States to pass on to companies the costs in respect of the central electronic platform.\n\n\nMember States may require companies to maintain the information for a specific period after the general meeting on their website or, where applicable, on the central electronic platform or the other website designated by the Member State concerned.

Depending on the law of each Member State, such experts may be natural persons or legal persons.\n\n\n\n\n2. As an alternative to experts operating on behalf of each of the merging companies, one or more independent experts, appointed for that purpose at the joint request of the companies by a judicial or administrative authority in the Member State of one of the merging companies or of the company resulting from the cross-border merger or approved by such an authority, may examine the common draft terms of cross-border merger and draw up a single written report to all the members.\n\n\n3. The expert report shall include at least the particulars provided for by Article\u00a095(2). The experts shall be entitled to secure from each of the merging companies all information they consider necessary for the discharge of their duties.\n\n\n4. Neither an examination of the common draft terms of cross-border merger by independent experts nor an expert report shall be required if all the members of each of the companies involved in the cross-border merger have so agreed.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0125\n\n\nApproval by the general meeting\n\n\n1. After taking note of the reports referred to in Articles\u00a0123 and\u00a0124, the general meeting of each of the merging companies shall decide on the approval of the common draft terms of cross-border merger.\n\n\n2. The general meeting of each of the merging companies may reserve the right to make implementation of the cross-border merger conditional on express ratification by it of the arrangements decided on with respect to the participation of employees in the company resulting from the cross-border merger.\n\n\n3. The laws of a Member State need not require approval of the merger by the general meeting of the acquiring company if the conditions laid down in Article\u00a093 are fulfilled.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0126\n\n\nPre-merger certificate\n\n\n1. Each Member State shall designate the court, notary or other authority competent to scrutinise the legality of the cross-border merger as regards that part of the procedure which concerns each merging company subject to its national law.\n\n\n2. In each Member State concerned the authority referred to in paragraph\u00a01 shall issue, without delay to each merging company subject to that State\u2019s national law, a certificate conclusively attesting to the proper completion of the pre-merger acts and formalities.\n\n\n3. If the law of a Member State to which a merging company is subject provides for a procedure to scrutinise and amend the ratio applicable to the exchange of securities or shares, or a procedure to compensate minority members, without preventing the registration of the cross-border merger, such procedure shall only apply if the other merging companies situated in Member States which do not provide for such procedure explicitly accept, when approving the draft terms of the cross-border merger in accordance with Article\u00a0125(1), the possibility for the members of that merging company to have recourse to such procedure, to be initiated before the court having jurisdiction over that merging company. In such cases, the authority referred to in paragraph\u00a01 may issue the certificate referred to in paragraph\u00a02 even if such procedure has commenced. The certificate \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5, however, indicate that the procedure is pending. The decision in the procedure shall be binding on the company resulting from the cross-border merger and all its members.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0127\n\n\nScrutiny of the legality of the cross-border merger\n\n\n1. Each Member State shall designate the court, notary or other authority competent to scrutinise the legality of the cross-border merger as regards that part of the procedure which concerns the completion of the cross-border merger and, where appropriate, the formation of a new company resulting from the cross-border merger where the company created by the cross-border merger is subject to its national law. The said authority shall in particular ensure that the merging companies have approved the common draft terms of cross-border merger in the same terms and, where appropriate, that arrangements for employee participation have been determined in accordance with Article\u00a0132.\n\n\n2. To that end each merging company shall submit to the authority referred to in paragraph\u00a01 the certificate referred to in Article\u00a0126(2) within six months of its issue together with the common draft terms of cross-border merger approved by the general meeting referred to in Article\u00a0125.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0128\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Date on which\u00a0\u00d5 the cross-border merger \u00d6\u00a0takes effect\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nThe law of the Member State to whose jurisdiction the company resulting from the cross-border merger is subject shall determine the date on which the cross-border merger takes effect. That date \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be after the scrutiny referred to in Article\u00a0127 has been carried out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU Art. 2(1) (adapted)\n\n\nArticle\u00a0129\n\n\nRegistration\n\n\nThe law of each of the Member States to whose jurisdiction the merging companies were subject shall determine, with respect to the territory of that State, the arrangements, in accordance with Article\u00a015, for publicising the completion of the cross-border merger in the public register in which each of the companies is required to file documents.\n\n\nThe registry for the registration of the company resulting from the cross-border merger shall notify, through the system of interconnection registers established in accordance with Article\u00a021(2) and without delay, the registry in which each of the companies was required to file documents that the cross-border merger has taken effect. Deletion of the old registration, if applicable, shall be effected on receipt of that notification, but not before.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC (adapted)\n\n\nArticle\u00a0130\n\n\nConsequences of \u00d6\u00a0a\u00a0\u00d5 cross-border merger\n\n\n1.

Without prejudice to paragraph\u00a02, the company resulting from the cross-border merger shall be subject to the rules in force concerning employee participation, if any, in the Member State where it has its registered office.\n\n\n2. However, the rules in force concerning employee participation, if any, in the Member State where the company resulting from the cross-border merger has its registered office shall not apply, where at least one of the merging companies has, within the six months prior to the publication of the draft terms of the cross-border merger as referred to in Article\u00a0122, an average number of employees that exceeds 500 and is operating under an employee participation system within the meaning of Article\u00a02(k) of Directive\u00a02001/86/EC, or where the national law applicable to the company resulting from the cross-border merger does not:\n\n\n(a)provide for at least the same level of employee participation as operated in the relevant merging companies, measured by reference to the proportion of employee representatives amongst the members of the administrative or supervisory organ or their committees or of the management group which covers the profit units of the company, subject to employee representation; or\n\n\n\n\n(b)provide for employees of establishments of the company resulting from the cross-border merger that are situated in other Member States the same entitlement to exercise participation rights as is enjoyed by those employees employed in the Member State where the company resulting from the cross-border merger has its registered office.\n\n\n3. In the cases referred to in paragraph\u00a02, the participation of employees in the company resulting from the cross-border merger and their involvement in the definition of such rights shall be regulated by the Member States, mutatis mutandis and subject to paragraphs\u00a04 to\u00a07 , in accordance with the principles and procedures laid down in Article\u00a012(2), (3) and\u00a0(4) of Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a02157/2001 and the following provisions of Directive\u00a02001/86/EC:\n\n\n(a)Article\u00a03(1), (2) and (3), the first indent of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a03(4), the second subparagraph of Article 3(4)and Article\u00a03(5) and (7);\n\n\n(b)Article\u00a04(1), Article\u00a04(2) (a), (g) and (h) and Article\u00a04(3);\n\n\n(c)Article\u00a05;\n\n\n(d)Article\u00a06;\n\n\n(e)Article\u00a07(1), point\u00a0(b) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a07(2), the second\u00a0subparagraph of Article\u00a07(2) and\u00a0Article\u00a07(3).

When regulating the principles and procedures referred to in paragraph\u00a03, Member States:\n\n\n(a)shall confer on the relevant organs of the merging companies the right to choose without any prior negotiation to be directly subject to the standard rules for participation referred to in paragraph\u00a03(h), as laid down by the legislation of the Member State in which the company resulting from the cross-border merger is to have its registered office, and to abide by those rules from the date of registration;\n\n\n(b)shall confer on the special negotiating body the right to decide, by a majority of twothirds of its members representing at least two thirds of the employees, including the votes of members representing employees in at least two different Member States, not to open negotiations or to terminate negotiations already opened and to rely on the rules on participation in force in the Member State where the registered office of the company resulting from the cross-border merger will be situated;\n\n\n(c)may, in the case where, following prior negotiations, standard rules for participation apply and notwithstanding these rules, determine to limit the proportion of employee representatives in the administrative organ of the company resulting from the cross-border merger. However, if in one of the merging companies employee representatives constituted at least one third of the administrative or supervisory board, the limitation may never result in a lower proportion of employee representatives in the administrative organ than one\u00a0third.\n\n\n5. The extension of participation rights to employees of the company resulting from the cross-border merger employed in other Member States, referred to in paragraph\u00a02(b), shall not entail any obligation for Member States which choose to do so to take those employees into account when calculating the size of workforce thresholds giving rise to participation rights under national law.\n\n\n6. When at least one of the merging companies is operating under an employee participation system and the company resulting from the cross-border merger is to be governed by such a system in accordance with the rules referred to in paragraph\u00a02, that company shall be obliged to take a legal form allowing for the exercise of participation rights.\n\n\n7. When the company resulting from the cross-border merger is operating under an employee participation system, that company shall be obliged to take measures to ensure that employees\u2019 participation rights are protected in the event of subsequent domestic mergers for a period of three years after the cross-border merger has taken effect, by applying mutatis mutandis the rules laid down in this Article.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0133\n\n\nValidity\n\n\nA cross-border merger which has taken effect as provided for in Article\u00a0128 may not be declared null and void.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02012/17/EU (adapted)\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02005/56/EC (adapted)\n\n\nArticle\u00a0134\n\n\nReview\n\n\n\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Five years after\u00a015\u00a0December\u00a02007\u00a0\u00d5 the Commission shall review \u00d6\u00a0the provisions of\u00a0\u00d5 this \u00d6\u00a0Chapter\u00a0\u00d5 in the light of the experience acquired in applying it and, if necessary, propose its amendment.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC (adapted)\n\n\nChapter\u00a0III\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Divisions of public limited liability companies\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nSection\u00a01\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Division by acquisition\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nArticle\u00a0135\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0General provisions\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1.

Member States may limit that liability to the net assets allocated to each of those companies other than the one to which the obligation has been transferred. However, they need not apply this paragraph where the division operation is subject to the supervision of a judicial authority in accordance with Article\u00a0157 and a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or any class of creditors of the company being divided have agreed to forego such joint and several liability at a meeting held pursuant to Article\u00a0157(l)(c).\n\n\n4. Article\u00a098(3) shall apply.\n\n\n5. Without prejudice to the rules governing the collective exercise of their rights, paragraphs\u00a01 to\u00a04 shall apply to the debenture holders of the companies involved in the division except where the division has been approved by a meeting of the debenture holders, if such a meeting is provided for under national laws, or by the debenture holders individually.\n\n\n6. Member States may provide that the recipient companies shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the company being divided. In such case they need not apply the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n\n7. Where a Member State combines the system of creditor protection set out in paragraph\u00a01 to\u00a05 with the joint and several liability of the recipient companies as referred to in paragraph\u00a06, it may limit such joint and several liability to the net assets allocated to each of those companies.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC (adapted)\n\n\nArticle\u00a0147\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Protection of holders of securities, other than shares, to which special rights are attached\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nHolders of securities, other than shares, to which special rights are attached, \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be given rights in the recipient companies against which such securities may be invoked in accordance with the draft terms of division, at least equivalent to the rights they possessed in the company being divided, unless the alteration of those rights has been approved by a meeting of the holders of such securities, if such a meeting is provided for under national laws, or by the holders of those securities individually, or unless the holders are entitled to have their securities repurchased.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0148\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Drawing up and certification of documents in due legal form\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nWhere the laws of a Member State do not provide for judicial or administrative preventive supervision of the legality of divisions or where such supervision does not extend to all the legal acts required for a division, Article\u00a0101 shall apply.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0149\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Date on which a division takes effect\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nThe laws of Member States shall determine the date on which a division takes effect.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0150\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Publication formalities\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n\n\n1. A division \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be published in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article\u00a015 in respect of each of the companies involved in a division.\n\n\n2. Any recipient company may itself carry out the publication formalities relating to the company being divided.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0151\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Consequences of a division\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC\n\n\n1. A division shall have the following consequences ipso jure and simultaneously:\n\n\n(a)the transfer, both as between the company being divided and the recipient companies and as regards third parties, to each of the recipient companies of all the assets and liabilities of the company being divided; such transfer shall take effect with the assets and liabilities being divided in accordance with the allocation laid down in the draft terms of division or in Article\u00a0137(3);\n\n\n(b)the shareholders of the company being divided become shareholders of one or more of the recipient companies in accordance with the allocation laid down in the draft terms of division;\n\n\n(c)the company being divided ceases to exist.\n\n\n2. No shares in a recipient company shall be exchanged for shares held in the company being divided either:\n\n\n(a)by that recipient company itself or by a person acting in his own name but on its behalf; or\n\n\n(b)by the company being divided itself or by a person acting in his own name but on its behalf.\n\n\n3. The foregoing shall not affect the laws of Member States which require the completion of special formalities for the transfer of certain assets, rights and obligations by a company being divided to be effective as against third parties. The recipient company or companies to which such assets, rights or obligations are transferred in accordance with the draft terms of division or with Article\u00a0137(3) may carry out these formalities themselves; however, the laws of Member States may permit a company being divided to continue to carry out these formalities for a limited period which may not, save in exceptional circumstances, be fixed at more than six months from the date on which the division takes effect.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC (adapted)\n\n\nArticle\u00a0152\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Civil liability of members of the administrative or management bodies of a\u00a0company\u00a0being\u00a0divided\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nThe laws of Member States shall at least lay down rules governing the civil liability of members of the administrative or management bodies of a company being divided towards the shareholders of that company in respect of misconduct on the part of members of those bodies in preparing and implementing the division and the civil liability of the experts responsible for drawing up for that company the report provided for in Article\u00a0142 in respect of misconduct on the part of those experts in the performance of their duties.\n\n\nArticle\u00a0153\n\n\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Conditions for nullity of a division\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. The laws of Member States may lay down nullity rules for divisions in accordance with the following conditions only:\n\n\n(a)nullity must be ordered in a court judgment;\n\n\n(b)divisions which have taken effect pursuant to Article\u00a0149 may be declared void only if there has been no judicial or administrative preventive supervision of their legality, or if they have not been drawn up and certified in due legal form, or if it is shown that the decision of the general meeting is void or voidable under national law;\n\n\n(c)nullification proceedings may not be initiated more than six months after the date on which the division becomes effective as against the person alleging nullity or if the situation has been rectified;\n\n\n(d)where it is possible to remedy a defect liable to render a division void, the competent court shall grant the companies involved a period of time within which to rectify the situation;\n\n\n(e)a judgment declaring a division void shall be published in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article\u00a015 ;\n\n\n(f)where the laws of a Member State permit a third party to challenge such a judgment, he may do so only within six months of publication of the judgment in the manner prescribed by \u00d6\u00a0Chapter\u00a0III of Title\u00a0I\u00a0\u00d5;\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC\n\n\n(g)a judgment declaring a division void shall not of itself affect the validity of obligations owed by or in relation to the recipient companies which arose before the judgment was published and after the date referred to in Article\u00a0149;\n\n\n(h)each of the recipient companies shall be liable for its obligations arising after the date on which the division took effect and before the date on which the decision pronouncing the nullity of the division was published. The company being divided shall also be liable for such obligations; Member States may provide that this liability be limited to the share of net assets transferred to the recipient company on whose account such obligations arose.\n\n\n2. By way of derogation from paragraph\u00a01(a), the laws of a Member State may also provide for the nullity of a division to be ordered by an administrative authority if an appeal against such a decision lies to a court. Paragraph\u00a01(b) and\u00a0(d) to\u00a0(h) shall apply by analogy to the administrative authority. Such nullification proceedings may not be initiated more than six\u00a0months after the date referred to in Article\u00a0149.\n\n\n3.

For the purposes of this \u00d6\u00a0Chapter\u00a0\u00d5 , \u2018division by the formation of new companies\u2019 means the operation whereby, after being wound up without going into liquidation, a company transfers to more than one newly-formed company all its assets and liabilities in exchange for the allocation to the shareholders of the company being divided of shares in the recipient companies, and possibly a cash payment not exceeding 10\u00a0% of the nominal value of the shares allocated or, where they have no nominal value, of their accounting par value.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC\n\n\n2. Article\u00a089(2) shall apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC (adapted)\n\n\nArticle\u00a0156\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Application of rules on divisions by acquisition\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. Articles\u00a0137, 138, 139, and\u00a0141, Article\u00a0142(1) and\u00a0(2) and Articles\u00a0143 to\u00a0153 shall apply, without prejudice to Articles\u00a011 and\u00a012 , to division by the formation of new companies. For this purpose, the \u00d6\u00a0term\u00a0\u00d5 \u2018companies involved in a division\u2019 shall refer to the company being divided and the \u00d6\u00a0term\u00a0\u00d5 \u2018recipient companies\u2019 shall refer to each of the new companies.\n\n\n2. In addition to the information specified in Article\u00a0137(2), the draft terms of division shall indicate the form, name and registered office of each of the new companies.\n\n\n3. The draft terms of division and, if they are contained in a separate document, the memorandum or draft memorandum of association and the articles or draft articles of association of each of the new companies shall be approved at a general meeting of the company being divided.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/109/EC Art. 3(8)(b)\n\n\n4. Member States shall not impose the requirements set out in Articles\u00a0141 and\u00a0142 and in Article\u00a0143(1)(c), (d) and\u00a0(e) where the shares in each of the new companies are allocated to the shareholders of the company being divided in proportion to their rights in the capital of that company.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC\n\n\nSection\u00a03\n\n\nDivisions under the supervision of a judicial authority\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC (adapted)\n\n\nArticle\u00a0157\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Divisions under the supervision of a judicial authority\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1.

Where a Member State makes use of the option provided for in Article\u00a0140, the period \u00d6\u00a0shall\u00a0\u00d5 be long enough for the shareholders of the recipient companies to be able to exercise the rights conferred on them by that Article;\n\n\n\n\n(c)to call any meeting of creditors of each of the companies involved in a division in order to decide upon the division;\n\n\n(d)to ensure that the creditors of each of the companies involved in a division have received or can obtain at least the draft terms of division in time to examine them before the date referred to in point\u00a0(b);\n\n\n(e)to approve the draft terms of division.\n\n\n2. Where the judicial authority establishes that the conditions referred to in paragraph\u00a01(b) and\u00a0(d) have been fulfilled and that no prejudice would be caused to shareholders or creditors, it may relieve the companies involved in the division from applying:\n\n\n(a)Article\u00a0138, on condition that the adequate system of protection of the interest of the creditors referred to in Article\u00a0146(1) covers all claims regardless of their date;\n\n\n(b)the conditions referred to in Article\u00a0140(a) and\u00a0(b) where a Member State makes use of the option provided for in Article\u00a0140;\n\n\n(c)Article\u00a0143, as regards the period and the manner prescribed for the inspection of the documents referred to therein.\n\n\n Section\u00a04\n\n\nOther operations treated as divisions\n\n\nArticle\u00a0158\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Divisions with cash payment exceeding 10\u00a0%\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC\n\n\nWhere, in the case of one of the operations specified in Article 135, the laws of a Member State permit the cash payment to exceed 10\u00a0%, Sections\u00a01, 2 and\u00a03 of this Chapter shall apply.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC (adapted)\n\n\nArticle\u00a0159\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Divisions without the company being divided ceasing to exist\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC\n\n\n\n\nWhere the laws of a Member State permit one of the operations specified in Article\u00a0135 without the company being divided ceasing to exist, Sections\u00a01, 2 and\u00a03 of this Chapter shall apply, except for Article\u00a0151(1)(c).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a082/891/EEC (adapted)\n\n\nSection\u00a05\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Application arrangements\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\nArticle\u00a0160\n\n\n\u00d6\u00a0Transitional provisions\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1.
