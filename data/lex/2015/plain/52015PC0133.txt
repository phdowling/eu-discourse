The aim of the Convention is to protect\r\nhuman health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The\r\nConvention provides a framework, based on the precautionary principle, for\r\nelimination of production, use, import and export of currently twenty-three\r\npriority POPs, their safe handling and disposal and elimination or reduction of\r\nreleases of certain unintentional POPs.\nRegulation (EC) No 850/2004 on persistent\r\norganic pollutants[2]\r\nimplements in Union law the commitments set out in the Convention and in the\r\nProtocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on\r\nPersistent Organic Pollutants (the Protocol), approved by Council Decision\r\n259/2004/EC[3].\nArticle 8(1) of the Convention stipulates\r\nthat any Party may submit a proposal to the Secretariat for listing a chemical\r\nin Annexes A, B or C to the Convention which will then be reviewed by the\r\nPersistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee (POP RC) following Article 8(3)\r\nand (4). The proposal shall contain the information specified in Annex D. The\r\nprocedure for the adoption of amendments to Annexes is governed by Article 22\r\nof the Convention.\nAccording to available scientific\r\ninformation and review reports, as well as taking due account of the screening\r\ncriteria laid down in Annex D to the Convention, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA),\r\nPFOA salts and PFOA-related substances that can be degraded to PFOA under\r\nenvironmental conditions exhibit characteristics of POPs. In the following,\r\nreference to \u201cPFOA and its compounds\u201d denotes all forms described pertaining to\r\nthis paragraph.\nA recent market analysis[4], conducted on behalf of\r\nthe European Commission, revealed only one company manufacturing ammonium\r\npentadecafluorooctanoate (APFO) was active in the Union in 2010. This company\r\nannounced cessation of production of APFO as per August 2010 and cessation of\r\nits commercialisation as per November 2010.\u00a0 The market analysis also showed\r\nthat PFOA and APFO are mainly used in the Union in the production of\r\nfluoropolymers and fluoroelastomers[5]\r\nand that entry into the environment occurs at this stage.\nOn 20 June 2013, following unanimous\r\nagreement of the EU's Member State Committee under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006\r\nof the European Parliament and the Council, concerning the Registration,\r\nEvaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)[6], PFOA and APFO were\r\nadded to the EU's Candidate List for authorisation[7] having been identified\r\nas Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs). The identification of PFOA and APFO\r\nas a SVHC was based on an information dossier[8]\r\nprepared by Germany pursuant to Annex XV of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.\u00a0 The\r\nscientific data presented in this dossier showed that PFOA and APFO met the\r\ncriteria of Article 57(c) of REACH as toxic for reproduction 1B and in\r\nparticular, that they also met the criteria of Article 57(d) of REACH as a\r\nsubstance which is persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT).\nIn October 2013, PFOA and APFO received a\r\nharmonised classification in Annex VI of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on\r\nclassification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (CLP)[9], as amended by\r\nCommission Regulation (EU) No 944/2013[10],\r\nas carcinogen category 2, toxic for reproduction category 1B and specific\r\ntarget organ toxicants on liver following repeated exposure category 1 (STOT RE\r\n1 liver). Following this classification, the placing on the market and use of\r\nPFOA and APFO as substances or in mixtures for supply to the general public are\r\nbanned in the Union since 1 January 2015, in accordance with Regulation (EC)\r\n1907/2006 as amended by Regulation (EU) No 317/2014[11].\nSince this point, the German and Norwegian\r\nCompetent Authorities have jointly compiled a dossier under Annex XV of REACH\r\nwith the intention of proposing PFOA compounds for inclusion in the restriction process under REACH. This\r\nRestriction dossier[12]\r\nwas submitted to ECHA on 17 October 2014 and proposes a restriction on the\r\nmanufacture, use or placing on the market of PFOA compounds\r\nas substances on their own, or as constituents of other\r\nsubstances, in mixtures or articles. \nDue to their outstanding technical\r\nproperties (to provide water, oil, and grease repellency) PFOA compounds are used in various consumer\r\nproducts as well as in industrial applications. These uses lead to the\r\nwide-dispersive release of PFOA, its salts and related substances into the\r\nenvironment. Globally, the sources of PFOA have been significantly reduced in\r\nthe USA, Japan and the Union. However, it is important to note, that the\r\nmanufacture of fluoropolymers is shifting to countries such as Russia and\r\nChina, where it is assumed that a large share of fluoropolymers is still\r\nproduced using PFOA. This can be seen from consumer articles containing PFOA\r\nwhich are often imported from outside the Union. The global fluoropolymer\r\nmarket is continuously growing (5-6% per year globally). \nThe dossier estimates, based on available\r\ninformation, that 40 tonnes per annum (t/a) of PFOA and\r\nits salts are currently imported into the Union. In addition, it estimates that\r\n100 - 1000 t/a of PFOA-related substances are manufactured in the Union and\r\nthat a further 100 \u2013 1000 t/a are imported into the Union. In addition, the\r\nPFOA-related substances enter the Union via imported articles, such as\r\ntextiles, which are expected to account for significant volumes of PFOA-related\r\nsubstances.\nIn addition to their proven PBT qualities,\r\nas evidenced in the REACH and CLP classifications noted above, the Annex XV\r\nRestriction dossier also investigates the long-range environmental transport\r\n(LRT) potential of PFOA and its compounds. The dossier makes reference to a report conducted by the OECD in\r\n2006 that concluded that PFOA and its compounds are subject to long range environmental transport and have been\r\nfound in remote areas such as the Arctic[13].\r\nThe dossier concludes that this confirms emissions of PFOA and its compounds as a transboundary pollution\r\nproblem.\nGiven the information currently available\r\nregarding the PBT and LRT qualities of PFOA and its\r\ncompounds and, on the basis of the studies and reports\r\noutlined above, it is proposed that PFOA and its compounds\r\nmeet the criteria of Annex D to the Convention and\r\ntherefore could be considered as a POP.\nPFOA and its compounds are still produced, used or unintentionally\r\nemitted in significant amounts in third countries. Due to the potential for\r\nlong-range environmental transport of these chemicals, the measures taken\r\nnationally or at the Union level are not sufficient to safeguard the high level\r\nof protection of the environment and human health and wider international\r\naction is necessary.\nWith a view to the next POPRC meeting in\r\nOctober 2015, it is appropriate that the Commission submit on behalf of the\r\nUnion a proposal for the listing of PFOA and its compounds for inclusion in Annex A to the Secretariat\r\nof the Stockholm Convention. This constitutes a position to be adopted on the\r\nUnion's behalf for the purpose of Article 218(9) TFEU.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nA paper[14]\r\nconcerning the common understanding between the Convention, the Protocol and\r\nREACH was endorsed by the Competent Authorities of the EU Member States in July\r\n2014.\nThe decision to submit a proposal for the\r\nlisting of PFOA and its compounds in Annex A to the Convention is based on the\r\nconclusions of this common understanding paper in which it states that the process\r\nfor including a substance in Annex XVII (Restriction) of REACH can run\r\nconcurrently with the process of including a substance in one of the Annexes to\r\nthe Convention and, furthermore, that the completion of the REACH Restriction\r\nprocess for a substance could facilitate the development of the EU position for\r\nthe Conference of Parties when the listing of that substance will have to be\r\ndecided.\nIn the event that PFOA and its compounds are nominated for listing in Annex A to the\r\nConvention, a further period of consultation and assessment will commence with\r\ninterested stakeholders and any other interested Parties to the Convention.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThis proposal will result in the\r\ncompilation of an information dossier pursuant to the provisions of Article\r\n8(1) and criteria of Annex D to the Convention upon which a proposal will be\r\nsubmitted to the Convention's Secretariat to add PFOA and its compounds to\r\nAnnex A of the Convention. \n2015/0066 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the submission, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, of a proposal for the listing of additional chemicals in Annex\r\nA to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 191(1), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union ratified the\r\nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (the Convention) on 16\r\nNovember 2004 by Council Decision 2006/507/EC of 14 October 2004 concerning the\r\nconclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Stockholm Convention on\r\nPersistent Organic Pollutants[15].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a Party to the\r\nConvention, the Union may make proposals for amendment of the Annexes to the\r\nConvention. Annex A to the Convention lists persistent organic pollutants\r\n(POPs) to be eliminated.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to available\r\nscientific information and review reports as well as taking due account of the\r\nscreening criteria laid down in Annex D to the Convention, perfluorooctanoic\r\nacid (PFOA), its salts and PFOA-related\r\nsubstances that can be degraded to PFOA under environmental conditions\r\n(hereinafter PFOA and its compounds) exhibit characteristics of POPs. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n59(1) and an Annex XV dossier[16]\r\nof Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council,\r\nconcerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of\r\nChemicals (REACH)[17],\r\nPFOA and its ammonium salt (APFO) have been included in the Candidate List of\r\nsubstances of very high concern having been identified as meeting the criteria\r\nof Article 57(c) of that regulation as toxic for reproduction 1B and in\r\nparticular, that it also met the criteria of Article 57(d) of that regulation\r\nas a substance which is persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further to the provisions\r\nof Article 69(4) of REACH, PFOA and its compounds are currently the subject of\r\nan Annex XV dossier[18],\r\nsubmitted to the European Chemical Agency, aiming to restrict the manufacture,\r\nuse or placing on the market of PFOA and its compounds on their own, or as\r\nconstituents of other substances, in a mixture or articles.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PFOA and its compounds are\r\nsubstances with worldwide dispersive uses and are ubiquitously detected in the\r\nenvironment. Due to the potential for long-range environmental transport of\r\nPFOA, the measures taken at Union level are not sufficient to safeguard the\r\nhigh level of protection of the environment and human health and wider international\r\naction is necessary.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union should therefore\r\nsubmit a proposal to the Secretariat of the Convention for the listing of PFOA\r\nand its compounds in Annex A to the Convention. This proposal and the Union's\r\nposition regarding the conditions for listing PFOA and its compounds in Annex A\r\nto the Convention should take account of any relevant information obtained in\r\nthe course of the on-going restriction procedure under Articles 68 to 73 of\r\nREACH.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1. The Union shall submit a proposal for\r\nthe listing of PFOA and its compounds in Annex A to the Stockholm Convention on\r\nPersistent Organic Pollutants (the Convention).\n2. The Commission shall communicate the\r\nproposal on behalf of the Union to the Secretariat of the Convention with all\r\nthe information required under Annex D to the Convention.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\nday of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 209, 31.7.2006, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 7.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 81, 19.3.2004, p. 35.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 van der Putte I, Murin M, van Velthoven M, Affourtit\r\nF. 2010.
