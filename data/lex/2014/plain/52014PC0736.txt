The request was\r\ncompleted on 15 September 2014 with a report covering the application of\r\nDecision 2012/232/EU. \nGeneral context\nArticle 168 of the VAT Directive provides\r\nthat a taxable person is entitled to deduct VAT charged on purchases made for\r\nthe purpose of taxed transactions. Article 26(1)(a) of the same Directive\r\nrequires the use of goods forming part of the assets of a business for private\r\npurposes to be a supply of services for consideration if the VAT on the goods\r\nwas eligible for deduction. This system allows for the recovery of initially\r\ndeducted VAT in relation to the private use. \nIn the case of passenger cars, this system\r\nis difficult to apply, in particular because it is difficult to identify the\r\nsplit between private and business use. Where records are kept, they add an\r\nadditional burden to both the business and the administration in maintaining\r\nand checking them, even in case Romania would make use of the option provided\r\nfor in Article 168a of the VAT Directive to limit the deduction on expenditure\r\nrelated to company cars to the proportion of the taxable person's effective\r\nbusiness use. \nIn order to simplify VAT collection and\r\ncombat tax evasion, in 2011 Romania requested an individual derogation allowing\r\nit to restrict the right of deduction to 50% in relation to certain motorised\r\nroad vehicles. The derogation request was approved by the Council by Decision\r\n2012/232/EU of 26 April 2012 and expires on 31 December 2014. Some categories\r\nof vehicles were specifically excluded from this restriction, such as vehicles\r\nused exclusively for emergency, security or courier services, vehicles used by\r\nagents and taxis, vehicles used for instruction by driving schools, used for\r\nhire or leasing or used as commodities for trading purposes. At the same time,\r\nbusinesses would be relieved from accounting from tax on the private use. \u00a0\nIn accordance with the second subparagraph\r\nof Article 4(2) of the above mentioned Decision, Romania has presented a report\r\ncovering the application of the Decision which included a review of the\r\npercentage restriction. It appears from the information provided by Romania that they find that the limitation of 50% still corresponds to the actual\r\ncircumstances and that this limit therefore still should be regarded as\r\nappropriate. \nHowever, any extension should be limited in\r\ntime in order to assess whether the conditions on which the derogation is based\r\nwould still be valid. Therefore, it is proposed to extend the derogation until\r\nthe end of 2017 and to request Romania to present a new report if a new\r\nextension request would be envisaged beyond that date. \nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nArticle 176 of the VAT Directive stipulates\r\nthat the Council shall determine the expenditure on which the VAT is not\r\ndeductible. Until such time, it authorises Member States to maintain exclusions\r\nwhich were in place on 1 January 1979. There are therefore a number of\r\n\"stand still\" provisions restricting the right to deduct in relation\r\nto passenger cars. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\r\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nThis proposal is based on a request made by\r\n Romania and concerns only this Member State.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThe Decision proposal aims\r\nin the first place at simplifying the collecting of VAT in relation to\r\npassenger cars partly used for non-business purposes and has therefore a\r\npotential positive impact. At the same time, tax evasion via incorrect record\r\nkeeping is countered. \nHowever, because of the\r\nnarrow scope of the derogation and the limited application in time, the impact\r\nwill in any case be limited. It will have no adverse impact on the Union's own resources accruing from VAT.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nAuthorisation for Romania to continue to\r\napply a derogating measure from the VAT Directive as to restrict to 50% the\r\nright of a taxable person to deduct VAT on expenditure related to motorised\r\nvehicles when the vehicle is not used exclusively for business purposes. When the\r\nright of deduction has been limited, the taxable person is relieved from the\r\nobligation to account for VAT on the private use of the car. Any possible\r\nrequest for extending the measure should be accompanied by the submission of a\r\nreport on the application of the derogation, including a review of the\r\npercentage restriction. \nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive. \nSubsidiarity principle\nConsidering the provision of the VAT\r\nDirective on which the proposal is based, the proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies\r\nwith the proportionality principle for the following reasons. \nThe Decision concerns\r\nan authorisation granted to a Member State upon its own request and does not\r\nconstitute any obligation. \nGiven the limited scope\r\nof the derogation, the special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued,\r\ni.e. to combat tax evasion and to simplify VAT Collection. \nChoice of\r\ninstruments\nUnder Article 395 of\r\nthe VAT Directive, derogation from the common VAT rules is only possible with\r\nthe authorisation of the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the\r\nCommission. Moreover, a Council Decision is the most suitable instrument since\r\nit can be addressed to individual Member States. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\r\nIMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nunion budget. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL\r\nELEMENTS\nThe proposal includes a sunset clause. \n2014/0352 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nextending the period of validity of\r\nDecision 2012/232/EU authorising Romania to apply measures derogating from\r\npoint (a) of Article 26(1) and Article 168 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the\r\ncommon system of value added tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF\r\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council\r\nDirective 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added\r\ntax[1], and in\r\nparticular Article 395(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the\r\nproposal from the European Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter registered at\r\nthe Commission on 13 February 2014, Romania requested authorisation to continue\r\nto apply a measure derogating from Articles 26(1)(a) and 168 of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC in order to restrict the right of deduction in relation to\r\nexpenditure on certain motorised road vehicles not wholly used for business\r\npurposes. By letter registered at the Commission on 15 September 2014, Romania complemented its request with a report on the application of Council Decision\r\n2012/232/EU.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nsecond subparagraph of Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, by letter dated\r\n12 November 2014, the Commission informed the other Member States of the\r\nrequest made by Romania. By letter dated 13 November 2014, the Commission\r\nnotified Romania that it had all the information necessary to consider the\r\nrequest.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 168 of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC authorises a taxable person to deduct VAT charged on supplies of\r\ngoods and services received by that person where the goods and services in\r\nquestion are used for the purposes of his taxed transactions. Point (a) of\r\nArticle 26(1) of that Directive contains a requirement to account for VAT when\r\na business asset is put to use for the private purposes of the taxable person\r\nor his staff or, more generally, for purposes other than those of his business.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2012/232/EU authorised\r\nRomania to apply a derogating measure pursuant to Article 395(1) of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC in order to implement a measure to limit the right of deduction of\r\ninput VAT to 50% as regards purchase, intra-EU acquisition, importation, hire\r\nand lease of motor vehicles, and VAT on expenditure related to such vehicles,\r\nincluding fuel, when the vehicles are not used exclusively for business\r\npurposes.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2012/232/EU is\r\ndue to expire on 31 December 2014.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nsecond subparagraph of Article 4(2) of Decision 2012/232/EU, Romania submitted a report to the Commission on the application of that Decision, including a review\r\nof the percentage restriction applied on the right of deduction. As was the\r\ncase with respect to the previous derogation, Romania continues to maintain\r\nthat a rate of 50% is justifiable. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is considered that the\r\nderogation would only have negligible effect on the overall amount of tax\r\nrevenue collected at the stage of final consumption and will have no adverse\r\nimpact on the Union's own resources accruing from VAT. Romania should therefore be authorised to continue to apply the measure for a limited\r\nperiod, until 31 December 2017.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the event Romania were\r\nto request a further extension of the derogating measure beyond 2017, a new\r\nreport should be submitted to the Commission together with the extension\r\nrequest no later than 31 March 2017, \nHAS ADOPTED THIS\r\nDECISION: \nArticle 1\nDecision 2012/232/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 4 is replaced by the following:\n\"Article 4\nThis Decision shall\r\nexpire on 31 December 2017. \nAny request for the\r\nextension of the measures provided for in this Decision shall be submitted to\r\nthe Commission by 31 March 2017. \nSuch a request shall be\r\naccompanied by a report which includes a review of the percentage restriction\r\napplied on the right to deduct VAT on the basis of this Decision.\"\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall\r\napply from 1 January 2015. \nArticle 3\nThis Decision is\r\naddressed to Romania.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p.1. \n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
