In accordance with Article 395(2) of the VAT\r\nDirective, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 11\r\nJune 2014 of the request made by Estonia. By letter dated 12 June 2014, the\r\nCommission notified Estonia that it had all the information it considered\r\nnecessary for appraisal of the request.\nGeneral context\nArticles 168 and 168a of the VAT Directive\r\nprovide that a taxable person is entitled to deduct VAT charged on purchases\r\nmade for the purpose of taxed transactions. Article 26(1)(a) of the same\r\nDirective requires the use of goods forming part of the assets of a business\r\nfor private purposes to be a supply of services for consideration if the VAT on\r\nthe goods was eligible for deduction. This system allows for the recovery of\r\ninitially deducted VAT in relation to the private use. \nIn the case of passenger cars, this system\r\nis difficult to apply, in particular because it is difficult to identify the\r\nsplit between private and business use. Where records are kept, they add an\r\nadditional burden to both the business and the administration in maintaining\r\nand checking them, even in case Estonia would make use of the option provided\r\nfor in Article 168a of the VAT Directive to limit the deduction on expenditure\r\nrelated to company cars to the proportion of the taxable person\u2019s effective\r\nbusiness use. \nTherefore, Estonia has requested to be\r\nallowed to restrict the right of deduction to a set percentage and in turn to\r\nrelieve the business from accounting for tax on the private use. This has the\r\nbenefit of simplifying the system for all concerned and prevents, at the same\r\ntime, tax evasion or avoidance because of incorrect record keeping. \nOn the basis of information provided by Estonia, it appears that, on average, 50% of the use of business passenger cars are used\r\nfor private purposes. The percentage restriction should therefore be set at\r\n50%.\nThe new system will apply to all passenger\r\ncars with a maximum of eight seats in addition to the driver\u2019s seat, not\r\nexceeding 3500 kilograms and which are not used exclusively for business\r\npurposes. However, passenger cars which are used for certain specific\r\nactivities would be excluded from the restriction on the right to deduct and\r\nwould be treated under the normal rules: cars purchased for resale, hire or\r\nlease, cars used for transportation of passengers (such as taxis), and cars\r\nused for driving lessons. \nThe derogation should be limited in time to\r\n31 December 2017, in order to be able to assess whether the 50% restriction is\r\nstill a correct reflection of the overall apportionment between business and\r\nprivate use. Any extension request should be accompanied by a report which\r\nincludes a review of the percentage applied and should be sent to the\r\nCommission with that request by 31 March 2017. \nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nSimilar derogations in relation to the\r\nright of deduction have been granted to other Member States. \nArticle 176 of the VAT Directive stipulates\r\nthat the Council shall determine the expenditure on which the VAT is not\r\ndeductible. Until such time, it authorises Member States to maintain exclusions\r\nwhich were in place on 1 January 1979. There are therefore a number of \u201cstand\r\nstill\u201d provisions restricting the right to deduct in relation to passenger\r\ncars. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nNot relevant.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThe Decision proposal aims in the first\r\nplace at simplifying the collecting of VAT in relation to passenger cars partly\r\nused for non-business purposes and has therefore a potential positive impact.\r\nAt the same time, tax evasion via incorrect record keeping is countered.\nHowever, because of the narrow scope of the\r\nderogation and the limited application in time, the impact will in any case be\r\nlimited. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nAuthorisation for Estonia to restrict the right of deduction to 50% of VAT incurred on expenditure in\r\nrelation to business passenger cars not exclusively used for business purposes.\r\nWhere that right to deduct has been limited, the taxable person is relieved\r\nfrom accounting for VAT on the private use of the car. \nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive.\nSubsidiarity principle\nConsidering the provision of the VAT Directive\r\non which the proposal is based, the proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons.\nThe Decision concerns an authorisation\r\ngranted to a Member State upon its own request and does not constitute any\r\nobligation.\nGiven the limited scope of the derogation,\r\nthe special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued.\nChoice of instruments\nUnder Article 395 of the VAT Directive,\r\nderogation from the common VAT rules is only possible with the authorisation of\r\nthe Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission. Moreover, a\r\nCouncil Decision is the most suitable instrument since it can be addressed to\r\nindividual Member States. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nunion budget. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nThe proposal includes a sunset clause.\n2014/0288 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nauthorising the Republic of Estonia to apply a special measure derogating from point (a) of Article 26(1) and Articles 168\r\nand 168a of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\r\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive\r\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax[1], and in particular\r\nArticle 395(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter registered with\r\nthe Commission on 26 May 2014, Estonia requested authorisation to derogate from\r\nthe provisions of Directive 2006/112/EC governing the right to deduct input tax\r\nin relation to passenger cars.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission informed\r\nthe other Member States by letter dated 11 June 2014 of the request made by Estonia. By letter dated 12 June 2014, the Commission notified Estonia that it had all the\r\ninformation it considered necessary for appraisal of the request.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Articles 168 and 168a of\r\nDirective 2006/112/EC establish a taxable person\u2019s right to deduct value added\r\ntax (VAT) charged on supplies of goods and services received by him for the use\r\nof his taxed transactions. Article 26(1)(a) of that Directive contains a\r\nrequirement to account for VAT when a business asset is put to non-business\r\nuse.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The non-business use is\r\noften very difficult to identify accurately and even where it is possible, the\r\nmechanism for doing so is often burdensome. Under the requested authorisation,\r\nthe amount of VAT on expenditure eligible for deduction in respect of passenger\r\ncars which are not used entirely for business purposes should, with some\r\nexceptions, be set at a flat percentage rate. Based on currently available\r\ninformation, the Estonian authorities believe that a rate of 50% is\r\njustifiable. At the same time, in order to avoid double taxation, the\r\nrequirement of accounting for VAT on the non-business use of passenger cars\r\nshould be suspended where those cars have been subject to a limitation. This\r\nsimplification measure removes the need to keep records on private use of\r\nbusiness cars and, at the same time, prevents tax evasion through incorrect\r\nrecord keeping.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The limitation of the\r\nright of deduction under the requested authorisation should apply to VAT paid\r\non the purchase, leasing, intra-Community acquisition and importation of\r\nspecified passenger cars and on expenditure related thereto, including the\r\npurchase of fuel.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The requested authorisation\r\nshould only apply to passenger cars with a maximum authorised weight not\r\nexceeding 3500 kilograms and having not more than eight seats in addition to\r\nthe driver\u2019s seat, since any non-business use of passenger cars exceeding 3500\r\nkilograms or having more than eight seats in addition to the driver\u2019s seat is\r\nnegligible due to their nature or the type of business they are used for. A\r\ndetailed list of specific passenger cars excluded from that authorisation\r\nshould also be provided, based on their particular use.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The authorisation should\r\nbe limited in time until 31 December 2017, in order to allow for a review of\r\nthe necessity and effectiveness of the derogating measure and the apportionment\r\nrate between business and non-business use it is based on.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where Estonia considers that an extension of the authorisation beyond 2017 is necessary, it should submit\r\nto the Commission a report which includes a review of the percentage limit\r\napplied together with the request for an extension no later than 31 March 2017.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogation will only\r\nhave a negligible effect on the overall amount of tax revenue collected at the\r\nstage of final consumption and will have no adverse impact on the Union\u2019s own\r\nresources accruing from VAT,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nBy way of derogation from Articles 168 and 168a\r\nof Directive 2006/112/EC, Estonia is authorised to limit to 50% the right of\r\ndeduct the value added tax (VAT) on expenditure on passenger cars not wholly\r\nused for business purposes.\nArticle 2\nBy way of derogation from point (a) of\r\nArticle 26(1) of Directive 2006/112/EC, Estonia shall not treat as supplies of\r\nservices for consideration the use for non-business purposes of a passenger car\r\nincluded in the assets of a taxable person\u2019s business, where that car has been\r\nsubject to a limitation authorised under Article 1 of this Decision.\nArticle 3\nThe expenditure referred to in Article 1\r\nshall cover the purchase, leasing, intra-Community acquisition and importation\r\nof passenger cars not wholly used for business purposes as well as expenditure\r\nrelated to the maintenance, repair and fuel for such cars.\nArticle 4\nThe Decision should only apply to passenger\r\ncars with a maximum authorised weight not exceeding 3500 kilograms and having\r\nnot more than eight seats in addition to the driver\u2019s seat.\nArticle 5\nArticles 1 and 2 shall not apply to the\r\nfollowing categories of passenger cars:\n(a) cars purchased for resale, hire or\r\nlease;\n(b) cars used for transportation of\r\npassengers for a fee, including taxi services;\n(c) cars used for the provision of driving\r\nlessons.\nArticle 6\nThis Decision shall expire on 31 December\r\n2017. Any request for the extension of the authorisation provided for in this\r\nDecision shall be submitted to the Commission by 30 March 2017 and accompanied\r\nby a report which includes a review of the percentage set out in Article 1.\nArticle 7\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of   Estonia. \nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
