This AEO\r\nlegislation came into force in January 2008. The objective of trade partnership\r\nprogrammes such as the AEO programme is to provide facilitation to reliable traders\r\nwhich demonstrate compliance with customs requirements and secure their part of\r\nthe international supply chain.\nMutual recognition of trade partnership\r\nprogrammes enhances end-to-end supply chain security and facilitates trade. It\r\nconsolidates internationally the approach agreed in the World Customs\r\nOrganization\u2019s Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Trade. It also\r\naddresses the concerns of the business community to avoid proliferation of\r\nrequirements and to standardise customs security procedures.\nThe Co-operation and Mutual Administrative\r\nAssistance Agreement in Customs Matters (\u2018CCMAAA\u2019) between the European\r\nCommunity and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u2018China\u2019) signed\r\non 8 December 2004 serves as the basis for EU-China customs relations. According\r\nto the CCMAAA, the respective customs authorities undertake to develop customs\r\ncooperation covering all matters relating to the application of customs\r\nlegislation. In particular, they undertake to develop trade facilitation\r\nactions in customs matters taking account of the work done by international\r\norganisations.\nMutual recognition should allow the EU and China to provide facilitative benefits to economic operators who have invested in\r\ncompliance and supply chain security and have been certified under their\r\nrespective trade partnership programmes.\nIn September 2010 the EU-China Joint\r\nCustoms Cooperation Committee (\u2018JCCC\u2019) requested the drafting of a roadmap\r\ntowards mutual recognition of the AEO programmes. In December 2010 this roadmap\r\nwas agreed at the EU\u2013China Joint Customs Cooperation Steering Group (\u2018JCCC SG\u2019)\r\nmeeting.\nIn June 2011 the in-depth comparison of the\r\nEU\u2019s AEO programme and China\u2019s Measures on Classified Management of Enterprises\r\nProgram were completed by the EU-China AEO Mutual Recognition Working Group. Following\r\nthis in-depth comparison which included both desk reviews and practical\r\nimplementation checks, the EU-China JCCC SG concluded that the two programmes\r\ncan be considered mutually compatible. \nIn June 2012 the EU-China JCCC agreed to\r\nlaunch formal negotiations. Since then, three rounds of negotiations have taken\r\nplace; the first in January 2013, the second in March 2013 and the third in October\r\n2013 to finalise the draft decision of the EU-China JCCC on AEO mutual\r\nrecognition.\nMutual Recognition of trade partnership\r\nprogrammes is a key component of the Strategic Framework for EU-China Customs\r\nCooperation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nMember States were consulted in the\r\nframework of the Working Party on Customs Union of the Council of the European\r\nUnion.\nThere is no need for an impact assessment\r\ninsofar as the decision of the EU-China JCCC implements the CCMAAA and does not\r\nmodify its substance.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe Council is asked to adopt a Union Position\r\non a draft decision of the JCCC based on Article 207(4) first subparagraph, in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union (\u2018TFEU\u2019).\nThe legal basis for the draft decision of\r\nthe JCCC is laid down in Article 21 of the CCMAAA.\nThe proposal falls under the common\r\ncommercial policy, exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity\r\nprinciple therefore does not apply.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no direct implication for\r\nthe Union budget.\n2014/0054 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf\r\nof the European Union, in the EU-China Joint Customs Cooperation Committee\r\nregarding mutual recognition of the Authorised Economic Operator Programme in\r\nthe European Union and the Measures on Classified Management of Enterprises\r\nProgram in the People\u2019s Republic of China\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(4) first\r\nsubparagraph, in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement between the\r\nEuropean Community and the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) on co-operation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters (hereinafter referred\r\nto as 'the CCMAAA') entered into force on 1 April 2005.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 6 of\r\nthe CCMAAA, the Contracting Parties undertake to develop customs cooperation on\r\nall matters relating to the application of customs legislation; they also\r\nundertake to develop trade facilitation actions in customs matters.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mutual recognition of\r\ntrade partnership programmes, namely the Authorised Economic Operator Programme\r\nin the European Union (Union) and the Measures on Classified Management of\r\nEnterprises Program in China enhances supply chain security and safety as well\r\nas facilitates international trade, by allowing the Parties to provide\r\nfacilitative benefits to economic operators which have invested in compliance\r\nand secured their part of the international supply chain, and which have been\r\ncertified under their respective trade partnership programmes.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore\r\nappropriate to establish mutual recognition of the trade partnership\r\nprogrammes.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mutual recognition is to\r\nbe established by a decision of the EU-China Joint Customs Cooperation\r\nCommittee (JCCC) which was set up under Article 21 of the CCMAAA.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union should therefore\r\ntake position in the JCCC as set out in the attached draft decision,\nHAS\r\nADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe position to be taken by the European Union\r\nin the Joint Customs Cooperation Committee, established by the Agreement\r\nbetween the European Community and the People\u2019s Republic of China on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters, shall be\r\nbased on the draft Decision of the Joint Customs Cooperation Committee attached\r\nto this Decision.\nArticle 2\nAfter its\r\nadoption, the Decision of the Joint Customs Cooperation Committee shall be\r\npublished in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision\r\nshall enter into force upon signature.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
