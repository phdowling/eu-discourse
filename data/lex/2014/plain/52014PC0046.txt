The Convention was\r\nsigned by the Union on 1 April 2009 on the basis of the Council Decision\r\n2009/397/EC[1].\nThe Action Plan implementing the Stockholm\r\nProgramme announced the Commission's intention to propose approval of the\r\nConvention in 2012.\nHaving the EU approve the Convention would\r\nreduce legal uncertainty for EU companies trading outside the EU by ensuring\r\nthat choice of court agreements included in their contracts are respected and that\r\njudgments issued by the courts designated in such agreements would be eligible\r\nfor recognition and enforcement in the other Contracting Parties to the\r\nConvention.\nOverall, approval of the Convention by the\r\nEU would complement the realisation of the aims underlying the EU rules on the prorogation\r\nof jurisdiction, by creating a harmonised set of rules within the EU in respect\r\nof third states which will become Contracting Parties to the Convention.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Hague Convention of 30\r\nJune 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements \nThe Convention on Choice of Court Agreements\r\nwas concluded on 30 June 2005 under the auspices of the Hague Conference on\r\nPrivate International Law. It is designed to offer greater legal certainty and\r\npredictability for parties involved in business-to-business agreements and\r\ninternational litigation by creating an optional worldwide judicial dispute\r\nresolution mechanism alternative to the existing arbitration system.\nIn particular, the objective of the Convention is to promote international trade\r\nand investment through enhanced judicial cooperation by introducing uniform\r\nrules on jurisdiction based on exclusive choice of court agreements and on the recognition\r\nand enforcement of judgments given by the chosen courts in its Contracting Parties.\r\n\nThe Convention seeks to achieve a balance\r\nbetween (i) the need to guarantee to the parties that only the courts chosen by\r\nthem will hear the case and that the resulting judgment will be recognised and\r\nenforced abroad, and (ii) the need to allow States to pursue some aspects of\r\ntheir public policy, related in particular to the protection of weaker parties,\r\nprotection against serious unfairness in particular situations and guaranteed\r\nrespect for some grounds of exclusive jurisdiction of States.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How\r\nthe Convention relates to the Brussels I Regulation\nAt EU level, international jurisdiction of the\r\nUnion courts based on choice of court agreements is governed by the Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement\r\nof judgments in civil and commercial matters (the Brussels I Regulation)[2] (to be replaced by\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on\r\njurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and\r\ncommercial matters (Recast)[3]\r\nas of 10 January 2015). The Brussels I Regulation does not however govern the\r\nenforcement in the Union of choice of court agreements in favor of third State\r\ncourts[4].\r\nThis would be achieved once the Convention on Choice of Court Agreements is approved\r\nby the Union.\nThe recent amendments to the Brussels I\r\nRegulation (the Brussels I Regulation (recast)) have strengthened party\r\nautonomy by ensuring that choice of court agreements may not be circumvented by\r\nparties seizing other courts in violation of such agreements. At the same time,\r\nthese amendments ensure that the approach to choice of court agreements for\r\nintra-EU situations is consistent with the one that would apply to extra-EU\r\nsituations under the Convention, once approved by the Union. The Brussels I\r\nRegulation (recast) thus prepares the ground for the EU to proceed with the\r\napproval of the Convention.\nThe relationship between the rules contained\r\nin the Convention and the existing and future EU rules is set out in Article\r\n26(6) of the Convention as follows:\n\u2018This Convention shall not affect the\r\napplication of the rules of a Regional Economic Integration Organisation that\r\nis a Party to this Convention, whether adopted before or after this Convention\na) where none of the parties is resident in a Contracting State that is not a Member State of the Regional Economic Integration Organisation;\nb) as concerns the recognition or enforcement\r\nof judgments as between Member States of the regional Economic Integration\r\nOrganisation.\u2019\nConsequently, the Convention affects the\r\napplication of the Brussels I Regulation if at least one of the parties is\r\nresident in a Contracting State to the Convention. The Convention will prevail\r\nover the jurisdiction rules of the Regulation except if both parties are EU\r\nresidents or come from third states, not Contracting Parties to the Convention.\r\nWith regard to the recognition and enforcement of judgments, the Regulation\r\nwill prevail where the court that made the judgment and the court in which\r\nrecognition and enforcement is sought are both located in the Union. \nThe Convention, once approved by the EU, will\r\ntherefore reduce the scope of application of the the Brussels I Regulation.\r\nNevertheless, this reduction of scope is acceptable in the light of the\r\nincrease in the respect for party autonomy at international level and increased\r\nlegal certainty for EU companies engaged in trade with third State parties. \n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Benefits\r\nfor European business\nA choice of court agreement is a significant\r\nelement in the negotiation of international contracts, as it ensures legal\r\npredictability in the event of a dispute. It is therefore an important element\r\nin the risk assessment for companies when engaging in international trade. The\r\nfigures collected in the course of preparing of the Commission\u2019s proposal on\r\nsignature of the Convention and on the Brussels I Regulation (recast)[5] show the importance of\r\nchoice of court agreements for EU business in their B2B relations. \nThe effectiveness of\r\nchoice of court agreements within the EU is ensured through the Brussels I Regulation. Party autonomy needs to be\r\nensured not only within the EU but also beyond the EU\u02bcs borders. The\r\nConvention will give EU business the necessary legal certainty that their\r\nchoice of court agreements in favour of a court outside the EU are respected in\r\nthe EU, and that agreements in favour of a court in the EU are respected in\r\nthird States. It will also ensure that EU businesses can be confident that a\r\njudgment given by the chosen court in the EU is eligible for recognition and\r\nenforcement in third states, Contracting Parties to the Convention, and vice\r\nversa. \nThe Commission\u02bcs impact assessment on\r\nconclusion of the Convention by the EU (SEC/2008/2389\r\nfinal) concluded that approving the Convention could increase business\u02bcs\r\npropensity to include choice of court agreements in international contracts,\r\nbecause of the greater legal certainty. Overall, it may act as a stimulus to\r\ninternational trade. \nThe benefits to EU business that emerge\r\nfrom approval by the EU of the Convention will increase with the number of\r\nratifications of the Convention in particular by the Union\u02bcs main commercial\r\npartners.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nBefore proposing the Council decision on the\r\nsignature of the Convention, the Commission carried out in 2008 an impact assessment\r\non conclusion of the Convention by the EU[6].\r\nIt found that conclusion of the Convention would be beneficial in terms of\r\npromoting legal certainty and predictability for European businesses in respect\r\nof third States.\nThe impact assessment suggested that, when\r\napproving the Convention, the EU might consider making declarations under\r\nArticle 21 of the Convention excluding from its scope copyright and related\r\nrights (where validity of these rights is linked to the Member States) and\r\ninsurance contracts (where the policyholder is domiciled in the EU and the risk\r\nor insured event, item or property is related exclusively to the EU). Given the\r\nimpact on both industries and the fact that the views of the stakeholders have\r\nin the past been divided, the Commission further considered the need to make\r\nsuch declarations. Notably, its decision to propose the approval of the\r\nConvention with a declaration on the scope of the Convention was preceded by\r\nconsultations with the Member States in the Council Working Party on Civil Law\r\nMatters (General Questions) on 28 May 2013 (for further information see point\r\n3.2 below).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union competence with\r\nrespect to the Convention \nThe Convention makes it possible for a\r\nRegional Economic Integration Organisation, depending on the scope of the competencies\r\nover the subject matter of the Convention, to conclude the Convention together\r\nwith its Member States or alone, with the consequence of binding its Member\r\nStates (Articles 29-30). The relevant declaration can be made at the time of\r\nsigning, acceptance, approval or accession to the Convention.\nWhen the EU signed the Convention, it declared\r\nin accordance with Article 30 of the Convention that it exercises competence\r\nover all the matters governed by the Convention and that its Member States will\r\nnot be Contracting Parties to the Convention, but will be bound by it by virtue\r\nof its conclusion by the EU. Therefore, there is no need for the EU to make a further\r\ndeclaration under Article 30 when it approves the Convention.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Declarations under the\r\nConvention affecting its substantive scope\nIn the interests of flexibility and of maintaining\r\nits potentially broad appeal, the Convention makes it possible for the\r\nContracting Parties to extend or reduce its substantive scope by making the\r\nrelevant declarations (Articles 19-22). Declarations may be made upon signature\r\nor approval or at any time thereafter, and may be modified or withdrawn at any\r\ntime. When signing the Convention, the Union made no declarations under these\r\nArticles. As mentioned above, the Commission carried out further\r\nconsultations with the Member States in May-June 2013 on the need for such declarations.\r\nThe results of the consultations are presented below.\n3.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Declarations\r\nunder Articles 19, 20 and 22\nArticle 19 permits a State to make a declaration\r\nby virtue of which its courts may refuse to determine disputes to which an\r\nexclusive choice of court agreement applies in cases which show no other\r\nconnection with their State except for the choice of court. Article 20 permits a\r\nState to make a declaration that its courts may refuse to\r\nrecognise or enforce a judgment given by a court of another Contracting State\r\nif the parties were resident in the requested State, and the relationship of\r\nthe parties and all other elements relevant to the dispute, other than the\r\nlocation of the chosen court, were connected only with the requested State. Articles\r\n19 and 20 thus permit to exclude from the scope of the Convention certain\r\nsituations which, other than the choice of court, show no other international\r\nelement.\nArticle 22 offers the possibility for a State\r\nto extend the scope of the Convention to cover non-exclusive choice of court\r\nagreements as far as the recognition and enforcement of judgments is concerned.\r\nBecause of the reciprocity principle, the obligation to recognize and enforce judgments\r\nbased on non-exclusive choice of court agreements extends only to judgments\r\ngiven by courts of other Contracting Parties that have themselves made Article\r\n22 declarations. \nWith respect to Articles 19 and 20, it should be\r\npointed out that Union law recognises choice of court agreements in situations\r\nwhere the choice of court is the only connection to the State of the chosen\r\ncourt. Union law does not require an additional connection to the chosen State\r\nbesides the choice of court. There therefore seems no reason to exclude such\r\nsituations from the scope of the Convention. This was confirmed in the\r\nconsultations carried out by the Commission among Member States regarding\r\npossible declarations under Articles 19-20. The Commission therefore does not\r\npropose making declarations under these Articles.\nWith respect to Article 22, if the scope of\r\nthe Convention were extended, the recognition and enforcement of judgments\r\ngiven on the basis of non-exclusive choice of court agreements would lead to\r\nthe result that the courts of EU Member States in general could not take\r\njurisdiction in situations where they would be seized by one of the parties after\r\na judgment based on a non-exclusive choice of court agreement had already been given\r\nby the court of another Contracting Party which had made a declaration under\r\nArticle 22. The Commission does not propose making the declaration under\r\nArticle 22 when the Convention is approved. Given that the Article is based on reciprocity\r\nprinciple, the potential declaration could be possibly considered at a later\r\nstage once the interests of other Contracting Parties to the Convention in\r\nextending its scope under Article 22 have become evident. The views of the\r\nMember States which replied to the Commission\u02bcs consultation support in\r\nprinciple the Commission\u02bcs proposal to proceed without declaration at the\r\nmoment.\n3.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Declarations\r\nunder Article 21\n3.2.2.1.\u00a0 The\r\ndeclarations in general\nArticle 2 of the Convention already provides\r\nfor a number of exclusions from its scope. In addition, Article 21 allows the\r\nContracting Party to extend the list of excluded matters by making a\r\ndeclaration specifying the matter that it intends to exclude. Consequently, the\r\nConvention would not apply with regard to that matter in the State making the\r\ndeclaration, and, because of reciprocity, other States would not apply the\r\nConvention to the matter in question where the chosen court is in the State which\r\nhad made the declaration. Furthermore, the following conditions must be met for\r\nthe declaration: there has to be a strong interest on the part of the declaring\r\nstate in not applying the Convention to a specific matter; the declaration may\r\nnot be broader than necessary and the specific matter excluded must be clearly\r\nand precisely defined[7].\r\n\nThe Commission\u2019s impact assessment of 2008 suggested\r\nto give consideration to the Union making a declaration under Article 21 of the\r\nConvention and thereby exclude from its scope matters relating to insurance\r\ncontracts - where the policyholder is domiciled in the EU and the risk or\r\ninsured event, item or property is related exclusively to the EU \u2013 and to\r\ncopyright and related rights where the validity of these rights is linked to a\r\nMember State. The aim of such declarations would be to\r\nprotect the weaker party to an insurance contract (similar to the protection available\r\nunder the Brussels I Regulation) and to a copyright contract from having to\r\nlitigate in the chosen court which may have been imposed on them by a\r\nco-contractor in a stronger position, and, arguably, to ensure the application\r\nof certain standards on copyright and related rights established under EU law.\nAs mentioned earlier, the Commission has\r\ncarried out further consultations with the Member States on the need for any\r\ndeclarations under Article 21, taking into account the policy with respect to\r\nchoice of court agreements in Union law and bearing in mind that due to the\r\nreciprocity principle, the exclusion of a specific matter from the scope would mean\r\nthat choice of court clauses in favor of Union courts which might benefit EU\r\nparties would not be enforced in third States Contracting Parties to the\r\nConvention. Taking into account the results of the consultation, the Commission\r\nproposes to limit the declaration under Article 21 to those matters where Union\r\nlaw equally limits party autonomy. This is the case, for matters falling with\r\nthe scope of the Convention, only with respect to certain type of insurance\r\ncontracts concluded for purposes which can be regarded as being within the\r\ntrade or profession engaged in by the parties. Such a limited exclusion will\r\nensure a coherent approach to choice of court within and outside the Union. \n3.2.2.2.\u00a0 The\r\nproposed declaration on insurance contracts\nThe Brussels I\r\nRegulation (Section 3) provides for special protective jurisdiction in matters\r\nof insurance aimed at protecting the weaker party (the policyholder, the\r\ninsured party or a beneficiary) and the economic interests of the general\r\npublic of the place where the weaker party is located. The insured party, as\r\nplaintiff, therefore has a choice of suing the insurer at several places,\r\nincluding the place where the insured party is domiciled; the insurer, as\r\nplaintiff, can sue the insured party in principle only where the latter is\r\ndomiciled. These protective jurisdiction rules are based on the premise that\r\nthe insured party is always the weaker party, even if he acts as a commercial\r\noperator in B2B relations. There is no change to this presumption in the\r\nBrussels I Regulation (recast). For this reason, the possibility of the parties\r\nconcluding the choice of court agreement has been limited (Article 13 of the\r\nRegulation). The protective jurisdiction rules in Section 3, in cases against\r\nthe insurer, apply only if the latter is domiciled or deemed to be domiciled (via\r\nbranch, agency or establishment) in the EU. There is no change to this\r\nprotective policy in the Brussels I Regulation (recast). \nThe Convention on its part applies to\r\ninsurance matters without limiting party autonomy to conclude choice of court agreements.\r\nThe only substantive limitation results from Article 2(1)(a) of the Convention\r\nwhich excludes insurance contracts entered into by private persons as\r\nconsumers. This is partially contrary to the regime established in the Brussels\r\nI Regulation insofar as, for instance, the Convention would apply to insurance\r\ncontracts concluded by SMEs. Once the Convention is approved by the EU, certain\r\ninsurance contracts which now fall under the Brussels I Regulation, e.g.\r\ncontracts between an EU policyholder and the EU branch of an insurer with headquarters\r\noutside the EU (Article 9(2) of the Regulation) would fall within the scope of\r\nthe Convention (Article 26(6), in conjunction with Article 4(2) of the\r\nConvention). Therefore, if the Convention were to be concluded without\r\nexcluding insurance contracts, there would be a lack of parallelism with the protective\r\npolicy established in the Brussels I Regulation which allows the insured party to\r\nsue an EU insurer (or a EU branch of third State insurer) in his own place of\r\ndomicile irrespective of any other jurisdiction available under a choice of\r\ncourt agreement. The downside of the complete exclusion of insurance contracts,\r\nfrom the point of view of European insurers, is that choice of court clauses they\r\nhave negotiated with non-European policyholders would not be recognised and\r\nenforced in third States which are Contracting Parties to the Convention. From\r\nthe perspective of the European policyholders, these would lose the advantage\r\nof having the decisions of EU courts\u02bc (chosen by the parties) recognised\r\nand enforced outside the Union under the Convention. However, the advantages of\r\nhaving at external level the same regime protecting the interests of EU weaker\r\nparties as under EU internal legislation, out-weight these disadvantages. \nThe views of the Member States\r\nwhich replied to the Commission\u2019s consultation on this matter were mixed with an\r\nalmost equal numbers for and against excluding insurance contracts from the\r\nscope of the Convention. The Commission therefore proposes, following the\r\nimpact assessment and in order to ensure consistency with EU internal\r\nprotective legislation, to exclude certain type of insurance matters from the\r\nscope of the Convention without further conditions. Article 21 of the\r\nConvention requires any declaration to be formulated by subject matter only. As\r\na result, any declaration under Article 21 could not be formulated in such a\r\nway that it would benefit unilaterally EU parties.\nArticles 13 and 14 of the Brussels I Regulation\r\ndo not limit party autonomy in insurance contracts in all cases. There are a\r\nnumber of exceptions in which parties are allowed to designate the court\r\ncompetent to hear their disputes. The proposed declaration is formulated in a\r\nway so as to allow as much as possible those choice of court agreements which\r\nare recognised in Union law to be equally recognised at the international level\r\nthrough the Choice of Court Convention. Nevertheless, in light of the\r\nformulation of the exceptions under Union law, which are designed to protect EU\r\npolicy holders only, and the requirement of the Convention that the declaration\r\nshould refer to subject matter only, it does not seem possible to ensure\r\ncomplete coherence between the Convention on the one hand and Union law on the\r\nother hand. In particular, Article 13(4) of the Brussels I Regulation\r\nrecognises and enforces choice of court agreements concluded with policy\r\nholders domiciled outside the EU, unless the insurance is compulsory or relates\r\nto immoveable property in a Member State. As it is not possible, under the\r\nConvention, to distinguish between policy holders domiciled in and outside the Union, the Commission proposes not to mirror the exception of Article 13(4) in the\r\ndeclaration. This would have the effect that insurance contracts concluded by\r\npolicyholders domiciled outside the Union would not be governed by the\r\nConvention and would remain governed by internal Union law. As a result,\r\nEuropean companies concluding agreements with non-EU policyholders would be\r\nensured to see their choice of court agreement upheld by Union courts on the\r\nbasis of Article 13(4); European policyholders concluding agreements with\r\nnon-EU insurance providers would still have access to the EU courts on the\r\nbasis of Section 3 of Chapter II of the Brussels I Regulation.\nOverall, the proposed declaration aims to ensure\r\nthat: \n\u00b7                        \r\nthe carve-out is as small as is needed to achieve\r\nthe goal of protecting the interests of weaker parties in insurance contracts as\r\nreflected in the protective jurisdiction rules of the Brussels I Regulation.\r\nThe courts of the EU Member States will be allowed (on the basis of EU or\r\nnational law, when applicable) to hear the insurance dispute despite a choice\r\nof court agreement in favour of the courts of a third State which is a Contracting\r\nParty to the Convention; \n\u00b7                        \r\nit is consistent with the Convention. The\r\ndeclaration is based solely on the subject matter and is neutral; \n\u00b7                        \r\nthere is a parallelism with the Brussels I\r\nRegulation which, in its Articles 13 and 14, defines the situations when choice\r\nof court agreements are allowed in insurance contracts;\n\u00b7                        \r\nboth the excluded subject matter \u2013 insurance\r\ncontracts \u2013 and the situations when the carve-out does not apply are clearly\r\nand precisely defined. \n2014/0021 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the approval, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, of the Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 81(2), in conjunction\r\nwith point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 218(6) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[8],\r\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union is\r\nworking towards the establishment of a common judicial area based on the\r\nprinciple of mutual recognition of judicial decisions. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Convention on Choice\r\nof Court Agreements concluded on 30 June 2005 under the auspices of the Hague\r\nConference on Private International Law (hereinafter referred to as the\r\nConvention) makes a valuable contribution to promoting party autonomy in\r\ninternational commercial transactions and increasing the predictability of\r\njudicial solutions in such transactions. In particular, the Convention ensures\r\nthe necessary legal certainty for the parties that their choice of court\r\nagreement is respected and that a judgment given by the chosen court is\r\neligible for recognition and enforcement in cross-border situations. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 29 of the\r\nConvention allows Regional Economic Organisations such us the European Union to\r\nsign, accept, approve or accede to the Convention. The Union signed the\r\nConvention on 1 April 2009, subject to the conclusion of the Convention at a\r\nlater date, in accordance with Council Decision 2009/397/EC[9].\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Convention affects Union\r\nsecondary legislation on jurisdiction based on choice by the parties and the\r\nrecognition and enforcement of the resulting judgments, in particular Council\r\nRegulation (EC) 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition\r\nand enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters[10]. Regulation\r\n(EC) No 44/2001 is to be replaced as of 10 January 2015 by\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition\r\nand enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters[11].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whereas Regulation (EU) No\r\n1215/2012 prepared the ratification of the Convention by ensuring coherence\r\nbetween the Union rules on choice of court in civil and commercial matters and\r\nthose of the Convention. It would therefore be appropriate for the Convention\r\nto enter into force in the Union on the same date of the entry into application\r\nof Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When signing the\r\nConvention, the Union declared under Article 30 of the Convention that it\r\nexercises competence over all the matters governed by the Convention.

The purpose of the declaration is to preserve\r\nthe protective jurisdictional rules available to the policyholder, the insured party\r\nor a beneficiary in insurance contracts under Section 3 of Regulation (EC) 44/2001.

This Convention shall\r\napply in international cases to exclusive choice of court agreements concluded\r\nin civil or commercial matters. \n2. For the purposes of\r\nChapter II, a case is international unless the parties are resident in the same\r\n  Contracting State and the relationship of the parties and all other elements\r\nrelevant to the dispute, regardless of the location of the chosen court, are\r\nconnected only with that State. \n3. For the purposes of\r\nChapter III, a case is international where recognition or enforcement of a\r\nforeign judgment is sought. \nArticle 2 \nExclusions from scope \n1. This Convention shall\r\nnot apply to exclusive choice of court agreements: \n(a) to which a natural\r\nperson acting primarily for personal, family or household purposes (a consumer)\r\nis a party; \n(b) relating to contracts\r\nof employment, including collective agreements. \n2. This Convention shall\r\nnot apply to the following matters: \n(a) the status and legal\r\ncapacity of natural persons; \n(b) maintenance\r\nobligations; \n(c) other family law\r\nmatters, including matrimonial property regimes and other rights or obligations\r\narising out of marriage or similar relationships; \n(d) wills and succession; \n(e) insolvency,\r\ncomposition and analogous matters; \n(f) the carriage of\r\npassengers and goods; \n(g) marine pollution,\r\nlimitation of liability for maritime claims, general average, and emergency\r\ntowage and salvage; \n(h) anti-trust\r\n(competition) matters; \n(i) liability for nuclear\r\ndamage; \n(j) claims for personal\r\ninjury brought by or on behalf of natural persons; \n(k) tort or delict claims\r\nfor damage to tangible property that do not arise from a contractual\r\nrelationship; \n(l) rights in rem in\r\nimmovable property, and tenancies of immovable property; \n(m) the validity, nullity,\r\nor dissolution of legal persons, and the validity of decisions of their organs;\r\n\n(n) the validity of\r\nintellectual property rights other than copyright and related rights; \n(o) infringement of\r\nintellectual property rights other than copyright and related rights, except\r\nwhere infringement proceedings are brought for breach of a contract between the\r\nparties relating to such rights, or could have been brought for breach of that\r\ncontract; \n(p) the validity of\r\nentries in public registers. \n3. Notwithstanding\r\nparagraph 2, proceedings are not excluded from the scope of this Convention\r\nwhere a matter excluded under that paragraph arises merely as a preliminary\r\nquestion and not as an object of the proceedings. In particular, the mere fact\r\nthat a matter excluded under paragraph 2 arises by way of defence does not\r\nexclude proceedings from the Convention, if that matter is not an object of the\r\nproceedings. \n4. This Convention shall\r\nnot apply to arbitration and related proceedings. \n5. Proceedings are not\r\nexcluded from the scope of this Convention by the mere fact that a State,\r\nincluding a government, a governmental agency or any person acting for a State,\r\nis a party thereto. \n6. Nothing in this\r\nConvention shall affect privileges and immunities of States or of international\r\norganisations, in respect of themselves and of their property. \nArticle 3 \nExclusive choice of\r\ncourt agreements \nFor the purposes of this\r\nConvention: \n(a) \u2018exclusive choice of\r\ncourt agreement\u2019 means an agreement concluded by two or more parties that meets\r\nthe requirements of paragraph (c) and designates, for the purpose of deciding\r\ndisputes which have arisen or may arise in connection with a particular legal\r\nrelationship, the courts of one Contracting State or one or more specific\r\ncourts of one Contracting State to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of any\r\nother courts; \n(b) a choice of court\r\nagreement which designates the courts of one Contracting State or one or more\r\nspecific courts of one Contracting State shall be deemed to be exclusive unless\r\nthe parties have expressly provided otherwise; \n(c) an exclusive choice of\r\ncourt agreement must be concluded or documented: \n(i) in writing; or \n(ii) by any other means of\r\ncommunication which renders information accessible so as to be usable for\r\nsubsequent reference; \n(d) an exclusive choice of\r\ncourt agreement that forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement\r\nindependent of the other terms of the contract. The validity of the exclusive\r\nchoice of court agreement cannot be contested solely on the ground that the\r\ncontract is not valid. \nArticle 4 \nOther definitions \n1. In this Convention,\r\n\u2018judgment\u2019 means any decision on the merits given by a court, whatever it may\r\nbe called, including a decree or order, and a determination of costs or\r\nexpenses by the court (including an officer of the court), provided that the\r\ndetermination relates to a decision on the merits which may be recognised or\r\nenforced under this Convention. An interim measure of protection is not a\r\njudgment. \n2. For the purposes of\r\nthis Convention, an entity or person other than a natural person shall be\r\nconsidered to be resident in the State: \n(a) where it has its\r\nstatutory seat; \n(b) under whose law it was\r\nincorporated or formed; \n(c) where it has its\r\ncentral administration; or \n(d) where it has its\r\nprincipal place of business. \nCHAPTER II \nJURISDICTION \nArticle 5 \nJurisdiction of the\r\nchosen court \n1. The court or courts of\r\na Contracting State designated in an exclusive choice of court agreement shall\r\nhave jurisdiction to decide a dispute to which the agreement applies, unless\r\nthe agreement is null and void under the law of that State. \n2. A court that has\r\njurisdiction under paragraph 1 shall not decline to exercise jurisdiction on\r\nthe ground that the dispute should be decided in a court of another State. \n3. The preceding\r\nparagraphs shall not affect rules: \n(a) on jurisdiction\r\nrelated to subject matter or to the value of the claim; \n(b) on the internal\r\nallocation of jurisdiction among the courts of a Contracting State. However, where the chosen court has discretion as to whether to transfer a case, due\r\nconsideration should be given to the choice of the parties. \nArticle 6 \nObligations of a court\r\nnot chosen \nA court of a Contracting   State other than that of the chosen court shall suspend or dismiss\r\nproceedings to which an exclusive choice of court agreement applies unless: \n(a) the agreement is null\r\nand void under the law of the State of the chosen court; \n(b) a party lacked the\r\ncapacity to conclude the agreement under the law of the State of the court\r\nseised; \n(c) giving effect to the\r\nagreement would lead to a manifest injustice or would be manifestly contrary to\r\nthe public policy of the State of the court seised; \n(d) for exceptional\r\nreasons beyond the control of the parties, the agreement cannot reasonably be\r\nperformed; or \n(e) the chosen court has\r\ndecided not to hear the case. \nArticle 7 \nInterim measures of\r\nprotection \nInterim measures of\r\nprotection are not governed by this Convention. This Convention neither\r\nrequires nor precludes the grant, refusal or termination of interim measures of\r\nprotection by a court of a Contracting State and does not affect whether or not\r\na party may request or a court should grant, refuse or terminate such measures.\r\n\nCHAPTER III \nRECOGNITION AND\r\nENFORCEMENT \nArticle 8 \nRecognition and\r\nenforcement \n1. A judgment given by a\r\ncourt of a Contracting State designated in an exclusive choice of court\r\nagreement shall be recognised and enforced in other Contracting States in accordance\r\nwith this Chapter. Recognition or enforcement may be refused only on the\r\ngrounds specified in this Convention. \n2. Without prejudice to\r\nsuch review as is necessary for the application of the provisions of this\r\nChapter, there shall be no review of the merits of the judgment given by the\r\ncourt of origin. The court addressed shall be bound by the findings of fact on\r\nwhich the court of origin based its jurisdiction, unless the judgment was given\r\nby default. \n3. A judgment shall be\r\nrecognised only if it has effect in the State of origin, and shall be enforced\r\nonly if it is enforceable in the State of origin. \n4. Recognition or\r\nenforcement may be postponed or refused if the judgment is the subject of\r\nreview in the State of origin or if the time limit for seeking ordinary review\r\nhas not expired. A refusal does not prevent a subsequent application for\r\nrecognition or enforcement of the judgment. \n5. This Article shall also\r\napply to a judgment given by a court of a Contracting State pursuant to a\r\ntransfer of the case from the chosen court in that Contracting State as permitted by Article 5(3). However, where the chosen court had discretion as to\r\nwhether to transfer the case to another court, recognition or enforcement of\r\nthe judgment may be refused against a party who objected to the transfer in a\r\ntimely manner in the State of origin. \nArticle 9 \nRefusal of recognition\r\nor enforcement \nRecognition or enforcement\r\nmay be refused if: \n(a) the agreement was null\r\nand void under the law of the State of the chosen court, unless the chosen\r\ncourt has determined that the agreement is valid; \n(b) a party lacked the\r\ncapacity to conclude the agreement under the law of the requested State; \n(c) the document which\r\ninstituted the proceedings or an equivalent document, including the essential\r\nelements of the claim: \n(i) was not notified to\r\nthe defendant in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange\r\nfor his defence, unless the defendant entered an appearance and presented his\r\ncase without contesting notification in the court of origin, provided that the\r\nlaw of the State of origin permitted notification to be contested; or \n(ii) was notified to the\r\ndefendant in the requested State in a manner that is incompatible with\r\nfundamental principles of the requested State concerning service of documents; \n(d) the judgment was\r\nobtained by fraud in connection with a matter of procedure; \n(e) recognition or\r\nenforcement would be manifestly incompatible with the public policy of the\r\nrequested State, including situations where the specific proceedings leading to\r\nthe judgment were incompatible with fundamental principles of procedural\r\nfairness of that State; \n(f) the judgment is\r\ninconsistent with a judgment given in the requested State in a dispute between\r\nthe same parties; or \n(g) the judgment is\r\ninconsistent with an earlier judgment given in another State between the same\r\nparties on the same cause of action, provided that the earlier judgment fulfils\r\nthe conditions necessary for its recognition in the requested State. \nArticle 10 \nPreliminary questions \n1. Where a matter excluded\r\nunder Article 2(2), or under Article 21, arose as a preliminary question, the\r\nruling on that question shall not be recognised or enforced under this\r\nConvention. \n2. Recognition or\r\nenforcement of a judgment may be refused if, and to the extent that, the\r\njudgment was based on a ruling on a matter excluded under Article 2(2). \n3. However, in the case of\r\na ruling on the validity of an intellectual property right other than copyright\r\nor a related right, recognition or enforcement of a judgment may be refused or\r\npostponed under the preceding paragraph only where: \n(a) that ruling is\r\ninconsistent with a judgment or a decision of a competent authority on that\r\nmatter given in the State under the law of which the intellectual property\r\nright arose; or \n(b) proceedings concerning\r\nthe validity of the intellectual property right are pending in that State. \n4. Recognition or\r\nenforcement of a judgment may be refused if, and to the extent that, the\r\njudgment was based on a ruling on a matter excluded pursuant to a declaration\r\nmade by the requested State under Article 21. \nArticle 11 \nDamages \n1. Recognition or\r\nenforcement of a judgment may be refused if, and to the extent that, the\r\njudgment awards damages, including exemplary or punitive damages, that do not\r\ncompensate a party for actual loss or harm suffered. \n2. The court addressed\r\nshall take into account whether and to what extent the damages awarded by the\r\ncourt of origin serve to cover costs and expenses relating to the proceedings. \nArticle 12 \nJudicial settlements (transactions\r\njudiciaires) \nJudicial settlements (transactions\r\njudiciaires) which a court of a Contracting State designated in an\r\nexclusive choice of court agreement has approved, or which have been concluded\r\nbefore that court in the course of proceedings, and which are enforceable in\r\nthe same manner as a judgment in the State of origin, shall be enforced under\r\nthis Convention in the same manner as a judgment. \nArticle 13 \nDocuments to be\r\nproduced \n1. The party seeking\r\nrecognition or applying for enforcement shall produce: \n(a) a complete and\r\ncertified copy of the judgment; \n(b) the exclusive choice\r\nof court agreement, a certified copy thereof, or other evidence of its\r\nexistence; \n(c) if the judgment was\r\ngiven by default, the original or a certified copy of a document establishing\r\nthat the document which instituted the proceedings or an equivalent document\r\nwas notified to the defaulting party; \n(d) any documents\r\nnecessary to establish that the judgment has effect or, where applicable, is\r\nenforceable in the State of origin; \n(e) in the case referred\r\nto in Article 12, a certificate of a court of the State of origin that the\r\njudicial settlement or a part of it is enforceable in the same manner as a\r\njudgment in the State of origin. \n2. If the terms of the\r\njudgment do not permit the court addressed to verify whether the conditions of\r\nthis Chapter have been complied with, that court may require any necessary\r\ndocuments. \n3. An application for\r\nrecognition or enforcement may be accompanied by a document, issued by a court\r\n(including an officer of the court) of the State of origin, in the form\r\nrecommended and published by the Hague Conference on Private International Law.\r\n\n4. If the documents\r\nreferred to in this Article are not in an official language of the requested\r\nState, they shall be accompanied by a certified translation into an official\r\nlanguage, unless the law of the requested State provides otherwise. \nArticle 14 \nProcedure \nThe procedure for\r\nrecognition, declaration of enforceability or registration for enforcement, and\r\nthe enforcement of the judgment, are governed by the law of the requested State\r\nunless this Convention provides otherwise. The court addressed shall act\r\nexpeditiously. \nArticle 15 \nSeverability \nRecognition or enforcement\r\nof a severable part of a judgment shall be granted where recognition or\r\nenforcement of that part is applied for, or only part of the judgment is\r\ncapable of being recognised or enforced under this Convention. \nCHAPTER IV \nGENERAL CLAUSES \nArticle 16 \nTransitional provisions\r\n\n1. This Convention shall\r\napply to exclusive choice of court agreements concluded after its entry into\r\nforce for the State of the chosen court. \n2. This Convention shall\r\nnot apply to proceedings instituted before its entry into force for the State\r\nof the court seised. \nArticle 17 \nContracts of insurance\r\nand reinsurance \n1. Proceedings under a\r\ncontract of insurance or reinsurance are not excluded from the scope of this\r\nConvention on the ground that the contract of insurance or reinsurance relates\r\nto a matter to which this Convention does not apply. \n2. Recognition and\r\nenforcement of a judgment in respect of liability under the terms of a contract\r\nof insurance or reinsurance may not be limited or refused on the ground that\r\nthe liability under that contract includes liability to indemnify the insured\r\nor reinsured in respect of: \n(a) a matter to which this\r\nConvention does not apply; or \n(b) an award of damages to\r\nwhich Article 11 might apply. \nArticle 18 \nNo legalisation \nAll documents forwarded or\r\ndelivered under this Convention shall be exempt from legalisation or any\r\nanalogous formality, including an Apostille. \nArticle 19 \nDeclarations limiting\r\njurisdiction \nA State may declare that\r\nits courts may refuse to determine disputes to which an exclusive choice of\r\ncourt agreement applies if, except for the location of the chosen court, there\r\nis no connection between that State and the parties or the dispute. \nArticle 20 \nDeclarations limiting\r\nrecognition and enforcement \nA State may declare that\r\nits courts may refuse to recognise or enforce a judgment given by a court of\r\nanother Contracting State if the parties were resident in the requested State,\r\nand the relationship of the parties and all other elements relevant to the\r\ndispute, other than the location of the chosen court, were connected only with\r\nthe requested State. \nArticle 21 \nDeclarations with\r\nrespect to specific matters \n1. Where a State has a\r\nstrong interest in not applying this Convention to a specific matter, that\r\nState may declare that it will not apply the Convention to that matter. The\r\nState making such a declaration shall ensure that the declaration is no broader\r\nthan necessary and that the specific matter excluded is clearly and precisely\r\ndefined. \n2.
