Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the\r\nCommission decided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more\r\nthan ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that\r\ndepartments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for\r\nwhich they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and\r\nreadily understandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law\r\napplicable to a given matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament,\r\nthe Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for\r\nthe fast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 594/2008 of 16 June 2008 on certain procedures for\r\napplying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities\r\nand their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the\r\nother part, and for applying the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related\r\nmatters between the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, of the other part[3]. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in\r\nit[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the\r\ncodification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was drawn up on the\r\nbasis of a preliminary consolidation, in 22 official languages, of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 594/2008 and the instrument amending it, carried out by the Publications\r\nOffice of the European Union, by means of a data-processing system.\r\nWhere the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old\r\nand the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex II to the\r\ncodified Regulation.\n\u00ea Corrigendum,\r\nOJ L 233, 30.8.2008, p. 1 (adapted)\n2014/0206 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non certain procedures for applying the\r\nStabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and\r\ntheir Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other\r\npart, and for applying the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters\r\nbetween the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of\r\nthe other part (codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00ea\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 594/2008[6]\r\nhas been substantially amended[7]. In the interests of\r\nclarity and rationality, that Regulation should be codified.\n\u00ea Corrigendum, OJ\r\nL 233, 30.8.2008, p. 1 (adapted)\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\r\nStabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and\r\ntheir Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other\r\npart (\u2018SAA\u2019), was signed in Luxembourg on 16 June 2008.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\n16 June 2008 the Council concluded an Interim\r\nAgreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of\r\nthe one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part[8] (\u2018Interim Agreement\u2019) which \u00d6 provided \u00d5 for the early\r\nentry into force of the trade and trade-related provisions of the SAA. The\r\nInterim Agreement \u00d6 entered \u00d5 into force on \u00d6 1 July\r\n2008 \u00d5 .\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis necessary to lay down the procedures for applying certain provisions of the\r\nInterim Agreement. Since the trade and trade-related provisions of \u00d6 those \u00d5 instruments are to a very large extent identical, this Regulation\r\nshould also apply to the implementation of the SAA after its entry into force.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nSAA and the Interim Agreement stipulate that fishery products originating in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina may be imported into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 at a reduced\r\ncustoms duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to\r\nlay down provisions regulating the management of \u00d6 those \u00d5 tariff quotas.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where\r\ntrade defence measures become necessary, they should be adopted in accordance\r\nwith the general provisions laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No  260/2009[9],\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No  1061/2009[10], Council Regulation (EC) No  1225/2009[11] or, as the case may be, Council Regulation (EC) No  597/2009[12].\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where\r\na Member State provides the Commission with information on a possible fraud or\r\nfailure to provide administrative cooperation, the relevant \u00d6 Union \u00d5 legislation\r\nshall apply, in particular Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97[13].\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe purposes of implementing the relevant provisions of this Regulation the\r\nCommission should be assisted by the Customs Code Committee established by Article 285 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[14].\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .17 (adapted)\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the Interim\r\nAgreement and of the \u00d6 SAA \u00d5 requires\r\nuniform conditions for the adoption of safeguard and other measures. Those\r\nmeasures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[15].\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly\r\njustified cases relating to exceptional and critical circumstances arising\r\nwithin the meaning of Article 24(5)(b) and Article 25(4) of the Interim Agreement, and thereafter Article 39(5)(b) and Article 40(4) of the \u00d6 SAA \u00d5, imperative\r\ngrounds of urgency so require,\n\u00ea Corrigendum,\r\nOJ L 233, 30.8.2008, p. 1 (adapted)\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down certain\r\nprocedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain\r\nprovisions of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European\r\nCommunities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, of the other part (\u2018SAA\u2019), and of the Interim Agreement on trade\r\nand trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part (\u2018Interim Agreement\u2019).\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .17(1)\nArticle 2\nConcessions for fish and fishery\r\nproducts\nDetailed rules on the implementation of\r\nArticle 13 of the Interim\r\nAgreement, and thereafter Article 28 of the SAA, concerning the tariff quotas for fish and fishery\r\nproducts, shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the examination\r\nprocedure referred to in Article 9(3) of this Regulation.\n\u00ea Corrigendum, OJ\r\nL 233, 30.8.2008, p. 1 (adapted)\nArticle 3\nTariff reductions\n1.
