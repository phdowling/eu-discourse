In accordance with Article 395(2)\r\nof the VAT Directive, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter\r\ndated 7 August 2014 of the request made by Latvia. By letter dated 11 August\r\n2014, the Commission notified Latvia that it had all the information necessary\r\nto consider the request.\nGeneral context\nChapter 1 of Title XII of the VAT Directive\r\nallows for the possibility for Member States to apply special schemes for small\r\nenterprises, including the possibility of exempting taxable persons below a\r\ncertain annual turnover. This exemption implies that a taxable person does not\r\nhave to charge VAT on his supplies and, consequently, he cannot deduct VAT on\r\nhis inputs.\nLatvia was first\r\ngranted the same exemption by Council Implementing Decision 2010/584/EU[1] which had expired on 31\r\nDecember 2013. The measure derogated from Title XII of the VAT Directive only\r\nin so far as the taxable person\u2019s annual turnover threshold for the special\r\nscheme was higher than that currently allowed for Latvia under Article 287(10)\r\nof the VAT Directive, which is EUR 17 200.\nBased on this experience, Latvia has now requested to be authorised again to apply the measure, which would anyhow be\r\noptional for taxable persons.\nFrom information provided by Latvia, it appears that the impact of the measure on tax revenue collected at the final\r\nconsumption stage is negligible. \nIt is therefore proposed to provide the\r\nderogation for a limited period until 31 December 2017. \nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nSimilar derogations have been granted to\r\nother Member States.\nConsistency with the other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union.\nThe measure is in line with the Union's\r\nobjectives for small businesses, as laid out in Commission Communication\r\n\"Think small first\" \u2013 a \"Small Business Act\" for\r\nEurope\" (COM(2008) 394 of 25 June 2008).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nNot relevant.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThe decision aims at providing a\r\nsimplification measure which removes many of the VAT obligations for businesses\r\noperating below an annual turnover.\nBecause of the narrow scope of the\r\nderogation, and its limited application in time, the scope will in any case be\r\nlimited.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nAuthorisation for Latvia to apply a\r\nderogating measure from the VAT Directive as regards the application of a\r\nsimplification measure for businesses with an annual turnover no higher than\r\nEUR 50 000.\nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive.\nSubsidiarity principle\nConsidering the provision of the VAT\r\nDirective on which the proposal is based, the proposal falls under the\r\nexclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does\r\nnot apply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality\r\nprinciple for the following reasons:\nThis Decision concerns an authorisation\r\ngranted to a Member State upon its own request and does not constitute any\r\nobligation.\nGiven the limited scope of the derogation,\r\nthe special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: Council Implementing\r\nDecision.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reasons:\nUnder Article 395 of the VAT Directive,\r\nderogation from the common VAT rules is only possible on the authority of the\r\nCouncil acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission. A Council\r\nImplementing Decision is the only suitable instrument since it can be addressed\r\nto an individual Member State.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nbudget of the Union because Latvia will carry out a compensation calculation in\r\naccordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC, EURATOM) No 1553/89. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nThe proposal is limited in time.\n2014/0290 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nauthorising the Republic of Latvia to apply a measure derogating from Article 287 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common\r\nsystem of value added tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive\r\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax ([2]) (the VAT Directive),\r\nand in particular Article 395(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a letter registered by\r\nthe Commission on 1 July 2014, the Republic of Latvia requested authorisation\r\nfor a measure derogating from Article 287(10) of the VAT Directive in order to\r\nexempt certain taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 50\r\n000. Through that measure, those taxable persons would be exempt from certain\r\nor all of the obligations in relation to value added tax (VAT) referred to in\r\nChapters 2 to 6 of Title XI of the VAT Directive. Such measure had already been\r\ngranted to the Republic of Latvia by Council Implementing Decision 2010/584/EU[3] which expired on 31\r\nDecember 2013.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission informed\r\nthe other Member States by letter dated 7 August 2014 of the request made by Latvia. By letter dated 11 August 2014, the Commission notified Latvia that it had all the\r\ninformation necessary to consider the request.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A special scheme for small\r\nenterprises is already available to Member States under Title XII of the VAT\r\nDirective. The measure derogates from Title XII of the VAT Directive only in so\r\nfar as the taxable person\u2019s annual turnover threshold for the special scheme is\r\nhigher than that allowed for Latvia under Article 287(10) of the VAT Directive,\r\nwhich is EUR 17 200.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A higher threshold for the\r\nspecial scheme is a simplification measure as it may significantly reduce the\r\nVAT obligations of the smallest businesses, whilst that special scheme is\r\noptional for taxable persons and allows businesses to opt for the normal VAT\r\narrangements.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From information provided\r\nby Latvia, the derogation will only have a negligible impact on the overall\r\namount of tax revenue collected at the final stage of consumption.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogation has no\r\nimpact on the Union's own resources accruing from value added tax,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nBy way of derogation from Article 287(10) of\r\nDirective 2006/112/EC, the Republic of Latvia is authorised to exempt from VAT\r\ntaxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 50 000. \nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall apply until 31 December\r\n2017.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of   Latvia.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 256, 30.9.2010, p. 29.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 256, 30.9.2010, p. 29.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
