The individual size of the\r\nlargest Union banks by assets is roughly similar or close to the GDP of its\r\nhome country. These banks still remain too-big-to-fail, too-big-to-save and\r\ntoo-complex-to-resolve.\nIn this context, Commissioner Barnier\r\nannounced in November 2011 the setting up of a High-Level Expert Group\r\n(\"HLEG\") with a mandate to assess the need for structural reform of\r\nthe Union banking sector, chaired by Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of\r\nFinland.[1]\r\nThe report was presented in October 2012 stating that bank restructuring is\r\nnecessary to complement existing reforms and recommending the mandatory\r\nseparation of proprietary trading and other high-risk trading activities into a\r\nseparate legal entity within the banking group. The separation would be\r\nmandatory only for banks where the activities to be separated amounted to a\r\nsignificant share of the banks business.[2]\r\nOn 3 July 2013, by large majority the European Parliament (\"EP\") adopted\r\nan own initiative report called \"Reforming the structure of the EU banking\r\nsector\"[3]\r\nthat welcomes structural reform measures at Union level to tackle concerns on\r\n\u201cToo-Big-To-Fail\u201d (\"TBTF\") banks[4].\nThis proposal represents a critical part of\r\nthe Union response to tackling the TBTF dilemma. It aims at preventing the\r\nresidual unmanaged risks in the Union banking system from materialising. It\r\nwill curtail the artificial expansion of banks' balance sheets, particularly\r\nthose activities of a purely speculative nature, thereby reducing the risk that\r\ntax payers have to step in to save failing banks, and reducing the cost and\r\ncomplexity of any resolution when required. It is also an important complement\r\nto the Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of\r\ncredit institutions and investment firms (\"BRRD\").[5]\nStructural reform has so far not been part\r\nof the international reform agenda agreed by the G20. However, a number of\r\njurisdictions around the world have enacted or proposed measures to address the\r\nabove concerns. In the last years a number of Member States have engaged in\r\nreform initiatives (Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Belgium). The\r\nUnited States has recently adopted the so-called \"Volcker rule\"\r\nprohibiting proprietary trading by banks. Furthermore, international\r\norganisations have called for a global debate on bank structures and business\r\nmodels. In view of the proliferation of reform initiatives in this context, and\r\nwith a view to prevent overlapping or incompatible measures affecting\r\ninternationally active banks, the G20 leaders at the last summit in Saint\r\nPetersburg called on the Financial Stability Board to assess cross-border\r\nconsistencies and global financial stability implications of structural banking\r\nreforms. This proposal takes careful note of emerging international coordination\r\nefforts and recognises the need to prevent opportunities for regulatory\r\narbitrages.\nThis proposal is accompanied by a directly\r\nrelated proposal to tackle another conduit for financial contagion \u2013 namely,\r\ninterconnectedness among market participants including systemic banks through\r\nopaque trading links in securities financing transactions. The Green Paper on\r\nshadow banking presented by the Commission on 19 March 2012[6] recognises that any\r\nreinforced banking regulation could drive a substantial part of banking\r\nactivities beyond the boundaries of traditional banking and towards \u201cshadow\r\nbanking\u201d defined as \"the system of credit intermediation that involves\r\nentities and activities outside the regular banking system\"[7]. On 20 November 2012,\r\nthe EP adopted a resolution on shadow banking[8]\r\nwhere it underlined the need to ensure greater transparency in the structure\r\nand activities of financial institutions as well as the need for supervisors to\r\nhave knowledge of the level of shadow banking activities like repurchase\r\nagreements and securities lending. On 4 September 2013, the Commission\r\nhighlighted in its communication on shadow banking[9] that strengthening\r\ntransparency of securities financing transactions, such as repurchase\r\nagreements and securities lending, other equivalent transactions and\r\nre-hypothecation will be essential to monitor the risks associated with\r\ninterconnectedness, excessive leverage and pro-cyclical behaviours.\nThe remainder of this explanatory\r\nmemorandum is confined to a presentation of the present proposal relating to\r\nstructural separation of credit institutions.\n\r\n2.                      \r\nRESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED\r\nPARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\r\n\nStakeholders have been consulted on a\r\nnumber of occasions. The HLEG met with a variety of stakeholders during its\r\nmandate and held a public consultation targeting banks, corporate customers and\r\nretail clients and their associations.[10]\r\nThe Commission also held a public stakeholder consultation in October 2012.[11] Structural bank reform\r\nand the need for a coordinated action at Union level have also been subject to\r\ndiscussions with Member States.\nIn the course of preparing the Impact\r\nAssessment (\"IA\"), the Commission held an additional public\r\nstakeholder consultation in the spring of 2013 inviting banks to model the\r\nimpact of different types of structural reform options.[12] The 500 consultation\r\nresponses highlighted the divisions among banks, on the one hand, and consumers\r\nand non-bank financials on the other hand. The former were to an overwhelming\r\nextent against structural separation; the latter were largely in favour. The\r\nviews of other categories were more balanced.\nAn Inter-service Steering Group (\"ISG\")\r\non bank structural reform was established in March 2013 with representatives\r\nfrom the Directorate Generals COMP, ECFIN, EMPL, ENTR, JUST, MARKT, SG, SJ,\r\nTAXUD and the JRC. This ISG met in March, April and September 2013 and\r\nsupported the work on the IA.\nThe draft IA was submitted to the Impact\r\nAssessment Board (the \u201cIAB\u201d) of the Commission on 19 September 2013 and\r\ndiscussed with the IAB on 16 October 2013. The IAB provided its recommendations\r\nfor improvement on 18 October 2013. The main recommendations were: (i) to\r\nimprove the problem description and baseline scenario; (ii) to better describe\r\nand explain the reform options; (iii) to better assess impacts and better\r\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the retained reform options; (iv) to better\r\npresent stakeholder views; and (v) to add a glossary. The Commission services\r\nresubmitted a revised IA on 18 December 2013, alongside with a separate\r\ndocument explaining to the IAB how the IAB recommendations had been\r\nincorporated. The IAB subsequently issued a positive opinion on 15 January\r\n2014, whilst providing recommendations for further improvements, asking in\r\nparticular to strengthen the analysis of the justification of the proposed\r\nmeasures, alternative reform options, impact, and stakeholder views with\r\nrespect to the transparency measures that had only been introduced in the\r\nresubmission of the final IA. The IAB also recommended further strengthening\r\nthe structural reform options presentation and the assessment of the impact and\r\neffectiveness of the retained reform options. The final version of the IA has\r\nsignificantly expanded the analysis of the transparency reform measures and has\r\nfurther elaborated on the other two IAB recommendations.\nOn the overall costs and benefits of this\r\nproposal, the impact assessment carried out in the context of this proposal has\r\nbeen subject to qualitative analysis and quantitative modelling. The impact\r\nassessment concluded that implicit subsidies are significant, while they depend\r\non the size of the bank and the level of interconnectedness of the bank. While\r\ntaking due account of the clear benefits derived from the diversity of banking\r\nmodels in Europe, this proposal intends to ensure that the delicate balance\r\nbetween the prevention of systemic risks and the financing of sustainable\r\neconomic growth is maintained.\n\r\n3.                      \r\nLEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\r\n3.1.                \r\nLegal basis and subsidiarity\r\n\nThe\r\nlegal basis for this Regulation is Article 114(1) of the Treaty of the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (the \"TFEU\"), which allows the\r\nadoption of measures for the approximation of national provisions aiming at the\r\nestablishment and good functioning of the internal market.\nUniform\r\nrules on banks\u2019 structures will enhance financial stability within the Union,\r\nbetter integrate financial markets, facilitate the orderly resolution and\r\nrecovery of the group, enhance the cross-border provision of services and the establishment\r\nin other Member States, reduce distortions of competition and prevent\r\nregulatory arbitrage.\nSome\r\nMember States have proposed or adopted structural reform measures for their\r\nnational banking systems. Inconsistent national legislation that does not\r\npursue the same policy goals, in a manner that is compatible and equivalent\r\nwith the mechanisms envisaged in this Regulation, increases chances that\r\ncapital movements and investment decisions are distorted. Without a Union-wide\r\napproach banks will be forced to adapt their structure and operation along\r\nnational boundaries, thereby making them even more complex and increasing\r\nfragmentation.\nInconsistent\r\nnational legislation would also undermine efforts to achieve a single rulebook\r\napplicable throughout the internal market and the creation of an effective banking\r\nunion, as it would have the effect of limiting the effectiveness of the Single\r\nSupervisory Mechanism (\"SSM\")[13] and a future Single Resolution\r\nMechanism (\"SRM\").[14]\r\nInconsistent legislation also makes the management of cross-border institutions\r\nmore difficult and costly.\nHarmonisation at Union level\r\nenvisaged in this Regulation can ensure that Union banking groups, many of\r\nwhich operate in several Member States, are regulated by a common framework of\r\nstructural requirements thereby ensuring a level playing field, reducing\r\nregulatory complexity, avoiding unwarranted compliance costs for cross-border\r\nactivities, promoting further integration in the Union market place and\r\ncontributing to the elimination of regulatory arbitrage opportunities.\nConsistent with the goals of\r\ncontributing to the functioning of the internal market, a Member State that has\r\npreviously adopted legislation prohibiting credit institutions taking deposits\r\nfrom individuals and SMEs from engaging in the activity of dealing in\r\ninvestments as a principal and hold trading assets may make a request to the\r\nCommission to grant a derogation from the provisions laid down in Chapter III\r\n(\u201cseparation of certain trading activities\u201d) for a credit institution that is\r\nsubject to the national law compatible with provisions of that Chapter. This\r\nwould allow Member States that are found to have already implemented\r\n\u201csuper-equivalent\u201d measures to avoid costly alignment of existing, effective provisions\r\nwith these provisions. To ensure that the impact of the national legislation\r\ndoes not jeopardize the aim or functioning of the internal market, the goals of\r\nthe national legislation must be the same as those set out in this proposal;\r\nand the national legal, supervisory and enforcement arrangements must ensure\r\nthat the credit institution comply with legally binding requirements that are\r\ncompatible with this proposal.\nThis proposal takes due account of\r\nthe rapidly evolving financial markets and financial innovation as well the\r\nevolution of the Union regulatory and supervisory frameworks. In order to\r\nensure the effective and consistent supervision and the development of the\r\nsingle rule book in banking, this proposal envisages an important role for the\r\nEuropean Banking Authority (\"EBA\"). The EBA will be consulted by\r\ncompetent authorities when taking certain decisions as set out in this proposal\r\nand will prepare draft regulatory and implementing technical standards, and\r\nsubmit reports to the Commission. This is particular important in the situations\r\ndescribed in Articles 9, 10, 13 and 21.\n\r\n3.2.                \r\nProportionality\r\n\nUnder the principle of proportionality set\r\nout in Article 5 of the TEU, the content and form of Union action must not\r\nexceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties.\nThe proposed Regulation prohibits large Union\r\ncredit institutions and banking groups from carrying out proprietary trading\r\nand certain related activities.\nOwnership separation has the potential to\r\nbe the most effective structural reform tool in terms of achieving the specific\r\nobjectives of facilitating resolution and limiting moral hazard, conflicts of\r\ninterest and capital and resource misallocation. The potential benefits of prohibiting\r\nproprietary trading activities would be particularly strong in terms of\r\nmitigation of risks, complexity, interconnectedness and conflicts of interest.\r\nHowever in view of the challenges derived from the difficult distinction\r\nbetween proprietary trading and other similar trading activities, market making\r\nin particular, a narrow definition of activities subject to the prohibition\r\nunderpins the proportionality of this measure. Excluding smaller banks from the\r\nscope of the prohibition is justified because of the disproportionate effects\r\nsuch a prohibition could entail for those banks if forced to divest parts of\r\ntheir portfolios.\nThe proposed Regulation also requires the\r\ncompetent authority to undertake a systematic review of certain other\r\nactivities \u2013 namely, market-making, investment in/sponsoring of securitization\r\nand trading of certain derivatives. These have been identified as the\r\nactivities where there is the greatest risk that proprietary trading could be\r\nperformed in contravention of the prohibition, and which could give rise to\r\nrisks for the stability of the core credit institution and the Union financial\r\nsystem. The competent authority is granted the power to require the separation.\r\nThis power to require separation is not imposed as a blanket measure: instead,\r\nthe competent authority is allowed to exercise judgment, using a set of harmonised\r\nmetrics. Only under certain circumstances, when risks exceed levels to be\r\ndefined using harmonised metrics, is the competent authority required to\r\nenforce separation. This approach is considered to be proportionate because\r\nseparation is imposed only under certain conditions, and following an in-depth\r\nreview of the impact of those activities on the risk profile and behaviour of\r\nthe core credit institution.\nThe proposed Regulation targets large\r\ncredit institutions and banking groups. Given that the main purpose of the\r\nproposal is to deal with residual systemic risks in the Union financial system,\r\nextending the measures of the proposal to all credit institutions would be\r\ndisproportionate and could lead to non-justified costs, in particular for\r\nsmaller credit institutions.\nCredit institutions falling below the\r\nthresholds of the proposed Regulation are not subject to the structural\r\nmeasures foreseen. This implies that Member States or the competent authorities\r\nmay decide to impose similar measures also on smaller credit institutions.\nThe proposed Regulation respects the\r\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of\r\nFundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the right to the protection\r\nof personal data, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to property, the\r\nright to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and has to be implemented in\r\naccordance with those rights and principles.\n\r\n3.3.                \r\nDetailed explanation of the proposal \r\n\nThis section briefly outlines the main\r\ncomponents of this regulation.\n\r\n3.3.1.          \r\nObjectives and subject matter of structural\r\nseparation\r\n\nThe proposed Regulation aims at enhancing\r\nfinancial stability in the Union by means of structural reform of large banks,\r\nthus complementing financial regulatory reforms already undertaken at Union level.\r\nArticle 1 outlines the aim and the objectives underpinning the reform.\nArticle 2 outlines the subject matter,\r\nwhich is to lay down rules on structural changes on TBTF banks by imposing a\r\nproprietary trading prohibition and potential separation of certain trading\r\nactivities.\n\r\n3.3.2.          \r\nScope\r\n\nArticle 3 states that the proposed Regulation\r\napplies to banks that meet certain criteria and exceed certain thresholds:\n(1)                   \r\nThe requirements apply to the European banks\r\nthat are identified as being of global systemic importance.\n(2)                   \r\nThe requirements apply to banks that exceed the\r\nfollowing thresholds for three consecutive years: (a) the bank's total assets\r\nexceed \u20ac30 billion;[15]\r\nand (b) the bank's total trading assets and liabilities exceed \u20ac70 billion or\r\n10 percent of their total assets.\nArticles 22 and 23 provide further detail\r\non how \"trading activities\" (for the purposes of competent authority review\r\nleading to possible separation from the credit institution) should be\r\ncalculated. Given that the focus of bank structural reform is on banking\r\nactivities, Article 23(2) states that for financial conglomerates, the\r\nactivities of insurance and non-financial undertakings must not be included in\r\nthe calculation.\nThe proposed Regulation will apply to Union\r\ncredit institutions and their EU parents, their subsidiaries and branches,\r\nincluding in third countries. It will also apply to branches and subsidiaries\r\nin the Union of banks established in third countries. Such a broad territorial\r\nscope is justified to ensure a level playing field and avoid the transfer of\r\nactivities outside the Union to circumvent these requirements. However, foreign\r\nsubsidiaries of Union banks and EU branches of foreign banks could be exempted\r\nif they are subject to equivalent separation rules (Articles 4 and 27). Article\r\n4(2) foresees another potential exemption: supervisors have been granted the power\r\nto exempt from separation foreign subsidiaries of groups with autonomous\r\ngeographic decentralised structure pursuing a \"Multiple Point of Entry\"\r\nresolution strategy.\nBy applying the separation requirement throughout\r\nthe global corporate group irrespective of geographic location, the potential\r\nfor banks circumventing separation by locating particular activities outside\r\nthe Union is eliminated. Furthermore, by supplementing the broad territorial\r\ncoverage with a third country equivalence regime the possible extraterritorial\r\nconcerns of third country jurisdictions are mitigated. By requiring foreign\r\nbanks to separate their operations in the Union, a level playing field in the\r\ninternal market is also ensured and thereby the risk of unfair competition is\r\nminimised.\n\r\n3.3.3.          \r\nProhibition of proprietary trading (Chapter II)\r\n\nArticle 6(1) of the proposed Regulation\r\nprovides that a credit institution and entities within the same group must not\r\nengage in proprietary trading in financial instruments and commodities. While\r\nconsistent data at Union level with regard to specific banking activity is\r\nscarce, available evidence suggests that proprietary trading represents a\r\nlimited part of banks\u2019 balance sheets.[16]\r\nHowever, the same evidence also highlights that such trading was significant\r\nprior to the crisis and, in the absence of regulatory intervention, there is no\r\nguarantee that it may not increase again in the future.\nIt is difficult to define proprietary\r\ntrading and distinguish it from market-making. According to Article 5(4), which\r\ndefines proprietary trading narrowly, desks\u2019, units\u2019, divisions\u2019 or individual\r\ntraders\u2019 activities specifically dedicated to taking positions for making a\r\nprofit for own account, without any connection to client activity or hedging\r\nthe entity\u2019s risk, would be prohibited.\nArticle 6(2) clarifies that where credit\r\ninstitutions falling within the scope of the proposed Regulation as defined in\r\nArticles 3 and 4, operate dedicated structures for buying and selling money\r\nmarket instruments for the purposes of cash management, they are not captured\r\nby this prohibition. Trading in Union government bonds is also exempted from\r\nthe prohibition (Article 6(2)(a)) to prevent possible negative consequences in\r\nthese crucial markets. This exemption mirrors the one provided for trading in\r\ngovernment bonds in relation to the assessment of activities (Article 8(2)).\nWhile in principle a proprietary trading prohibition\r\ncould extend to all banks, it is proposed to apply the ban only to banks\r\nreferred to in Article 3. To prevent banks from circumventing the prohibition\r\nby e.g. owning or investing in hedge funds, Article 6(1)(b) states that banks\r\nsubject to the proprietary trading prohibition are also prohibited from\r\ninvesting in or holding shares in hedge funds (or certificates/derivatives\r\nlinked to these), or entities that engage in proprietary trading or sponsor\r\nhedge funds. Unleveraged and closed-ended funds\u2013 mainly private equity, venture\r\ncapital and social entrepreneurship funds \u2013 are exempted from this prohibition,\r\ngiven their role in supporting the financing of the real economy (Article\r\n6(3)). Credit institutions covered by these prohibitions will be able to\r\ncontinue providing banking/custody services to hedge funds.\n\r\n3.3.4.          \r\nPotential separation of certain trading\r\nactivities (Chapter III)\r\n\nBanks engage in a number of other trading\r\nand investment banking activities, including market making, lending to venture\r\ncapital and private equity funds, investment and sponsorship of risky\r\nsecuritisation, sales and trading of derivatives etc. Banking groups will be\r\nallowed to continue engaging in those other activities subject to the\r\ndiscretion of the competent authority who will be obliged to review trading\r\nactivities and will have the power (as well as an obligation under certain\r\ncircumstances) to separate a subset of activities (market making, risky\r\nsecuritisation, complex derivatives) if certain metrics are exceeded. This aims\r\nat avoiding the risk that banks would circumvent the ban in Article 6 by\r\nengaging in hidden proprietary trading activities and that the non-prohibited\r\ntrading activities become too significant or highly leveraged. The basic\r\nprinciple of the proposed Regulation is that \"deposit taking entities\"\r\nwithin banking groups can only engage in these activities as long as the competent\r\nauthority does not decide that they need to be performed within a distinct \"trading\r\nentity.\"\n\r\n3.3.4.1.    \r\nScope of activities subject to separation\r\n\nArticle 8 defines trading activities\r\nbroadly by stating that it means activities other than e.g. taking deposits\r\neligible for deposit insurance, lending, retail payment services and a number\r\nof other activities. Article 8(2) furthermore exempts Union sovereign bonds\r\nfrom the obligation to review and power to separate. Such an exemption is\r\nconsistent with the current practice of zero risk weights in the Capital\r\nRequirement Regulation and Directive[17]\r\n(the \"CRR\"/\"CRDIV\"). Nevertheless, Article 8(3) states that\r\nthe Commission may by delegated acts extend the scope of the exemption to non-Union\r\nsovereign bonds if they conform to certain conditions.\n\r\n3.3.4.2.    \r\nDuty to review activities\r\n\nThe proposed Regulation will oblige competent\r\nauthority to review trading activities of banks exceeding the thresholds,\r\nincluding in particular three activities that are either especially close to\r\nproprietary trading, and hence susceptible to feature hidden proprietary\r\ntrading (market making), or have played a key role during the financial crisis\r\n(e.g. investing and sponsoring activities in risky securitisation and trading\r\nin derivatives other than those that are specifically allowed for the purpose\r\nof prudent risk management). Competent authorities will assess these activities\r\nin light of certain metrics to be adjusted using supervisory data. The metrics\r\nindicate relative size, leverage, complexity, profitability, associated market\r\nrisk, as well as interconnectedness (Article 9(2)). To ensure that these\r\nmetrics are consistently measured and applied, Article 9(4) entrusts the EBA\r\nwith developing a binding implementing technical standard to be adopted by the\r\nCommission.\n\r\n3.3.4.3.    \r\nPower to separate\r\n\nArticle 10(1) states that the competent\r\nauthorities must require separation if the trading activities of banks (market making,\r\ninvesting in and sponsoring risky securitisation and trading in certain\r\nderivatives) and the related risks are found to exceed certain thresholds and\r\nmeet certain conditions linked to the metrics. If the bank demonstrates to the\r\nsatisfaction of the competent authority that these activities do not endanger the\r\nUnion financial stability, taking into account the objectives of the proposed\r\nRegulation, the competent authority may decide not to require separation.\nArticle 10(2) states that a competent\r\nauthority can require separation of a particular trading activity if it\r\nconsiders that the activity in question threatens the financial stability of\r\nthe bank or of the Union, taking into account any of the objectives of the\r\nproposed Regulation.\nThe competent authority should consult the\r\nEBA prior to taking decisions referred to in Article 10 and should notify the\r\nEBA of its final decision.\nArticle 10(5) empowers the Commission to\r\nadopt a delegated act specifying the level not to be exceeded for each metrics\r\nas well as the conditions, including the number of metrics that need to be\r\nexceeded, for the separation to apply. In addition, the Commission will be\r\nempowered to specify which type of securitisation is not considered to pose a\r\nthreat to financial stability according to a list of criteria and could\r\ntherefore be carried out by a core credit institution.\n\r\n3.3.4.4.    \r\nManagement of banks\u2019 own risks (\"treasury\r\nmanagement\")\r\n\nIf further separation materialises, Article\r\n11(1) clarifies that the deposit-taking bank is still allowed to manage its own\r\nrisk. Nevertheless, as treasury management may give rise to proprietary trading\r\nand given that liquidity management involves taking certain speculative\r\npositions, this should be associated with certain safeguards.\n\r\n3.3.4.5.    \r\nProvision of risk management services to clients\r\n\nArticle 12 clarifies that the core credit\r\ninstitution is still able to sell certain risk management products (i.e.,\r\nderivatives) to non-financial, non-banking clients. However, the sale of\r\nderivatives to clients exposes the bank to more risks, which may notably make its\r\nresolution more complex and therefore it will be subject to different degrees\r\nof safeguards and control. To address these risks, it is stated that interest\r\nrate, foreign exchange, credit, emission allowance and commodity derivatives\r\neligible for central counterparty clearing can be sold by the core credit\r\ninstitution to its non-financial clients, insurance undertakings and\r\ninstitutions for occupational retirement provision, but only to hedge interest\r\nrate, foreign exchange and credit risk, commodity risk and emission allowance\r\nrisk and subject to caps on the resulting position risk. Recognising certain\r\nderivatives further encourages banks to standardise those derivatives and is\r\nthus in line with the policy objectives of the European Market Infrastructure\r\nRegulation (\"EMIR\").[18]\n\r\n3.3.4.6.    \r\nRules on separation of trading activities\r\n\nIf competent authorities require the\r\nseparation of trading activities above and these activities will remain within\r\nthe banking group, then these would have to be transferred to a distinct legal\r\nentity (a \"trading entity\"). The legal, economic, governance and\r\noperational links of that entity with the rest of the group would have to be\r\ncurtailed to ensure effective separation. Article 13(3) states that if\r\nseparation occurs, the group must be organised into homogeneous functional\r\nsubgroups constituted on the one side by core credit institutions and on the\r\nother trading entities. Article 13(5) to (13) and of the proposed Regulation\r\nstate the conditions that will apply to ensure a strong separation in legal,\r\neconomic, governance and operational terms. After separation, the prudential\r\nrequirements outlined in those Articles should apply on an individual or\r\nsub-consolidated basis to the respective sub-groups.\nFurthermore, Article 13(11) provides for\r\nderogations to the CRR as regards waiving certain requirements to ensure that\r\nprudential requirements (own funds, liquidity and disclosure) apply on a\r\nsub-consolidated basis to the respective subgroups. Groups that qualify as\r\nmutuals, cooperatives, savings institutions or the like do engage in risky\r\ntrading activities and therefore are subject to the requirements in this\r\nproposal. However, these institutions have a very specific ownership and\r\neconomic structure and play an important role in financing the local and\r\nregional economy. Imposing some of the rules related to separation could\r\nrequire far-reaching changes to the structural organisation of such entities.\r\nThis could be disproportionate to the benefits if it would require these\r\nentities to completely change their corporate identity. Thus, the competent\r\nauthority may decide to allow core credit institutions that meet the\r\nrequirements set out in Article 49(3)(a) or (b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013\r\nto hold capital instruments or voting rights in a trading entity where the\r\ncompetent authority considers that holding such capital instruments or voting\r\nrights is indispensable for the functioning of the group and that has taken sufficient\r\nmeasures in order to appropriately mitigate the relevant risks.\nAnother fundamental part of the economic\r\nseparation between the core credit institution and the trading entity are the\r\nlarge exposure restrictions. Articles 14 to 17 accordingly lay down rules to\r\nthat effect. These rules refer to limits on both intra and extra-group, individual and aggregate large exposures.\n\r\n3.3.4.7.    \r\nSeparation plan\r\n\nThe actual separation of trading activities\r\nwill be preceded by an obligation for relevant banks to submit a\r\n\"separation plan\" to competent authorities. Article 18 provides that\r\nthis plan should be approved by the competent authority, with the latter having\r\nthe possibility to require changes to the plan as appropriate, or setting out\r\nits own plan for separation in case of inaction by the relevant bank.\n\r\n3.3.4.8.    \r\nCooperation between competent authorities and\r\nresolution authorities\r\n\nThe BRRD foresees that resolution\r\nauthorities may, as part of their resolution planning, require banks to make\r\nstructural changes (e.g. to their legal and organisational structure) if the\r\nresolution authority believes that it is necessary to address impediments to\r\neffective resolution. While the proposed regulation addresses a broader range\r\nof objectives going beyond resolution, it is necessary to ensure that the\r\nrespective authorities liaise with each other. Article 19 accordingly states that\r\nif a competent authority decides to require separation, it must notify\r\nresolution authorities (Article 19(1)) and take into account any ongoing or\r\npre-existing resolvability assessment by resolution authorities as per Articles\r\n13 and 13a of the BRRD. Likewise, the resolution authority must take into\r\naccount the notification of a separation decision by a competent authority when\r\nassessing the resolvability of an institution.\n\r\n3.3.4.9.    \r\nProhibited activities for the trading entity\r\n\nArticle 20 provides that there are certain\r\nactivities that the trading entity may not carry out. Those are taking deposits\r\neligible for protection under deposit guarantee schemes and provide retail\r\npayment services as defined in the Payment Services Directive[19].\n\r\n3.3.4.10. \u00a0Derogation\r\n\nWhereas the proposed Regulation sets out\r\nuniform rules on the aim, objectives and instruments of structural reform of\r\nbanks in the internal market, Article 21 allows for a possible derogation from\r\nthe separation requirements in Chapter III for credit institutions being\r\ncovered by national legislation having an equivalent effect as the provisions\r\nof Chapter III of the proposal. This derogation will be granted by the\r\nCommission upon request of the Member State in question after the Member State\r\nhas obtained a positive opinion from the competent authority responsible for\r\nthe supervision of the banks for which the derogation is requested. To qualify\r\nfor the derogation, the national primary legislation must have been adopted\r\nbefore 29 January 2014 and fulfil the criteria laid down in Article 21(1). This\r\nmeans that the aim of the national law, its material scope and provisions\r\nreferring to the legal, economic and governance separation of the deposit\r\ntaking entity must be similar to those in the proposed Regulation.\n\r\n3.3.5.          \r\nCompliance: entities and competent authorities\r\n(Chapter V)\r\n\nMost banks covered by Article 3 are\r\noperating in several countries both by means of branches and subsidiaries. They\r\nare supervised by several different authorities, both home (parent,\r\nsubsidiaries in different Member States) and host (branches). In order to\r\nensure an effective and efficient group level application of structural reform,\r\nArticle 26 gives the final say over structural separation decisions to the lead\r\nsupervisor with responsibility over the consolidated group. This is the\r\napproach chosen by some national reform proposals. The lead supervisor should,\r\nprior to making any decisions, consult the home supervisor of significant group\r\nsubsidiaries.\n\r\n3.3.6.          \r\nRelationships with third countries (Chapter VI)\r\n\nArticle 27 provides for\r\nthe adoption of delegated acts to recognise third country structural reforms as\r\nbeing equivalent when they meet certain conditions.\n\r\n3.3.7.          \r\nAdministrative sanctions and measures (Chapter\r\nVII)\r\n\n\u00a0Chapter VII reflects\r\ncurrent horizontal policies in the financial services sector concerning\r\nsanctions and measures. It defines a common approach to the main breaches of the\r\nproposed Regulation and lays down the administrative sanctions and measures\r\nthat the competent authorities should be empowered to apply in case of the main\r\nbreaches. \n\r\n3.3.8.          \r\nReport and Review (Chapter VIII)\r\n\nThe adoption of this proposal would\r\nconstitute the first set of structural separation rules applying to banks at Union\r\nlevel. It is therefore important to assess whether the rules described above\r\nhave proved to be an effective and efficient way of achieving the aim and the objectives\r\nof structural reform. To that end the final Chapter outlines a number of areas\r\nwhere the Commission will review the framework in both general and specific\r\nterms (Article 34). For example, reviews will focus on the application of\r\nthresholds, the application and the effectiveness of the prohibition foreseen\r\nin Article 6, the scope of activities subject to the review, and the\r\nsuitability and application of the metrics.\n\r\n3.3.9.          \r\nTimeline \r\n\nThe following indicates the principal dates\r\nrelating to the adoption and implementation of the key provisions of this\r\nproposal, on the basis that the final text of the Regulation is adopted by the EP\r\nand Council by June 2015:\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe Commission adopts the required delegated\r\nacts for implementation of key provisions by 1 January 2016;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe list of covered and derogated \u00a0banks is\r\npublished 1 July 2016 and on a yearly basis thereafter;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe prohibition on proprietary trading becomes\r\neffective on 1 January 2017;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe provisions on separation of trading activities\r\nfrom credit institutions will become effective on July 1, 2018.\n\r\n4.                      \r\nBudgetary implications:\r\n\nThe financial and budgetary impact of the\r\nproposal is indicated in the legislative financial statement attached.\n2014/0020 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non structural measures improving the\r\nresilience of EU credit institutions\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[20],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Central Bank[21],\nAfter consulting the European Data\r\nProtection Supervisor[22],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)              \r\nThe Union\u2019s financial system includes over 8,000\r\nbanks of different sizes, corporate structures and business models, a few of\r\nwhich exist in the form of large banking groups carrying out an\r\nall-encompassing set of activities. Those groups comprise a complex web of\r\nlegal entities and intra-group relationships. They are highly connected to each\r\nother through interbank borrowing and lending and through derivatives markets.\r\nThe impact of possible failures of these large banks can be extremely widespread\r\nand significant.\n(2)              \r\nThe financial crisis has demonstrated the\r\ninterconnected nature of Union banks and the resulting risk to the financial\r\nsystem. As a result, resolution has to date been challenging, involved entire\r\nbanking groups, as opposed to only\r\nthe non-viable parts, and has\r\nrelied significantly on public support.\n(3)              \r\nSince the start of the financial crisis, the\r\nUnion and its Member States have engaged in a fundamental overhaul of bank\r\nregulation and supervision including the setup of the first steps towards a banking\r\nunion. Given the depth of the financial crisis and the need to ensure that all\r\nbanks can be resolved, there was a need to assess whether more measures are\r\nneeded to further reduce the probability and impact of failure of the largest\r\nand most complex banks. A High-Level Expert Group (\"HLEG\") chaired by\r\nErkki Liikanen was mandated for this purpose. The HLEG recommended the\r\nmandatory separation of proprietary trading and other high-risk trading\r\nactivities into a separate legal entity within the banking group for the largest\r\nand most complex banks.\n(4)              \r\nThe on-going banking regulatory reform agenda\r\nwill significantly increase the resilience of both individual banks and the\r\nbanking sector as a whole. However, a limited subset of the largest and most\r\ncomplex Union banking groups still remain too-big-to-fail, too-big-to-save and\r\ntoo-complex to manage, supervise and resolve. Structural reform is therefore an\r\nimportant complement to other regulatory initiatives and measures, as it would\r\noffer one way of more directly addressing intra-group complexity, intra-group\r\nsubsidies, and excessive risk-taking incentives. A number of Member States have\r\nadopted or are considering adopting measures to introduce structural reform in\r\ntheir respective banking systems.\n(5)              \r\nOn 3 July 2013, the European Parliament called\r\non the Commission to provide for a principles-based approach to structural\r\nreform of the European banking sector.\n(6)              \r\nThe legal basis for this Regulation is Article\r\n114(1) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which\r\nallows the adoption of measures for the approximation of national provisions\r\naiming at the establishment and good functioning of the internal market.\n(7)              \r\nInconsistent national legislation that does not\r\npursue the same policy goals in a manner that is compatible and equivalent with\r\nthe mechanisms envisaged in this Regulation increases chances that capital\r\nmovements decisions of market participants are negatively affected because\r\ndifferent and inconsistent rules and practices may significantly raise\r\noperational costs for credit institutions that are operating across borders and\r\nhence lead to a less efficient allocation of resources and capital compared to\r\na situation where capital movement is subject to similar and consistent rules.\r\nFor the same reasons, different and inconsistent rules will also negatively\r\naffect decisions of market participants relating to where and how to provide\r\ncross-border financial services. Different and inconsistent rules may also\r\nunintentionally encourage geographic arbitrage. The movement of capital and the\r\nprovision of cross-border services are essential elements for the proper\r\nfunctioning of the Union internal market. Without a\r\nUnion-wide approach credit institutions will be forced to adapt their structure\r\nand operations along national boundaries, thereby making them even more complex\r\nand leading to increased fragmentation of the internal market.\n(8)              \r\nInconsistent national legislation also undermines\r\nefforts to achieve a single rulebook applicable throughout the internal market. Such a development would also have\r\nthe effect of limiting the effectiveness of the Single Supervisory Mechanism[23] (SSM) because the\r\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) would have to apply a set of different and\r\ninconsistent legislation to credit institutions that are under its supervision\r\nwhich will increase supervisory costs and complexity. Inconsistent legislation\r\nalso makes the management of cross-border credit institutions more difficult\r\nand costly, notably in terms of ensuring compliance with divergent and possibly\r\ninconsistent rules. Similarly, the Single Resolution Mechanism[24] (SRM) would have to\r\nresolve credit institutions subject to potentially different national\r\nrequirements regarding their organisational and operational structure.\n(9)              \r\nHarmonisation at Union level can ensure that\r\nUnion banking groups, many of which operate in several Member States, are\r\nregulated by a common framework of structural requirements thereby avoiding\r\ncompetitive distortions, reducing regulatory complexity, avoiding unwarranted\r\ncompliance costs for cross-border activities, promoting further integration in\r\nthe Union market place and contributing to the elimination of regulatory\r\narbitrage opportunities.\n(10)          \r\nConsistent with the goals of contributing to the\r\nfunctioning of the internal market, it should be possible to grant a derogation\r\nfor a credit institution from the provisions on separation of certain trading\r\nactivities where a Member State has adopted national primary legislation prior\r\nto 29 January 2014 (including secondary legislation subsequently adopted) prohibiting\r\ncredit institutions, which take deposits from individuals and Small and Medium\r\nsized Enterprises (SMEs) from dealing in investments as a principal and holding\r\ntrading assets. The Member State should therefore be entitled to make a request\r\nto the Commission to grant a derogation from the provisions on separation of\r\ncertain trading activities for a credit institution that is subject to the\r\nnational legislation compatible with those provisions. This would allow Member\r\nStates that already have primary legislation in place, the effects of which are\r\nequivalent to and consistent with this Regulation, to avoid alignment of\r\nexisting, effective provisions. To ensure that the impact of that national\r\nlegislation, as well as of subsequent implementing measures, does not jeopardise\r\nthe aim or functioning of the internal market, the aim of that national\r\nlegislation and related supervisory and enforcement\r\narrangements must be able to ensure that credit institutions that take eligible\r\ndeposits from individuals and from SMEs comply with legally binding requirements that are equivalent and\r\ncompatible with the provisions provided in this Regulation. The competent authority supervising the credit institution subject\r\nto the national legislation in question should be responsible for providing an\r\nopinion that should accompany the request for the derogation.\n(11)          \r\nAccording to Article 4 (1)(i) of the Council\r\nregulation (EU) No 1024/2013[25]\r\nthe ECB is empowered to carry out supervisory tasks in relation to structural\r\nchanges required from credit institutions to prevent financial stress or failure\r\nwhen those tasks are explicitly stipulated by Union law for competent\r\nauthorities.\n(12)          \r\n\u00a0This Regulation intends to reduce excessive\r\nrisk taking and rapid balance sheet growth, difficult resolution, difficult\r\nmonitoring, conflicts of interest, competition distortions, and misallocation\r\nof capital. It also intends to shield institutions carrying out activities that\r\ndeserve a public safety net from losses incurred as a result of other\r\nactivities. Necessary rules should\r\ntherefore contribute to refocusing banks on their core relationship-oriented\r\nrole of serving the real economy, and avoid that bank capital be excessively\r\nallocated to trading at the expense of lending to the non-financial economy.\n(13)          \r\nThis Regulation will apply only to credit\r\ninstitutions and groups with trading activities that meet thresholds set out in\r\nthe Regulation. This is in line with the explicit focus on the limited subset\r\nof the largest and most complex credit institutions and groups that in spite of\r\nother legislative acts remain too-big-to-fail, too-big-to-save and too complex\r\nto manage, supervise and resolve. The provisions of this Regulation should\r\naccordingly only apply to those Union credit institutions and groups that\r\neither are deemed of global systemic importance or exceed certain relative and\r\nabsolute accounting-based thresholds in terms of trading activity or absolute\r\nsize. Member States or the competent authorities may\r\ndecide to impose similar measures also on smaller credit institutions.\n(14)          \r\nThe territorial scope of this Regulation should\r\nbe wide to ensure that competition is not distorted and circumvention is prevented.\r\nHowever, if the subsidiaries of EU parents in third countries or EU branches of\r\ncredit institutions established in third countries falling within the scope of\r\nthis Regulation are subject to measures that in the opinion of the Commission are\r\ndeemed to have equivalent effect to those in this Regulation, they should be\r\nexempted. Competent authorities should be able also to exempt foreign\r\nsubsidiaries of groups with an EU parent if those are autonomous and if the\r\nimpact of their failure would have limited effects on the group as a whole.\n(15)          \r\nCredit institutions and entities belonging to\r\nthe same group, should be prohibited from buying and selling financial\r\ninstruments and commodities for their own account, as this activity has limited\r\nor no added value for the public good and is inherently risky.\n(16)          \r\nIt is difficult to distinguish proprietary\r\ntrading from market making. To overcome this difficulty, the prohibition of\r\nproprietary trading should be limited to desks, units, divisions or individual\r\ntraders specifically dedicated to proprietary trading. Banks should not be able\r\nto circumvent the prohibition by running or benefiting from investments in\r\nnon-bank entities engaging in proprietary trading.\n(17)          \r\nTo ensure that the entities subject to the prohibition\r\nof proprietary trading can continue to contribute toward the financing of the\r\neconomy, they should be allowed to invest in a closed list of funds. This\r\nexhaustive list should comprise closed-ended and unleveraged alternative\r\ninvestment funds (AIFs), European Venture Capital Funds, European Social\r\nEntrepreneurship Funds and European Long Term Investment Funds. To ensure that\r\nthese funds do not endanger the viability and financial soundness of the credit\r\ninstitutions that invest in them, it is essential that closed-ended and\r\nunleveraged AIFs in which credit institutions can still invest are managed by\r\nAIF managers that are authorised and supervised in accordance with the relevant\r\nprovisions of Directive 2011/61/EU of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council[26], and that those AIFs are established in the\r\nUnion or, if they are not established in the Union, they are marketed in the\r\nUnion according to the rules of that Directive.\n(18)          \r\nThe entities subject to the prohibition of proprietary\r\ntrading should be allowed to use their own capital to make investments in the\r\nframework of their cash management. Cash management should be an activity aiming\r\nat preserving the value of own capital while spreading credit risk across\r\nmultiple counterparties and maximising the liquidity of its own capital. In\r\nmanaging its cash, entities subject to the prohibition of proprietary trading should\r\nnot pursue the objective of achieving returns greater than money market rates,\r\nusing as a benchmark the rate of return of a three-month high quality\r\ngovernment bond.\n(19)          \r\nCash equivalent assets are instruments that are\r\nnormally dealt on the money market, such as treasury and local authority bills,\r\ncertificates of deposit, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, short-term\r\nnotes or units or shares of regulated money market funds. In order to prohibit\r\nshort selling, a credit institution should hold cash equivalent assets before being\r\nable to sell these assets.\n(20)          \r\nRemuneration policies which encourage excessive\r\nrisk-taking can undermine sound and effective risk management of banks. By\r\ncomplementing relevant existing Union law in this area, remuneration provisions\r\nshould contribute to preventing circumvention of the prohibition of proprietary\r\ntrading. Similarly, it should curtail any residual or hidden proprietary\r\ntrading activity by core credit institutions when carrying out prudent risk\r\nmanagement.\n(21)          \r\nThe management body of the entities subject to\r\nthe prohibition of proprietary trading should ensure compliance with this prohibition.\n(22)          \r\nOther than proprietary trading, large credit\r\ninstitutions engage in numerous other trading activities, such as market\r\nmaking, issuance, investment and sponsorship activity linked to risky\r\nsecuritisation, or the structuring, arranging, or execution of complex\r\nderivative transactions. These trading activities are often related to client activity\r\nbut may nevertheless give rise to concerns. Considering, however, the\r\npotentially useful nature of these activities they should not be subject to a\r\ndirect prohibition. Instead, such activities should remain subject to an ex\r\npost assessment by the competent authority and, potentially, to a\r\nrequirement to be separated from the rest of the groups\u2019 activities.\n(23)          \r\nIf, when assessing the trading activities, the\r\ncompetent authority concludes that they exceed certain metrics in terms of\r\nrelative size, leverage, complexity, profitability, associated market risk, as\r\nwell as interconnectedness, it should require their separation from the core\r\ncredit institution unless the core credit institution can demonstrate to the\r\nsatisfaction of the competent authority that those trading activities do not\r\npose a threat to the financial stability of the core credit institution or to\r\nthe Union financial system as a whole, taking into account the objectives set\r\nout in this Regulation.\n(24)          \r\nThere are particular concerns in relation to\r\nmarket making. The resolvability of a bank may be impeded by the presence of\r\ntrading and inventory within a large banking group, as individual trading\r\npositions are treated the same way in a resolution process, whether they result\r\nfrom client activity driven market making or from speculation. Additionally,\r\nmarket makers are interconnected with other large banking groups. Furthermore,\r\nmarket makers can be exposed to substantial counterparty risk and the concrete\r\nfunctioning of market making can vary in relation to different financial\r\ninstruments and market models. Therefore, particular attention to those\r\nactivities should be made during the assessment of the competent authority.\n(25)          \r\nCertain activities involving securitisation have\r\nallowed credit institutions to build up risks quickly, to concentrate risks\r\nwithin the leveraged sector, to grow notably short-term debt reliance between\r\nfinancial intermediaries, and to make financial intermediaries significantly\r\nmore interconnected. Unless securitisation fulfils certain minimum criteria to\r\nbe considered as high quality, credit institutions still run significant\r\nliquidity risk. Further, investing in risky securitised products may give rise\r\nto interconnectedness of financial institutions which impedes orderly and swift\r\nresolution. As a consequence, these activities require particular attention\r\nduring the assessment of the competent authority.\n(26)          \r\nTo ensure an effective separation in legal,\r\neconomic, governance and operational terms, core credit institutions and\r\ntrading entities should meet capital, liquidity, and large exposure rules on a\r\nfunctional sub-group basis. They should have strong independent governance and\r\nseparate management bodies.\n(27)          \r\nGroups that qualify as mutuals, cooperatives,\r\nsavings institutions or similar have a specific ownership and economic\r\nstructure. Imposing some of the rules related to separation could require\r\nfar-reaching changes to the structural organisation of those entities the costs\r\nof which could be disproportionate to the benefits. To the extent that those\r\ngroups fall within the scope of the Regulation, the competent authority may\r\ndecide to allow core credit institutions that meet the requirements set out in\r\nArticle 49(3)(a) or (b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to hold capital\r\ninstruments or voting rights in a trading entity where the competent authority\r\nconsiders that holding such capital instruments or voting rights is\r\nindispensable for the functioning of the group and that the core credit\r\ninstitution has taken sufficient measures in\r\norder to appropriately mitigate the relevant risks.\n(28)          \r\nLarge exposure limits aim at protecting credit\r\ninstitutions against the risk of incurring losses because of an excessive\r\nconcentration on one client or a group of connected clients. Applying those restrictions\r\nbetween the separated parts within the credit institution or group, as well as\r\nbetween the core credit institution and external entities carrying out trading\r\nactivities are an integral part of this Regulation. However, irrespective of\r\nindividual exposure limits, aggregate large exposures can still be substantial.\r\nThe individual limits should therefore be complemented by an aggregate large\r\nexposure limit. In order to limit the application of the public safety net to\r\nthe activities subject to separation and to clearly distinguish the activities\r\nof a trading entity from the core credit institution, the trading entities\r\nshould be prohibited from taking deposits eligible for deposit insurance. This\r\nprohibition should not prevent the exchange of collateral strictly relating to\r\ntheir trading activities. However, in order not to close down an additional\r\nsource of credit, the trading entity should be allowed to extend credit to all\r\nclients. Furthermore, whereas the trading entity may need to provide wholesale\r\npayment, clearing and settlement services, it should not be involved in retail\r\npayment services.\n(29)          \r\nIrrespective of separation, the core credit\r\ninstitution should still be able to manage its own risk. Certain trading\r\nactivities should therefore be allowed to the extent that they are aimed at the\r\nprudent management of the core credit institution's capital, liquidity and\r\nfunding and do not pose concerns to its financial stability. Similarly, the core\r\ncredit institutions needs to be able to provide certain necessary risk\r\nmanagement services to its clients. However, that should be done without\r\nexposing the core credit institution to unnecessary risk and without posing\r\nconcerns to its financial stability. Hedging activities eligible for the\r\npurpose of prudently managing own risk and for the provision of risk management\r\nservices to clients can, but does not have to, qualify as hedge accounting\r\nunder the International Financial Reporting Standards.\n(30)          \r\nTo enhance the effectiveness of the decision\r\nmaking procedure envisaged by this Regulation as well as to ensure to greatest\r\nextent possible that there is consistency between measures imposed under this\r\nRegulation, Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council, Directive [BRRD] and Directive 2013/36/EU of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council[27],\r\ncompetent authorities and relevant resolution authorities should closely\r\ncooperate in all circumstances having all powers conferred upon them in\r\nrelevant Union law. The duty to cooperate should cover all stages of the\r\nprocedure leading up to a competent authority's final decision to impose\r\nstructural measures.\n(31)          \r\nSeparation has a significant impact on banking\r\ngroups\u2019 legal, organisational and operational structure. To insure an effective\r\nand efficient application of separation and to prevent separation of groups\r\nalong geographic lines, separation decisions should be taken at group level by\r\nthe consolidating supervisor, having consulted the competent authorities of a\r\nbanking group\u2019s significant subsidiaries as appropriate.\n(32)          \r\nIn order to promote transparency and legal\r\ncertainty for the benefit of all market stakeholders, the European Banking Authority\r\n(EBA) should publish and keep up-to-date on its website a list of credit\r\ninstitutions and groups subject to the requirements concerning the ban of\r\nproprietary trading and separation of certain trading activities.\n(33)          \r\nTo the extent that the disclosure of information\r\nrelating to prudential supervision and for the application of this Regulation\r\ninvolves processing of personal data, such data should be fully protected by\r\nthe Union legal framework. In particular, personal data shall be retained by\r\nthe competent authority only for the period necessary, in accordance with the\r\napplicable data protection rules[28].\n(34)          \r\nSeparation entails changes to the legal,\r\norganisation and operational structure of affected banking groups, all of which\r\ngenerate costs. In order to limit the risk of costs being passed on to clients and\r\ngrant the credit institutions the time necessary to execute a separation\r\ndecision in an orderly fashion, separation should not be applicable immediately\r\nupon entry into force of the Regulation but apply as of [OP please enter the\r\nexact date 18 months from the date of publication of this Regulation]. \n(35)          \r\nThe provision of all or part of the investment\r\nservices or activities as a regular occupation or business on a professional\r\nbasis by different entities identified under this Regulation as a result of\r\nstructural changes imposed on large, complex and interconnected credit\r\ninstitutions, should be performed in accordance with the provisions of\r\nDirective 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[29]. Where this Regulation provides further restrictions on the ability\r\nof these entities to perform investment services as compared to those defined\r\nin Directive 2004/39/EC, the provisions of this Regulation should prevail. The\r\nperformance of these investment services or activities is subject to prior\r\nauthorisation in accordance with the provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC with the exception of credit institutions\r\nthat are authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU.\n(36)          \r\nThe Commission should cooperate with\r\nthird-country authorities in order to explore mutually supportive solutions to\r\nensure consistency between the provisions in this Regulation and the\r\nrequirements established by third countries. To that end, the Commission should\r\nbe able to determine that a third country legal framework is equivalent to this\r\nRegulation, also with respect to its legal, supervisory and enforcement\r\narrangements.\n(37)          \r\nIn order to ensure that entities subject to this\r\nRegulation comply with the obligations deriving from it and to ensure that they\r\nare subject to similar treatment across the Union, administrative sanctions and\r\nmeasures which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive should be ensured.\r\nTherefore, administrative sanctions and measures set by this Regulation should\r\nsatisfy certain essential requirements in relation to addressees, the criteria\r\nto be taken into account when applying a sanction or measure, publication of\r\nsanctions or measures, key sanctioning powers and the levels of administrative\r\npecuniary sanctions.\n(38)          \r\nIn order to specify the requirements set out in\r\nthis Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in\r\nrespect of the following non-essential elements: expanding the type of government\r\nbonds that should not prohibited under Article 6 and which competent\r\nauthorities do not have to review or consider for separation; setting the\r\nrelevant limits and conditions for when a competent authority shall presume\r\nthat certain trading activities must be separated; expanding the list of instruments\r\nthat are allowed for the management of a credit institution's own risk;\r\nexpanding the list of instruments that a credit institution may transact in to\r\nmanage clients' risks; calculating the limit above which derivatives may not be\r\nsold nor recorded on the balance sheet of a core credit institution; large\r\nexposures and the extent of recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques;\r\namending the components of the concept of \"trading activities\" used\r\nfor establishing the conditions of application of Chapter II and Chapter III of\r\nthis Regulation; specifying the types of securitisations that do not pose a\r\nthreat to the financial stability of a core credit institution or to the Union financial\r\nsystem; the criteria for assessing the equivalence of third country legal and\r\nsupervisory frameworks. It is of\r\nparticular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations\r\nduring its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when\r\npreparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely\r\nand appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and\r\nto the Council.\n(39)          \r\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the\r\nimplementation of this Regulation, in particular with\r\nregard to the provisions set out in Articles 21 and 27, implementing powers should be\r\nconferred on the Commission.\n(40)          \r\nTechnical standards in financial services should\r\nensure consistent harmonisation and adequate protection of depositors,\r\ninvestors and consumers across the Union. As bodies with highly specialised expertise, it is efficient and appropriate\r\nto entrust the EBA with the elaboration of draft regulatory technical and\r\nimplementing standards, which do not involve policy choices. EBA should ensure\r\nefficient administrative and reporting processes when drafting technical\r\nstandards.\n(41)          \r\nThe Commission should adopt regulatory technical\r\nstandards developed by the EBA with regard to the methodology for the\r\nconsistent measurement and application of the metrics relative to the\r\ncalculation of the threshold above which separation of trading activities\r\nshould take place by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 of the TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14\r\nof Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council[30]. The Commission and\r\nthe EBA should ensure that those standards can be applied by all institutions\r\nconcerned in a manner that is proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity\r\nof those institutions and their activities.\n(42)          \r\nThe Commission should be empowered to adopt\r\nimplementing technical standards developed by the EBA with regard to the\r\nmethodology for calculating the amount of trading activities engaged in by\r\ncredit institutions and groups, the uniform template for disclosure of total\r\namount and the components of credits institutions and parent companies' trading\r\nactivities and determining the procedures and forms for exchange of information\r\non sanctions with the EBA by means of implementing acts pursuant to Article 291\r\nof the TFEU and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\n(43)          \r\nIn accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the aim\r\nof preventing systemic risk, financial stress or failure of large, complex and\r\ninterconnected credit institutions to lay down rules on prohibition on\r\nproprietary trading and separation of certain trading activities. This\r\nRegulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the\r\nobjectives pursued in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Treaty on the\r\nEuropean Union.\n(44)          \r\nThe freedom to conduct a business in accordance\r\nwith Union law and national laws and practices is recognised under Article 16\r\nof the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter). Each person within the Union has\r\nthe right to start-up or to continue a business without being subject to either\r\ndiscrimination or unnecessary restriction. Moreover, share ownership is\r\nprotected as property under Article 17 of the Charter. Shareholders have the\r\nright to own, use, and dispose of their property, and the right not to be\r\ndeprived involuntarily of this property. The prohibition of proprietary trading\r\nand the separation of certain trading activities provided for in this\r\nRegulation may affect the freedom to conduct a business as well as the property\r\nrights of shareholders who, in such situation, cannot freely dispose of their\r\nproperty.\n(45)          \r\nThe limitations on the freedom to conduct a\r\nbusiness and the rights of shareholders should comply with Article 52 of the\r\nCharter. Interference with these rights should not be disproportionate.\r\nAccordingly, the banning or separation of trading activities should only be\r\nrequired when it is in the public interest promoting the good functioning of\r\nthe Union banking market and financial stability. Affected shareholders should\r\nnot be prevented from using their other legal rights, such as the right to an\r\neffective remedy and to a fair trial.\n(46)          \r\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights\r\nand observes the principles recognised in the Charter, in\r\nparticular the right to respect for private and family life, the right to the\r\nprotection of personal data, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to\r\nproperty, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial as well as the\r\nright of defence and the respect of the ne bis in idem principle. This Regulation\r\nmust be applied according to these rights and principles.\n(47)          \r\nBecause entities concerned by the prohibition of\r\nproprietary trading will require sufficient time to implement the prohibition,\r\nthis Regulation foresees that the prohibition shall apply [OP please\r\nintroduce exact date 18 months after publication of this Regulation].\r\nSimilarly, the procedures foreseen in this Regulation with regard to the\r\nprovisions that lead to a decision by the competent authority that trading\r\nactivities need to be separated from the core credit institution, and the\r\nprocedures that apply to groups following the adoption of such a decision, are\r\ncomplex and require time not only to carry out but also to implement those measures in a responsible and sustainable\r\nmanner. It is therefore appropriate\r\nthat such provisions apply [OP please introduce exact date 36 months\r\nafter publication of this Regulation].\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nChapter I\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 1\nObjectives\nThis Regulation aims at preventing systemic\r\nrisk, financial stress or failure of large, complex and interconnected entities\r\nin the financial system, in particular credit institutions, and at meeting the\r\nfollowing objectives: \n(a)                   \r\nto reduce excessive risk taking within the\r\ncredit institution;\n(b)                   \r\nto remove material conflicts of interest between\r\nthe different parts of the credit institution;\n(c)                   \r\nto avoid misallocation of resources and to\r\nencourage lending to the real economy;\n(d)                  \r\nto contribute to undistorted conditions of\r\ncompetition for all credit institutions within the internal market;\n(e)                   \r\nto reduce interconnectedness within the\r\nfinancial sector leading to systemic risk;\n(f)                    \r\nto facilitate efficient management, monitoring\r\nand supervision of the credit\r\ninstitution;

The largest banks\r\nare also more active in complex trading activities and more active cross-border\r\nthrough a very high number of legal entities. \nSeveral EU Member States as well as third\r\ncountries have therefore taken a step further and have enacted, or are in the\r\nprocess of enacting, structural reforms of their respective banking sectors to\r\naddress concerns related to the largest and most complex financial\r\ninstitutions. Also international institutions such as the G20, the Financial\r\nStability Board, the Bank for International Settlements, the International\r\nMonetary Fund, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\r\nhave highlighted the role of such reforms as regards e.g. resolvability and\r\nhave called for a broad and global debate on bank business models.\n\r\n1.5.2.          \r\nAdded value of EU involvement \r\n\nIn light of these developments, there is a\r\nstrong justification to act at EU level. While the national reforms broadly\r\nshare the same objective, they differ in detail. This will distort\r\nestablishment decisions, as TBTF banks may transfer activities to, or locate,\r\nin another Member State. A common EU response would therefore be a more\r\neffective response. The need for uniform rules is particularly important for\r\nthe banking union in order to facilitate the supervisory tasks of the SSM and\r\nthe resolution actions of the SRM.\n\r\n1.5.3.          \r\nLessons learned from similar experiences in the\r\npast \r\n\nn/a\n\r\n1.5.4.          \r\nCompatibility and possible synergy with other\r\nappropriate instruments \r\n\nThe EU has already initiated a number of\r\nreforms to increase the resilience of banks and to reduce the probability and\r\nimpact of bank failure. These reforms include measures to strengthen banks'\r\nsolvency (the capital and liquidity requirements part of the CRR/CRDIV\r\npackage); measures to strengthen bank resolvability (the proposed BRRD);\r\nmeasures to better guarantee deposits (the revision of the Deposit Guarantee\r\nSchemes directive (the \"DGS\"); measures to improve transparency and\r\naddress the risks of derivatives and to improve market infrastructures\r\n(European Market Infrastructure Regulation (the \"EMIR\") and related\r\nrevisions to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive\r\n(\"MiFID\")). Additionally, in order to break the negative feedback\r\ncycle between the sovereign and banking risks and to restore confidence in the\r\neuro and the banking system, the European Commission has called for further\r\ndevelopment of a Banking Union, building on the single rule book that will be\r\napplicable to all banks in the entire EU. This include a Single Supervisory\r\nMechanism (\u201cSSM\u201d) and a Single Resolution Mechanism (\"SRM), which will be\r\nmandatory for members of the euro area but open to voluntary participation for\r\nall other Member States.\nDespite this broad-ranging reform agenda\r\nfurther measures are needed to reduce the probability and impact of failure of\r\nTBTF banks. Such measures have global support, as evidenced by recent\r\nstatements by G20 leaders and ministers. \nAs regards impact of failure,\r\nimplementation of the BRRD will pave the way for the orderly resolution of\r\nnormal EU banks and thus significantly reduce the impact of failure of such\r\nbanks on public finances.\u00a0 The resolution powers will be challenging to\r\nexercise for TBTF banks, given their particularly large, complex and integrated\r\nbalance sheets and corporate structures. As a result, while the potential for\r\neventual public support is certainly reduced, it may still not be eradicated if\r\nthe powers are not in all instances fully applied. The impact of a failure of a\r\nlarge and complex bank may therefore still be significant. All this may explain\r\nmarket perceptions of remaining implicit subsidies and call for further clarity\r\nas regards potential additional structural measures. Structural reform will\r\nincrease the options available to authorities when dealing with failing banking\r\ngroups. By increasing orderly resolution credibility, it will also improve\r\nmarket discipline and bank balance sheet dynamics ex ante.\u00a0 Structural reforms\r\ncould make the newly granted powers in BRRD more effective for TBTF banks, as\r\nresolution authorities would deal with separate, segregated and simpler balance\r\nsheets. This would make it easier to monitor and assess the different entities\r\nof a banking group and it expands the range of options at the disposal of\r\nresolution authorities. Additional measures for TBTF banks would be in line\r\nwith the BRRD\u2019s proportionality principle.\n\r\n1.6.                \r\nDuration and financial impact \r\n\n\u00fd Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\nEntry into force and start of application\r\nforeseen for 2015/2017 with compliance with proprietary trading ban as of\r\nJanuary 2017 and potential separation requirements as of July 2018.\n\r\n1.7.                \r\nManagement mode(s) planned[44] \r\n\nFrom the 2014 budget\n\u00a8 Direct management by the Commission\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 by its departments, including by its staff in the Union\r\ndelegations; \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 by the executive agencies; \n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00fd Indirect management by delegating implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial\r\nRegulation;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the\r\nextent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are\r\nentrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\r\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic\r\nact.\n\u2013       If more than one management mode is indicated,\r\nplease provide details in the \"Comments\" section.\nComments \nEBA is a regulatory agency acting under the\r\noversight of the Commission.\n\r\n2.                      \r\nMANAGEMENT MEASURES \r\n2.1.                \r\nMonitoring and reporting rules \r\n\nThe proposal foresees that the Commission\r\nshould review the effectiveness of the proposed measures on a periodic basis. \n\r\n2.2.                \r\nManagement and control system \r\n2.2.1.          \r\nRisk(s) identified\r\n\nIn relation to the legal, economical,\r\nefficient and effective use of appropriations resulting from the proposal, it\r\nis expected that the proposal would not bring about new risks that would not be\r\ncurrently covered by EBA's existing internal control framework.\n\r\n2.2.2.          \r\nInformation concerning the internal control\r\nsystem set up\r\n\nn.a.\n\r\n2.2.3.          \r\nEstimate of the costs and benefits of the\r\ncontrols and assessment of the expected level of risk of error\r\n\nn.a.\n\r\n2.3.                \r\nMeasures to prevent fraud and irregularities \r\n\nFor the purposes of combating fraud,\r\ncorruption and any other illegal activity, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No\r\n1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999\r\nconcerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)\r\nshall apply to the EBA without any restriction.\nEBA shall accede to the Interinstitutional\r\nAgreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the\r\nEuropean Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning\r\ninternal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and shall\r\nimmediately adopt appropriate provisions for all EBA staff.\nThe funding decisions and the agreements\r\nand the implementing instruments resulting from them shall explicitly stipulate\r\nthat the Court of Auditors and OLAF may, if need be, carry out on-the-spot\r\nchecks on the beneficiaries of monies disbursed by EBA as well as on the staff\r\nresponsible for allocating these monies.\nArticles 64 and 65 of the Regulation\r\nestablishing EBA set out the provisions on implementation and control of the\r\nEBA budget and applicable financial rules.\n\r\n3.                      \r\nESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \r\n3.1.                \r\nHeading(s) of the multiannual financial\r\nframework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \r\n\n\u00b7      Existing budget lines \nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n   || Diff./non-diff.

The Commission and the EBA\r\nshould ensure that those standards can be applied by all institutions concerned\r\nin a manner that is proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of those\r\ninstitutions and their activities. Additionally, the Commission should adopt\r\nimplementing technical standards developed by the EBA with regard to the\r\nmethodology for calculating the amount of trading activities engaged in by\r\ncredit institutions and parent companies and the uniform template for\r\ndisclosure of total amount and the components of credits institutions and\r\nparent companies' trading activities by means of implementing acts. The work\r\nforeseen requires bilateral and multilateral meetings with stakeholders,\r\nanalysis and assessment of options and drafting of consultation documents,\r\npublic consultation of stakeholders, setting up and management of standing\r\nexpert groups composed of supervisors from Member States, setting up and\r\nmanagement of ad hoc expert groups, analysis of the responses to consultations,\r\ndrafting of cost/benefit analysis and drafting of the legal text.\nIt\r\nhas been assumed that the Regulation will enter into force in the end of 2015.\r\nThe additional EBA resources are therefore only required from 2016.
