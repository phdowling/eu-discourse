Ltd, the Court of Justice of the European Union ('the Court')\nannulled Council Regulation (EC) No 1472/2006 of 5 October 2006 imposing a\ndefinitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitely the provisional duty\nimposed on imports of certain footwear with uppers of leather originating in\nthe People's Republic of China and Vietnam ('the Regulation') . The Regulation\nwas annulled in so far as it relates to Brosmann Footwear (HK) Ltd, Seasonable\nFootwear (Zhongshan) Ltd, Lung Pao Footwear (Guangzhou) Ltd and Risen Footwear (HK)\nCo Ltd as well as Zhejiang Aokang Shoes Co. Ltd ('the exporting producers\nconcerned').\nIn the respective judgments the Court\nstated that the Union institutions should have examined and decided upon the\nrequests for market economy treatment ('MET') lodged by the exporting producers\nconcerned.\nArticle 266 of the Treaty on the\nfunctioning of the European Union provides that the institutions must take the\nnecessary measures to comply with the Court's judgments. \nIn order to comply with that obligation,\nthe Commission decided to investigate the point affected by the illegality and\nto examine whether market economy conditions prevailed for the exporting\nproducers concerned for the period from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005.\nThe enclosed Commission proposal for a\nCouncil Implementing Regulation imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on the exporting\nproducers concerned for the period covered by Council Regulation (EC) No\n1472/2006 (7 April 2006 to 7 October 2009), is made after the interested\nparties have been given sufficient time to provide comments to the final\ndisclosure document of 22 November 2013. \nIt is proposed that the Council adopts the\nattached proposal for a Regulation which should be published in the Official\nJournal of the European Union as soon as possible.\nLegal basis\nCouncil Regulation (EC) 1225/2009 of 30\nNovember 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members\nof the European Community and Article 266 TFEU.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive competence\nof the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle because the form of action is described in the\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and\nadministrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional\nand local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and\nproportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: Council Implementing\nRegulation.\nOther means would not be adequate because\nthe basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the Union\nbudget. \n2014/0044 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nRe-imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty\nand collecting definitely the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain\nfootwear with uppers of leather originating in the People's Republic of China\nand produced by Brosmann Footwear (HK) Ltd, Seasonable Footwear (Zhongshan)\nLtd, Lung Pao Footwear (Guangzhou) Ltd, Risen Footwear (HK) Co Ltd and Zhejiang\nAokang Shoes Co. Ltd\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\u2018TFEU\u2019),\nHaving regard to Article 266 TFEU,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC)\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[5]\n('the basic Regulation'), and in particular Article 9\nand 14 (3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission ('the Commission') after consulting the Advisory Committee,\nWhereas \nA. PROCEDURE\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 23 March 2006, the\nCommission adopted Regulation (EC) No 553/2006 imposing provisional\nanti-dumping measures on imports of certain footwear with uppers of leather (\u2018footwear\u2019)\noriginating in the People's Republic of China ('PRC') and Vietnam (\u2018the\nprovisional Regulation\u2019)[6].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Regulation (EC)\nNo 1472/2006[7]\nthe Council imposed definitive anti-dumping duties ranging from 9.7 % to 16.5 %\non imports of certain footwear with uppers of leather, originating in Vietnam\nand in the PRC for two years ('Council Regulation (EC) No 1472/2006' or \u2018the\ncontested Regulation\u2019).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation (EC) No\n388/2008[8]\nthe Council extended the definitive anti-dumping measures on imports of certain\nfootwear with upper leather originating in the PRC to imports consigned from\nthe Macao Special Administrative Region ('SAR'), whether declared as\noriginating in the Macao SAR or not.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further to an expiry\nreview initiated on 3 October 2008[9],\u00a0\nthe Council further extended the anti-dumping measures for 15 months by Council\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 1294/2009[10],\ni.e. until 31 March 2011, when the measures expired (\u2018Council Regulation (EC)\nNo. 1294/2009\u2019).\u00a0 \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Brosmann\nFootwear (HK) Ltd, Seasonable Footwear (Zhongshan) Ltd, Lung Pao Footwear\n(Guangzhou) Ltd and Risen Footwear (HK) Co Ltd as well as Zhejiang Aokang Shoes\nCo. Ltd ('the exporting producers concerned') challenged the contested\nRegulation in the Court of First Instance (now: the General Court). By\njudgements of 4 March 2010 in Case T-401/06 Brosmann Footwear (HK) and Others v\nCouncil [2010] ECR II-671 and of 4 March 2010 in Joined Cases T-407/06 and T-408/06\nZhejiang Aokang Shoes and Wenzhou Taima Shoes v Council [2010] ECR II-747 (\u2018the\njudgments of the General Court\u2019), the General Court rejected those challenges.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exporting producers concerned\nappealed those judgements. In its judgments of 2 February 2012 in case C-249/10\nP Brosmann et al and of 15 November 2012 in case C-247/10P Zhejiang Aokang\nShoes Co. Ltd (\u2018the judgments\u2019), the Court of Justice of the European Union\n('the Court') quashed the judgments of the General Court. It held that the\nGeneral Court erred in law in so far as it held that the Commission was not\nrequired to examine requests for market economy treatment (\u2018MET\u2019) under Article\n2(7)(b) and (c) of the basic Regulation from non-sampled traders (paragraph 36\nof the judgement in Case C-249/10 P and paragraph 29 and 32 of the judgement in\nCase C-247/10 P).\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Court then gave\njudgement itself in the matter. It held: \u201c[\u2026] the Commission ought to have\nexamined the substantiated claims submitted to it by the appellants pursuant to\nArticle 2(7)(b) and (c) of the basic regulation for the purpose of claiming MET\nin the context of the anti-dumping proceeding [which is] the subject of the\ncontested regulation. It must next be found that it cannot be ruled out that\nsuch an examination would have led to a definitive anti-dumping duty being\nimposed on the appellants other than the 16.5% duty applicable to them pursuant\nto Article 1(3) of the contested regulation. It is apparent from that provision\nthat a definitive anti-dumping duty of 9.7% was imposed on the only Chinese\ntrader in the sample which obtained MET. As is apparent from paragraph 38\nabove, had the Commission found that the market economy conditions prevailed\nalso for the appellants, they ought, when the calculation of an individual\ndumping margin was not possible, also to have benefited from the same rate\u201d\n(paragraph 42 of the judgement in Case C-249/10 P and paragraph 36 of the\njudgement in Case C-247/10 P).\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence, it annulled\nthe contested Regulation, in so far as it relates to the exporting producers\nconcerned. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article\n266 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that\nthe Institutions must take the necessary measures to comply with the Court's\njudgments. In case of annulment of an act adopted by the Institutions in the\ncontext of an administrative procedure, such as anti-dumping, compliance with\nthe Court\u2019s judgement consists in the replacement of the annulled act by a new\nact, in which the illegality identified by the Court is eliminated.[11]\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According\nto the case-law of the Court, the procedure for replacing the annulled act may\nbe resumed at the very point at which the illegality occurred.[12] That implies in particular that in a situation where an act\nconcluding an administrative procedure is annulled, that annulment does not\nnecessarily affect the preparatory acts, such as the initiation of the anti-dumping\nprocedure. In a situation where a Regulation imposing definitive anti-dumping\nmeasures is annulled, that means that subsequent to the annulment, the\nanti-dumping proceeding is still open, because the act concluding the\nanti-dumping proceeding has disappeared from the Union legal order[13], except if the illegality occurred at the stage of initiation.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  In\nthe present case, the illegality occurred after initiation. Hence, the\nCommission decided to resume the present anti-dumping proceeding that was still\nopen at the very point at which the illegality occurred and to examine whether\nmarket economy conditions prevailed for the exporting producers concerned for\nthe period from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Institutions therefore\nhave examined those requests for MET, which relate to the period from 1 April\n2004 to 31 March 2005 which was the investigating period (\u2018the IP\u2019).\u00a0 \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exporting producers\nconcerned were invited to cooperate. They were given the opportunity to make\ntheir views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time-limit set\nout in the respective letters.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the anti-dumping\nproceeding leading to the adoption of the contested Regulation was carried out\nin 2005-2006, the Commission was not sure that it had the correct contact\ndetails of potentially interested parties. Therefore, the Commission invited\nall potentially interested parties to indicate whether they wished to receive\ndisclosure pursuant to Article 20 of the basic Regulation by means of a notice published\nin the Official Journal[14].\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 REPLACEMENT OF THE CONTESTED\nREGULATION BY A NEW ACT IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE JUDGMENTS\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Community Institutions\nhave the possibility to remedy the aspects of the contested Regulation which\nled to its annulment, while leaving unchanged the parts of the assessment which\nare not affected by the Judgment[15].\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The present Regulation\nseeks to correct the aspects of the contested Regulation found to be\ninconsistent with the basic Regulation, and which thus led to the annulment in\nso far as the exporting producers are concerned.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All other findings made in\nthe contested Regulation, which were not annuled by the General Court, remain valid\nand are herewith incorporated into the present Regulation.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the following\nrecitals are limited to the new assessment necessary in order to comply with\nthe judgments.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Examination of the MET\nclaims\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nreason for the annulment of the contested Regulation in respect of the exporting\nproducers concerned was that\nthe Institutions ought to have examined the\nsubstantiated MET claims submitted to it by the exporting producers concerned\npursuant to Article 2(7)(b) and (c) of the basic Regulation.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nInstitutions have therefore analyzed the MET claims. The assessment showed that\nthe information provided was not sufficient to demonstrate that the exporting\nproducers concerned operated under market economy conditions (see for a\ndetailed explanation below recitals (23) and following).\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis necessary to point out that the burden of proof lies with the producer\nwishing to claim MET under Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation. To that\nend, the first subparagraph of Article 2(7)(c) provides that the claim\nsubmitted by such a producer must contain sufficient evidence, as laid down in\nthat provision, that the producer operates under market economy conditions.\nAccordingly, there is no obligation on the EU institutions to prove that the\nproducer does not satisfy the conditions laid down for the recognition of such\nstatus. On the contrary, it is for the EU institutions to assess whether the\nevidence supplied by the producer concerned is sufficient to show that the\ncriteria laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 2(7)(c) of the basic\nregulation are fulfilled in order to grant it MET and it is for the EU\njudicature to examine whether that assessment is vitiated by a manifest error (paragraph 32 of the judgement in Case C-249/10 P and paragraph 24 of\nthe judgement in Case C-247/10 P). \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission, despite the fact that the burden of proof is on the producers\nconcerned, nevertheless gave the exporting producers\nconcerned the possibility to provide additional information. None of the exporters concerned provided the additional information\nrequested, not even after being reminded and warned about the consequences of\nnot providing that information. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation showed that one exporting producer, located in Hong Kong (company 1), was related to another exporting producer concerned\n(company 2) during the original IP. Their MET requests were therefore assessed\ntogether. Company 2 failed to address the deficiencies identified by the\nCommission; on the basis of the information at its disposal, the Commission\nconcluded that company 1 and company 2 failed to demonstrate that they operated\nunder market economy conditions as laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic\nRegulation, for the following reasons.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the criterion 1\n(Business decisions), the official document \u201dCertificate of Approval\u201d of the\ncompany refered to a quantitative limitation of the production of the product\nconcerned and the obligation to sell for exports only. The Articles of\nAssociation mentioned in several chapters the obligation to report to the local\nauthorities, in particular in relation to the sales price determination and\nforeign exchange operations. The MET form stated that the company had long term\nloans, unsecured, bearing no interests and having no fixed terms of repayment.\nThe criteria 2 (Accounting) and 3 (Assets and 'carry over') were not fulfilled since\nexternal audit reports and capital verification reports were not provided.\u00a0 \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another also Hong Kong based exporting producer concerned (company 3) was found to be related to\nproducers of the product concerned in the PRC. Company 3 was therefore asked to\nsubmit MET claim forms for its related producers in the PRC. No information was\nsubmitted. It was concluded that Company 3 failed to provide sufficient\nevidence demonstrating that its related producers operated under market economy\nconditions as required under Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation.\nTherefore, company 3 could not be granted MET.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The MET claim submitted by\ncompany 4 contained many documents and annexes only in Chinese, without any\ntranslation into English. In addition, it failed to provide information\nallowing for assessment of its compliance with criteria 1 (Business decisions),\n2 (Accounting) and 3 (Assets and 'carry over') as laid down in Article 2(7)(c)\nof the basic Regulation.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards criterion 1\n(Business decision), it failed to provide the Articles of Association and the required\ncopies of contracts. For criteria 2 and 3, translations of the audited accounts\ninto English were not provided. It also failed to explain as requested why the\ncompany had no sales on the domestic market during the IP. The capital\nverification reports were not provided. Moreover, supporting documents showing\nthe different steps in the field of business decision and costs, like\nnegotiations with big suppliers and examples of labour contracts, were not\nprovided as requested. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The MET claim submitted by\nCompany 5 failed to demonstrate that the company operated under market economy\nconditions, as it did not provide the information necessary to assess its\ncompliance with criteria 1 ( Business decisions), 2 (Accounting) and 3 (Assets\nand \u2018carry over\u2019).\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 More specifically, as\nregards criterion 1,\u00a0 Company 5 failed to submit MET claims for five other related\ncompanies belonging to the group and which appear to have sold the product\nconcerned. As regards criterion 2, Company 5 failed to provide audited accounts\nfor the year 2003 and the audit reports for 2002 and 2004 contain comments\ncasting doubts on the reliability of the relevant financial accounts. Finally,\nCompany 5 failed to provide the Capital Verification Report and information as\nto when and under which conditions the production equipment had been obtained. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first subparagraph of\nArticle 2(7) (c) provides that the claim submitted by a producer claiming MET must\ncontain sufficient evidence, as laid down in that provision, that the producer\noperates under market economy conditions. The MET claims did not contain such\nevidence. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission furthermore,\nwithout being legally obliged to do so, sent deficiency letters to the\nexporting producers concerned, but to no avail. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On that basis, the Commission\ninformed the exporting producers concerned about its intention to deny MET and\ngave them an opportunity to comment.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the oral hearing and in\ntheir written observations, the exporting producers concerned have not\ncontested the assessment of their MET claims by the Commission.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is concluded that none\nof the exporting producers concerned fulfilled all the conditions set out in\nArticle 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation and MET is, as a result, denied for all\nof them. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that the Court\nheld that if the Institutions found that the market economy conditions\nprevailed for the exporting producers concerned, they ought to have benefited\nfrom the same rate as the company in the sample that was granted MET. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, since MET is\ndenied for all exporting producers concerned as a result of the findings in the\nresumed investigation, none of the exporting producers concerned should benefit\nfrom the individual duty rate of the sampled company that was granted MET. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nresidual anti-dumping duty applicable to the PRC should be therefore imposed\nfor the exporting producers concerned for the period of application of Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1472/2006. The period of application of that Regulation was\ninitially from 7 October 2006 until 7 October 2008. Following the initiation of\nan expiry review, it was prolonged on30 December 2009 until 31 March 2011. The\nillegality identified in the judgments is that the Institutions failed to\nestablish whether the products produced by the exporting producers concerned should\nbe subject to the residual duty or to the duty of the company in the sample\nthat was granted MET.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthe basis of the illegality identified by the Court, there is no legal ground\nfor completely exempting the products produced by the exporting producers\nconcerned from paying any anti-dumping duty. A new act remedying the illegality\nidentified by the Court therefore only needs to reassess the applicable anti-dumping\nduty rate, and not the measures themselves.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Should the Institutions\nrefrain from re-imposing the duties at the appropriate level, that would\ntrigger unjust enrichement, as imports of the product produced by the exporting\nproducers concerned took place under the assumption that the appropriate duty\nwould be levied. The duty was therefore factored in\nwhen deciding on the sales price for the products concerned.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Since\nit is concluded that the residual duty should be re-imposed in respect of the\nexporting producers concerned at the same rate as originally imposed by Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1472/2006, no changes are required to Council Regulation\n(EC) No 388/2008 and Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1294/2009. Those\nregulations remain valid for the exporting producers concerned. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of interested\nparties\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exporting producers\nconcerned argue, first, that it was exceedingly difficult, if not impossible to\nprovide the additional information requested by the Commission, covering the\nperiod 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005. \n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They argued, second, that\nthe Court not only annulled the contested Regulation because of the failure of\nthe Institutions to examine their requests for MET at all, but also because the\nInstitutions failed to make the MET determination of non-sampled and sampled\ncompanies within three months of initiation of the investigation, as stipulated\nin Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation. The parties claimed that that\ndefect could not be remedied any more. They consider that in any event, as a\nresult of the violation of the three months deadline, also all sampled\ncompanies that had requested MET should be treated as if they had been granted\nMET, and that the Institutions therefore were under an obligation to\nrecalculate the average dumping margin for companies having obtained MET.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They argue, third, that the\nanti-dumping proceeding had been concluded at the expiry of the anti-dumping\nmeasures on 31 March 2011, and that it therefore was not possible for the\nInstitutions to resume that proceeding from the point where the illegality occurred.\nRather, they consider that the Institutions are under the obligation to start a\nnew investigation covering not only the MET claims, but also the existence of\ndumping, injury and Union interest.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They argue, fourth, that\nthe proposed way of complying with the judgments would lead to a retroactive\nimposition of the anti-dumping duties. That, in turn, would be against the\nprinciple of legal certainty, the right to effective judicial remedy and Article\n10(1) of the basic Regulation. \n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They claim, fifth, that the\nInstitutions cannot limit themselves to the assessment of the requests for MET\npresented by the exporting producers concerned. Rather, they consider that the\nInstitutions need to assess all requests for MET presented by non-sampled\ncompanies. Not doing so would violate the principle of non-discrimination.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, the parties\ncontest the argument that the absence of re-imposition would result in unjust\nenrichment. It was argued that since the annulled anti-dumping duties never\nexisted for the exporters concerned, not imposing them would not lead to an\nunjust enrichment of the affected operators. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis of comments \n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to the first\nclaim, the Institutions recall that according to the case-law, the burden of\nproof lies with the producer wishing to claim MET under Article 2(7)(b) of the\nbasic Regulation. To that end, the first subparagraph of Article 2(7)(c)\nprovides that the claim submitted by such a producer must contain sufficient\nevidence, as laid down in that provision, that the producer operates under\nmarket economy conditions. Accordingly, as held by the Court in the judgments (see\nabove recital (21), there is no obligation on the Institutions to prove that\nthe producer does not satisfy the conditions laid down for the recognition of\nsuch status. On the contrary, it is for the Institutions to assess whether the\nevidence supplied by the producer concerned is sufficient to show that the\ncriteria laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 2(7)(c) of the basic\nregulation are fulfilled in order to grant it MET.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hence, the Institutions\ncould simply have rejected the request for MET on the basis that the requests\ndid not contain sufficient evidence that the producer operates under market\neconomy conditions. The fact that the Institutions decided to give the\nexporting producers concerned the possibility to complement their requests can\ntherefore not be criticised for coming allegedly late.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the second claim that the MET determination had\nto be completed within three months of the initiation, it is recalled that\naccording to the case law, the second subparagraph of Article 2(7)(c) of the\nbasic Regulation does not contain any indication as regards the consequences of\nthe Commission's failure to comply with the three-month period. The General\nCourt therefore takes the view that an MET decision at a later stage does not\naffect the validity of the Regulation imposing definitive measures as long as applicants\nhave not proved that, if the Commission had not exceeded the three-month\nperiod, the Council might have adopted a different regulation more favourable\nto their interests than the contested regulation.[16] The Court has furthermore recognized that the Institutions may\nmodify the MET assessment until the adoption of final measures.[17]\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That case-law has not been\noverturned by the judgments. In the judgments, the Court relies on the\nobligation for the Commission to carry out the assessment in three months in\norder to show that the obligation of that assessment exists independently of\nwhether the Commission applies sampling or not. The Court does not pronounce\nitself on the question what legal consequence it has if the Commission\nconcludes the MET assessment at a later stage of the investigation. The Court\nonly rules that the Institutions could not completely ignore MET claims, but\nhad to assess them the latest when imposing definitive measures. \n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe present case, the exporting producers concerned have not shown that, had\nthe Commission carried out the MET assessment within three months after the\ninitiation of the anti-dumping procedure in 2005, the Council might have\nadopted a different regulation more favourable to their interests than the\ncontested regulation. The second claim is therefore rejected. \n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nregards the third claim, namely that the measures in question expired on 31\nMarch 2011, the Institutions fail to see why the expiry of the measure would be\nof any relevance for the possibility for the Council to adopt a new act to\nreplace the annulled act. \n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nexplained above in recitals (9) to (11), the anti-dumping proceedings are, as a\nresult of the annulment of the act concluding the proceedings, still open. The\nInstitutions are under an obligation to close those proceedings, as the basic Regulation\nprovides that an investigation has to be closed by an act of the Institutions. \u00a0. \n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nfor the fourth argument, Article 10 (1) of the basic Regulation, which takes\nover the text of Article 10 (1) of the WTO Antidumping Agreement (\u2018ADA\u2019),\nstipulates that provisional measures and definitive anti-dumping duties shall\nonly be applied to products which enter free circulation after the time when\nthe decision taken pursuant to Article 7(1) or 9(4) of the basic Regulation, as\nthe case may be, enters into force. In the present case, the anti-dumping\nduties in question are only applied to products which entered into free\ncirculation after the provisional and the contested (definitive) Regulation taken\npursuant to 7 (1)\u00a0 and 9 (4) of the basic Regulation respectively had entered\ninto force.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In additon, it is also\nconsidered that the imposition of the anti-dumping duties does not result in\nviolation of the general principles of Union law, such as protection of legal\ncertainty, of legitimate expectations and the right to effective judicial\nremedy for the following reasons. \n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regards to the\nprotection of legal certainty and of legitimate expectations, it is first of\nall observed that according to the case-law, traders cannot claim the\nprotection of legal certainty and legitimate expectations where they were\nalerted of an imminent change in the Union's commercial policy.[18] In the present case,\ntraders were alerted by the publication of the notice of initiation and of the\nprovisional Regulation in the Official Journal, which are both still part of\nthe legal order of the Union, of the risk that the products produced by the\nexporting producers concerned may become subject to an anti-dumping duty. The\nexporting producers concerned could therefore not rely on the general\nprinciples of the Union's law of protection of legal certainty and legitimate\nexpectations.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Second, it is important to\nunderline that the imposition of definitive measures is not retroactive. The\ncase-law of the Court distinguishes in that regard between the application of a\nnew role to a situation that has become definitive (also referred to as an\nexisting or definitively established legal situation)[19], and a situation that\nstarted before the entry into force of the new rule, but which is not yet\ndefinitive (also referred to as a temporary situation)[20].\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present case, the\nsituation of the imports of the products concerned that occurred during the\nperiod of application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1472/2006 has not yet\nbecome definitive, because, as a result of the annulment of the contested\nRegulation, the anti-dumping duty applicable to them has not yet been\ndefinitively established. At the same time, traders were warned that such a\nduty may be imposed by the publication of the notice of initiation and the\nprovisional Regulation. It is standing case-law of the Union Courts that\noperators cannot acquire legitimate expectations until the Institutions have\nadopted an act closing the administrative procedure, which has become\ndefinitive.[21]\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore the imposition of\nthe anti-dumping duties is not retroactive.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, even if the\nimposition of the duties was retroactive, quod non, the substantive rules of Union\nlaw may apply to the situations existing before their entry into force in so\nfar as it clearly follows from their terms, objectives or general scheme that\nsuch effect must be given to the them[22]. In particular, in case T-180/01 Euroagri\nv Commission[23] it was held that: [A]lthough in general the principle of legal certainty\nprecludes a Community measure from taking effect from a point in time before\nits publication, it may exceptionally be otherwise where the purpose to be\nachieved so demands and where the legitimate expectations of those concerned\nare duly respected [24].\n\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe present case the purpose is to comply with the\nobligation of the Institutions pursuant to Article 266 TFEU. Since the Court\nonly found an illegality with regards to the determination of the applicable\nduty rate, and not with regards to the imposition of the measures themselves\n(that is, with regards to the finding of dumping, injury and Union interest), the\nexporting producers concerned could not have legitimately expected that no definitive\nanti-dumping measures would be imposed. Consequently, that imposition, even if\nit was retroactive, quod non, cannot be construed as breaching legitimate\nexpectations.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nright to effective judicial remedy is not violated either. The exporting\nproducers concerned can contest the legality of the present Regulation in the\nUnion Courts.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nregards the fifth argument, it has to be noted that the exporting producers\nconcerned are in a different legal position than the other non-sampled\ncompanies which have filed a request for MET but which have not challenged the\ncontested Regulation in the Court. With regards to the latter, the contested\nRegulation has become definitive.\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally,\nif the Institutions were not to propose any measures, this would lead to unjust\nenrichment, for the reasons explained above in recital (39). The argument that\nthe annulled duties never existed because the judgement removes the contested\nRegulation with retroactive effect from the legal order of the Union overlooks\nthe fact that traders were warned of the risk of an imposition of duties by the\nnotice of initiation and the provisional Regulation, and that pricing decisions\nfor the products produced by the exporting producers concerned were taken at a\npoint in time when the definitive duty was in place. In the case-law of the\nCourt of Justice, it is recognized that the repayment of charges which have\nbeen unduly levied may be refused where doing so would entail unjust enrichment\nof the recipients.[25] The argument of the parties is therefore dismissed.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of interested\nparties after disclosure \n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After disclosure, some\ninterested parties reiterated that the Court had annulled the Regulation in its\nentirety as regards the exporting producers concerned. They took the view that\nthe Institutions were obliged, on the basis of Article 266 TFEU, to repay anti-dumping\nduties collected on the basis of the contested Regulation, insofar as they\nconcerned products produced by the exporting producers concerned, and that the\nInstitutions had the possibility, but not the obligation, to adopt a new act,\nprovided that the new act does not violate Union law and is not affected by the\nsame irregularities as those identified by the Court in its judgement.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the\nrepayment of the anti-dumping duties, the Commission services have instructed national\ncustoms authorities by note of 31 Mai 2012 to honour such requests for\nrepayment, but to inform importers at the same time that it cannot be ruled out\nthat the Commission may propose to the Council to re-impose duties on the\nrelevant importations. That information had the express purpose of avoiding the\ncreation of legitimate expectations.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the adoption\nof a new act replacing the annulled act, it is recalled that in the context of\nadministrative procedures such as anti-dumping procedures, the Institutions are\nunder an obligation to close an open investigation by a definitive act (see\nabove recitals (9), (10) and (53)). The adoption of a definitive act closing\nthe open procedure is therefore not a possibility, but an obligation on the\nInstitutions. It goes without saying that any new act has to comply with Union\nlaw and remedy the illegality identified by the Court. With regard to\nviolations of Union law, the interested parties argued, first, that there is no\nlegal basis for resuming the investigation at the point where the illegality\noccurred. They point to the fact that the anti-dumping measures on imports of\ncertain footwear with uppers of leather (\u2018footwear\u2019) from the exporters\nconcerned had expired in March 2011. In their view, it is contrary to both Union and WTO law to \u201cresurrect a dead anti-dumping duty\u201d.\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The interested parties\noverlook the fact that as a consequence of the annulment, the anti-dumping\nprocedure which had led to the adoption of the contested Regulation is still\nopen with regard to the exporting producers concerned (see above recitals (9)\nto (11) and (52) to (53). The fact that the measures imposed by Council\nRegulation (EC) No. 1294/2009 had expired in 2011, that is before the Court\nrendered the judgments, is without any importance in that regard. Otherwise,\nthe measures the Institutions are required to take in order to comply with a\nCourt judgement would depend on the duration of the proceedings before the\nUnion Courts. \n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Second, they argue that the\nexporting producers concerned had challenged in the Court not only the\nrejection of the MET claims, but also the finding of dumping. Furthermore, they\nread the judgements as saying that the contested Regulation was annulled not\nbecause the Institutions failed to assess the MET claim prior to the adoption\nof the contested Regulation, but because the Commission failed to do so within\nthree months. In their view, it follows from that that the Institutions had\nalso not validly assessed the MET claims of the sampled companies, and\ntherefore had not validly found dumping. One interested party goes even further\nand suggests that the Institutions should have assessed, when complying with\nthe judgment, also all MET claims made by other, non-sampled companies.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That interpretation of the\njudgement has been rebutted above in recitals (49) to (51) . The reference to\nthe three-month deadline in the judgements is a textual argument to show that\nall MET claims have to be assessed, even in case of sampling. Nowhere in the\njudgments does the Court overturn the earlier case-law on the lack of sanction\nfor the violation of the three-month deadline. The fact that the Court\nexercised judicial economy by not examining six of the nine pleas against the\njudgements of the General Court means that the exporting producers concerned\nmay raise those pleas again in case they decide to bring new proceedings. The\nCommission and the Council can rely, when complying with the judgments, on the\nfindings of the General Court rejecting those arguments, as they have not been\ninvalidated by the Court. Finally, there is no need to examine the MET claims\nof other non-sampled companies at this point in time, as the contested\nRegulation has become definitive vis-\u00e0-vis those other non-sampled companies.\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Third, interested parties\nargued that the Institutions deviated from their normal practice of complying\nwith judgments annulling definitive anti-dumping measures, including what the\nInstitutions had done following the judgment of the Court in Industrie des\nPoudres Spheriques (\u2018IPS\u2019)[26].\nThey point out in particular that the Commission published notices of\nre-opening of the investigation in the Official Journal and proposed new\nmeasures to the Council to be adopted for the future.\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The facts of the present\ncase are, however, different from previous annulments. As explained above in\nrecital (38) and (61), the illegality identified by the Court does not concern\nthe findings on dumping, injury, and Union interest, and therefore the\nprinciple of the imposition of the duty, but only the precise duty rate. The\nprevious annulments relied on by the interested parties, on the contrary,\nconcerned the findings on dumping, injury and Union interest. The institutions\ntherefore considered it more appropriate to adopt new measures for the future.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party also\nrelies on the annulments in Case T-221/05 Huvis v Council and in Case T-249/06\nInterpipe Nikopolsky v Council. Those annulments were partial; they left part\nof the duty in place. The reason was that the General Court could decide itself\non the appropriate level of the duty, as it held that an adjustment had to be\ndone in a certain way. In the present case, on the contrary, the Court found\nthat it could not decide on the place of the Commission and the Council whether\nthe exporting producers concerned should be granted MET. That decision could\nonly be taken on the basis of an assessment of their claims, which falls within\nthe competence of the Commission and the Council. The fact that the Court did\nnot rule itself on the question as to whether or not the exporting producers\nconcerned should be granted MET also shows that the violation of the three\nmonth deadline does not automatically lead to granting of MET, as certain\ninterested parties claim. \n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fourth, interested parties\nalso reiterated that the imposition of anti-dumping duties on footwear imports\nfrom the exporting concerned would be retroactive and therefore violate Article\n10 of the basic Regulation and Article 10 of ADA. They argued that the allegedly\nretroactive imposition would also violate legitimate expectations. Those\nlegitimate expectations would have been created by the judgements respectively\nby the fact that the Commission deviated from its previous practice by\npublishing a notice on the resumption of the procedure in the Official Journal\nnot immediately after the annulments, but only more than a year after the first\njudgement had been handed down. Furthermore, they argue that the general principle\nof the Union\u2019s law of the protection of legal certainty precludes a Union act\nfrom taking effect as from a date prior its publication. \n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It has been explained in\nrecitals (54) to (59) that the imposition of anti-dumping duties in the present\nRegulation is not retroactive.\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judgments cannot have\ncreated legitimate expectations, as they explain that the Commission and the\nCouncil need to establish at which rate the duty shall be set (see above\nrecital (7)).\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regards to the notice,\nthe Institutions observe first of all, that there is no obligation to publish\nsuch a notice in the first place, as the Institutions resume the procedure from\nthe point at which the illegality occurred, and the Notice of initiation remains\npart of the Union legal order. Secondly, the alleged legitimate expectations\nwould be based on a period of silence. However, according to the case-law, the\nabsence of an action of the Institutions cannot create legitimate expectations[27]. In any event, the\nallegedly late publication in the Official Journal did not constitute a notice\non the resumption of the procedure, but a notice inviting interesting parties\nto come forward. It has been published for the reasons set out above in recital\n(14), and cannot create legitimate expectations either.\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regards to the general\nprinciple of the Union\u2019s law of the protection of legal certainty, it has been\nset out above in recital (60) that a Union measure may take effect from a point\nin time before its publication where the purpose to be achieved so demands and\nwhere the legitimate expectations of those concerned are duly respected, which\nis the case in the present case.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fifth, interested parties also\nreiterated their argument on the absence of \u2018unjust enrichment of the\nimporters\u2019, which has been rebutted above in recital (64). \n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sixth, interested parties\nalso argued that the proposed implementation would violate the Union interest\nprinciple as laid down in Article 21 of the basic Regulation since the\nimposition of duties would be an unreasonable burden on importers in the Union without providing any benefit for the Union industry as a whole. That argument\noverlooks that the present Regulation concerns imports of the product concerned\nthat have taken place during the period of application of the contested\nRegulation, and not future imports. With regard to those imports during the\nperiod of application of the contested Regulation, the Institutions have\nestablished the Union interest in recitals (241) to (286) of the contested\nRegulation. No illegality has been identified by the Union Courts with regard\nto those recitals.\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seventh, interested parties\nalso argued that not all interested parties had been able to defend their\nrights, but only those that could prove that they had been registered as such\nin the original investigation. In their view, the proposed duties will have an\nimpact also on companies that were not registered as interested parties in the\noriginal investigation. In addition, they argued that the Institutions did not\npublish any notice immediately upon the Court judgment and that therefore they\nhad been no information concerning the intended implementation in time.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the Institutions have\nresumed the procedure at the point in time where the illegality occurred, it is\nnormal that the Institutions have addressed the Notice to those parties that\nare interested parties in that procedure. In addition, nothing prevented other\ninterested parties to come forward, and some have indeed done so and where\nconsidered as interested parties from the point in time onwards in which they\ncame forward. The fact that the Notice was published only more than a year\nafter the first of the two judgments was rendered is without impact on the\nlegality of the present Regulation, as all interested parties were informed in\ntime to make their views known. \n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eighth, the exporting\nproducers concerned have argued that their rights of defence were violated due\nto the fact that the Commission has assessed their MET claims only in\n2012/2013, and not in 2005/2006. They claim that had that assessment taken\nplace in 2005/2006, they could have provided certain information which they\ncannot longer provide, because documents have been destroyed and/or because\npeople have moved to other jobs.\n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In that regard, it is\nrecalled that there is no obligation, for the Commission, to request the\nexporting producer to complement the MET claim. The Commission and the Council\nmay base their assessment on the information submitted by the exporting\nproducer (see above recitals (21), (22) and (31)). Furthermore, the exporting\nproducers concerned have not contested the assessment of their MET claims by\nthe Commission, and they have not identified which documents or which people\nthey have no longer been able to rely upon. The allegation is therefore so\nabstract that the Institutions cannot take into account those difficulties when\ncarrying out the assessment of the MET claims. As that argument is based on\nspeculation and not supported by precise indications as to which documents and\nwhich people are no longer available and as to what the relevance of those\ndocuments and people for the assessment of the MET claim is, that argument has\nto be rebutted.\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The interested parties\nargued that the proposed implementation would violate Article II (1)(b) of GATT\n1994 since the Institutions proposed imposing retroactively an anti-dumping\nduty on footwear imports from the exporters concerned for which the\nanti-dumping measures had already expired. In addition, the interested parties\nargued that, since there are no legally applicable anti-dumping measures in\nplace on the imports concerned, the proposed implementation is in violation of\nArticles 10, 5.1 and 5.6 of ADA. Under these Articles, the Institutions may\nre-impose definitive anti-dumping duties following the initiation of a new\ninvestigation and a new decision in the sense of ADA Article 9.1.\n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those arguments rest on the\nview that the Institutions were prevented from resuming the procedure at the\npoint at which the illegality occurred and that the imposition of duties would\nbe retroactive. For the reasons set out above, that view is wrong. It is\ntherefore not necessary to address in more detail the arguments put forward on\nan alleged violation of WTO rules. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 221 of the\nCommunity Customs Code\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 221 of Council\nRegulation (EEC) 2913/1992 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community\nCustoms Code[28]\nstipulates that communication of the amount of duty shall not take place after\nthe expiry of a period of three years from the date on which the customs debt\nwas incurred. The application may render impossible the implementation of the\njudgments in all cases where national customs authorities and/or judges have\naccepted the illegality of national customs communications that were based on\nthe contested Regulation and concerned products produced by the exporting\nproducers concerned. In such situations, the national customs authorities must\nbe in a position to communicate the amount of duty later than three years from\nthe date on which the customs debt was incurred.\n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contrary to the view held\nby interested parties, Article 221 of the Community Customs Code is not\nautomatically applicable to the perception of anti-dumping duties. Neither the\nCommunity Customs Code itself nor the basic Regulation contains a provision\nthat would render applicable the Community Customs Code to the perception of\nanti-dumping duties. Pursuant to Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation, it is\nthe Regulation imposing the duty which has to specify form, rate and other\ncriteria of the perception of the duties.\n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the present\nRegulation does not provide for the applicability of Article 221 of the\nCommunity Customs Code, but sets out independent rules for time bar. Those\nindependent rules are justified as follows: for the reasons set out above in\nrecitals (54) to (59) and (66), the proposed re-imposition of duties does not\nhave retroactive effect, and in any event, for the reasons set out above in\nrecitals (60) and (61) and (76) to (80), does not run counter the general\nprinciples of Union law of the protection of legal certainty and legitimate\nexpectations.\n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, an initial\ncommunication of the amount of duty did take place within the three-year period.\nFollowing the judgments, it has however become necessary to re-assess whether\nthe customs debt should be reduced as a consequence of the assessment of the\nMET claims of the exporting producers concerned. As there was, pending that\nassessment, no legal ground for keeping the customs duty paid, the Commission\nhad instructed national customs authorities to honour such requests for\nrepayment, but to inform importers at the same time that it cannot be ruled out\nthat the Commission may propose to the Council to re-impose duties on the\nrelevant importations (see above recital (66)).\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For those reasons, \u00a0independent\nrules on time bar, different from Article 221 of the Community Customs Code, are\njustified.\n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless,\nin order to ensure legal certainty and to reflect the particular circumstances\nof the present case, it is considered appropriate to provide that communication\nto the debtor of the amount of duty shall take place no later than two years\nafter the entry into force of the present Regulation.\n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties argued\nthat the Institutions cannot derogate from Article 221 of the Community Customs\nCode on the basis of Article 14(3) of the basic Regulation. They consider that the\nbasic Regulation only confers competence to impose anti-dumping duties, but not\nto edict rules on the collection and recovery of anti-dumping duties. Those\nlatter rules would have to be set exclusively by the Community Customs Code. They\nrely on the ruling of the Court in Case C-201/04 Molenbergnatie. Interested\nparties also argued that an implementing act such as Council Regulations imposing\nanti-dumping measures cannot derogate from legislative acts such as the\nCommunity Customs Code. Finally, parties argued that derogating from Article\n221 of the CCC would undermine legal certainty since it is settled case law\nthat upon expiry of the limitation period the legally owed duty is no longer\nrecoverable.\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As set out above in recital\n(88), the Community Customs Code is not automatically applicable to the\nperception of anti-dumping duties, but only where and to the extent that the\nRegulation imposing the duties provides for its applicability. The argument has\nto be rejected as unfounded for that reason. In any event, Article 14 of the\nbasic Regulation, which is a legislative act that constitutes a lex\nspecialis to the Community Customs Code, confers wide-ranging powers to the\nCouncil to deviate from the Community Customs Code. Pursuant to Article 14 (1)\nof the basic Regulation Member States shall collect the duties in the form, at\nthe rate specified and according to the other criteria laid down in the\nRegulation imposing such duties. Contrary to the view expressed by interested\nparties, Article 14 of the basic Regulation covers also the collection of\nduties, and not only the imposition. Article 14 (3) of the basic Regulation provides\nthat the Council may adopt \u201cspecial provisions\u201d; the example given of a common\ndefinition of the concept of origin illustrates that such special provisions\nmay derogate, inter alia, from the Community Customs Code. In Molenbergnatie,\nArticle 221 of the Community Customs Code was applicable precisely because the\nRegulation imposing anti-dumping duties did not derogate from it. Furthermore,\nit is obvious that any derogation has to be justified by the Institutions, and\nneeds to preserve the spirit underlying Article 221 of the Community Customs\nCode, namely legal certainty, as is the case in the present Regulation. The\narguments are therefore rebutted.\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat the two-year deadline for the communication to the debtor of the duty\namount, mentioned in recital (92) above, should be applied in the context of\nArticle 221(3) 2nd sentence of the Community Customs Code, which\nforesees an extension of the three year period to collect the duty by the\nCustoms authorities in case of criminal behaviour. Furthermore, the interested\nparty argued that the same extension should be applied to the three year\ndeadline foreseen for the importers to request duty refunds under Article 236 of\nthe Customs Code. The Institutions see no ground for acceding to those\nrequests. The exception to the three-year rule provided for by Article 221(3) 2nd\nsentence of the Community Customs Code is not broad enough to allow for the\neffective compliance with the judgments. There is no justification for\nextending the deadline for importers that have imported the product concerned\nfrom the exporting producers concerned and failed to contest their customs debt\nin time.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Account taken of the comments\nmade and the analysis thereof it was concluded that the residual anti-dumping\nduty applicable to the PRC in respect of the exporting producers concerned for\nthe period of application of the contested Regulation should be re-imposed. \n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As explained in recital (40)\nno changes are required to Council Regulation (EC) No 388/2008 and Council\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 1294/2009 which remain valid for the exporting\nproducers concerned.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DISCLOSURE\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exporting producers\nconcerned and all parties that came forward were informed of the essential\nfacts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the\nimposition of the definitive anti-dumping duty on the exporting producers\nconcerned. They were granted a period within which to make representations\nsubsequent to disclosure and a number of interested parties has made use of\nthis possibility. A hearing with the hearing officer has also taken place in\nthat context. \nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A definitive anti-dumping\nduty is hereby imposed on imports of footwear with uppers of leather or\ncomposition leather, excluding sports footwear, footwear involving special\ntechnology, slippers and other indoor footwear and footwear with a protective\ntoecap, originating in the People's Republic of China and produced by Brosmann\nFootwear (HK) Ltd, Seasonable Footwear (Zhongshan) Ltd, Lung Pao Footwear\n(Guangzhou) Ltd, Risen Footwear (HK) Co Ltd and Zhejiang Aokang Shoes Co.
