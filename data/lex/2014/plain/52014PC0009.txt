This Internal Agreement will\r\nonly enter into force after ratification by all the Member States. This process will probably not be concluded before January 2014.\nThe Commission has proposed transitional\r\nmeasures (\u2018Bridging Facility\u2019) to\r\nensure the availability of funds for cooperation with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and\r\nwith Overseas Countries and Territories, as well as for support expenditure, between January 2014 and the entry into\r\nforce of the Internal Agreement establishing the 11th EDF. This\r\nfacility shall be financed from balances and\r\ndecommitted funds of the 10th and previous EDFs. The funds under this Bridging Facility shall be accounted for under the\r\n11th EDF.\nThe Commission has also adopted a proposal\r\nfor a Regulation providing financial rules applicable to the 11th\r\nEDF. This Regulation cannot be adopted by the Council before the entry into\r\nforce of the 11th EDF Internal Agreement or before the adoption by\r\nthe Council of a Decision allowing for a provisional application of some of its\r\nprovisions. In the light of the latest discussions in the Council, it is not\r\nexpected that any of these processes will be concluded before January 2014.\nIt is appropriate that actions supported\r\nunder the Bridging Facility are as soon as possible implemented using the same\r\nrules as those foreseen for the 11th EDF. Therefore, the Commission\r\nproposes that the Council Regulation on the Financial Regulation applicable to\r\nthe 10th EDF be modified in such a way that the financial rules\r\nwhich will apply to the 11th EDF also apply for the financial\r\nmanagement of the Bridging Facility.\nThe Commission therefore proposes to the\r\nCouncil to adopt the attached Regulation in due course, when it can be complemented\r\nby the inclusion in its annex of the substantive provisions of the draft 11th\r\nEDF Financial Regulation, their content having been approved and fixed by the\r\nCouncil in the meantime.\n2014/0003 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n215/2008 of 18 February 2008 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the 10th\r\nEuropean Development Fund for the implementation of the Bridging Facility\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to the Partnership Agreement\r\nbetween the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States of\r\nthe one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other\r\npart, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000[1]\r\n(hereinafter referred to as the Cotonou Agreement),\nHaving regard to the Internal Agreement\r\nbetween the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting\r\nwithin the Council, on the financing of Community aid under the multiannual\r\nfinancial framework for the period 2008 to 2013 in accordance with the ACP-EC\r\nPartnership Agreement and on the allocation of financial assistance for the\r\nOverseas Countries and Territories to which Part Four of the EC Treaty applies[2], and in particular\r\nArticle 10(2) thereof, (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as the Internal Agreement),\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Court\r\nof Auditors[3],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\r\nInvestment Bank, \nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nDecision of [xx/xx/2013] establishes transitional EDF management measures\r\n(Bridging Facility) to ensure the availability of funds for cooperation with\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific countries and with Overseas Countries and\r\nTerritories, as well as for support expenditure, from 1 January 2014 until the\r\nentry into force of the 11th European Fund,\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is\r\nnecessary to modify the implementing rules of the 10th EDF for the operational\r\nand financial management of the transitional measures (\u2018Bridging Facility\u2019)\r\nfinancing the transition period between the 10th and the 11th EDF until the\r\nentry into force of the 11th EDF Internal Agreement and its implementing rules,\r\nin line with the latter, \nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nFor the purpose of implementing the\r\nBridging Facility, the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 215/2008 are\r\nreplaced by those laid down in the Annex of this Regulation.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of\r\nthe European Union.\nIt shall apply from its date of its entry\r\ninto force and until the entry into application of the Financial Regulation of\r\nthe 11th EDF.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nANNEX\n(Pro memoria: Text of the 11th\r\nEDF financial rules to be inserted once fixed).\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 317, 15.12.2000, p. 3.
