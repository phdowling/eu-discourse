This\r\nexemption is meant to give an economic incentive to the use of shore-side\r\nelectricity in order to reduce air pollution in port cities.\nThe aim of the measure to be applied by Sweden is to reduce the environmental impact of maritime transport.\nThe request and its general context\nOn 20 June 2011 the Council adopted Council\r\nImplementing Decision 2011/384/EU authorising Sweden to apply a reduced rate of\r\nelectricity tax to electricity directly provided to vessesl at berth in a port\r\n(\u2018sohre-side electricity\u2019) in accordance with Article 19 of Directive\r\n2003/96/EC ([1]).\r\nThis Decision expires on 25 June 2014.\nBy letter dated 13 December 2013, the\r\nSwedish authorities requested a new authorisation decisioin which will allow Sweden to continue to apply the tax reduction. With the requested measure Sweden wants to\r\ngive an incentive for the use of shore-side electricity which is considered a\r\nless polluting alternative to the generation of electricity on board vessels\r\nlying at berth in a port.\nThe intention of the Swedish authorities is\r\nto continue to apply a reduced rate of SEK 50 (EUR 5.79) ([2]) per MWh of electricity\r\ntax to shore-side electricity. This tax rate is above the minimum rate of\r\ntaxation for electricity as laid down in Directive 2003/96/EC. It is also above\r\nthe national rate of taxation on electricity for business use which is SEK 5\r\n(EUR 0.59) per MWh. However Sweden does not consider that the use of shore-side\r\nelectricity constitutes business use. Thus without the authorisation the\r\napplicable national rates to shore-side electricity would be SEK 293\r\n(EUR 33.94) per MWh or SEK 185 (EUR 21.43) per MWh in Northern Sweden.\nOn the other hand, Article 14(1)(c) of the\r\nEnergy Taxation Directive obliges Member States to exempt energy products used\r\nas fuel by ships for navigation within EU waters. This exemption covers also the\r\nenergy products used to produce electricity on board ships at berth in ports.\r\nMember States may also exempt energy products used by ships for navigation on\r\ninland waterways according to Article 15(1)(f) thereof which also covers the\r\nproduction of electricity on board. Thus in most cases the system of taxation\r\nbased on the Energy Taxation Directive does not affect the costs for producing\r\nelectricity on board a ship at berth in a port even though such production\r\ncould have negative health and environmental effects by deteriorating air\r\nquality and increasing noise levels in ports.\nSweden will apply the\r\nreduced rate of electricity taxation to all supplies of shore-side electricity\r\nof at least 380 V to vessels used for commercial shipping of at least 400\r\ngross tonnage. The limit is considered appropriate by the Swedish authorities so\r\nas to ensure that the absolute majority of vessels used in international\r\ntraffic and larger vessels used in national traffic will be covered by the\r\nproposed reduction. These are the vessels considered to be responsible for the\r\nlargest part of emissions caused by the running of auxiliary motors on board\r\nwhile berthed in ports.\nThe Swedish authorities acknowledge that\r\nthe measure constitutes state aid and that it favours owners of ships used for\r\ncommercial shipping. They also claim that it is neutral with respect to\r\ncompetition between ship owners or operators since it is available to all ships\r\n(except ships for private use) at berth in Swedish ports independently of their\r\nflag. As regards the effect on trade between Member States, Sweden assumes that the effect will be negligible as the choice of ports depends on the cargo's\r\ndestination rather than on the reduced costs of berthing caused by the tax\r\nreduction for shore-side electricity.\nSweden requested\r\nthe authorisation to be granted for a period of six years, which is the maximum\r\nperiod indicated in Article 19(2) of the Directive.\nSweden considers\r\nthat this measure is in line with Commission recommendation 2006/339/EC on the\r\npromotion of shore-side electricity for use by ships at berth in Community\r\nports ([3])\r\nand with the Commission Communication Strategic goals and recommendations for\r\nthe EU's maritime transport policy until 2018 ([4]). In this regard, it is\r\nnoted that from June 2011 on, Member States have an unconditional obligation to\r\nmeet air quality standards for relevant pollutants like particulate matter ([5]). This obligation\r\nrequires them to find solutions to problems such as ship emissions at berth in\r\nports where this is relevant and it is conceivable that in ports with these\r\nproblems the use of shore-side electricity will be encouraged as one element of\r\nthe overall air quality strategy.\nWith the tax reduction Sweden wants to continue to provide an incentive for vessel operators to use shore-side\r\nelectricity in order to reduce airborne emissions and noise from vessels at\r\nberth as well as CO2 emissions. The application of a reduced tax\r\nrate would strengthen the competitiveness of shore-side electricity relative to\r\nthe burning of bunker fuels on board, which is fully tax exempt. The Swedish\r\nauthorities informed the Commission that since the measure has been in\r\napplication additional shore-side electricity facilities have been built and\r\nthe number of Swedish ports who have such facilities has increased from five to\r\neight (Stockholm, Gothenburg, Pite\u00e5, Helsingborg, Lule\u00e5, Karlskrona, Trelleborg\r\nand Ystad) and that at present plans for the construction of additional\r\nfacilities in the port of Stockholm are in place. The Swedish authorities\r\ninformed the Commission that vessels used by the forestry sector are the most\r\nintensive users of shore-side electricity facilities. Ports serving this\r\nindustry have the highest share of use of shore-side electricity. The\r\nfacilities are normally used in cases where vessels are berthed for longer\r\nperiods. The share of vessels using shore-side electricity facilities differs\r\nbetween ports (from 33 to almost 100 %) depending on the port and the type\r\nof vessels using it. According to the information provided by Sweden the use of shore-side electricity has led to emission reductions of sulphur dioxide,\r\nnitric oxides, particulate matter and carbon oxides. However the Swedish\r\nauthorities do not have precise estimates of the emission reductions which can\r\nbe attributed to the application of the measure.\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nCouncil Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October\r\n2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products\r\nand electricity, in particular Articles 14(1)(c) and 15(1)(f).\nAssessment of the measure under\r\nArticle 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\nSpecific policy considerations\nArticle 19(1), first subparagraph, of the\r\nDirective reads as follows: \n\u2018In addition to the provisions set out in\r\nthe previous Articles, in particular in Articles 5, 15 and 17, the Council,\r\nacting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member\r\nState to introduce further exemptions or reductions for specific policy considerations.\u2019\nBy means of the tax reduction in question\r\nthe Swedish authorities pursue the objective to promote an environmentally less\r\nharmful way for ships to satisfy their electricity needs while lying at berth\r\nin ports and thereby to improve local air quality. As Sweden has pointed out,\r\nthe Commission has in fact already recommended the use of shore-side\r\nelectricity as an alternative to the generation of electricity on board the\r\nvessels at berth and thereby recognised its environmental advantages ([6]). Without the measure\r\nelectricity supplied to vessels at berth would be taxed at SEK 293\r\n(EUR 33.94) per MWh or SEK 185 (EUR 21.43) per MWh in Northern Sweden. The requested exemption would thus lead to an additional incentive for the\r\nuse of this technology equal to SEK 243 or EUR 28.15 per MWh (SEK 135\r\nor EUR 15.64 per MWh in Northern Sweden) and therefore contribute to the\r\nstated policy objective. \nThe Commission also notes that since the\r\nmeasure has been in application Sweden has further developed its on-shore\r\ninfrastructure. The tax reduction seems to have been an effective incentive for\r\na more widespread use of shore-side electricity. The Swedish authorities\r\ninformed the Commission that they had requested or obliged some of the ports to\r\nintroduce shore-side electricity facilities. However Sweden did not report on the\r\nintroduction of any legal obligations or financial incentives for the use of\r\nthe facilities. There is interest in the development of the infrastructure\r\nexpressed in particular by the forestry sector as part of its efforts to\r\nachieve more environmentally friendly transport. At the current state of\r\ndevelopment of shore-side electricity in Sweden the Commission considers that\r\nthe application of a significantly reduced tax rate remains an adequate instrument\r\nto stimulate port authorities and ship owners alike to further invest in the\r\ntechnology also taking into consideration the lack of other specific national\r\nmeasures incentivising the use of shore-side electricity.\nAs regards the nature of the policy objective\r\npursued the Commission would point out that the promotion of shore-side\r\nelectricity is in fact a common policy objective that should be pursued by the Union as a whole. This is stated clearly in the Commission Communication on an integrated\r\nmaritime policy ([7])\r\nand the accompanying Commission staff working document ([8]). The Commission\r\nsuggested shore-side electricity provided to ships while at berth in ports to\r\nbe exempted from energy taxation in its proposal for revision of the Energy\r\nTaxation Directive ([9]).\nHowever at present the Commission proposal\r\nis not yet adopted by the Council. In the meantime economic operators in Sweden and the Swedish authorities should be provided with legal certainty as regards the\r\ntax measures applied for the purpose of promoting the use of shore-side\r\nelectricity. Currently the only possibility to introduce a favourable tax\r\ntreatment to shore-side electricity is provided by Article 19. However its\r\npurpose is to react to specific circumstances in individual Member States that\r\nare not reflected in the Directive itself. A derogation on the basis of Article\r\n19 which pursues the policy objective of promoting shore-side electricity can\r\ntherefore only be granted as a transitional measure before this objective has\r\nbeen addressed by the Council in the context of a revision of Directive\r\n2003/96/EC.\nConsistency with the other policies\r\nand objectives of the Union\nThe requested measure concerns mainly the\r\nEU's environmental policy. To the extent that it will help to reduce the\r\nburning of bunker fuels on board the vessels in ports the measure will in fact\r\ncontribute to the objective of improving local air quality. The measure is also\r\nlikely to lead to a reduction of CO2 emissions to the extent that\r\nthe electricity mix from the onshore grid is less carbon intensive than the\r\nelectricity produced on board by burning bunker fuels, due to higher system\r\nefficiency and the difference in input fuels used. In this context it can be\r\nnoted that the average electricity mix in the relevant market area is\r\nconsiderably less carbon-intensive than the EU average. Although the carbon\r\nintensity of additional electricity supplied is usually higher than the one of\r\nthe average electricity mix and highly dependent on the time of day when the\r\nadditional demand occurs, CO2 reductions resulting from the measure should\r\nremain relatively significant ([10]).\r\n\nThe measure is in line with the Commission\r\nproposal for a directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure\r\nwhich addresses the issue of installing shore-side electricity supply\r\nfacilities in ports where this is cost-effective and has environmental\r\nbenefits ([11]).\nIt has to be recalled at this point that\r\none important reason for the unfavourable competitive position of shore-side\r\nelectricity lies in the fact that the alternative, i.e. electricity produced on\r\nboard the vessels while in maritime ports, currently enjoys a full net tax\r\nexemption: not only is the bunker fuel burnt for generating the electricity\r\nexempt from taxation, which corresponds to the normal position under Article\r\n14(1)(a) of Directive 2003/96/EC, but also the electricity produced on board\r\nthe vessels is itself exempt (cf. Article 14(1)(c) of Directive 2003/96/EC).\r\nAlthough the latter exemption could as such be considered difficult to reconcile\r\nwith the environmental objectives of the Union, it mirrors considerations of\r\npracticability. In fact, taxation of the electricity produced on board would\r\nrequire a declaration by the ship owner - often established in a third country\r\n- or operator of the amount of electricity consumed. The declaration would\r\nfurthermore have to determine the share of the electricity consumed in the\r\nterritorial waters of the Member State where the tax is due. It would create a\r\nhuge administrative burden for ship-owners to have to make such declarations\r\nfor every Member States whose territorial waters are concerned. Under these\r\ncircumstances it can be justified not to penalize the less-polluting\r\nalternative of shore-side electricity by allowing Sweden to apply a reduced rate\r\nof taxation.\nAs regards electricity consumed by vessels\r\nat berth in ports along inland waterways, and contrary to the situation\r\nobtaining in maritime ports, exemption of the electricity produced on board is\r\nmerely optional for Member States (Article 15(1)(f)). Therefore, no legal\r\nobstacle would prevent Member States from treating equally shore-side\r\nelectricity and on-board generation in ports along inland waterways. However,\r\nthe option offered by Article 15(1)(f) of the Directive not to tax electricity\r\ngenerated on board is again to be explained by considerations of practicability\r\non the part of the legislator and at the same time closely linked to the\r\noptional tax advantages for the purposes of navigation on inland waterways. The\r\nmajority of Member States, among which Sweden, have decided not to tax fuels\r\nused for these purposes. They also consider it impractical to tax the input\r\nfuel instead of taxing the electricity (cf. Article 21(5), third subparagraph,\r\nof Directive 2003/96/EC) because this would suppose, at the very least, a\r\nseparate treatment of the fuel used for the generation of electricity. In fact,\r\nin deciding whether to extend the tax exemption applicable to maritime shipping\r\nto fuels used for navigation on inland waterways, Member States will take into\r\nconsideration a number of aspects, including wider objectives of national\r\ntransport policy such as environmental considerations, which may lead them not\r\nto tax fuels used for these purposes. \nIt is therefore considered justified, at\r\nthe present stage, to extend the possibility to apply a reduced level of\r\ntaxation to shore-side electricity to ports in inland waterways.\nInternal market and fair competition\nThe Commission has not received any\r\ncomplaints regarding the practical application of the tax measure authorised by\r\nCouncil Implementing Decision 2011/384/EU. From the point of view of the\r\ninternal market and fair competition the measure only reduces the existing tax distortion\r\nbetween two competing sources of electricity for boats at berth, i.e. on board\r\ngeneration and shore-side electricity, caused by the tax exemption for bunker\r\nfuels.\nAs regards competition between vessel\r\noperators the Swedish authorities have not provided information on considerable\r\nincreases of the number of vessels equipped for the use of shore-side\r\nelectricity. It should be noted that according to their calculations the cost\r\nof using shore-side electricity remains relatively high compared to on-board\r\ngeneration with the use of tax exempted bunker fuels. In particular the costs\r\nfor ship owners include grid charges and investment costs for on-board equipment.\r\nAlthough precise cost projections depend crucially on the development of the\r\noil price and are therefore very difficult, the latest available assessments indicate\r\nthat overall even a full tax exemption would in most cases not reduce\r\noperational costs of shore-side electricity below the costs of on-board\r\ngeneration ([12])\r\nand would therefore not, in any event, represent a significant competitive\r\nbenefit on vessel operators using shore-side electricity as opposed to those\r\nusing on-board generation. In the present case, a significant distortion of the\r\nabove mentioned kind has not taken place with the application of Council\r\nImplementing Decision 2011/384/EU and it is unlikely to emerge since Sweden intends to continue to respect the minimum level of taxation prescribed by the\r\nEnergy Taxation Directive. Furthermore, Sweden intends to keep the limit for the\r\ntax advantage to vessels with a gross tonnage of at least 400 as well as to\r\nsupplies of shore-side electricity of at least 380 volts in order to target the\r\nmeasure to those vessels with significant on-board generation while limiting\r\nthe overall number of beneficiaries. As explained by the Swedish authorities,\r\nboth threshold values have been set at a relatively low level in response to\r\nconcerns by national associations that otherwise national vessels might be\r\ndisadvantaged as against non-Swedish ones. Conversely, it can reasonably be\r\nassumed that vessels that might be excluded from the tax benefit through the\r\nthreshold values will rather be national than from other EU countries and that\r\nthe threshold values will therefore in any case not lead to a more advantageous\r\ntax treatment of national economic actors over their competitors from other EU\r\nMember States.\nConcerning competition between ports, the\r\nSwedish authorities reported that they have not observed considerable changes\r\nin the ship owners' choice of ports which can be linked to the availability of\r\nshore-side electricity facilities. They consider as negligible any potential\r\nimpact on trade between Member States which could result if vessels alter their\r\nroutes because of the possibility to consume shore-side electricity at a\r\nreduced tax rate. In a situation where, as stated above, the use of shore-side\r\nelectricity is, at least in the short term, unlikely to become more economically\r\nfeasible than on-board generation in spite of the tax reduction, this tax\r\nreduction for shore-side electricity is also unlikely to significantly distort\r\ncompetition between ports by inducing vessels to change their itinerary\r\naccording to the availability of this option.\nThe timeframe for which it is proposed to\r\nauthorize the application of a reduced tax rate reflects to a large extent the timeframe\r\nin the Commission proposal of eight years for the tax exemption for shore-side\r\nelectricity.\nPeriod of application of the measure\r\nand development of the EU framework on Energy Taxation\nIn principle, the period of application of\r\nthe derogation should be long enough in order not to discourage port operators\r\nfrom making the necessary investments. In this particular case the period of\r\napplication of the measure would have been prolonged and the scale of the tax\r\nreduction increased by the Commission proposal for revision of the Energy\r\nTaxation Directive which envisages an obligatory exemption for shore-side\r\nelectricity for a period of eight years after its entry into effect. Still the\r\nderogation should not undermine future developments of the existing legal\r\nframework and should take into account the possible adoption by the Council of\r\na legal act based on the Commission proposal for amendment of the Energy\r\nTaxation Directive. Under these circumstances, it appears appropriate to grant\r\nthe authorisation requested for the maximum period of six years allowed by the\r\nDirective, subject however to the entry into application of general provisions\r\nin the matter, at a point in time earlier than the expiry thus foreseen. This\r\nperiod of time will provide legal certainty to ship and port operators which\r\nhave to plan their investments in shore-side electricity facilities or on-board\r\nequipment. It will also allow the Swedish authorities to collect data in order\r\nto fully assess the effect of the measure.\nState aid rules\nOn the basis of the relevant exchange rate\r\nof 1 October 2013 as published in the Official Journal of the European Union ([13]), the reduced tax rate\r\nof SEK 50 per MWh envisaged by the Swedish authorities is above the EU minimum level of taxation\r\npursuant to Article 10 of Directive 2003/96/EC. The\r\nmeasure thus fulfils one of the conditions laid down in Article 44 of\r\nCommission Regulation 651/2014/EU ([14]),\r\nwhich stipulates the conditions under which such a measure is exempted from the\r\nState aid notification requirements. However it cannot be established at this\r\nstage whether all the conditions set in Article 44 are fulfilled and the\r\nproposal for a Council Implementing Decision does not prevent the Commission\r\nfrom requiring from Sweden to comply with State aid rules.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nThis proposal is based on a request made by\r\n Sweden and concerns only this Member State.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThis proposal concerns an authorisation for\r\nan individual Member State upon its own request.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposal aims at authorising Sweden to derogate from the general provisions of Council Directive 2003/96/EC and to apply\r\na reduced rate of SEK 50 (EUR 5.79) per MWh electricity tax to\r\nelectricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port.\nLegal basis\nArticle 19 of Council Directive 2003/96/EC.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe field of indirect taxation covered by\r\nArticle 113 TFEU is not in itself within the exclusive competence of the\r\nEuropean Union within the meaning of Article 3 TFEU.\nHowever, the exercise by Member States of\r\ntheir competences in this field is strictly circumscribed and limited by\r\nexisting EU law. Pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC, only the\r\nCouncil is empowered to authorise a Member State to introduce further\r\nexemptions or reductions within the meaning of that provision. Member States\r\ncannot substitute themselves for the Council. \nThe proposal therefore respects the\r\nprinciple of subsidiarity.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal respects the principle of\r\nproportionality. The tax reduction does not exceed what is necessary to attain\r\nthe objective in question (cf. the considerations on the Internal market and\r\nfair competition aspects, above).\nChoice of instruments\nInstrument(s) proposed: Council\r\nImplementing Decision.\nArticle 19 of Directive 2003/96 makes\r\nprovision for this type of measure only.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe measure does not impose any financial\r\nor administrative burden on the Union. The proposal therefore has no impact on\r\nthe budget of the Union.\n2014/0230 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nauthorising Sweden to apply a reduced rate\r\nof taxation on electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port\u00a0 in\r\naccordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive 2003/96/EC\r\nof 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of\r\nenergy products and electricity ([15]),\r\nand in particular Article 19 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Implementing Decision\r\n2011/384/EU ([16])\r\nSweden was authorised to apply a reduced rate of taxation to electricity\r\ndirectly provided to vessels at berth in a port (\u2018shore-side electricity\u2019) in\r\naccordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC until 25 June 2014.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter of 13 December\r\n2013, Sweden sought the authorisation to continue to apply a reduced rate of\r\nelectricity tax to shore-side electricity pursuant to Article 19 of Directive\r\n2003/96/EC.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the tax reduction it\r\nintends to apply, Sweden aims at continuing the promotion of a more widespread\r\nuse of shore-side electricity as an environmentally less harmful way for ships\r\nto satisfy their electricity needs while lying at berth in ports as compared to\r\nthe burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as the use of\r\nshore-side electricity avoids emissions of air pollutants associated with the\r\nburning of bunker fuels on board the vessels at berth, it contributes to an\r\nimprovement of local air quality in port cities. Under the specific conditions of\r\nthe electricity generation structure in the region concerned, i.e. the Nordic\r\nelectricity market including Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway, the use of electricity from the onshore grid instead of electricity generated by\r\nburning bunker fuels on board is furthermore expected to reduce CO2\r\nemissions. The measure is therefore expected to contribute to the\r\nenvironmental, health and climate policy objectives of the Union.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allowing Sweden to apply a reduced rate of electricity taxation to shore-side electricity does not go beyond\r\nwhat is necessary to increase the use of shore-side electricity, since on-board\r\ngeneration will remain the more competitive alternative in most cases. For the\r\nsame reason, and because of the current relatively low degree of market\r\npenetration of the technology, the measure is unlikely to lead to significant\r\ndistortions in competition during its lifetime and will thus not negatively\r\naffect the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from Article\r\n19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC that each authorisation granted under that\r\nprovision must be strictly limited in time. Given the need for a period long\r\nenough to allow for the proper evaluation of the measure, but also the need not\r\nto undermine future developments of the existing legal framework, it is\r\nappropriate to grant the authorisation requested for a period of six years,\r\nsubject however to the entry into application of general provisions in the\r\nmatter, at a point in time earlier than the expiry thus foreseen.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to provide legal\r\ncertainty to port and ship operators and to avoid a potential increase in the\r\nadministrative burden for the distributors and redistributors of electricity\r\nwhich could result from changes to the rate of excise duty levied on shore-side\r\nelectricity, it should be ensured that Sweden can apply the existing specific tax\r\nreduction to which this Decision relates without interruption. The\r\nauthorisation requested should therefore be granted with effect from 26 June\r\n2014, following seamlessly on from the prior arrangements under Council Implementing\r\nDecision 2011/384/EU.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This decision is without\r\nprejudice to the application of the Union rules regarding State aid,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nSweden is hereby\r\nauthorised to apply a reduced rate of electricity taxation to electricity\r\ndirectly supplied to vessels berthed in ports, other than private pleasure\r\ncraft, provided that the minimum levels of taxation pursuant to Article 10 of\r\nDirective 2003/96/EC are respected.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall take effect on the day of its notification.\nIt shall apply from 26 June 2014.\nIt shall expire on 25 June 2020.\nHowever, should the Council, acting on the\r\nbasis of Article 113 TFEU, provide for general rules on tax advantages for\r\nshore-side electricity, this Decision shall cease to apply on the day on which\r\nthose general rules become applicable.\nArticle 3\nThis\r\nDecision is addressed to the Kingdom of Sweden.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n([1])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ\r\nL 170, 30.6.2011, pp. 36\u201337.\n([2])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All\r\ncalculations are based on the exchange rate on 1 October 2013, i.e.\r\nSEK 8.6329 for EUR 1.\r\nCf.
