At the end of the negotiations a new draft\r\nprotocol was initialled by the negotiators on 28 August 2014. The new Protocol\r\ncovers a period of four years from the date of provisional application laid\r\ndown in Article 15, that being the date on which it is signed.\nThe main purpose of the Protocol to the\r\nAgreement is to grant fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the fishing\r\nzone of the Republic of Cape Verde, in accordance with the best scientific\r\nopinions available and the recommendations of the International Commission for\r\nthe Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), where applicable within the limits\r\nof the available surplus. The Commission's negotiating position was based in\r\npart on the results of an ex-post evaluation of the previous Protocol carried\r\nout by external experts.\nThe general aim is to enhance cooperation\r\nbetween the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde, thereby creating a\r\npartnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy\r\nand sound exploitation of fishery resources in the fishing zone of the Republic of   Cape Verde, in the interests of both parties.\nThe Protocol provides for fishing\r\nopportunities in the following categories:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 28 tuna seiners\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 30 surface longliners\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13 pole-and-line tuna vessels.\nThe Commission proposes, on this basis,\r\nthat the Council authorise the signing and provisional application of the new\r\nProtocol.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe interested parties were consulted during\r\nthe evaluation of the Protocol for the period 2011-14. Experts from the Member\r\nStates were also consulted in technical meetings. These consultations led to\r\nthe conclusion that it would be beneficial to maintain a fishing protocol with\r\nthe Republic of Cape Verde.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThis procedure is being initiated in\r\nparallel with the procedures relating to the Council Decision concluding the\r\nProtocol itself, and to the Council Regulation concerning the allocation of the\r\nfishing opportunities between the EU Member States.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe annual financial contribution is EUR\r\n550 000 the first two years and EUR 500 000 the last two years, based on (a) a\r\nreference tonnage of 5 000 tonnes, for which an amount linked to access has\r\nbeen set at EUR 275 000 the first two years and EUR 250 000 the last two\r\nyears, and (b) support for development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the\r\nRepublic of Cape Verde, amounting to EUR 275 000 per year the first two years\r\nand EUR 250 000 per year the last two years. This support meets the\r\nobjectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the needs of the Republic of   Cape Verde in its fight against illegal fishing.\n2014/0328 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, and provisional application of the Protocol setting out the fishing\r\nopportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Fisheries\r\nPartnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 19 December 2006, the\r\nCouncil adopted Regulation (EC) No 2027/2006 on the conclusion of the\r\nFisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of   Cape Verde[1].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council authorised the\r\nCommission to negotiate a new protocol granting European Union vessels fishing\r\nopportunities in the fishing zone in which the Republic of Cape Verde exercises its jurisdiction.

To establish a governance framework\r\nfor fishing activities carried out by EU fishing vessels in third country\r\nwaters (SFAs) (budget line 11.0301)\n1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected result(s) and\r\nimpact\nSpecify the effects\r\nwhich the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\nThe conclusion of the Protocol will help maintain the fishing\r\nopportunities for EU vessels in the Cape Verdean fishing zone.\nThe Protocol will also contribute to better management and\r\nconservation of fishery resources, through financial support (sectoral support)\r\nfor the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner\r\ncountry, in particular to monitor and combat illegal fishing.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\r\nimpact \nSpecify the\r\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nRates of utilisation of fishing opportunities (annual uptake of\r\nfishing authorisations as a percentage of availability under the Protocol);\nGathering and analysing data on catches and the commercial value of\r\nthe Agreement;\nContribution to employment and to added value in the EU and to\r\nstabilising the EU market (in aggregate with other FPAs);\nNumber of technical meetings and meetings of the Joint Committee.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nThe Protocol for the period 2011-14 expired on 31 August 2014. It is\r\nintended that the new Protocol will apply provisionally from the date of its\r\nsignature. To secure continuity of fishing operations, a procedure for adoption\r\nby the Council of a Decision on the signing and provisional application of the\r\nProtocol has been launched in parallel with this procedure.\nThe new Protocol will provide a framework for the fishing activities\r\nof the European fleet in the Cape Verdean fishing zone and will allow European\r\nvessel owners to apply for fishing licences allowing them to fish in Cape Verdean waters. In addition, the new Protocol enhances cooperation between the EU and\r\nthe Republic of Cape Verde, with a view to promoting the development of a\r\nsustainable fisheries policy. It provides, in particular, for vessels to be\r\nmonitored via VMS and for the electronic transmission of catch data. Sectoral\r\nsupport has been strengthened to help the Republic of Cape Verde with its\r\nnational fisheries strategy, including in the fight against IUU fishing.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nAs regards this new Protocol, failure to act by the EU would allow\r\nthe emergence of private agreements which would not guarantee sustainable\r\nfisheries. The European Union also hopes that with this Protocol, the Republic of   Cape Verde will continue to cooperate effectively with the EU particularly as\r\nregards the fight against illegal fishing.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nBased on an analysis of catches under the previous Protocol, the\r\nparties have agreed to maintain the reference tonnage but to reduce the number\r\nof surface longliners (from 35 to 30) and to slightly increase the number of\r\npole-and-line tuna vessels (from 11 to 13) The number of tuna seiners remains\r\nunchanged at 28 vessels. \nGiven that pelagic sharks are among the species caught by the EU\r\nfleet, catches of these species by longline vessels require particular attention.\r\nA strict mechanism will be set up to monitor these fisheries so as to ensure\r\nsustainable exploitation of the resource, and a study will be carried out to\r\nanalyse the condition of sharks and the impact of fishing on local ecosystems.\r\nThis will provide data on the migratory patterns of the species concerned and\r\nhelp identify biologically and environmentally vulnerable zones in Cape Verde and the tropical Atlantic.\nSectoral support has been strengthened taking account of the\r\npriorities of the national fisheries strategy and requirements in terms of\r\nbuilding the capacity of the Cape Verdean fishing authorities.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nFunds paid out under FPAs constitute fungible revenue in the budgets\r\nof the third-country partners. However, allocating some of those funds for\r\nimplementing measures as part of the country\u2019s sectoral policy is a condition\r\nfor the conclusion and monitoring of FPAs. These financial resources are\r\ncompatible with other sources of funding from other providers of international\r\nfunding for carrying out projects and/or programmes at national level in the\r\nfisheries sector.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \nX\r\nProposal/initiative of limited duration \n\u2013     \r\nX\u00a0 Proposal/initiative\r\nin force from the date of signature and for a duration of four years.\n\u2013     \r\nX\u00a0 Financial\r\nimpact from 2015 to 2018\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\r\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\r\nenvisaged \nX Direct management by the Commission\n\u2013     \r\nX By its\r\ndepartments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 by the executive agencies \n\u00a8 Shared management with Member States \n\u00a8 Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation\r\ntasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 international organisations and their agencies (please specify);\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial\r\nRegulation;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the\r\nextent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\r\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic\r\nact.\nComments \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nSpecify frequency\r\nand conditions\nThe Commission (DG MARE, in collaboration with its fisheries\r\ncounsellor in Senegal and the European Union\u2019s Delegation in Dakar) will ensure\r\nregular monitoring of the implementation of this Protocol, particularly as\r\nregards operators\u2019 use of fishing opportunities and catch data. \nThe Fisheries Partnership Agreement provides for at least one annual\r\nmeeting of the Joint Committee, at which the Commission and the Republic of\r\nCape Verde review the implementation of the Agreement and the Protocol thereto\r\nand, if necessary, adjust the programming and, if applicable, the financial\r\ncontribution.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\r\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThere is some risk in setting up a fisheries protocol, particularly\r\nwith regard to the amounts intended to finance the sectoral fisheries policy\r\n(under-programming).\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information concerning the\r\ninternal control system set up\nExtensive dialogue is planned on the programming and implementation\r\nof the sectoral policy.

All technical conservation measures which must be met in order for a\r\nfishing licence to be issued, as specified in Annex 2 to this Protocol, shall\r\napply to all foreign industrial fleets operating in the Cape Verdean fishing zone under technical conditions similar to those applicable to the EU fleets.\n2.                      \r\nDuring the period covered by\r\nthis Protocol, the European Union and the authorities of Cape Verde shall monitor the evolution of captures, the fishing effort and the state of fishery\r\nresources in the Cape Verdean fishing zone with regard to all species covered\r\nby the Protocol. In particular, the parties agree to improve data collection\r\nand analysis, with a view to drawing up a national action plan for the\r\nconservation and management of sharks in the Cape Verdean EEZ.\n3.                      \r\nThe parties shall comply\r\nwith the recommendations and resolutions of the International Commission for\r\nthe Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) regarding the responsible management\r\nof fisheries.\n4.                      \r\nIn accordance with Article 4\r\nof the Fisheries Partnership Agreement and on the basis of ICCAT\r\nrecommendations and resolutions and the best available scientific advice, the\r\nparties shall consult each other within the Joint Committee set up under\r\nArticle 9 of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement before adopting, by mutual\r\nagreement and if necessary after a scientific meeting, any measures aimed at\r\nthe sustainable management of fishery resources affecting the activities of EU\r\nvessels.\n5.                      \r\nCape Verde undertakes to make public any agreement\r\nauthorising vessels flying a foreign flag to fish in waters under Cape Verdean jurisdiction, whilst taking into account any sensitive information such as the\r\nfinancial conditions.\n6.                      \r\nGiven that pelagic sharks\r\nmay be among the species caught by the EU fleet in connection with tuna\r\nfisheries, and in view of the vulnerability of these species as expressed in\r\nICCAT scientific opinions, any catches of the species in question by longline\r\nvessels engaged in fishing under this Protocol require particular attention in\r\nline with the precautionary principle. The parties shall cooperate with a view\r\nto improving the availability and monitoring of scientific data relating to the\r\nspecies caught.\nTo this end,\r\nthe parties shall set up a mechanism for strict monitoring of this fishery in\r\norder to ensure sustainable exploitation of the resource. The monitoring\r\nmechanism shall, in particular, be based on a quarterly exchange of data on\r\nshark catches. If in the course of a year these catches exceed 30% of the\r\nreference tonnage referred to in Article 2(2)(a), reinforced monitoring\r\nbased on a monthly exchange of data and consultation between the parties shall\r\nbe set up. If in the course of a year such catches exceed 40% of the reference\r\ntonnage referred to above, the Joint Committee shall, where appropriate, adopt\r\nfurther management measures setting a more adequate framework for the longliner\r\nfleet's activities.\nFurthermore,\r\nthe parties agree to take account of a study carried out by the European Union\r\nwith the participation of Cape Verdean scientific institutes, aimed at:\n\u2013 analysing the condition of sharks and the\r\nimpact of fishing on local ecosystems;\n\u2013 providing data on the migratory patterns of\r\nshark species;\n\u2013 identifying biologically and ecologically\r\nvulnerable zones in Cape Verde and the tropical Atlantic.\nThe Joint\r\nCommittee may decide to adjust the monitoring mechanism referred to above to\r\ntake account of the results of this study. \nArticle 5\r\nReview of fishing opportunities and technical\r\nmeasures by mutual agreement within the Joint Committee\n1.                      \r\nThe Joint Committee may\r\nreview the fishing opportunities referred to in Article 1 and adjust them by\r\nmutual agreement insofar as ICCAT recommendations and resolutions confirm that\r\nthe adjustment guarantees the sustainable management of the fishery resources\r\ncovered by this Protocol. In this case, the financial contribution referred to\r\nin Article 2(2)(a) shall be adjusted proportionately and pro rata temporis\r\nand the necessary amendments shall be made to this Protocol and to its Annex.\n2.                      \r\nThe Joint Committee may,\r\nwhere necessary, examine and adapt by mutual agreement the provisions governing\r\nthe pursuit of fishing activities and the rules for implementing this Protocol\r\nand the Annexes thereto.\nArticle 6\r\nLanding incentives and promoting cooperation\r\nbetween economic operators\n1.                      \r\nThe parties shall cooperate\r\nwith a view to improving landing options in Cape Verdean ports.\n2.                      \r\nFinancial landing incentives\r\nas specified in the Annex shall be put into place.\n3.                      \r\nThe parties shall endeavour\r\nto create conditions favourable to the promotion of relations between their\r\nenterprises in the technical, economic and commercial spheres, by encouraging\r\nthe establishment of an environment favourable to the development of business\r\nand investment.\nArticle 7\r\nSuspension of the Protocol's implementation\n1.                      \r\nThe implementation of this\r\nProtocol may be suspended at the initiative of one of the parties if one or\r\nmore of the following conditions apply:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 unusual circumstances, as defined in\r\nArticle 7(3)(a) of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, prevent fishing\r\nactivities in the Cape Verdean EEZ;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 significant changes in the formulation\r\nor implementation of the fisheries policy of either one of the parties\r\naffecting the provisions of this Protocol;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 activation of the consultation\r\nmechanisms laid down in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement owing to violation\r\nof one of the essential and fundamental elements of human rights and democratic\r\nprinciples set out in Article 9 of that Agreement;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 non-payment by the European Union of\r\nthe financial contribution provided for in Article 2(2)(a), for reasons other\r\nthan those provided for in Article 8 of this Protocol;\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a serious and unresolved dispute\r\nbetween the parties on the application or interpretation of this Protocol.\n2.                      \r\nWhere the application of the\r\nProtocol is suspended for reasons other than those given in paragraph 1(c)\r\nabove, the party concerned shall be required to notify its intention in writing\r\nat least three months before the date on which suspension is due to take\r\neffect.

For each tuna-fishing vessel and\r\nsurface longliner, the EU shall draw up, on the basis of its catch reporting, a\r\nfinal statement of the fees owed by the vessel in respect of its annual season\r\nfor the previous calendar year. The EU shall send this final statement to Cape Verde and to the vessel owner before 31 July of the year in progress. \nFrom the date the electronic system\r\nprovided for under point 3 becomes operational, the EU shall draw up for each\r\npole-and-line tuna vessel, tuna seiner and surface longliner, on the basis of\r\nthe logbooks archived at the FMC of the flag State, a final statement of the\r\nfees owed by the vessel in respect of its annual season for the previous\r\ncalendar year. The EU shall send this final statement to Cape Verde and to the vessel owner before 31 March of the year in progress. \nIn both cases Cape Verde may, within 30\r\ndays of the day it was sent, contest the final statement on the basis of\r\ndocumentary proof. In the case of disagreement, the parties shall consult each\r\nother in the Joint Committee. If Cape Verde does not object within 30 days, the\r\nfinal statement shall be considered to be adopted.\nWhere the final statement exceeds the\r\nanticipated flat-rate fee paid to obtain the fishing licence, the vessel owner\r\nshall pay the outstanding balance to Cape Verde by 30 September of the year in\r\nprogress. Where the final statement is less than the anticipated flat-rate fee,\r\nthe remaining amount may not be reclaimed by the vessel owner.\nCHAPTER\r\nV\nLANDINGS\r\nAND TRANSHIPMENTS\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notification\nThe master of an EU vessel wishing to land\r\nin a Cape Verdean port, or to tranship catch from the Cape Verdean zone, must\r\nnotify Cape Verde, at least 24 hours before the landing or transhipment, of the\r\nfollowing: \n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the name of the fishing vessel which\r\nis to land or tranship; \n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the port of landing or transhipment; \n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the date and time scheduled for the\r\nlanding or transhipment; \n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the quantity (expressed in kilograms\r\nof live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish) of each species\r\nto be landed or transhipped (identified by its FAO alpha 3 code); \n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in the case of transhipment, the name\r\nof the receiving vessel; \n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the health certificate of the\r\nreceiving vessel.\nAny transhipment operation must be carried\r\nout in the waters of a Cape Verdean port authorised for this purpose.\r\nTranshipment at sea is prohibited. \nNon-compliance with these provisions shall\r\nlead to imposition of the relevant penalties provided for under Cape Verdean legislation. \n2.
