Both the EU and Montenegro signed the Convention on 15 June 2011.\nThe EU and Montenegro deposited their\r\ninstruments of acceptance with the depositary of the Convention on 26 March\r\n2012 and 2 July 2012, respectively. As a consequence, in application of its\r\nArticle 10(3), the Convention entered into force in relation to the EU and Montenegro on 1 May 2012 and on 1 September 2012, respectively.\nArticle 6 of the Convention provides that\r\neach Contracting Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the\r\nConvention is effectively applied. To that effect, the Stabilisation and Association\r\nCouncil established by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the\r\nEuropean Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic\r\nof Montenegro, of the other part[2],\r\nshould adopt a Decision replacing Protocol 3 concerning the definition of the\r\nconcept of 'originating products' and methods of administrative cooperation by\r\na new Protocol which, with regard to the rules of origin, refers to the\r\nConvention.

The Contracting Parties to the Convention were consulted at the meeting\r\nof the Pan-Euro-Med working group of 14 and 15 May 2013.\nNo recourse to external expertise has been\r\nnecessary. Furthermore, it has not been necessary to conduct an impact\r\nassessment, since the proposed amendments are technical in nature and do not\r\naffect the substance of the protocol on rules of origin currently in effect.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the Council Decision is\r\nthe first subparagraph of Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article\r\n218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union.
