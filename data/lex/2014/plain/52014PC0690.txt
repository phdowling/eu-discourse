Since 2013 the Members of the IOC\r\nhave been negotiating the revision of the Agreement. In this context, on 19 November\r\n2013 the Council authorized the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union a new and substantially renewed agreement that takes into\r\naccount economic, technical and commercial developments in the olive sector. \nIn line with the negotiating mandate of the\r\nCouncil, the Union submitted a proposal for the revision of the Agreement to\r\nthe IOC. This proposal covers also provisions pertaining to the expansion of\r\nthe organisation in order to welcome new members, including both exporting and\r\nimporting countries, and provisions on the revision of the participation shares\r\n(Article 8 of the current Agreement). \nThe Council of Members of the IOC decides\r\non the possible accession of new members to the Agreement on the basis of\r\nArticle 40 \"Accession\" and Article 8 \"Participation shares\"\r\nof the Agreement. The ongoing negotiations will redefine these Articles, as\r\nwell as the framework of the future IOC with new goals and new governance.\r\nUnder these conditions, it is necessary that the new agreement first enters\r\ninto force before the IOC can make decisions on the accessions to the\r\norganisation.\n2014/0324 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted on behalf of\r\nthe European Union within the Council of Members of the International Olive\r\nCouncil concerning the accession of new Members\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207, in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2014/664/EU[1] \u00a0authorised the\r\nCommission to request and vote in favour of a one-year prolongation of the\r\nexisting 2005 International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives,[2] as this Agreement will\r\nexpire on 31 December 2014.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 19 November 2013, the\r\nCouncil authorised the Commission to open negotiations on behalf of the Union for the conclusion of a new international agreement on olive oil and table olives. Those\r\nnegotiations are expected to redefine the objectives, the functioning and the\r\nstructure of the future International Olive Council, including the rules that\r\nhave impact on the rights and obligations of Members.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In that context, it is therefore\r\nnot appropriate for the current International Olive Council to decide on\r\napplications for new membership to that organisation. This question needs to be\r\nanalysed and discussed within the framework established by a new international agreement\r\non olive oil and table olives,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe position to be adopted on the Union's\r\nbehalf, within the Council of Members of the International Olive Council, shall\r\nbe to request the postponement of the vote on all requests for new accessions\r\nuntil a new international agreement on olive oil and table olives is in force. \nShould that request not be honoured, and\r\nshould the Council of Members of the International Olive Council be requested\r\nto take a decision on new accessions, the position to be adopted on the Union's behalf shall be to abstain from the vote.\u00a0 \nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\nday of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2014/664/EU of 15 September 2014 on\r\nthe position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union within the Council\r\nof Members of the International Olive Council concerning the prolongation of\r\nthe 2005 International Agreement on olive oil and table olives (OJ L 275,\r\n17.9.2014, p. 6).\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 302, 19.11.2005, p. 47.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
