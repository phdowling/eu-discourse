Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the\r\nCommission decided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more\r\nthan ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that\r\ndepartments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for\r\nwhich they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and\r\nreadily understandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law\r\napplicable to a given matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament,\r\nthe Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the\r\nfast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009\r\nof 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries\r\nnot members of the European Community[3].\r\nThe new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by\r\nthe codification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was drawn up on the\r\nbasis of a preliminary consolidation, in 22 official languages, of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 and the\r\ninstruments amending it, carried out by the Publications Office of the European\r\nUnion, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have\r\nbeen given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is\r\nshown in a table set out in Annex II to the codified Regulation.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\n2014/0309 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non protection against dumped imports from\r\ncountries not members of the European \u00d6 Union \u00d5 (codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the Functioning of the European Union \u00d5, and in\r\nparticular Article  \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\nrecital 1 (adapted)\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n\u00d6 1225/2009[6] \u00d5 has been\r\nsubstantially amended several times[7].\r\nIn the interests of clarity and rationality, \u00d6 that \u00d5 Regulation should be codified.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\nrecital 3 (adapted)\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement on\r\nImplementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\r\n1994 (\u2018the 1994 Anti-Dumping Agreement\u2019) contains detailed rules, relating in\r\nparticular to the calculation of dumping, procedures for initiating and\r\npursuing an investigation, including the establishment and treatment of the\r\nfacts, the imposition of provisional measures, the imposition and collection of\r\nanti-dumping duties, the duration and review of anti-dumping measures and the\r\npublic disclosure of information relating to anti-dumping investigations.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a\r\nproper and transparent application of \u00d6 the \u00d5 rules \u00d6 of the\r\n1994 Anti-Dumping Agreement \u00d5, the language\r\nof \u00d6 that \u00d5 agreement\r\nshould be \u00d6 reflected \u00d5 in \u00d6 Union \u00d5 legislation \u00d6 to the\r\nbest extent \u00d5 possible.\n\u00ea 1225/2009 recital\r\n4 (adapted)\n\u00e81 Corrigendum, OJ L 7, 12.1.2010, p. 22\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In applying the rules \u00d6 of the\r\n1994 Anti-Dumping Agreement \u00d5 it is\r\nessential, in order to maintain the balance of rights and obligations which \u00e81 the \u00d6 General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade \u00d5 (\u2018GATT\u2019) \u00d6 established \u00d5, \u00e7 that the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 take account\r\nof \u00d6 the\r\ninterpretation of those rules \u00d5 by the \u00d6 Union\u2019s \u00d5 major trading\r\npartners.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\nrecital 5 (adapted)\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is desirable to \u00d6 set\r\nout \u00d5 clear and\r\ndetailed rules on the calculation of \u00d6 the \u00d5 normal value.\r\nIn particular such value should in all cases be based on representative sales\r\nin the ordinary course of trade in the exporting country. It is expedient to\r\ngive guidance as to when parties may be considered as being associated for the\r\npurpose of determining dumping. It is expedient to define the circumstances in\r\nwhich domestic sales may be considered to be made at a loss and may be\r\ndisregarded, and in which recourse may be had to remaining sales, or to constructed\r\nnormal value, or to sales to a third country. It is also appropriate to provide\r\nfor a proper allocation of costs, even in start-up situations, and \u00d6 for \u00d5 guidance as to\r\nthe definition of start-up and the extent and method of allocation. It is also\r\nnecessary, when constructing \u00d6 the \u00d5 normal value,\r\nto indicate the methodology to be applied in determining the amounts for\r\nselling, general and administrative costs and the profit margin that should be included\r\nin such value.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\nrecital 6 (adapted)\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When determining \u00d6 the \u00d5 normal value\r\nfor non-market economy countries, it appears prudent to set out rules for\r\nchoosing the appropriate market-economy third country to be used for such\r\npurpose and, where it is not possible to find a suitable third country, to\r\nprovide that \u00d6 the \u00d5 normal value\r\nmay be established on any other reasonable basis.\n\u00ea 1225/2009 recital\r\n7 (adapted)\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is expedient to define\r\nthe export price and to enumerate the adjustments which \u00d6 should \u00d5 be made in\r\nthose cases where a reconstruction of \u00d6 that \u00d5 price from the\r\nfirst open-market price is deemed necessary.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\nrecital 8 (adapted)\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of\r\nensuring a fair comparison between export price and normal value, it is\r\nadvisable to list the factors which may affect prices and price comparability\r\nand to \u00d6 set\r\nout \u00d5 specific rules\r\nas to when and how the adjustments should be made, including the fact that any\r\nduplication of adjustments should be avoided.

An anti-dumping duty may be \u00d6 imposed\r\non \u00d5 any dumped\r\nproduct whose release for free circulation in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 causes injury.\n2. A product is to be considered as being\r\ndumped if its export price to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 is less than a\r\ncomparable price for \u00d6 a \u00d5 like product,\r\nin the ordinary course of trade, as established for the exporting country.\n3. The exporting country shall normally be\r\nthe country of origin. However, it may be an intermediate country, except\r\nwhere, for example, the products are merely transhipped through that country,\r\nor the products concerned are not produced in that country, or there is no\r\ncomparable price for them in that country.\n4. For\r\nthe purposes of this Regulation, \u2018like product\u2019 means a product which is\r\nidentical, that is to say, alike in all respects, to the product under\r\nconsideration, or, in the absence of such a product, another product which,\r\nalthough not alike in all respects, has characteristics closely resembling\r\nthose of the product under consideration.\nArticle 2\nDetermination of dumping\nA. NORMAL\r\nVALUE\n1. The normal value shall normally be based\r\non the prices paid or payable, in the ordinary course of trade, by independent\r\ncustomers in the exporting country.\nHowever, where the exporter in the\r\nexporting country does not produce or does not sell the like product, the\r\nnormal value may be established on the basis of prices of other sellers or\r\nproducers.\nPrices between parties which appear to be\r\nassociated or to have a compensatory arrangement with each other may not be\r\nconsidered to be in the ordinary course of trade and may not be used to\r\nestablish \u00d6 the \u00d5 normal value\r\nunless it is determined that they are unaffected by the relationship.\nIn order to determine whether two parties\r\nare associated account may be taken of the definition of related parties set\r\nout in Article 143 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93[9].\n2. Sales of the like product intended for\r\ndomestic consumption shall normally be used to determine \u00d6 the \u00d5 normal value\r\nif such sales volume constitutes 5 % or more of the sales volume of the\r\nproduct under consideration to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 . However, a\r\nlower volume of sales may be used when, for example, the prices charged are\r\nconsidered representative for the market concerned.\n3. When there are no or insufficient sales\r\nof the like product in the ordinary course of trade, or where, because of the\r\nparticular market situation, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the\r\nnormal value of the like product shall be calculated on the basis of the cost\r\nof production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for selling,\r\ngeneral and administrative costs and for profits, or on the basis of the export\r\nprices, in the ordinary course of trade, to an appropriate third country,\r\nprovided that those prices are representative.\nA particular market situation for the\r\nproduct concerned within the meaning of the first subparagraph may be deemed to\r\nexist, inter alia, when prices are artificially low, when there is\r\nsignificant barter trade, or when there are non-commercial processing\r\narrangements.\n4. Sales of the like product in the\r\ndomestic market of the exporting country, or export sales to a third country,\r\nat prices below unit production costs (fixed and variable) plus selling,\r\ngeneral and administrative costs may be treated as not being in the ordinary\r\ncourse of trade by reason of price, and may be disregarded in determining\r\nnormal value, only if it is determined that such sales are made within an\r\nextended period in substantial quantities, and are at prices which do not\r\nprovide for the recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time.\nIf prices which are below costs at the time\r\nof sale are above weighted average costs for the period of investigation, such\r\nprices shall be considered to provide for recovery of costs within a reasonable\r\nperiod of time.\nThe extended period of time shall normally\r\nbe one year but shall in no case be less than six months, and sales below\r\nunit cost shall be considered to be made in substantial quantities within such\r\na period when it is established that the weighted average selling price is\r\nbelow the weighted average unit cost, or that the volume of sales below unit\r\ncost is not less than 20 % of sales being used to determine normal\r\nvalue.\n5. Costs shall normally be calculated on\r\nthe basis of records kept by the party under investigation, provided that such\r\nrecords are in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of\r\nthe country concerned and that it is shown that the records reasonably reflect\r\nthe costs associated with the production and sale of the product under\r\nconsideration.\nIf costs associated with the production and\r\nsale of the product under investigation are not reasonably reflected in the\r\nrecords of the party concerned, they shall be adjusted or established on the\r\nbasis of the costs of other producers or exporters in the same country or,\r\nwhere such information is not available or cannot be used, on any other\r\nreasonable basis, including information from other representative markets.\nConsideration shall be given to evidence\r\nsubmitted on the proper allocation of costs, provided that it is shown that\r\nsuch allocations have been historically utilised. In the absence of a more\r\nappropriate method, preference shall be given to the allocation of costs on the\r\nbasis of turnover. Unless already reflected in the cost allocations under this\r\nsubparagraph, costs shall be adjusted appropriately for those non-recurring\r\nitems of cost which benefit future and/or current production.\nWhere the costs for part of the period for\r\ncost recovery are affected by the use of new production facilities requiring\r\nsubstantial additional investment and by low capacity utilisation rates, which\r\nare the result of start-up operations which take place within or during part of\r\nthe investigation period, the average costs for the start-up phase shall be\r\nthose applicable, under the above-mentioned allocation rules, at the end of\r\nsuch a phase, and shall be included at that level, for the period concerned, in\r\nthe weighted average costs referred to in the second subparagraph of\r\nparagraph 4. The length of a start-up phase shall be determined in\r\nrelation to the circumstances of the producer or exporter concerned, but shall\r\nnot exceed an appropriate initial portion of the period for cost recovery. For\r\nthis adjustment to costs applicable during the investigation period,\r\ninformation relating to a start-up phase which extends beyond that period shall\r\nbe taken into account where it is submitted prior to verification visits and\r\nwithin three months of the initiation of the investigation.\n6. The amounts for selling, for general and\r\nadministrative costs and for profits shall be based on actual data pertaining\r\nto production and sales, in the ordinary course of trade, of the like product\r\nby the exporter or producer under investigation. When such amounts cannot be\r\ndetermined on this basis, the amounts may be determined on the basis of:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the weighted average of the\r\nactual amounts determined for other exporters or producers subject to\r\ninvestigation in respect of production and sales of the like product in the\r\ndomestic market of the country of origin;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the actual amounts applicable to\r\nproduction and sales, in the ordinary course of trade, of the same general\r\ncategory of products for the exporter or producer in question in the domestic\r\nmarket of the country of origin;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 any other reasonable method,\r\nprovided that the amount for profit so established shall not exceed the profit\r\nnormally realised by other exporters or producers on sales of products of the\r\nsame general category in the domestic market of the country of origin.\n7. (a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of imports from\r\nnon-market economy countries[10],\r\nnormal value shall be determined on the basis of the price or constructed value\r\nin a market economy third country, or the price from such a third country to\r\nother countries, including the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , or, where\r\nthose are not possible, on any other reasonable basis, including the price\r\nactually paid or payable in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 for the like\r\nproduct, duly adjusted if necessary to include a reasonable profit margin.\nAn appropriate market economy third country\r\nshall be selected in a not unreasonable manner, due account being taken of any\r\nreliable information made available at the time of selection. Account shall\r\nalso be taken of time limits. Where appropriate, a market economy third country\r\nwhich is subject to the same investigation shall be used.\nThe parties to the investigation shall be\r\ninformed shortly after its initiation of the market economy third country\r\nenvisaged and shall be given 10 days to comment.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In anti-dumping investigations\r\nconcerning \u00e81 imports from the People\u2019s Republic of China,\r\nVietnam and Kazakhstan and any non-market-economy country \u00e7 which is a\r\nmember of the WTO at the date of the initiation of the investigation, normal\r\nvalue shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 6, if it\r\nis shown, on the basis of properly substantiated claims by one or more\r\nproducers subject to the investigation and in accordance with the criteria and\r\nprocedures set out in point (c), that market economy conditions prevail for\r\nthis producer or producers in respect of the manufacture and sale of the like\r\nproduct concerned. When \u00d6 that \u00d5 is not the\r\ncase, the rules set out under  point (a) shall apply.\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A claim under point (b) must be\r\nmade in writing and contain sufficient evidence that the producer operates\r\nunder market economy conditions, that is if:\n\u2013              \r\ndecisions of firms regarding prices, costs and\r\ninputs, including for instance raw materials, cost of technology and labour,\r\noutput, sales and investment, are made in response to market signals reflecting\r\nsupply and demand, and without significant State interference in \u00d6 that \u00d5 regard, and\r\ncosts of major inputs substantially reflect market values,\n\u2013              \r\nfirms have one clear set of basic accounting\r\nrecords which are independently audited in line with international accounting\r\nstandards and are applied for all purposes,\n\u2013              \r\nthe production costs and financial situation of\r\nfirms are not subject to significant distortions carried over from the former\r\nnon-market economy system, in particular in relation to depreciation of assets,\r\nother write-offs, barter trade and payment via compensation of debts,\n\u2013              \r\nthe firms concerned are subject to bankruptcy\r\nand property laws which guarantee legal certainty and stability for the\r\noperation of firms, and\n\u2013              \r\nexchange rate conversions are carried out at the\r\nmarket rate.\nA determination whether the producer meets the\r\nabove-mentioned criteria \u00e82 shall normally be made within seven months of, but\r\nin any event not later than eight months after, the initiation of the\r\ninvestigation \u00e7, \u00e83 after the Union industry \u00e7 has been given\r\nan opportunity to comment. \u00d6 That \u00d5 determination\r\nshall remain in force throughout the investigation. \u00e83 The Commission shall provide information to the\r\nMember States concerning its analysis of claims made pursuant to point (b)\r\nnormally within 28 weeks of the initiation of the investigation. \u00e7\n\u00ea 1168/2012\r\nArt. 1.1(b) (adapted)\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the Commission has limited\r\nits \u00d6 investigation \u00d5 in accordance\r\nwith Article 17, a determination pursuant to points (b) and (c) of this\r\nparagraph shall be limited to the parties included in the \u00d6 investigation \u00d5 and any\r\nproducer that receives individual treatment pursuant to Article 17(3).\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\nB. EXPORT\r\nPRICE\n8. The export price shall be the price\r\nactually paid or payable for the product when sold for export from the\r\nexporting country to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\n9. In cases where there is no export price\r\nor where it appears that the export price is unreliable because of an\r\nassociation or a compensatory arrangement between the exporter and the importer\r\nor a third party, the export price may be constructed on the basis of the price\r\nat which the imported products are first resold to an independent buyer, or, if\r\nthe products are not resold to an independent buyer or are not resold in the\r\ncondition in which they were imported, on any reasonable basis.\nIn \u00d6 those \u00d5 cases,\r\nadjustment for all costs, including duties and taxes, incurred between\r\nimportation and resale, and for profits accruing, shall be made so as to\r\nestablish a reliable export price, at the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 frontier\r\nlevel.\nThe items for which adjustment shall be\r\nmade shall include those normally borne by an importer but paid by any party,\r\neither inside or outside the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , which\r\nappears to be associated or to have a compensatory arrangement with the\r\nimporter or exporter, including usual transport, insurance, handling, loading\r\nand ancillary costs, customs duties, any anti-dumping duties, and other taxes\r\npayable in the importing country by reason of the importation or sale of the\r\ngoods, and a reasonable margin for selling, general and administrative costs\r\nand profit.\nC.\r\nCOMPARISON\n10. A fair comparison shall be made between\r\nthe export price and the normal value. This comparison shall be made at the\r\nsame level of trade and in respect of sales made at, as closely as possible,\r\nthe same time and with due account taken of other differences which affect\r\nprice comparability. Where the normal value and the export price as established\r\nare not on such a comparable basis due allowance, in the form of adjustments,\r\nshall be made in each case, on its merits, for differences in factors which are\r\nclaimed, and demonstrated, to affect prices and price comparability. Any\r\nduplication when making adjustments shall be avoided, in particular in relation\r\nto discounts, rebates, quantities and level of trade. When the specified\r\nconditions are met, the factors for which adjustment can be made are listed as\r\nfollows:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Physical characteristics\nAn adjustment shall be made for differences in\r\nthe physical characteristics of the product concerned. The amount of the\r\nadjustment shall correspond to a reasonable estimate of the market value of the\r\ndifference.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Import\r\ncharges and indirect taxes\nAn adjustment shall be made to normal value for\r\nan amount corresponding to any import charges or indirect taxes borne by the\r\nlike product and by materials physically incorporated therein, when intended\r\nfor consumption in the exporting country and not collected or refunded in\r\nrespect of the product exported to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Discounts, rebates and\r\nquantities\nAn adjustment shall be made for differences in\r\ndiscounts and rebates, including those given for differences in quantities, if \u00d6 those \u00d5 are properly\r\nquantified and are directly linked to the sales under consideration. An\r\nadjustment may also be made for deferred discounts and rebates if the claim is\r\nbased on consistent practice in prior periods, including compliance with the\r\nconditions required to qualify for the discount or rebates.\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Level of trade\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An adjustment for differences in\r\nlevels of trade, including any differences which may arise in OEM (Original\r\nEquipment Manufacturer) sales, shall be made where, in relation to the\r\ndistribution chain in both markets, it is shown that the export price,\r\nincluding a constructed export price, is at a different level of trade from the\r\nnormal value and the difference has affected price comparability which is\r\ndemonstrated by consistent and distinct differences in functions and prices of\r\nthe seller for the different levels of trade in the domestic market of the\r\nexporting country. The amount of the adjustment shall be based on the market\r\nvalue of the difference.\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, in circumstances not\r\nenvisaged under point (i), when an existing difference in level of trade\r\ncannot be quantified because of the absence of the relevant levels on the\r\ndomestic market of the exporting countries, or where certain functions are\r\nshown clearly to relate to levels of trade other than the one which is to be\r\nused in the comparison, a special adjustment may be granted.\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transport, insurance,\r\nhandling, loading and ancillary costs\nAn adjustment shall be made for differences in\r\nthe directly related costs incurred for conveying the product concerned from\r\nthe premises of the exporter to an independent buyer, where such costs are\r\nincluded in the prices charged. Those costs shall include transport, insurance,\r\nhandling, loading and ancillary costs.\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Packing\nAn adjustment shall be made for differences in\r\nthe directly related packing costs for the product concerned.\n(g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Credit\nAn adjustment shall be made for differences in\r\nthe cost of any credit granted for the sales under consideration, provided that\r\nit is a factor taken into account in the determination of the prices charged.\n(h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After-sales costs\nAn adjustment shall be made for differences in\r\nthe direct costs of providing warranties, guarantees, technical assistance and\r\nservices, as provided for by law and/or in the sales contract.\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commissions\nAn adjustment shall be made for differences in\r\ncommissions paid in respect of the sales under consideration.\nThe term \u2018commissions\u2019 shall be understood to\r\ninclude the mark-up received by a trader of the product or the like product if\r\nthe functions of such a trader are similar to those of an agent working on a\r\ncommission basis.\n(j)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Currency conversions\nWhen the price comparison requires a conversion\r\nof currencies, such conversion shall be made using the rate of exchange on the\r\ndate of sale, except that when a sale of foreign currency on forward markets is\r\ndirectly linked to the export sale involved the rate of exchange in the forward\r\nsale shall be used. Normally, the date of sale shall be the date of invoice but\r\nthe date of contract, purchase order or order confirmation may be used if \u00d6 those \u00d5 more\r\nappropriately establish the material terms of sale. Fluctuations in exchange\r\nrates shall be ignored and exporters shall be granted 60 days to reflect a\r\nsustained movement in exchange rates during the investigation period.\n(k)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other factors\nAn adjustment may also be made for differences\r\nin other factors not provided for under points (a) to (j) if it is\r\ndemonstrated that they affect price comparability as required under this\r\nparagraph, in particular that customers consistently pay different prices on\r\nthe domestic market because of the difference in such factors.\nD.\r\nDUMPING MARGIN\n11. Subject to the relevant provisions\r\ngoverning fair comparison, the existence of margins of dumping during the investigation\r\nperiod shall normally be established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted\r\naverage normal value with a weighted average of prices of all export\r\ntransactions to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , or by a\r\ncomparison of individual normal values and individual export prices to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 on a\r\ntransaction-to-transaction basis. However, a normal value established on a\r\nweighted average basis may be compared to prices of all individual export\r\ntransactions to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , if there is\r\na \u00d6 significant\r\ndifference in the \u00d5 pattern of\r\nexport prices among different purchasers, regions or time periods, and if the\r\nmethods specified in the first sentence of this paragraph would not reflect the\r\nfull degree of dumping being practised. This paragraph shall not preclude the\r\nuse of sampling in accordance with Article 17.\n12. The dumping margin shall be the amount\r\nby which the normal value exceeds the export price. Where dumping margins vary,\r\na weighted average dumping margin may be established.\nArticle 3\nDetermination of injury\n1. Pursuant to this Regulation, the term\r\n\u2018injury\u2019 shall, unless otherwise specified, be taken to mean material injury to\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry,\r\nthreat of material injury to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry or\r\nmaterial retardation of the establishment of such an industry and shall be\r\ninterpreted in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n2. A determination of injury shall be based\r\non positive evidence and shall involve an objective examination of :\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the volume of the dumped imports\r\nand the effect of the dumped imports on prices in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 market for\r\nlike products; and\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the consequent impact of those\r\nimports on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\n3. With regard to the volume of the dumped\r\nimports, consideration shall be given to whether there has been a significant\r\nincrease in dumped imports, either in absolute terms or relative to production\r\nor consumption in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 . With regard\r\nto the effect of the dumped imports on prices, consideration shall be given to\r\nwhether there has been significant price undercutting by the dumped imports as\r\ncompared with the price of a like product of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, or\r\nwhether the effect of such imports is otherwise to depress prices to a\r\nsignificant degree or prevent price increases, which would otherwise have\r\noccurred, to a significant degree. No one or more of \u00d6 those \u00d5 factors can\r\nnecessarily give decisive guidance.\n4. Where imports of a product from more\r\nthan one country are simultaneously subject to anti-dumping investigations, the\r\neffects of such imports shall be cumulatively assessed only if it is determined\r\nthat:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the margin of dumping established\r\nin relation to the imports from each country is more than de minimis as\r\ndefined in Article 9(3) and the volume of imports from each country is not\r\nnegligible; and\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a cumulative assessment of the\r\neffects of the imports is appropriate in \u00d6 the \u00d5 light of the\r\nconditions of competition between imported products and the conditions of competition\r\nbetween the imported products and the like \u00d6 Union \u00d5 product.\n5. The examination of the impact of the\r\ndumped imports on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\r\nconcerned shall include an evaluation of all relevant economic factors and\r\nindices having a bearing on the state of the industry, including the fact that\r\nan industry is still in the process of recovering from the effects of past\r\ndumping or subsidisation, the magnitude of the actual margin of dumping, actual\r\nand potential decline in sales, profits, output, market share, productivity,\r\nreturn on investments, utilisation of capacity, factors affecting \u00d6 Union \u00d5 prices, actual\r\nand potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages,\r\ngrowth, ability to raise capital or investments. This list is not exhaustive,\r\nnor can any one or more of these factors necessarily give decisive guidance.\n6. It must be demonstrated, from all the\r\nrelevant evidence presented in relation to paragraph 2, that the dumped\r\nimports are causing injury within the meaning of this Regulation. Specifically,\r\n\u00d6 that \u00d5 shall entail a\r\ndemonstration that the volume and/or price levels identified pursuant to\r\nparagraph 3 are responsible for an impact on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry as\r\nprovided for in paragraph 5, and that \u00d6 that \u00d5 impact exists\r\nto a degree which enables it to be classified as material.\n7. Known factors other than the dumped\r\nimports which at the same time are injuring the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry shall\r\nalso be examined to ensure that injury caused by \u00d6 those \u00d5 other factors\r\nis not attributed to the dumped imports under paragraph 6. Factors which\r\nmay be considered in \u00d6 that \u00d5 respect \u00d6 shall \u00d5 include the\r\nvolume and prices of imports not sold at dumping prices, contraction in demand\r\nor changes in the patterns of consumption, restrictive trade practices of, and\r\ncompetition between, third country and \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers,\r\ndevelopments in technology and the export performance and productivity of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\n8. The effect of the dumped imports shall\r\nbe assessed in relation to the production of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry of\r\nthe like product when available data permit the separate identification of that\r\nproduction on the basis of such criteria as the production process, producers\u2019\r\nsales and profits. If such separate identification of that production is not\r\npossible, the effects of the dumped imports shall be assessed by examination of\r\nthe production of the narrowest group or range of products, which includes the\r\nlike product, for which the necessary information can be provided.\n9. A determination of a threat of material\r\ninjury shall be based on facts and not merely on an allegation, conjecture or\r\nremote possibility. The change in circumstances which would create a situation\r\nin which the dumping would cause injury must be clearly foreseen and imminent.\nIn making a determination regarding the\r\nexistence of a threat of material injury, consideration should be given to such\r\nfactors as:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a significant rate of increase of\r\ndumped imports into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 market\r\nindicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sufficient freely disposable\r\ncapacity of the exporter or an imminent and substantial increase in such\r\ncapacity indicating the likelihood of substantially increased dumped exports to\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , account\r\nbeing taken of the availability of other export markets to absorb any\r\nadditional exports;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether imports are entering at\r\nprices that would, to a significant degree, depress prices or prevent price\r\nincreases which otherwise would have occurred, and would probably increase\r\ndemand for further imports; \n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 inventories of the product being\r\ninvestigated.\nNo one of the factors listed above by\r\nitself can necessarily give decisive guidance, but the totality of the factors\r\nconsidered must lead to the conclusion that further dumped exports are imminent\r\nand that, unless protective action is taken, material injury will occur.\nArticle 4\nDefinition of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\n1. For the purposes of this Regulation, the\r\nterm \u2018 \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\u2019\r\nshall be interpreted as referring to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers as a\r\nwhole of the like products or to those of them whose collective output of the\r\nproducts constitutes a major proportion, as defined in Article 5(4), of\r\nthe total \u00d6 Union \u00d5 production of\r\nthose products, except that:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when producers are related to the\r\nexporters or importers or are themselves importers of the allegedly dumped\r\nproduct, the term \u2018 \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\u2019 may\r\nbe interpreted as referring to the rest of the producers;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in exceptional circumstances the\r\nterritory of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 may, for the\r\nproduction in question, be divided into two or more competitive markets and the\r\nproducers within each market may be regarded as a separate industry if:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the producers within such a market\r\nsell all or almost all of their production of the product in question in that\r\nmarket; and\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the demand in that market is not to\r\nany substantial degree \u00d6 met \u00d5 by producers\r\nof the product in question located elsewhere in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\nIn such circumstances, injury may be found to\r\nexist even where a major portion of the total \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry is\r\nnot injured, provided \u00d6 that \u00d5 there is a\r\nconcentration of dumped imports into such an isolated market and provided\r\nfurther that the dumped imports are causing injury to the producers of all or\r\nalmost all of the production within such a market.\n2. For the purpose of paragraph 1,\r\nproducers shall be considered to be related to exporters or importers only if:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 one of them directly or\r\nindirectly controls the other; or\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 both of them are directly or\r\nindirectly controlled by a third person; or\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 together they directly or indirectly\r\ncontrol a third person, provided that there are grounds for believing or\r\nsuspecting that the effect of the relationship is such as to cause the producer\r\nconcerned to behave differently from non-related producers.\nFor the purpose of this paragraph, one\r\nshall be deemed to control another when the former is legally or operationally\r\nin a position to exercise restraint or direction over the latter.\n3. Where the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry has\r\nbeen interpreted as referring to the producers in a certain region, the\r\nexporters shall be given an opportunity to offer undertakings pursuant to\r\nArticle 8 in respect of the region concerned. In such cases, when\r\nevaluating the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 interest of\r\nthe measures, special account shall be taken of the interest of the region. If\r\nan adequate undertaking is not offered promptly or the situations set out in\r\nArticle 8(9) and (10) apply, a provisional or definitive duty may be\r\nimposed in respect of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 as a whole. In\r\nsuch cases the duties may, if practicable, be limited to specific producers or\r\nexporters.\n4. The provisions of Article 3(8)\r\nshall be applicable to this Article.\nArticle 5\nInitiation of proceedings\n1. Except as provided for in paragraph 6,\r\nan investigation to determine the existence, degree and effect of any alleged\r\ndumping shall be initiated upon a written complaint by any natural or legal\r\nperson, or any association not having legal personality, acting on behalf of\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\nThe complaint may be submitted to the\r\nCommission or to a Member State, which shall forward it to the Commission. The\r\nCommission shall send Member States a copy of any complaint it receives. The\r\ncomplaint shall be deemed to have been lodged on the first working day\r\nfollowing its delivery to the Commission by registered mail or the issuing of\r\nan acknowledgement of receipt by the Commission.\nWhere, in the absence of any complaint, a\r\nMember State is in possession of sufficient evidence of dumping and of\r\nresultant injury to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, it\r\nshall immediately communicate such evidence to the Commission.\n2. A complaint under paragraph 1 shall\r\ninclude evidence of dumping, injury and a causal link between the allegedly\r\ndumped imports and the alleged injury. The complaint shall contain such\r\ninformation as is reasonably available to the complainant on the following:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the identity of the complainant\r\nand a description of the volume and value of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 production of\r\nthe like product by the complainant. Where a written complaint is made on\r\nbehalf of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, the\r\ncomplaint shall identify the industry on behalf of which the complaint is made\r\nby a list of all known \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers of\r\nthe like product (or associations of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers of\r\nthe like product) and, to the extent possible, a description of the volume and\r\nvalue of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 production of\r\nthe like product accounted for by such producers;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a complete description of the\r\nallegedly dumped product, the names of the country or countries of origin or\r\nexport in question, the identity of each known exporter or foreign producer and\r\na list of known persons importing the product in question;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00d6 the \u00d5 prices at\r\nwhich the product in question is sold when destined for consumption in the\r\ndomestic markets of the country or countries of origin or export (or, where\r\nappropriate, the prices at which the product is sold from the country or\r\ncountries of origin or export to a third country or countries or on the\r\nconstructed value of the product) and \u00d6 the \u00d5 export prices\r\nor, where appropriate, the prices at which the product is first resold to an\r\nindependent buyer in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 ;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00d6 the \u00d5 changes in the\r\nvolume of the allegedly dumped imports, the effect of those imports on prices\r\nof the like product on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 market and the\r\nconsequent impact of the imports on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, as\r\ndemonstrated by relevant factors and indices having a bearing on the state of\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, such\r\nas those listed in Article 3(3) and (5).\n3. The Commission shall, as far as\r\npossible, examine the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the complaint,\r\nto determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of\r\nan investigation.\n4. An investigation shall not be initiated\r\npursuant to paragraph 1 unless it has been determined, on the basis of an\r\nexamination as to the degree of support for, or opposition to, the complaint\r\nexpressed by \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers of\r\nthe like product, that the complaint has been made by or on behalf of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry. The\r\ncomplaint shall be considered to have been made by or on behalf of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry if it\r\nis supported by those \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\nwhose collective output constitutes more than 50 % of the total production\r\nof the like product produced by that portion of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\r\nexpressing either support for or opposition to the complaint. However, no\r\ninvestigation shall be initiated when \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\nexpressly supporting the complaint account for less than 25 % of total\r\nproduction of the like product produced by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\n5. The authorities shall avoid, unless a\r\ndecision has been made to initiate an investigation, any publicising of the\r\ncomplaint seeking the initiation of an investigation. However, after receipt of\r\na properly documented complaint and before proceeding to initiate an\r\ninvestigation, the government of the exporting country concerned shall be\r\nnotified.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(2) (adapted)\n6. If, in special circumstances, \u00d6 the\r\nCommission decides \u00d5 to initiate an\r\ninvestigation without having received a written complaint by or on behalf of\r\nthe Union industry for the initiation of such an investigation, this shall be\r\ndone on the basis of sufficient evidence of dumping, injury and a causal link,\r\nas described in paragraph 2, to justify such initiation. The Commission shall\r\nprovide information to the Member States once it has determined the need to\r\ninitiate such investigation.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\n7. The evidence of both dumping and injury\r\nshall be considered simultaneously in the decision on whether or not to\r\ninitiate an investigation. A complaint shall be rejected where there is\r\ninsufficient evidence of either dumping or of injury to justify proceeding with\r\nthe case. Proceedings shall not be initiated against countries whose imports\r\nrepresent a market share of below 1 %, unless such countries collectively\r\naccount for 3 % or more of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 consumption.\n8. The complaint may be withdrawn prior to\r\ninitiation, in which case it shall be considered not to have been lodged.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(2) (adapted)\n9. Where it is apparent that there is\r\nsufficient evidence to justify initiating proceedings, the Commission shall do\r\nso within 45 days of the date \u00d6 on\r\nwhich \u00d5 the complaint \u00d6 was\r\nlodged \u00d5 and shall\r\npublish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. Where\r\ninsufficient evidence has been presented, the complainant shall be so informed\r\nwithin 45 days of the date on which the complaint is lodged with the\r\nCommission. The Commission shall provide information to the Member States\r\nconcerning its analysis of the complaint normally within 21 days of the date on\r\nwhich the complaint is lodged with the Commission.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\n\u00e81 37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .22(3)\n10. The notice of initiation of proceedings\r\nshall announce the initiation of an investigation, indicate the product and\r\ncountries concerned, give a summary of the information received, and provide\r\nthat all relevant information is to be communicated to the Commission.\nIt shall state the periods within which\r\ninterested parties may make themselves known, present their views in writing\r\nand submit information if such views and information are to be taken into\r\naccount during the investigation. It shall also state the period within which\r\ninterested parties may apply to be heard by the Commission in accordance with\r\nArticle 6(5).\n11. The Commission shall advise the\r\nexporters, importers and representative associations of importers or exporters\r\nknown to it to be concerned, as well as representatives of the exporting\r\ncountry and the complainants, of the initiation of the proceedings and, with\r\ndue regard to the protection of confidential information, provide the full text\r\nof the written complaint received pursuant to paragraph 1 to the known\r\nexporters and to the authorities of the exporting country, and make it\r\navailable upon request to other interested parties involved. Where the number\r\nof exporters involved is particularly high, the full text of the written complaint\r\nmay instead be provided only to the authorities of the exporting country or to\r\nthe relevant trade association.\n12. An anti-dumping investigation shall not\r\nhinder the procedures of customs clearance.\nArticle 6\nThe investigation\n1. Following the initiation of proceedings,\r\nthe Commission, acting in cooperation with the Member States, shall commence an\r\ninvestigation at \u00d6 Union \u00d5 level. Such\r\ninvestigation shall cover both dumping and injury and these shall be\r\ninvestigated simultaneously.\nFor the purpose of a representative\r\nfinding, an investigation period shall be selected which in the case of dumping\r\nshall, normally, cover a period of no less than six months immediately prior to\r\nthe initiation of proceedings.\nInformation relating to a period subsequent\r\nto the investigation period shall, normally, not be taken into account.\n2. Parties receiving questionnaires used in\r\nan anti-dumping investigation shall be given at least 30 days to reply. The\r\ntime limit for exporters shall be counted from the date of receipt of the\r\nquestionnaire, which for this purpose shall be deemed to have been received one\r\nweek from the day on which it was sent to the exporter or transmitted to the\r\nappropriate diplomatic representative of the exporting country. An extension to\r\nthe 30 day period may be granted, due account being taken of the time limits of\r\nthe investigation, provided that the party shows due cause for such extension,\r\nin terms of its particular circumstances.\n3. The Commission may request Member States\r\nto supply information, and Member States shall take whatever steps are\r\nnecessary in order to give effect to such requests.\nThey shall send to the Commission the\r\ninformation requested together with the results of all inspections, checks or\r\ninvestigations carried out.\nWhere \u00d6 that \u00d5 information is\r\nof general interest or where its transmission has been requested by a Member State, the Commission shall forward it to the Member States, provided it is not\r\nconfidential, in which case a non-confidential summary shall be forwarded.\n4. The Commission may request Member States\r\nto carry out all necessary checks and inspections, particularly amongst\r\nimporters, traders and \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers, and\r\nto carry out investigations in third countries, provided that the firms\r\nconcerned give their consent and that the government of the country in question\r\nhas been officially notified and raises no objection.\nMember States shall take whatever steps are\r\nnecessary in order to give effect to such requests from the Commission.\nOfficials of the Commission shall be\r\nauthorised, if the Commission or a Member State so requests, to assist the\r\nofficials of Member States in carrying out their duties.\n5. The interested parties which have made themselves\r\nknown in accordance with Article 5(10) shall be heard if they have, within\r\nthe period prescribed in the notice published in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union, made a written request for a hearing showing that they are\r\nan interested party likely to be affected by the result of the proceedings and\r\nthat there are particular reasons why they should be heard.\n6. Opportunities shall, on request, be\r\nprovided for the importers, exporters, representatives of the government of the\r\nexporting country and the complainants, which have made themselves known in\r\naccordance with Article 5(10), to meet those parties with adverse\r\ninterests, so that opposing views may be presented and rebuttal arguments\r\noffered.\nProvision of such opportunities must take\r\naccount of the need to preserve confidentiality and of the convenience to the\r\nparties.\nThere shall be no obligation on any party\r\nto attend a meeting, and failure to do so shall not be prejudicial to that\r\nparty's case.\nOral information provided under this\r\nparagraph shall be taken into account in so far as it is subsequently confirmed\r\nin writing.\n7. The complainants, importers and\r\nexporters and their representative associations, users and consumer\r\norganisations, which have made themselves known in accordance with Article 5(10),\r\nas well as the representatives of the exporting country, may, upon written\r\nrequest, inspect all information made available by any party to an\r\ninvestigation, as distinct from internal documents prepared by the authorities\r\nof the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or its Member\r\nStates, which is relevant to the presentation of their cases and not\r\nconfidential within the meaning of Article 19, and is used in the\r\ninvestigation.\nSuch parties may respond to such\r\ninformation and their comments shall be taken into consideration, wherever they\r\nare sufficiently substantiated in the response.\n8. Except in the circumstances provided for\r\nin Article 18, the information which is supplied by interested parties and\r\nupon which findings are based shall be examined for accuracy as far as\r\npossible.\n9. For proceedings initiated pursuant to\r\nArticle 5(9), an investigation shall, whenever possible, be concluded\r\nwithin one year. In any event, such investigations shall in all cases be\r\nconcluded within 15 months of initiation, in accordance with the findings made\r\npursuant to Article 8 for undertakings or the findings made pursuant to\r\nArticle 9 for definitive action.\nArticle 7\nProvisional measures\n1. Provisional duties may be imposed if:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 proceedings have been initiated\r\nin accordance with Article 5; \n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a notice has been given to that\r\neffect and interested parties have been given \u00e81 an adequate opportunity \u00e7 to submit\r\ninformation and make comments in accordance with Article 5(10); \n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a provisional affirmative\r\ndetermination has been made of dumping and consequent injury to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry ;\r\nand \n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 interest calls\r\nfor intervention to prevent such injury.\nThe provisional duties shall be imposed no\r\nearlier than 60 days from the initiation of the proceedings but no later than\r\nnine months from the initiation of the proceedings.\n2. The amount of the provisional\r\nanti-dumping duty shall not exceed the margin of dumping as provisionally\r\nestablished, but it should be less than the margin if such lesser duty would be\r\nadequate to remove the injury to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\n3. Provisional duties shall be secured by a\r\nguarantee, and the release of the products concerned for free circulation in\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 shall be\r\nconditional upon the provision of such guarantee.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(3) (adapted)\n4. The Commission shall \u00d6 adopt \u00d5 provisional\r\nmeasures in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 15(4).\n\u00ea 1225/2009\n5. Where a Member State requests immediate\r\nintervention by the Commission and where the conditions in paragraph 1 are\r\nmet, the Commission shall, within a maximum of five working days of receipt of\r\nthe request, decide whether a provisional anti-dumping duty shall be imposed.\n6. Provisional duties may be imposed for\r\nsix months and extended for a further three months or they may be imposed for\r\nnine months. However, they may only be extended, or imposed for a nine-month\r\nperiod, where exporters representing a significant percentage of the trade\r\ninvolved so request or do not object upon notification by the Commission.\nArticle 8\nUndertakings\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(4)\n1. On the condition that a provisional\r\naffirmative determination of dumping and injury has been made, the Commission\r\nmay, in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 15(2),\r\naccept satisfactory voluntary undertaking offers submitted by any exporter to\r\nrevise its prices or to cease exports at dumped prices, if it is satisfied that\r\nthe injurious effect of the dumping is thereby eliminated.\nIn such a case and as long as such\r\nundertakings are in force, provisional duties imposed by the Commission in\r\naccordance with Article 7(1), or definitive duties imposed in accordance with\r\nArticle 9(4), as the case may be, shall not apply to the relevant imports of\r\nthe product concerned manufactured by the companies referred to in the\r\nCommission decision accepting undertakings, as subsequently amended.\nPrice increases under such undertakings\r\nshall not be higher than necessary to eliminate the margin of dumping and they\r\nshould be less than the margin of dumping if such increases would be adequate\r\nto remove the injury to the Union industry.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\n2. Undertakings may be suggested by the\r\nCommission, but no exporter shall be obliged to enter into such an undertaking.\r\nThe fact that exporters do not offer such undertakings, or do not accept an\r\ninvitation to do so, shall in no way prejudice consideration of the case.\nHowever, it may be determined that a threat\r\nof injury is more likely to be realised if the dumped imports continue.\r\nUndertakings shall not be sought or accepted from exporters unless a\r\nprovisional affirmative determination of dumping and injury caused by such\r\ndumping has been made.\nSave in exceptional circumstances,\r\nundertakings may not be offered later than the end of the period during which\r\nrepresentations may be made pursuant to Article 20(5).\n3. Undertakings offered need not be\r\naccepted if their acceptance is considered impractical, such as where the\r\nnumber of actual or potential exporters is too great, or for other reasons,\r\nincluding reasons of general policy. The exporter concerned may be provided\r\nwith the reasons for which it is proposed to reject the offer of an undertaking\r\nand may be given an opportunity to make comments thereon. The reasons for\r\nrejection shall be set out in the definitive decision.\n4. Parties which offer an undertaking shall\r\nbe required to provide a non-confidential version of such undertaking, so that\r\nit may be made available to interested parties to the investigation.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(4)\n5. Where undertakings are accepted, the\r\ninvestigation shall be terminated. The Commission shall terminate the\r\ninvestigation in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in\r\nArticle 15(3).\n\u00ea 1225/2009\n6. If the undertakings are accepted, the\r\ninvestigation of dumping and injury shall normally be completed. In such a\r\ncase, if a negative determination of dumping or injury is made, the undertaking\r\nshall automatically lapse, except in cases where such a determination is due in\r\nlarge part to the existence of an undertaking. In such cases it may be required\r\nthat an undertaking be maintained for a reasonable period.\nIn the event that an affirmative\r\ndetermination of dumping and injury is made, the undertaking shall continue\r\nconsistent with its terms and the provisions of this Regulation.\n7. The Commission shall require any\r\nexporter from which an undertaking has been accepted to provide, periodically,\r\ninformation relevant to the fulfilment of such undertaking, and to permit\r\nverification of pertinent data. Non-compliance with such requirements shall be\r\nconstrued as a breach of the undertaking.\n8. Where undertakings are accepted from\r\ncertain exporters during the course of an investigation, they shall, for the\r\npurpose of Article 11, be deemed to take effect from the date on which the\r\ninvestigation is concluded for the exporting country.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(4) (adapted)\n9. In the case of breach or withdrawal of\r\nundertakings by any party to the undertaking, or in the case of withdrawal of\r\nacceptance of the undertaking by the Commission, the acceptance of the\r\nundertaking shall be withdrawn by Commission Decision or Commission Regulation,\r\nas appropriate, and the provisional duty which has been imposed by the Commission\r\nin accordance with Article 7 or the definitive duty which has been imposed in\r\naccordance with Article 9(4) shall automatically apply, provided that the\r\nexporter concerned has, except where \u00d6 that\r\nexporter \u00d5 has withdrawn\r\nthe undertaking, been given an opportunity to comment. The Commission shall\r\nprovide information to the Member States when it decides to withdraw an\r\nundertaking.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\nAny interested party or Member State may submit information showing prima facie evidence of a breach of an\r\nundertaking. The subsequent assessment of whether or not a breach of an\r\nundertaking has occurred shall normally be concluded within six months, but in\r\nno case later than nine months following a duly substantiated request.\nThe Commission may request the assistance\r\nof the competent authorities of the Member States in the monitoring of\r\nundertakings.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(4)\n10. A provisional duty may be imposed in\r\naccordance with Article 7 on the basis of the best information available where\r\nthere is reason to believe that an undertaking is being breached, or in the\r\ncase of breach or withdrawal of an undertaking, where the investigation which\r\nled to the undertaking has not been concluded.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 9\nTermination without measures;\r\nimposition of definitive duties\n1. Where the complaint is withdrawn,\r\nproceedings may be terminated unless such termination would not be in the \u00d6 Union\u2019s \u00d5 interest.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(5)\n2. Where protective measures are\r\nunnecessary, the investigation or proceedings shall be terminated. The\r\nCommission shall terminate the investigation in accordance with the examination\r\nprocedure referred to in Article 15(3).\n\u00ea 1225/2009\n3. For proceedings initiated pursuant to\r\nArticle 5(9), injury shall normally be regarded as negligible where the\r\nimports concerned represent less than the volumes set out in Article 5(7).\r\nFor the same proceedings, there shall be immediate termination where it is\r\ndetermined that the margin of dumping is less than 2 %, expressed as a\r\npercentage of the export price, provided that it is only the investigation that\r\nshall be terminated where the margin is below 2 % for individual exporters\r\nand they shall remain subject to the proceedings and may be reinvestigated in\r\nany subsequent review carried out for the country concerned pursuant to\r\nArticle 11.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(5) (adapted)\n4. Where the facts as finally established\r\nshow that there is dumping and injury caused thereby, and the Union interest\r\ncalls for intervention in accordance with Article 21, a definitive anti\u2011dumping\r\nduty shall be imposed by the Commission acting in accordance with the examination\r\nprocedure referred to in Article 15(3). Where provisional duties are in force,\r\nthe Commission shall initiate that procedure no later than one month before the\r\nexpiry of such duties.\nThe amount of the anti-dumping duty shall\r\nnot exceed the margin of dumping established but it should be less than the\r\nmargin if such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the Union\r\nindustry.\n\u00ea 765/2012\r\nArt. 1\n5. An anti-dumping duty shall be imposed in\r\nthe appropriate amounts in each case, on a non-discriminatory basis, on imports\r\nof a product from all sources found to be dumped and causing injury, except for\r\nimports from those sources from which undertakings under the terms of this\r\nRegulation have been accepted.\nThe Regulation imposing anti-dumping\r\nmeasures shall specify the duty for each supplier or, if that is impracticable,\r\nthe supplying country concerned. Suppliers which are legally distinct from\r\nother suppliers or which are legally distinct from the State may nevertheless\r\nbe considered as a single entity for the purpose of specifying the duty. For\r\nthe application of this subparagraph, account may be taken of factors such as\r\nthe existence of structural or corporate links between the suppliers and the\r\nState or between suppliers, control or material influence by the State in\r\nrespect of pricing and output, or the economic structure of the supplying\r\ncountry.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\n\u00e81 1168/2012 Art. 1.2\n\u00e82 37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .22(6)\n\u00e83 37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .22(7)\n6. \u00e81 When the Commission has limited its \u00d6 investigation \u00d5 in accordance\r\nwith Article 17, any anti-dumping duty applied to imports from exporters\r\nor producers which have made themselves known in accordance with Article 17 but\r\nwere not included in the \u00d6 investigation \u00d5 shall not\r\nexceed the weighted average margin of dumping established with respect to the\r\nparties in the sample, irrespective of whether the normal value for such\r\nparties is determined on the basis of Article 2(1) to (6) or point (a) of\r\nArticle 2(7). \u00e7\nFor the purpose of this paragraph, the\r\nCommission shall disregard any zero and de minimis margins, and margins\r\nestablished in the circumstances referred to in Article 18.\nIndividual duties shall be applied to\r\nimports from any exporter or producer which is granted individual treatment, as\r\nprovided for in Article 17.\nArticle 10\nRetroactivity\n1. Provisional measures and definitive anti-dumping\r\nduties shall only be applied to products which enter free circulation after the\r\ntime when the \u00d6 measure \u00d5 taken pursuant\r\nto Article 7(1) or 9(4), as the case may be, enters into force, subject to\r\nthe exceptions set out in this Regulation.\n\u00e82 2. Where a provisional duty has been applied and\r\nthe facts as finally established show that there is dumping and injury, the\r\nCommission shall decide, irrespective of whether a definitive anti-dumping duty\r\nis to be imposed, what proportion of the provisional duty is to be definitively\r\ncollected. \u00e7 For \u00d6 that \u00d5 purpose,\r\n\u2018injury\u2019 shall not include material \u00d6 delay \u00d5 of the\r\nestablishment of a \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, nor\r\nthreat of material injury, except where it is found that this would, in the\r\nabsence of provisional measures, have developed into material injury. In all\r\nother cases involving such threat or \u00d6 delay \u00d5, any\r\nprovisional amounts shall be released and definitive duties can only be imposed\r\nfrom the date \u00d6 on\r\nwhich \u00d5 a final\r\ndetermination of threat or material \u00d6 delay \u00d5 is made.\n3. If the definitive anti-dumping duty is\r\nhigher than the provisional duty, the difference shall not be collected. If the\r\ndefinitive duty is lower than the provisional duty, the duty shall be\r\nrecalculated. Where a final determination is negative, the provisional duty shall\r\nnot be confirmed.\n4. A definitive anti-dumping duty may be\r\nlevied on products which were entered for consumption no more than 90 days\r\nprior to the date of application of provisional measures but not prior to the\r\ninitiation of the investigation, provided that:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00d6 the \u00d5 imports have\r\nbeen registered in accordance with Article 14(5);\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  the importers concerned \u00d6 have been\r\ngiven \u00d5 an opportunity\r\nto comment \u00d6 by the\r\nCommission \u00d5; \n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 there is, for the product in\r\nquestion, a history of dumping over an extended period, or the importer was\r\naware of, or should have been aware of, the dumping as regards the extent of\r\nthe dumping and the injury alleged or found; and\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in addition to the level of\r\nimports which caused injury during the investigation period, there is a further\r\nsubstantial rise in imports which, in the light of its timing and volume and\r\nother circumstances, is likely to seriously undermine the remedial effect of the\r\ndefinitive anti-dumping duty to be applied.\n5. In cases of breach or withdrawal of\r\nundertakings, definitive duties may be levied on goods entered for free\r\ncirculation no more than 90 days before the application of provisional\r\nmeasures, provided that \u00d6 the \u00d5 imports have\r\nbeen registered in accordance with Article 14(5), and that any such\r\nretroactive assessment shall not apply to imports entered before the breach or\r\nwithdrawal of the undertaking.\nArticle 11\nDuration, reviews and refunds\n1. An anti-dumping measure shall remain in\r\nforce only as long as, and to the extent that, it is necessary to counteract\r\nthe dumping which is causing injury.\n2. A definitive anti-dumping measure shall\r\nexpire five years from its imposition or five years from the date of the\r\nconclusion of the most recent review which has covered both dumping and injury,\r\nunless it is determined in a review that the expiry would be likely to lead to\r\na continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury. Such an expiry review shall\r\nbe initiated on the initiative of the Commission, or upon \u00d6 a \u00d5 request made\r\nby or on behalf of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers, and\r\nthe measure shall remain in force pending the outcome of such review.\nAn expiry review shall be initiated where\r\nthe request contains sufficient evidence that the expiry of the measures would\r\nbe likely to result in a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury. Such\r\nlikelihood may, for example, be indicated by evidence of continued dumping and\r\ninjury or evidence that the removal of injury is partly or solely due to the\r\nexistence of measures or evidence that the circumstances of the exporters, or\r\nmarket conditions, are such that they would indicate the likelihood of further\r\ninjurious dumping.\nIn carrying out investigations under this\r\nparagraph, the exporters, importers, the representatives of the exporting\r\ncountry and the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\nshall be provided with the opportunity to amplify, rebut or comment on the\r\nmatters set out in the review request, and conclusions shall be reached with\r\ndue account taken of all relevant and duly documented evidence presented in\r\nrelation to the question as to whether the expiry of measures would be likely,\r\nor unlikely, to lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury.\nA notice of impending expiry shall be\r\npublished in the Official Journal of the European Union at an\r\nappropriate time in the final year of the period of application of the measures\r\nas defined in this paragraph. Thereafter, the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\nshall, no later than three months before the end of the five-year period, be\r\nentitled to lodge a review request in accordance with the second subparagraph.\r\nA notice announcing the actual expiry of measures pursuant to this paragraph\r\nshall also be published.\n3. The need for the continued imposition of\r\nmeasures may also be reviewed, where warranted, on the initiative of the\r\nCommission or at the request of a Member State or, provided that a reasonable\r\nperiod of time of at least one year has elapsed since the imposition of the\r\ndefinitive measure, upon a request by any exporter or importer or by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\nwhich contains sufficient evidence substantiating the need for such an interim\r\nreview.\nAn interim review shall be initiated where\r\nthe request contains sufficient evidence that the continued imposition of the\r\nmeasure is no longer necessary to offset dumping and/or that the injury would\r\nbe unlikely to continue or recur if the measure were removed or varied, or that\r\nthe existing measure is not, or is no longer, sufficient to counteract the\r\ndumping which is causing injury.\nIn carrying out investigations pursuant to\r\nthis paragraph, the Commission may, inter alia, consider whether the\r\ncircumstances with regard to dumping and injury have changed significantly, or\r\nwhether existing measures are achieving the intended results in removing the\r\ninjury previously established under Article 3. In \u00d6 those \u00d5 respects,\r\naccount shall be taken in the final determination of all relevant and duly\r\ndocumented evidence.\n4. A review shall also be carried out for\r\nthe purpose of determining individual margins of dumping for new exporters in\r\nthe exporting country in question which have not exported the product during\r\nthe period of investigation on which the measures were based.\nThe review shall be initiated where a new\r\nexporter or producer can show that it is not related to any of the exporters or\r\nproducers in the exporting country which are subject to the anti-dumping\r\nmeasures on the product, and that it has actually exported to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 following the\r\ninvestigation period, or where it can demonstrate that it has entered into an\r\nirrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\n\u00e83 A review for a new exporter shall be initiated and\r\ncarried out on an accelerated basis after Union producers have been given an\r\nopportunity to comment. \u00e7 The Commission\r\nRegulation initiating a review shall repeal the duty in force with regard to\r\nthe new exporter concerned by amending the Regulation which has imposed such\r\nduty, and by making imports subject to registration in accordance with\r\nArticle 14(5) in order to ensure that, should the review result in a\r\ndetermination of dumping in respect of such an exporter, anti-dumping duties\r\ncan be levied retroactively to the date of the initiation of the review.\nThe provisions of this paragraph shall not\r\napply where duties have been imposed under Article 9(6).\n5. The relevant provisions of this\r\nRegulation with regard to procedures and the conduct of investigations,\r\nexcluding those relating to time limits, shall apply to any review carried out\r\npursuant to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.\nReviews carried out pursuant to\r\nparagraphs 2 and 3 shall be carried out expeditiously and shall\r\nnormally be concluded within 12 months of the date of initiation of the review.\r\nIn any event, reviews pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 shall in all\r\ncases be concluded within 15 months of initiation.\nReviews pursuant to paragraph 4 shall\r\nin all cases be concluded within nine months of the date of initiation.\nIf a review carried out pursuant to\r\nparagraph 2 is initiated while a review under paragraph 3 is ongoing\r\nin the same proceeding, the review pursuant to paragraph 3 shall be\r\nconcluded at the same time as the review pursuant to paragraph 2.\nIf the investigation is not completed\r\nwithin the deadlines specified in the second, third and fourth subparagraphs,\r\nthe measures shall:\n\u2013                        \r\nexpire in investigations pursuant to\r\nparagraph 2,\n\u2013                        \r\nexpire in the case of investigations carried out\r\npursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 in parallel, where either the investigation\r\npursuant to paragraph 2 was initiated while a review under\r\nparagraph 3 was ongoing in the same proceeding or where such reviews were\r\ninitiated at the same time, or\n\u2013                        \r\nremain unchanged in investigations pursuant to\r\nparagraphs 3 and 4.\nA notice announcing the actual expiry or\r\nmaintenance of the measures pursuant to this paragraph shall then be published\r\nin the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(7) (adapted)\n6. Reviews pursuant to this Article shall\r\nbe initiated by the Commission. The Commission shall decide whether or not to\r\ninitiate reviews pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article in accordance with the\r\nadvisory procedure referred to in Article 15(2). The Commission shall also\r\nprovide information to the Member States once an operator or a Member State has\r\nsubmitted a request justifying the initiation of a review pursuant to\r\nparagraphs 3 and 4 of this Article and the Commission has completed its\r\nanalysis thereof, or once the Commission has itself determined that the need\r\nfor the continued imposition of measures should be reviewed.\nWhere warranted by reviews, measures shall,\r\nin accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 15(3), be\r\nrepealed or maintained pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, or repealed,\r\nmaintained or amended pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article.\nWhere measures are repealed for individual\r\nexporters, but not for the country as a whole, such exporters shall remain\r\nsubject to the proceedings and may, automatically, be reinvestigated in any\r\nsubsequent review carried out for that country pursuant to this Article.\n\u00ea 1225/2009 (adapted)\n7. Where a review of measures pursuant to\r\nparagraph 3 is in progress at the end of the period of application of\r\nmeasures as defined in paragraph 2, such review shall also cover the\r\ncircumstances set out in paragraph 2.\n8. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, an\r\nimporter may request reimbursement of duties collected where it is shown that\r\nthe dumping margin, on the basis of which duties were paid, has been\r\neliminated, or reduced to a level which is below the level of the duty in\r\nforce.\nIn requesting a refund of anti-dumping\r\nduties, the importer shall submit an application to the Commission. The\r\napplication shall be submitted via the Member State of the territory in which\r\nthe products were released for free circulation, within six months of the date\r\non which the amount of the definitive duties to be levied was duly determined\r\nby the competent authorities or of the date on which a decision was made\r\ndefinitively to collect the amounts secured by way of provisional duty. Member\r\nStates shall forward the request to the Commission forthwith.\nAn application for refund shall only be\r\nconsidered to be duly supported by evidence where it contains precise\r\ninformation on the amount of refund of anti-dumping duties claimed and all\r\ncustoms documentation relating to the calculation and payment of such amount.\r\nIt shall also include evidence, for a representative period, of normal values\r\nand export prices to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 for the\r\nexporter or producer to which the duty applies. In cases where the importer is\r\nnot associated with the exporter or producer concerned and such information is\r\nnot immediately available, or where the exporter or producer is unwilling to\r\nrelease it to the importer, the application shall contain a statement from the\r\nexporter or producer that the dumping margin has been reduced or eliminated, as\r\nspecified in this Article, and that the relevant supporting evidence will be\r\nprovided to the Commission. Where such evidence is not forthcoming from the\r\nexporter or producer within a reasonable period of time the application shall\r\nbe rejected.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(7)\nThe Commission shall decide whether and to\r\nwhat extent the application should be granted, or it may decide at any time to\r\ninitiate an interim review, whereupon the information and findings from such a\r\nreview carried out in accordance with the provisions applicable for such reviews\r\nshall be used to determine whether and to what extent a refund is justified.\r\nThe Commission shall provide information to the Member States once it has\r\ncompleted its analysis of the application. \n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\n\u00e81 Corrigendum, OJ L 7, 12.1.2010, p. 22\nRefunds of duties shall normally take place\r\nwithin 12 months, and in no circumstances more than 18 months after the date on\r\nwhich a request for a refund, duly supported by evidence, has been made by an\r\nimporter of the product subject to the anti-dumping duty.\nThe payment of any refund authorised should\r\nnormally be made by Member States within 90 days of the Commission's\r\ndecision.\n9. In all review or refund investigations\r\ncarried out pursuant to this Article, the Commission shall, provided that\r\ncircumstances have not changed, apply the same methodology as in the\r\ninvestigation which led to the duty, with due account being taken of\r\nArticle 2, and in particular paragraphs 11 and 12 thereof, and\r\nof Article 17.\n10. In any investigation carried our\r\npursuant to this Article, the Commission shall examine the reliability of\r\nexport prices in accordance with Article 2. However, where it is decided\r\nto construct the export price in accordance with Article 2(9), it shall\r\ncalculate it with no deduction for the amount of anti-dumping duties paid when\r\nconclusive evidence is provided that the duty is duly reflected in resale\r\nprices and the subsequent selling prices in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\nArticle 12\n\u00e81 Absorption \u00e7\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(8)\n1. Where the Union industry or any other\r\ninterested party submit, normally within two years from the entry into force of\r\nthe measures, sufficient information showing that, after the original\r\ninvestigation period and prior to or following the imposition of measures,\r\nexport prices have decreased or that there has been no movement, or\r\ninsufficient movement, in the resale prices or subsequent selling prices of the\r\nimported product in the Union, the Commission may reopen the investigation to\r\nexamine whether the measure has had effects on the above-mentioned prices. The\r\nCommission shall provide information to the Member States once an interested\r\nparty has submitted sufficient information justifying the reopening of the\r\ninvestigation and the Commission has completed its analysis thereof.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\n\u00e81 Corrigendum, OJ L 7, 12.1.2010, p. 22\nThe investigation may also be reopened,\r\nunder the conditions set out \u00d6 in the\r\nfirst subparagraph \u00d5, at the\r\ninitiative of the Commission or at the request of a Member State.\n2. \u00e81 During a reinvestigation pursuant to this Article,\r\nexporters, importers and \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\nshall be provided with an opportunity to clarify the situation with regard to\r\nresale prices and subsequent selling prices. If it is concluded that the\r\nmeasure should have led to movements in such prices, then, in order to remove\r\nthe injury previously established in accordance with Article 3, export\r\nprices shall be reassessed in accordance with Article 2 and dumping\r\nmargins shall be recalculated to take account of the reassessed export prices.\r\nWhere it is considered that the conditions of Article 12(1) are met due to\r\na fall in export prices which has occurred after the original investigation\r\nperiod and prior to or following the imposition of measures, dumping margins\r\nmay be recalculated to take account of such lower export prices. \u00e7\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(8)\n3. Where a reinvestigation pursuant to this\r\nArticle shows increased dumping, the measures in force may be amended by the\r\nCommission acting in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in\r\nArticle 15(3), in accordance with the new findings on export prices. The amount\r\nof the anti-dumping duty imposed pursuant to this Article shall not exceed\r\ntwice the amount of the duty imposed initially.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\n4. The relevant provisions of\r\nArticles 5 and 6 shall apply to any reinvestigation carried out\r\npursuant to this Article, except that such reinvestigation shall be carried out\r\nexpeditiously and shall normally be concluded within six months of the date of\r\ninitiation of the reinvestigation. In any event, such reinvestigations shall in\r\nall cases be concluded within nine months of initiation of the reinvestigation.\nIf the reinvestigation is not completed\r\nwithin the deadlines specified in the first subparagraph, measures shall remain\r\nunchanged. A notice announcing the maintenance of the measures pursuant to this\r\nparagraph shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n5. Alleged changes in normal value shall\r\nonly be taken into account under this Article where complete information on\r\nrevised normal values, duly substantiated by evidence, is made available to the\r\nCommission within the time limits set out in the notice of initiation of an\r\ninvestigation. Where an investigation involves a re-examination of normal values,\r\nimports may be made subject to registration in accordance with\r\nArticle 14(5) pending the outcome of the reinvestigation.\nArticle 13\nCircumvention\n1. Anti-dumping duties imposed pursuant to\r\nthis Regulation may be extended to imports from third countries of the like\r\nproduct, whether slightly modified or not, or to imports of the slightly\r\nmodified like product from the country subject to measures, or parts thereof,\r\nwhen circumvention of the measures in force is taking place.\nAnti-dumping duties not exceeding the\r\nresidual anti-dumping duty imposed in accordance with Article 9(5) may be\r\nextended to imports from companies benefiting from individual duties in the\r\ncountries subject to measures when circumvention of the measures in force is\r\ntaking place.\nCircumvention shall be defined as a change\r\nin the pattern of trade between third countries and the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or between\r\nindividual companies in the country subject to measures and the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , which stems\r\nfrom a practice, process or work for which there is insufficient due cause or\r\neconomic justification other than the imposition of the duty, and where there\r\nis evidence of injury or that the remedial effects of the duty are being\r\nundermined in terms of the prices and/or quantities of the like product, and\r\nwhere there is evidence of dumping in relation to the normal values previously\r\nestablished for the like product, if necessary in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of Article 2.\nThe\r\npractice, process or work referred to in the first subparagraph includes, inter\r\nalia:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the slight modification of the\r\nproduct concerned to make it fall under customs codes which are normally not\r\nsubject to the measures, provided that the modification does not alter its\r\nessential characteristics;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the consignment of the product\r\nsubject to measures via third countries;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the reorganisation by exporters\r\nor producers of their patterns and channels of sales in the country subject to\r\nmeasures in order to eventually have their products exported to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 through\r\nproducers benefiting from an individual duty rate lower than that applicable to\r\nthe products of the manufacturers; \n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in the circumstances indicated in\r\nparagraph 2, the assembly of parts by an assembly operation in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or a third\r\ncountry.\n2.

Investigations shall be initiated\r\npursuant to this Article on the initiative of the Commission or at the request\r\nof a Member State or any interested party on the basis of sufficient evidence\r\nregarding the factors set out in paragraph 1. Initiations shall be made by\r\nCommission Regulation which may also instruct customs authorities to \u00d6 subject \u00d5 imports to\r\nregistration in accordance with Article 14(5) or to request guarantees. The\r\nCommission shall provide information to the Member States once an interested\r\nparty or a Member State has submitted a request justifying the initiation of an\r\ninvestigation and the Commission has completed its analysis thereof, or where\r\nthe Commission has itself determined that there is a need to initiate an\r\ninvestigation.\nInvestigations shall be carried out by the\r\nCommission.

The extension shall take effect from the date on which registration\r\nwas imposed pursuant to Article 14(5), or on which guarantees were requested.\r\nThe relevant procedural provisions of this Regulation \u00d6 concerning \u00d5 the initiation\r\nand the conduct of investigations shall apply pursuant to this Article.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\n4. Imports shall not be subject to\r\nregistration pursuant to Article 14(5) or measures where they are traded\r\nby companies which benefit from exemptions.\nRequests for exemptions duly supported by\r\nevidence shall be submitted within the time limits established in the\r\nCommission regulation initiating the investigation.\nWhere the circumventing practice, process\r\nor work takes place outside the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , exemptions\r\nmay be granted to producers of the product concerned that can show that they\r\nare not related to any producer subject to the measures and that are found not\r\nto be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in paragraphs 1\r\nand 2 of this Article.\nWhere the circumventing practice, process\r\nor work takes place inside the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , exemptions\r\nmay be granted to importers that can show that they are not related to\r\nproducers subject to the measures.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(9) (adapted)\n\u00d6 Those \u00d5 exemptions\r\nshall be granted by decision of the Commission and shall remain valid for the\r\nperiod and under the conditions set down therein. The Commission shall provide\r\ninformation to the Member States once it has concluded its analysis.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\nProvided that the conditions set in\r\nArticle 11(4) are met, exemptions may also be granted after the conclusion\r\nof the investigation leading to the extension of the measures.\nProvided that at least one year has lapsed\r\nfrom the extension of the measures, and in case the number of parties\r\nrequesting or potentially requesting an exemption is significant, the\r\nCommission may decide to initiate a review of the extension of the measures.\r\nAny such review shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of\r\nArticle 11(5) as applicable to reviews pursuant to Article 11(3).\n5. Nothing in this Article shall preclude\r\nthe normal application of the provisions in force concerning customs duties.\nArticle 14\nGeneral provisions\n1. Provisional or definitive anti-dumping\r\nduties shall be imposed by Regulation, and collected by Member States in the\r\nform, at the rate specified and according to the other criteria laid down in\r\nthe Regulation imposing such duties. Such duties shall also be collected\r\nindependently of the customs duties, taxes and other charges normally imposed\r\non imports.\nNo product shall be subject to both\r\nanti-dumping and countervailing duties for the purpose of dealing with one and\r\nthe same situation arising from dumping or from export subsidisation.\n2. Regulations imposing provisional or\r\ndefinitive anti-dumping duties, and Regulations or Decisions accepting\r\nundertakings or terminating investigations or proceedings, shall be published\r\nin the Official Journal of the European Union.\nSuch Regulations or Decisions shall contain\r\nin particular, and with due regard to the protection of confidential\r\ninformation, the names of the exporters, if possible, or of the countries\r\ninvolved, a description of the product and a summary of the material facts and\r\nconsiderations relevant to the dumping and injury determinations. In each case,\r\na copy of the Regulation or Decision shall be sent to known interested parties.\r\nThe provisions of this paragraph shall apply mutatis mutandis to reviews.\n3. Special provisions, in particular with\r\nregard to the common definition of the concept of origin, as contained in\r\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92[11],\r\nmay be adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(10)\n4. In the Union interest, measures imposed\r\npursuant to this Regulation may be suspended by a decision of the Commission in\r\naccordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 15(2) for a\r\nperiod of nine months. The suspension may be extended for a further period, not\r\nexceeding one year, by the Commission acting in accordance with the advisory\r\nprocedure referred to in Article 15(2).\nMeasures may only be suspended where market\r\nconditions have temporarily changed to an extent that injury would be unlikely\r\nto resume as a result of the suspension, and provided that the Union industry\r\nhas been given an opportunity to comment and those comments have been taken\r\ninto account. Measures may at any time be reinstated in accordance with the\r\nadvisory procedure referred to in Article 15(2) if the reason for suspension is\r\nno longer applicable.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\n\u00e81 37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .22(10)\n\u00e81 5. The Commission may, after having informed the\r\nMember States in due time, direct the customs authorities to take the\r\nappropriate steps to register imports, so that measures may subsequently be\r\napplied against those imports from the date of such registration. \u00e7 Imports may be\r\nmade subject to registration following a request from the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry which\r\ncontains sufficient evidence to justify such action. Registration shall be\r\nintroduced by regulation which shall specify the purpose of the action and, if\r\nappropriate, the estimated amount of possible future liability. Imports shall\r\nnot be made subject to registration for a period longer than nine months.\n6. Member States shall report to the\r\nCommission every month on the import trade in products subject to investigation\r\nand to measures, and on the amount of duties collected pursuant to this\r\nRegulation.\n7. Without prejudice to paragraph 6,\r\nthe Commission may request Member States, on a case-by-case basis, to supply\r\ninformation necessary to monitor efficiently the application of measures. In this\r\nrespect, the provisions of Article 6(3) and (4) shall apply. Any data\r\nsubmitted by Member States pursuant to this Article shall be covered by the\r\nprovisions of Article 19(6).\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(11) (adapted)\nArticle 15\nCommittee procedure\n1. The Commission shall be assisted by a\r\nCommittee. That Committee shall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 182/2011.\n2. Where reference is made to this\r\nparagraph, Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\n3. Where reference is made to this\r\nparagraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\n4. Where reference is made to this\r\nparagraph, Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, in conjunction with\r\nArticle 4 thereof, shall apply.\n5. Pursuant to Article 3(5) of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 182/2011, where the written procedure \u00d6 is used\r\nto \u00d5 adopt\r\ndefinitive measures pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article, or \u00d6 to\r\ndecide \u00d5 on the\r\ninitiation or non-initiation of expiry reviews pursuant to Article 11(6) of\r\nthis Regulation, such procedure shall be terminated without result where,\r\nwithin the time limit set down by the chair, the chair so decides or a majority\r\nof committee members as defined in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 182/2011 so request. Where the written procedure \u00d6 is\r\nused \u00d5 in other\r\ninstances where there has been a discussion of the draft measure in the\r\ncommittee, such procedure shall be terminated without result where, within the\r\ntime limit set down by the chair, the chair so decides or a simple majority of\r\ncommittee members so request. Where the written procedure \u00d6 is\r\nused \u00d5 in other\r\ninstances where there has not been a discussion of the draft measure in the\r\ncommittee, such procedure shall be terminated without result where, within the\r\ntime limit set down by the chair, the chair so decides or at least a quarter of\r\ncommittee members so request.\n6. The Committee may consider any matter\r\nrelating to the application of this Regulation, raised by the Commission or at\r\nthe request of a Member State. Member States may request information and may\r\nexchange views in the Committee or directly with the Commission.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 16\nVerification visits\n1. The Commission shall, where it considers\r\nit appropriate, carry out visits to examine the records of importers,\r\nexporters, traders, agents, producers, trade associations and organisations and\r\nto verify information provided on dumping and injury. In the absence of a\r\nproper and timely reply, a verification visit may not be carried out.\n2. The Commission may carry out\r\ninvestigations in third countries as required, provided that it obtains the\r\nagreement of the firms concerned, that it notifies the representatives of the\r\ngovernment of the country in question and that the latter does not object to\r\nthe investigation. As soon as the agreement of the firms concerned has been\r\nobtained the Commission \u00d6 shall \u00d5 notify the\r\nauthorities of the exporting country of the names and addresses of the firms to\r\nbe visited and the dates agreed.\n3. The firms concerned shall be advised of\r\nthe nature of the information to be verified during verification visits and of\r\nany further information which needs to be provided during such visits, though\r\nthis should not preclude requests made during the verification for further\r\ndetails to be provided in the light of information obtained.\n4. In investigations carried out pursuant\r\nto paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the Commission shall be assisted by\r\nofficials of those Member States who so request.\nArticle 17\nSampling\n1. In cases where the number of\r\ncomplainants, exporters or importers, types of product or transactions is\r\nlarge, the investigation may be limited to a reasonable number of parties,\r\nproducts or transactions by using samples which are statistically valid on the\r\nbasis of information available at the time of the selection, or to the largest\r\nrepresentative volume of production, sales or exports which can reasonably be\r\ninvestigated within the time available.\n2. The final selection of parties, types of\r\nproducts or transactions made under these sampling provisions shall rest with\r\nthe Commission, though preference shall be given to choosing a sample in\r\nconsultation with, and with the consent of, the parties concerned, provided \u00d6 that \u00d5 such parties\r\nmake themselves known and make sufficient information available, within three\r\nweeks of initiation of the investigation, to enable a representative sample to\r\nbe chosen.\n3. In cases where the \u00d6 investigation \u00d5 has been\r\nlimited in accordance with this Article, an individual margin of dumping shall,\r\nnevertheless, be calculated for any exporter or producer not initially selected\r\nwho submits the necessary information within the time limits provided for in\r\nthis Regulation, except where the number of exporters or producers is so large\r\nthat individual examinations would be unduly burdensome and would prevent completion\r\nof the investigation in good time.\n4. Where it is decided to sample and there\r\nis a degree of non-cooperation by some or all of the parties selected which is\r\nlikely to materially affect the outcome of the investigation, a new sample may\r\nbe selected.\nHowever, if a material degree of\r\nnon-cooperation persists or there is insufficient time to select a new sample,\r\nthe relevant provisions of Article 18 shall apply.\nArticle 18\nNon-cooperation\n1. In cases in which any interested party\r\nrefuses access to, or otherwise does not provide, necessary information within\r\nthe time limits provided in this Regulation, or significantly impedes the\r\ninvestigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be\r\nmade on the basis of the facts available.\nWhere it is found that any interested party\r\nhas supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be\r\ndisregarded and use may be made of facts available.\nInterested parties should be made aware of\r\nthe consequences of non-cooperation.\n2. Failure to give a computerised response\r\nshall not be deemed to constitute non-cooperation, provided that the interested\r\nparty shows that presenting the response as requested would result in an\r\nunreasonable extra burden or unreasonable additional cost.\n3. Where the information submitted by an\r\ninterested party is not ideal in all respects it should nevertheless not be\r\ndisregarded, provided that any deficiencies are not such as to cause undue\r\ndifficulty in arriving at a reasonably accurate finding and that the\r\ninformation is appropriately submitted in good time and is verifiable, and that\r\nthe party has acted to the best of its ability.\n4. If evidence or information is not\r\naccepted, the supplying party shall be informed forthwith of the reasons\r\ntherefor and shall be granted an opportunity to provide further explanations\r\nwithin the time limit specified. If the explanations are considered\r\nunsatisfactory, the reasons for rejection of such evidence or information shall\r\nbe disclosed and given in published findings.\n5. If determinations, including those\r\nregarding normal value, are based on the provisions of paragraph 1,\r\nincluding the information supplied in the complaint, it shall, where\r\npracticable and with due regard to the time limits of the investigation, be\r\nchecked by reference to information from other independent sources which may be\r\navailable, such as published price lists, official import statistics and\r\ncustoms returns, or information obtained from other interested parties during\r\nthe investigation.\nSuch information may include relevant data\r\npertaining to the world market or other representative markets, where\r\nappropriate.\n6. If an interested party does not\r\ncooperate, or cooperates only partially, so that relevant information is\r\nthereby withheld, the result may be less favourable to the party than if it had\r\ncooperated.\nArticle 19\nConfidentiality\n1. Any information which is by nature\r\nconfidential (for example, because its disclosure would be of significant\r\ncompetitive advantage to a competitor or would have a significantly adverse\r\neffect upon a person supplying the information or upon a person from whom he\r\nhas acquired the information) or which is provided on a confidential basis by\r\nparties to an investigation shall, if good cause is shown, be treated as such\r\nby the authorities.\n2. Interested parties providing\r\nconfidential information shall be required to \u00d6 provide \u00d5\r\nnon-confidential summaries thereof. Those summaries shall be in sufficient\r\ndetail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information\r\nsubmitted in confidence. In exceptional circumstances, such parties may\r\nindicate that such information is not susceptible of summary. In such\r\nexceptional circumstances, a statement of the reasons why such \u00d6 summarisation \u00d5 is not\r\npossible must be provided.\n3. If it is considered that a request for\r\nconfidentiality is not warranted and if the supplier of the information is\r\neither unwilling to make the information available or to authorise its\r\ndisclosure in generalised or summary form, such information may be disregarded\r\nunless it can be satisfactorily demonstrated from appropriate sources that the\r\ninformation is correct. Requests for confidentiality shall not be arbitrarily\r\nrejected.\n4. This Article shall not preclude the\r\ndisclosure of general information by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 authorities,\r\nand in particular of the reasons on which decisions taken pursuant to this\r\nRegulation are based, or disclosure of the evidence relied on by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 authorities in\r\nso far as is necessary to explain those reasons in court proceedings. Such\r\ndisclosure must take into account the legitimate interests of the parties\r\nconcerned that their business secrets should not be divulged.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(12)\n5. The Commission and Member States,\r\nincluding the officials of either, shall not reveal any information received\r\npursuant to this Regulation for which confidential treatment has been requested\r\nby its supplier, without specific permission from that supplier. Exchanges of\r\ninformation between the Commission and Member States, or any internal documents\r\nprepared by the authorities of the Union or the Member States, shall not be\r\ndivulged except as specifically provided for in this Regulation.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\n6. Information received pursuant to this\r\nRegulation shall be used only for the purpose for which it was requested.\nThis provision shall not preclude the use\r\nof information received in the context of one investigation for the purpose of\r\ninitiating other investigations within the same proceedings in relation to the\r\nproduct concerned.\nArticle 20\nDisclosure\n1. The complainants, importers and\r\nexporters and their representative associations, and representatives of the\r\nexporting country, may request disclosure of the details underlying the\r\nessential facts and considerations on the basis of which provisional measures\r\nhave been imposed. Requests for such disclosure shall be made in writing\r\nimmediately following the imposition of provisional measures, and the\r\ndisclosure shall be made in writing as soon as possible thereafter.\n2. The parties mentioned in\r\nparagraph 1 may request final disclosure of the essential facts and\r\nconsiderations on the basis of which it is intended to recommend the imposition\r\nof definitive measures, or the termination of an investigation or proceedings\r\nwithout the imposition of measures, particular attention being paid to the\r\ndisclosure of any facts or considerations which are different from those used\r\nfor any provisional measures.\n3. Requests for final disclosure, as\r\ndefined in paragraph 2, shall be addressed to the Commission in writing\r\nand be received, in cases where a provisional duty has been \u00d6 imposed \u00d5, no later than\r\none month after publication of the imposition of that duty. Where a provisional\r\nduty has not been \u00d6 imposed \u00d5, parties shall\r\nbe provided with an opportunity to request final disclosure within time limits\r\nset by the Commission.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(13)\n4. Final disclosure shall be given in\r\nwriting. It shall be made, due regard being had to the protection of\r\nconfidential information, as soon as possible and, normally, no later than one\r\nmonth prior to the initiation of the procedures set out in Article 9. Where the\r\nCommission is not in a position to disclose certain facts or considerations at\r\nthat time, they shall be disclosed as soon as possible thereafter.\nDisclosure shall not prejudice any subsequent\r\ndecision which may be taken by the Commission, but where such a decision is\r\nbased on any different facts and considerations they shall be disclosed as soon\r\nas possible.\n5. Representations made after final\r\ndisclosure is given shall be taken into consideration only if received within a\r\nperiod to be set by the Commission in each case, which shall be at least\r\nten days, due consideration being given to the urgency of the matter. A\r\nshorter period may be set whenever an additional final disclosure has to be\r\nmade.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 21\n\u00a0\u00d6 Union \u00d5 interest\n1. A determination as to whether the \u00d6 Union\u2019s \u00d5 interest calls\r\nfor intervention shall be based on an appreciation of all the various interests\r\ntaken as a whole, including the interests of the domestic industry and users\r\nand consumers. A determination pursuant to this Article shall only be made\r\nwhere all parties have been given the opportunity to make their views known\r\npursuant to paragraph 2. In such an examination, the need to eliminate the\r\ntrade distorting effects of injurious dumping and to restore effective\r\ncompetition shall be given special consideration. Measures, as determined on\r\nthe basis of the dumping and injury found, may not be applied where the\r\nauthorities, on the basis of all the information submitted, can clearly\r\nconclude that it is not in the \u00d6 Union\u2019s \u00d5 interest to\r\napply such measures.\n2. In order to provide a sound basis on\r\nwhich the authorities can take account of all views and information in the\r\ndecision as to whether or not the imposition of measures is in the \u00d6 Union\u2019s \u00d5 interest, the\r\ncomplainants, importers and their representative associations, representative\r\nusers and representative consumer organisations may, within the time limits\r\nspecified in the notice of initiation of the anti-dumping investigation, make\r\nthemselves known and provide information to the Commission. Such information,\r\nor appropriate summaries thereof, shall be made available to the other parties\r\nspecified in this Article, and they shall be entitled to respond to such\r\ninformation.\n3. The parties which have acted in \u00d6 accordance \u00d5 with\r\nparagraph 2 may request a hearing. Such requests shall be granted\r\nwhen they are submitted within the time limits set in paragraph 2, and\r\nwhen they set out the reasons, in terms of the \u00d6 Union\u2019s \u00d5 interest, why\r\nthe parties should be heard.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .22(14) (adapted)\n4. The parties which have acted in \u00d6 accordance \u00d5 with paragraph\r\n2 may provide comments on the application of any provisional duties. Such\r\ncomments shall be received within 25 days of the date of application of such\r\nmeasures if they are to be taken into account and they, or appropriate\r\nsummaries thereof, shall be made available to other parties who shall be\r\nentitled to respond to such comments.\n5. The Commission shall examine the information\r\nwhich is properly submitted and the extent to which it is representative, and\r\nthe results of such analysis, together with an opinion on its merits, shall be\r\ntransmitted to the committee as part of the draft measure submitted pursuant to\r\nArticle 9. The views expressed in the committee should be taken into account by\r\nthe Commission under the conditions provided for in Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 182/2011.\n6. The parties which have acted in\r\nconformity with paragraph 2 may request \u00d6 that \u00d5 the facts and\r\nconsiderations on which final decisions are likely to be taken be made\r\navailable to them. Such information shall be made available to the extent\r\npossible and without prejudice to any subsequent decision taken by the\r\nCommission.\n\u00ea 1225/2009\r\n(adapted)\n7. Information shall only be taken into\r\naccount where it is supported by actual evidence which substantiates its\r\nvalidity.\nArticle 22\nFinal provisions\nThis Regulation shall not preclude the\r\napplication of:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 any special rules laid down in\r\nagreements concluded between the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 and third\r\ncountries;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 Regulations in\r\nthe agricultural sector and Council Regulations (EC) No 1667/2006[12], (EC) No 614/2009[13] and (EC) No 1216/2009[14].
