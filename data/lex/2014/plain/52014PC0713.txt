Such acts\r\nshould be removed from the law acquis of the European Union to improve transparency and give a\r\nhigher degree of certainty for all\r\ncitizens and all Member States.\nThis is in line\r\nwith the Commission's policy on Regulatory Fitness. In its Communication of\r\nJune 2014 on \"Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT): State\r\nof Play and Outlook\"[2],\r\nthe Commission stated that it was screening the acquis in respect of\r\npolice cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to\r\nidentify acts which could be repealed in the context of the expiry of the\r\ntransitional period set out in the Treaties. \nThe Commission has now completed its assessment on the\r\nlegal acts related to the area of freedom, security and justice, including the\r\nformer third pillar acquis. A number of acts adopted in recent decades\r\nhave exhausted all their effects. They are no longer relevant because of their\r\ntemporary nature or because their content has been taken up by successive acts.\r\nFor reasons of legal certainty, the Commission proposes that the measures\r\nreferred to in this proposal are revoked by the European Parliament and the\r\nCouncil. \nI. Decision of the Executive Committee Sch/Com-ex (95) PV 1 rev[3] referred to a\r\nvery specific situation on the prior consultation requested by Portugal vis-\u00e0-vis Indonesian visa applicants. That Decision became obsolete as Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 810/2009[4]\r\n(Visa Code) and Regulation (EC) No 767/2008[5] (VIS Regulation) provided for new rules on the\r\nprior consultation of other Member States. \nII.\r\nDecision of the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (95) 21[6]\r\nrefers to Schengen States' obligation to exchange statistical information for\r\nbetter monitoring migration at the external borders with the support of Schengen\r\nSecretariat. That Decision became obsolete since Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004[7] entrusted FRONTEX\r\nwith carrying out risk analyses regarding emerging risks at the external\r\nborders and developing and operating information systems enabling the exchange\r\nof such information, including the Information and Coordination Network\r\nestablished by Decision\r\n2005/267/EC[8] and European\r\nborder surveillance system established by Regulation (EC) No 1052/2013[9].\nIII. Decision of the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (96) 13 rev 1[10] established\r\nthe principles regulating the rights and obligations of\r\nrepresenting and represented States in respect to the\r\nissuance of Schengen visas in third States where not all Schengen States are\r\nrepresented. That Decision became obsolete after the entry into force of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 810/2009[11] that introduced a new set of rules on\r\nthe representation arrangements in situations where a Member State agrees to represent another Member State for the purpose of examining applications and\r\nissuing visas on behalf of that Member State.\nIV. Decision of the Executive Committee\r\nSCH/Com-ex (97) 39 rev[12] established guiding principles for means\r\nof proof and indicative evidence within the framework of readmission agreements\r\nbetween Schengen States. That Decision became obsolete after the entry into force of Council Regulation\r\n343/2003[13]\r\nand of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1560/2003[14] providing\r\nfor the elements of proof and circumstantial evidence that\r\nshall be used for determining the Member State responsible for examining the\r\napplication for asylum. \nV. Decision\r\nof the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (98) 1 rev 2[15] provided for a number of measures aiming at increasing the\r\nefficiency of checks at external borders. That Decision became obsolete after\r\nthe entry into force of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 562/2006 that introduced\r\nnew rules on checks at external borders and of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 which\r\nentrusted FRONTEX with facilitating the application of Community measures\r\nrelating to the management of external borders.\nVI. Decision of the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (98) 18 rev[16] established a\r\nprocedure to be followed by the Schengen States experiencing serious\r\ndifficulties in obtaining a laissez-passer to repatriate illegal foreign\r\nnationals. That Decision became obsolete since the specific obligations and\r\nprocedures to be complied with by the authorities of the non-EU country and of\r\nEU States for the repatriation of foreign nationals who are irregularly\r\nresiding in the EU are provided for in the readmission agreements that the EU\r\nconcludes with third countries. \nVII. Decision of the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (98) 21[17] approved a number of common rules for affixing\r\nstamps to the passports of all visa applicants as a mean of preventing the same\r\nperson from lodging multiple or successive visa applications. That Decision\r\nbecame obsolete after the entry into force of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 810/2009 (Visa Code).\nVIII-IX.\r\nDecision of the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (98) 37 def 2[18] introduced an\r\nintegrated approach for stepping up the fight against illegal migration that\r\nwere put into effect by the Decision of the Central Group SCH/C (98) 117[19]. Those Decisions\r\nbecame obsolete after the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 377/2004[20] that established the\r\ncommon framework for posting immigration liaison officers in third countries,\r\nRegulation 562/2006 which provided for a set of common measures on the control\r\nat external borders and Council Decision 2009/371/JHA[21] that entrusted Europol\r\nwith specific tasks related to the exchange of information. \nX. Decision of the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (98) 59 rev[22] provided for a set of\r\nguidelines for the coordinated deployment of document advisers for air and\r\nmaritime traffic and at Member States' consular representations with the aim to\r\nstrengthen the combating of illegal immigration into the Schengen area. That\r\nDecision became obsolete after the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 377/2004 that\r\nestablished new rules for the deployment of liaison officers in third\r\ncountries. \nXI. Decision of the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (99) 7 rev 2[23] approved the plan for Member\r\nStates' reciprocal secondment of liaison officers to advise and assist in the\r\nperformance of checking at the external borders. This decision became obsolete\r\nafter the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 and Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004[24] which provide for the new\r\nlegal framework of cooperation between Member States on the control of the\r\nexternal border, including secondment of liaison officers.\nXII. Council Regulation (EC) No 189/2008[25] provided for the\r\nspecifications relevant to certain SIS II tests with the aim to demonstrate\r\nthat Central SIS II, the communication infrastructure and the interactions\r\nbetween Central SIS II and the national systems (N.SIS II) work in accordance\r\nwith the technical and functional requirements set out in the SIS II legal\r\ninstruments. That Regulation exhausted its legal effect once the SIS II went\r\nlive on 9 April 2013. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n   Summary of the proposed measures   The proposal repeals a number of legal measures in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice that have been identified as obsolete.   \n Legal basis   The legal basis for repealing Decision of the Executive Committee of 28 April 1995 on common visa policy (Sch/Com-ex (95) PV 1 rev) is Article 77(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

It is for the Union legislator to adopt the necessary measures to that effect. \n   Choice of instrument   \n Proposed instrument: European Parliament and Council decision. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe\r\nproposal has no budgetary impact\n\u00a0\n2014/0337 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nrepealing certain acts in the Area of\r\nFreedom Security and Justice\nTHE\r\nEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 77(2)(a),(b) and (d), Article 78(2)(e) and (g),\r\nArticle 79(2)(c) and (d) and Article 87(2)(a) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Improving the transparency\r\nof Union law is an essential element of the better lawmaking strategy that the\r\ninstitutions of the Union are implementing. In that context it is appropriate\r\nto remove from the legislation in force those acts which no longer serve any\r\npurpose.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A number of acts adopted\r\nin the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice are no longer relevant because their content has been taken up by successive acts, even though\r\nthey have not been repealed.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision\r\nof the Executive Committee Sch/Com-ex (95) PV 1 rev[26] referred to a very specific situation on the prior consultation\r\nrequested by Portugal vis-\u00e0-vis Indonesian visa applicants. That decision became\r\nobsolete after the entry into force of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 810/2009[27]\r\nand of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008[28] providing for new\r\nrules for the prior consultation of other Member States in relation to issuance\r\nof visas.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision of the Executive\r\nCommittee SCH/Com-ex (95) 21[29]\r\nprovided for the obligation of Member States to exchange statistical\r\ninformation for better monitoring the migration at external borders.

That decision became obsolete after the entry into force of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 810/2009 that provides for new rules on the representation\r\narrangements in situations where a Member State agrees to represent another Member State or the purpose of examining applications and issuing visas on behalf of that Member State.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision\r\nof the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (97) 39 rev[32] approved the guiding principles for means\r\nof proof and indicative evidence under readmission agreements between Schengen\r\nStates.

That\r\ndecision became obsolete after the entry into force of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 810/2009 that provided for a new set\r\nof rules for issuing visas and for stamping the applicant's travel document.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision\r\nof the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (98) 37 def 2[39] established a set of measures aiming at establishing an integrated\r\napproach for stepping up the fight against illegal migration that were put into\r\neffect by the Decision of the Central Group of 27 October 1998 on the adoption\r\nof measures to fight illegal immigration (SCH/C (98) 117). Those decisions became\r\nobsolete after the entry into force of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 377/2004[40] that established the common framework for posting immigration\r\nliaison officers in third countries, Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 which provided\r\nfor a set of common measures on the control at external borders and the Council\r\nDecision 2009/371/JHA [41] that entrusted Europol with specific tasks related to the exchange\r\nof information, including on countering illegal migration. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision\r\nof the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (98) 59 rev[42] provided for a set of guidelines for the coordinated deployment of\r\ndocument advisers for air and maritime traffic and at consular representations\r\nof Member States with the aim to strengthen the combating of illegal\r\nimmigration.

That decision became obsolete after the entry\r\ninto force of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 and Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 2007/2004 that introduced a new legal framework for\r\ncooperation between Member States with regard to the control of the external\r\nborder, including secondment of liaison officers.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 189/2008[44] provided for the specifications relevant to certain SIS II tests\r\nwith the aim to demonstrate that Central SIS II, the communication\r\ninfrastructure and the interactions between Central SIS II and the national\r\nsystems (N.SIS II) work in accordance with the technical and functional\r\nrequirements set out in the SIS II legal instruments. That regulation exhausted\r\nits legal effect once the SIS II started operation on 9 April 2013.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For reasons of legal\r\ncertainty and clarity, those obsolete decisions and the regulation should be\r\nrepealed.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nDecision, namely the repeal of a number of obsolete Union acts in the Area of Freedom,\r\nSecurity and Justice cannot be achieved by Member States but only at Union\r\nlevel, this Decision complies with the requirements of the principle of\r\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
