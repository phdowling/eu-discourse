It is\r\none of the few economic sectors which register continuous growth, in spite of\r\neconomic and financial difficulties, presenting thereby a great potential to\r\ncontribute to \"Europe 2020\", the EU's growth strategy for a smart,\r\nsustainable and inclusive EU economy.\nWith some 1.8 million businesses, primarily\r\nSMEs, this sector[1]\r\nemploys approximately 3.3 % of EU workforce (about 8 million jobs) and\r\ngenerates about 2.9% of EU GDP. Taking into account the sectors linked to it[2], its indirect\r\ncontribution is even greater: it is estimated to provide around 8.5% of all\r\njobs (approximately 18.8 million people employed) and generates about 7.9% of\r\nthe European Union's GDP[3].\r\nDespite increasing competition from other regions of the world, the EU is the\r\nworld's No 1 tourist destination, with 384.8 million international arrivals in\r\n2011[4].\nWith the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the\r\nEU has now been given the competence to complement the action of the Member\r\nStates in the tourism sector, in particular by promoting the competitiveness of\r\nUnion undertakings in that sector[5].\nIn response to the new powers granted to it\r\nand to the need for new measures to stimulate EU growth, the Commission adopted\r\na Communication in 2010 on a new political framework for tourism in Europe[6]. This framework outlines\r\nan ambitious set of actions aiming at (a) stimulating competitiveness in the\r\nEuropean tourism sector; (b) promoting the development of sustainable,\r\nresponsible and high-quality tourism; (c) consolidating the image and profile\r\nof Europe as home to sustainable and high-quality destinations; and (d)\r\nmaximising the potential of EU policies and financial instruments for\r\ndeveloping tourism.\nAction 13 of the Communication explicitly envisages the development of a\r\nEuropean Tourism Quality Label, \"based on existing national\r\nexperience, to increase consumer security and confidence in tourism products\r\nand reward rigorous efforts by tourism professionals whose aim is quality of\r\ntourism service for customer satisfaction\".\nIn its reaction to this Communication, the European\r\nParliament called on the Commission \"[\u2026] to assess, in cooperation with\r\ntourism stakeholders, the feasibility of a European quality tourism label,\r\n[\u2026].in order to create an umbrella label complementary to national labels and\r\nrecognised on an opt-in basis.\" [7]\r\nThe 2009 study on the competitiveness of the EU tourism industry has\r\nfound that even though the total number of international arrivals in Europe is\r\nstill growing, Europe has been losing market share lately against new, emerging\r\ndestinations worldwide. Moreover, globalisation, the Internet and rapidly\r\nchanging consumer behaviour, as well as a growing concern about the\r\nenvironmental footprint of tourism activities have a strong impact on the\r\nindustry[8].\nIn such an increasingly competitive market, the\r\nsignificance of quality has grown for tourism businesses, which are ever more\r\naware of the importance of quality as a source of competitive advantage.\r\nTherefore access to reliable, up-to-date, accurate and relevant information on\r\nthe quality of a particular tourism service is essential for tourists in order\r\nto differentiate among competing products and to make an informed choice.\nThis may be particularly accentuated in case of tourists\r\narriving from another EU Member State, where uncertainties may be highlighted\r\nby linguistic difficulties, where information is not available in a language\r\nthat the consumer understands.\nFurthermore, given the current economic crisis, the EU\r\nmust do all in its power to attract third country visitors. Ensuring that these\r\nvisitors can rely on receiving a certain quality level of service across the EU\r\nis of paramount importance.\nThe information provided to consumers on the quality of\r\ntourism services has a role to play in attracting third country visitors, which\r\nhas a huge and so far largely untapped potential to boost tourist arrivals to\r\nEU destinations and to enhance the competitiveness of EU tourism. In 2011\r\nforeign visitor spending amounted to \u20ac330.44 billion. According to recent\r\nestimations these figures are likely to increase up to 20.4 million jobs and\r\n\u20ac427.31 billion in 2022[9].\nTherefore the current initiative must also be seen in\r\nthe context of the Commission\u2019 initiative to brand Europe in third countries[10] and within this the\r\n\u201cDestination Europe 2020\u201d initiative[11],\r\nas well as the EU visa policy[12]\r\nwhich facilitates the travel of non-EU nationals to the EU[13] to help Europe remain\r\nthe world\u2019s No 1 tourist destination.\n1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Current state of play\nCurrently there is no specific legislation at EU level\r\nregulating the information provided to consumers on the quality of tourism\r\nservices[14].\nCertain existing information tools, such as on-line\r\nevaluation and comparison websites, can help consumers in their decision-making\r\nprocess provided they display transparent and reliable information. \nCertain Member States operate national, sub-national or\r\nregional public quality schemes within their territories on a voluntary basis.\r\nThere is also a wide variety of industry initiatives at regional, national or\r\ntransnational level, which mostly focus on service quality aspects specific to\r\ntheir respective tourism sub-sectors or geographic area.\nAs it has been confirmed by the market analysis carried\r\nout in the context of the assessment of policy options accompanying this\r\nproposal[15],\r\nthese quality schemes show significant diversity and therefore very little\r\nconsistency when compared in respect of their sectoral scope, geographical\r\ncoverage, governance, assessment methodology and evaluation criteria.\nThe vast number and diversity of the existing private\r\nand public quality schemes result in a highly fragmented market in terms of the\r\nevaluation of tourism service quality.\nAs a consequence of this fragmentation,\r\ncross-border tourists are not provided with consistent information to easily\r\nunderstand what the various quality schemes represent and to differentiate\r\nbetween competing services. This leads to confusion. This then limits the\r\nquality schemes' capacity to effectively inform consumers about the quality\r\nlevel of the tourism services offered, which impairs the consumers' ability to\r\nmake informed choices particularly when travelling to another Member State or from third countries. Hence, they do not reward (possibly with more favoured\r\nchoices or better reputation) those businesses that invest in quality. This situation\r\ndiscourages the industry, particularly SMEs with limited financial resources,\r\nfrom doing so. As a result, the EU tourism industry is prevented from fully\r\ncapitalising on its competitive advantage in service quality and fulfilling its\r\neconomic potential by raising the visibility of its service quality. Tourism\r\nstakeholders have not so far been successful in cooperating at EU level to\r\nreduce the inconsistency across the EU between existing or future quality\r\nschemes and there are no indications that any private or public initiative that\r\nwould improve this situation is likely to emerge. Therefore\r\nit is most urgently needed to address fragmentation of the market at several\r\nlevels. The existing fragmentation among quality evaluation systems generate\r\nconfusion and can negatively affect the competitiveness of European tourism.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation process\nFollowing the adoption of the 2010\r\nCommunication, the Commission started gathering information on the existing\r\nquality schemes with the help of Member States and industry stakeholders. Two\r\nworkshops were organised during the course of 2011 to exchange information on\r\nthe existing experiences and to exchange ideas about possible common quality\r\nprinciples for tourism services. Early 2011, the Commission set up an informal\r\nexpert group with the participation of managers of existing public and private\r\nquality schemes and consumer representatives to provide assistance in the\r\ndevelopment of a draft concept. The vast majority of stakeholders participating\r\nin the workshops and the informal expert group agreed that the EU initiative\r\nshould follow a bottom-up approach, building on and recognising the existing\r\nand future initiatives by the Member States and the industry. However, with\r\nregards to what the common principles should include, the stakeholders\r\nexpressed diverse views. Furthermore, the inclusion of environmental\r\nsustainability issues in the principles also triggered some different views among\r\nstakeholders.\nA targeted consultation was carried out in\r\nSeptember-October 2011, seeking the views of a wider circle of stakeholders,\r\nconsisting of the main European tourism associations and federations, related\r\nindustry associations, consumer organisations as well as the Members States'\r\nauthorities. This consultation produced the same results in terms of\r\nstakeholders' positions as the preliminary workshops described above.\nMember States were also consulted during\r\nthe regular meetings of the Commission's Tourism Advisory Committee and\r\nexpressed divergent opinions: some Member States expressed strong support for\r\nthe initiative, opposing obligations on public administrations to participate\r\nin the governance of such EU initiative, mainly reasoning with non-compliance\r\nwith the principle of subsidiarity and the restrictions of the legal basis, as\r\nwell as limited resources of the national authorities.\nTo widen the consultation of stakeholders\r\nand collection of expertise, the Commission organised an open conference in\r\nJanuary 2012. The documentation and the report of this conference can be found\r\non the Commission's website[16].\r\nThe discussions at the conference reflected no change in the views and\r\npositions of the private and public stakeholders.\nA public consultation was carried out\r\nbetween May and July 2012 through \u201cYour Voice in Europe\u201d, DG Enterprise and\r\nIndustry website on Europa and e-mails sent to a wide range of private and\r\npublic stakeholders as well as Member States' representatives. Professional\r\nassociations and federations and public administrations made up 90% of the more\r\nthan 150 respondents. The remaining 10% were tourism enterprises, two thirds of\r\nwhich participate in a quality scheme. Tourism trade unions and the\r\nrepresentatives of consumers were also actively involved in the consultation\r\nprocess. Most respondents agreed with the Commission's definition of the\r\nproblem and with the need for an initiative by the EU in this area. The public\r\nconsultation results are published on the Commission's website[17].\nIn the framework of the assessment of\r\npolicy options a background study was conducted on the experience of businesses\r\nabout participating in a quality scheme, where the input of the managers of a\r\nrepresentative sample of the existing quality schemes and their member\r\nbusinesses provided useful insight to the assessment of the impacts of the\r\nproposed initiative[18].\n2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Assessment of policy\r\noptions\nThe Commission assessed various policy\r\noptions in view of improving the consistency among the existing and future quality\r\nschemes and as a result the information provided to consumers.\nAltogether seven policy options were\r\nconsidered among which four were examined in the assessment. These include the\r\noption of no policy change, an industry-driven self-regulatory option and two\r\noptions involving EU intervention. The latter two options examined the impacts\r\nof the possibility of including in the concept certain principles, such as\r\nthose related to environmental sustainability aspects. The estimated economic,\r\nsocial and environmental impacts of each option were assessed based on their\r\neffectiveness in fulfilling the policy objectives, their cost-efficiency and\r\ntheir consistency with other EU policies.\nThe assessment paid particular attention to\r\nthe fact that, participation by industry in either the option proposing\r\nself-regulation or the one suggesting EU intervention would be voluntary.\r\nThorough consideration was also given to the conservation of the uniqueness and\r\ndiversity of the European tourism offer, especially in view of the vast variety\r\nof tourism sub-sectors to which European service quality principles could be\r\napplied.\nThe assessment does not conclude on one\r\nsole favourable option as the comparison of options showed equal effectiveness,\r\nefficiency and consistency both for the option including only service quality-related\r\nprinciples and for the one extending information to other aspects, such as\r\nenvironmental sustainability.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal Basis\nThe proposal is based on Articles 195 and\r\n292 TFEU.\n3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Principle of subsidiarity\r\nand proportionality\nArticle 195 TFEU provides that the EU shall\r\n\"complement the action of the Member States in the tourism sector, in\r\nparticular by promoting the competitiveness of Union undertakings in that\r\nsector\". In line with the principle of subsidiarity, the proposed EU\r\naction would be of a voluntary nature. The proposed initiative does not\r\neliminate any existing initiative put in place by Member States or the\r\nindustry.\nThe rationale for an EU action stems from\r\nthe trans-national nature of the problem. This occurs in a cross-border\r\nsetting, where the tourism service is provided in a country where the tourist\r\nis not resident, limiting the added value that quality schemes can provide for\r\ncross-border travellers, even more so when those travellers come from outside\r\nthe EU.\nThe current situation (described under 1.2)\r\nconcerning the evaluation of tourism service quality in Europe is not\r\nconductive to an adequate level playing field in the EU Industry. The\r\ninconsistency of quality evaluation schemes for tourism services at national\r\nand regional level confuses the consumers and creates obstacles to the internal\r\nmarket.\nThere is limited power and scope for the\r\nindividual Member States to act alone in trying to improve consistency of the\r\nquality of tourism services offered across the EU. Member States have so far\r\nnot initiated any cross-border coordination of tourism quality principles and\r\nthere is no indication that they would do so in the future. Given the current\r\nlow number of existing public schemes at national level, such cooperation would\r\nin any event not result in large scale cross-border cooperation. Moreover,\r\nindividual Member States are currently not in a position to improve consistency\r\nbetween private schemes from other Member States. Therefore EU action is\r\nnecessary and justified.\nIn addition, actions\r\nundertaken by the industry, even at transnational level are limited to a\r\nspecific sub-sector (or maybe a few related ones), but are not of true\r\nhorizontal scope. This results in inconsistent information being offered to\r\nconsumers, as well as limits to the informative power of quality schemes and\r\ntheir member businesses in an intra-EU cross border context and towards\r\ntravellers from third countries. This situation is not expected to change,\r\nrequiring action at EU level.\nFor reasons of scale, the EU is better\r\nplaced to tackle the problems of sectoral and geographic fragmentation\r\ndescribed above. An EU framework pursuing the general interest of promoting the\r\n Union's tourism competitiveness would be more effective in terms of\r\ncross-border visibility and credibility. This can be achieved by complementing\r\nthe work already undertaken by public and private tourism actors, encouraging\r\nand creating a favourable environment for them to combine their efforts.\r\nEuropean Tourism Quality Principles can better be promoted by EU action, both\r\nin the Member States and towards travellers from third countries, as part of\r\nthe overall EU promotional strategy in tourism. The added value of a large-scale\r\naction coordinated at EU level has been confirmed by a clear majority of\r\nstakeholders.\nFinally, the proposal\r\ncomplies with the proportionality principle. The initiative was developed in\r\nview of limiting its costs to what is necessary to achieve the policy\r\nobjectives. The application of the proposed quality principles mainly requires\r\norganisational change, which entails limited investments, that are expected to\r\nbe balanced out by the benefits stemming from the increased satisfaction of\r\nconsumers and from complementary EU actions.\nTo ensure that the\r\ncompetences of the Member States are respected it is recommended that the\r\nMember States coordinate, monitor and promote the application of the European\r\nTourism Quality Principles in their respective territories, in cooperation with\r\nthe Commission. With these measures the proposal duly respects the principle of\r\nsubsidiarity.\n3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Outline of the proposal\n3.3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subject matter and Objectives\nThe European Tourism Quality Principles set\r\nout in this proposal are applicable to tourism services offered in the Union directly to consumers and are recommended to be followed by public and private\r\norganisations providing services in the field of tourism.\nThe initiative aims to\r\nimprove information to consumers, especially to those who travel to another Member State or from a third country, on the quality of tourism services, allowing\r\nquality-sensitive consumers to make better informed choices. This in turn\r\nstrengthens incentives for EU tourism businesses, particularly for SMEs, to\r\nfurther invest in quality. It aims to do so by improving consistency in the\r\nquality of tourism services at EU level by setting European principles for\r\ntourism organisations to comply with. These principles originate from the\r\ncriteria proposed by the stakeholders and assessed in the open consultation.\nIn operational terms, the aim is, by the\r\ntime of the revision of the initiative, to have a significant number of tourism\r\norganisations in the EU following the European Tourism Quality Principles.\nThe added value of the initiative will be\r\nmany-fold: a) tourism organisations that follow these Principles will be able\r\nto benefit from promotional and awareness raising action carried out by the Commission.\r\nThis will lead to increased visibility, which will enhance their capacity to\r\nreach out to consumers and will provide them with the possibility to extend\r\ntheir activities to markets that they otherwise could not reach, in particular\r\nin third countries; b) For consumers, the added value will be the reassurance\r\nthat certain European quality principles will be fulfilled, no matter which\r\nMember State they visit. Finally, highlighting and emphasising on the high\r\nquality of European tourism services will contribute to the overall EU strategy\r\nof improving tourism flows of travellers within and from outside Europe,\r\ncomplementing the efforts of facilitating visa requirements for third-country\r\ntourists as well as branding Europe as a set of sustainable and high-quality\r\ndestinations.\nUltimately, this will contribute to the\r\nimproved competitiveness of the sector and boost its capacity to create\r\neconomic growth and jobs, to the benefit of Member States and the overall EU\r\neconomy.\n3.3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Application\r\nof the European Tourism Quality Principles \nSectoral\r\nand geographic scope\nIn order to achieve a better consistency of\r\nthe quality of the tourism services across the EU, the European Tourism Quality\r\nPrinciples can be applied, without sub-sectoral restriction, to all those\r\npublic or private tourism organisations that operate at national, regional,\r\nlocal or transnational level, offering tourism services in the Union to consumers.\nCoordination, monitoring and\r\npromotion\nIn accordance with the principle of\r\nsubsidiarity, Member States will be invited to coordinate, monitor and promote\r\nthe European Tourism Quality Principles in respect of their territories. \nMember States will also be recommended to\r\ncooperate between each other in respect of transnational tourism organisations.\r\nThey will also be invited to cooperate with the Commission within the framework\r\nof the Tourism Advisory Committee, in order to facilitate the monitoring and\r\nassessment of the initiative, which might be undertaken, inter alia, with\r\ndedicated surveys among Member States, industry representatives and consumers.\nThe Programme for the Competitiveness of\r\nEnterprises and SMEs (COSME) 2014-2020, sets the specific objective to improve the framework conditions of the competitiveness and\r\nsustainability of Union enterprises in the tourism sector. With the objective of improving the image and profile of Europe as a sustainable, responsible and high-quality destination, the Commission will\r\nundertake information, communication and promotional activities, including the\r\ncreation of a dedicated website providing information on the European Tourism\r\nQuality Principles. The Commission will also facilitate the exchange of best\r\npractice and experiences.\n3.3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evaluation\nAn evaluation of the implementation of this\r\nRecommendation is foreseen after three years following its publication in the\r\nOfficial Journal. The Commission will also assess whether further measures are\r\nnecessary to enhance consistent service quality in tourism.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS \nAn appropriate budgetary allocation could\r\nbe foreseen for the promotion of the European Tourism Quality Principles, via\r\nthe Competitiveness of enterprises and SMEs Programme (COSME)[19].\n2014/0043 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL RECOMMENDATION\non European Tourism Quality Principles \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 195 and 292\r\nthereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission recognises\r\nin its Communication of 30 June 2010, \"Europe, the world's No 1 tourist\r\ndestination \u2013 a new political framework for Europe\"[20] the need to promote\r\nthe development of sustainable, responsible and high-quality tourism, as part\r\nof the overall objective of promoting the Union as a collection of high-quality\r\ndestinations in third countries.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The promotion of high\r\nenvironmental performances of tourism accommodations and campsites and best\r\nenvironmental management practices of the tourism sector are already\r\nspecifically addressed at Union level through the application of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 66/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council[21] and by Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council[22].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A wide variety of public\r\nand private quality schemes already exists in the Union, aiming at providing\r\ninformation to consumers on the quality of tourism services and providing\r\nguidance to tourism professionals. Those schemes show significant diversity in\r\nscope, governance, methodology and criteria. Moreover, their operation is\r\nlimited to certain sub-sectors or geographic areas, which results in a highly\r\nfragmented environment in respect of the evaluation of tourism service quality.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because of this fragmentation and the lack of consistent assessment\r\nacross the existing quality schemes, consumers travelling cross-border within\r\nthe Union or to the Union from third countries may find it difficult to compare\r\nthe services covered by different quality schemes. That lack of consistency\r\nlimits the consumers' capacity to make fully informed choices.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due\r\nto the lack of consistent assessment across the existing quality schemes,\r\ntourism businesses have so far had limited capacity to gain visibility\r\nvis-\u00e0-vis consumers and to benefit from coordinated actions. This is especially\r\ntrue for micro and small enterprises which often do not have the adequate tools\r\nand resources to promote themselves and the high-quality service they provide.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to boost the\r\ntourism industry's competitiveness, it is necessary to make the Union's tourism businesses attractive for third country nationals.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore\r\nappropriate to outline a set of European Tourism Quality Principles acknowledged\r\nby consumers and the industry.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\r\ncoverage of the largest possible range of tourism subsectors and at the same\r\ntime to preserve the diversity of the Union's tourism offer, the European\r\nTourism Quality Principles should be of general nature, but offer an added\r\nvalue in line with consumers' expectations towards high quality tourism\r\nservices.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure the satisfactory\r\nprovision of tourism services, it is necessary to provide adequate training to\r\nthe relevant employees on the tasks assigned to them. The same reason prompts\r\nthat the attended training is recorded in a training register.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To facilitate continuous\r\nimprovement of tourism service quality to meet the requirements of consumers,\r\nit is important to carry out consumer surveys and ensure a response to\r\ncomplaints.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To promote the authenticity\r\nand diversity of the Union\u2019s tourism offer, it is necessary that consumers are\r\nprovided with up-to-date information on local customs, heritage, traditions,\r\nservices and products.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To enhance the awareness\r\nabout the European Tourism Quality Principles, and therefore gain consumer\r\nconfidence, it is key that tourism organisations provide information and\r\nguidance related to those Principles to consumers.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\r\napplication of the European Tourism Quality Principles within their territories\r\nas well as the coordination of their actions, Member States should coordinate,\r\nmonitor and promote the European Tourism Quality Principles in a transparent\r\nmanner.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\r\nEuropean Tourism Quality Principles are applied on a voluntary basis by tourism\r\norganisations operating in more than one Member State (transnational\r\norganisations), it is essential that Member States cooperate with each other in\r\nview of the application of the European Tourism Quality Principles by those\r\norganisations.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\r\nconsistent application of the European Tourism Quality Principles and of their\r\ncoordination, monitoring and promotion throughout the Union, the Member States\r\nare invited to exchange information and experiences.
