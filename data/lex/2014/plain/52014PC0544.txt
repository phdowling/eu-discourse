The Convention on the conservation of\r\nmigratory species of wild animals (also known as the CMS or Bonn Convention)\r\naims to conserve terrestrial, marine and avian migratory species throughout\r\ntheir range. It is an intergovernmental treaty, concluded under the aegis of\r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme, concerned with the conservation of\r\nwildlife and habitats on a global scale. The European Union has been a Party to\r\nthe CMS since 1 November 1983[1].\n2. The migratory species to be conserved\r\nare listed in Appendices I (endangered species) and II (species to be the\r\nsubjects of agreements) to the Convention. Article III\r\nto the Convention stipulates that Appendix I shall list\r\nmigratory species which are endangered and provides that Parties that are Range\r\nStates of the species concerned shall endeavour to take various conservation\r\nmeasures and shall prohibit the taking of animals belonging to such species. Article\r\nIV to the Convention stipulates that Appendix II shall list migratory species\r\nwhich have an unfavourable conservation status and which require international\r\nagreements for their conservation and management, as well as those which have a\r\nconservation status which would significantly benefit from the international\r\ncooperation that could be achieved by an international agreement.\n3. The Conference of the Parties is the\r\ndecision-making body of the Convention with powers to assess the conservation\r\nstatus of migratory species and, subsequently, to amend Appendices I and II to\r\nthe Convention.\n4. In accordance with Article XI of the\r\nConvention, proposals for amendment may be made by any Party. An amendment to\r\nthe Appendices enters into force for all Parties ninety days after the meeting\r\nof the Conference of the Parties at which it is adopted, except for those\r\nParties which make a reservation.\n5. The eleventh meeting of the Conference\r\nof the Parties to the Convention will take place in Quito (Ecuador) from 4 to 9 November 2014. For this meeting, the Union proposed to amend Appendix\r\nI to the Convention to add the Mediterranean\r\nsubpopulation of Ziphius cavirostris, and the bird species Coracias\r\ngarrulus, and to amend Appendix II to the Convention to add three species\r\nof thresher sharks, namely Alopias superciliosus, Alopias vulpinus and Alopias\r\npelagicus.\n6. Other Parties to the Convention have\r\nsubmitted proposals to amend Appendices I and II to the Convention for the\r\nspecies Ursus maritimus, all subspecies of the Panthera leo, Kobus kob,\r\nEudorcas rufifrons, Otis tarda, Calidris pusilla, calidris tenuirostris,\r\nCardellina canadiensis, Carcharhinus falciformis, Sphyrna lewini, Sphyrna\r\nmokarran, Anoxypristis cuspidate, Pristis clavata, Pristis pectinata, Pristis\r\nzijsron, Pristis pristis, Mobula mobular, Mobula japonica, Mobula\r\nthurstoni, Mobula tarapacana, Mobula eregoodootenkee, Mobula kuhlii, Mobula\r\nhypostoma, Mobula rochebrunei and Mobula munkiana, Manta alfredi and\r\nAnguilla Anguilla. \n7. The Union should support all proposals\r\nbecause they are science-based, in line with Union legislation and with the Union's commitment to international cooperation for the protection of biodiversity. Adding\r\nthese species to Appendix I or II to the Convention, as proposed, would not\r\nrequire any change in Union law;\n8. It is therefore necessary for the\r\nCouncil to take a decision for the purpose of establishing the position to be\r\nadopted on behalf of the Union with a view to the eleventh meeting of the\r\nConference of the Parties with regard to proposals for amendment.\n2014/0252 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be adopted on\r\nbehalf of the European Union with regard to proposals from various parties to\r\nthe Convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals for\r\namendments to the Appendices of the Convention at the eleventh meeting of the\r\nConference of the Parties \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1), in conjunction with Article 218(9),\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Council\r\nDecision 82/461/EEC of 24 June 1982[2]\r\nthe Union is a Party to the Convention on the conservation of migratory species\r\nof wild animals (\"the Convention\"). The Conference of the Parties is\r\nthe decision-making body of the Convention and the powers conferred upon it\r\ninclude the capacity to assess the conservation status of migratory species and\r\nsubsequently to amend Appendices I and II to the Convention which list the\r\nspecies to be conserved;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\nXI of the Convention, an amendment to the Appendices enters into force for all\r\nParties ninety days after the meeting of the Conference of the Parties at which\r\nit is adopted, except for those Parties which make a reservation;\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The eleventh meeting of\r\nthe Conference of the Parties is to take place in Quito (Ecuador) from 4 to 9 November 2014;\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to that\r\nmeeting, the Union submitted to the Secretariat of the Convention a proposal to\r\namend Appendix I to the Convention to include the species Coracias garrulus and\r\nthe Mediterranean subpopulation of the species Ziphius\r\ncavirostris and to amend Appendix II to the\r\nConvention to include the species Alopias\r\nsuperciliosus, Alopias vulpinus and Alopias\r\npelagicus[3];\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other Parties to the\r\nConvention have also submitted proposals to amend Appendices I and II to the\r\nConvention;\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union should support all\r\nproposals because they are science-based, in line with Union legislation and\r\nwith the Union's commitment to international cooperation for the protection of\r\nbiodiversity in accordance with Article 5 of the UN Convention on Biological\r\nDiversity and decisions taken at the Conference of the Parties under that\r\nConvention, in particular with the global target agreed at the Tenth meeting:\r\n\"By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and\r\ntheir conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, has been\r\nimproved and sustained\";\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The whale Ziphius\r\ncavirostris, is included in Annex IV of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21\r\nMay 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora[4]. Hence adding this\r\nspecies to the Appendix I to the Convention would not require any change in\r\nUnion law;\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mammals Ursus\r\nmaritimus, all subspecies of the Panthera leo other than Panthera leo persica,\r\nand Kobus kob do not occur in the EU. Hence adding these species to\r\nAppendix II to the Convention would not require any change in Union law. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mammals Panthera\r\nleo persica and Eudorcas rufifrons do not occur in the EU.\r\nHence adding these species to Appendix I would not require any change in Union\r\nlaw. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The bird Otis tarda\r\nis included in Annex I to Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds[5]. Hence adding this\r\nspecies to Appendix I to the Convention would not require any change in Union\r\nlaw. The middle-European population of the Otis tarda is already\r\nincluded in Appendix I to the Convention and covered by the Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding on the Conservation and Management of the Middle-European\r\nPopulation of the Great Bustard (Otis tarda) to which 12 Member States\r\nare a party. In addition, the entire global population is already included in\r\nAppendix II to the Convention;\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The birds Calidris\r\npusilla, calidris tenuirostris and Cardellina canadiensis, do\r\nnot occur in the EU except for overseas territories which fall outside the\r\nscope of the Directive 2009/147/EC. Hence adding these species to Appendix I\r\nand II to the Convention would not require any change in Union law. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The bird Coracias\r\ngarrulus is included in Annex I to Directive 2009/147/EC. Hence adding this\r\nspecies to Appendix I to the Convention would not require any change in Union\r\nlaw. The conservation needs are most pressing for the European population of\r\nthis species;\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The populations of the\r\nsharks Alopias superciliosus, Alopias vulpinus, Alopias\r\npelagicus, Carcharhinus falciformis, Sphyrna lewini and Sphyrna mokarran fall\r\nunder the European Union's common fisheries policy (CFP) which offers the\r\nappropriate instruments for the Union to contribute to managing their\r\nprotection when adding these species to Appendix II to the Convention. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The saw fishes Anoxypristis\r\ncuspidate, Pristis clavata, Pristis pectinata, Pristis zijsron, Pristis\r\npristis, the mobula rays Mobula mobular, Mobula japonica, Mobula thurstoni,\r\nMobula tarapacana, Mobula eregoodootenkee, Mobula kuhlii, Mobula hypostoma,\r\nMobula rochebrunei and Mobula munkiana fall under the CFP which offers the\r\nappropriate instruments for the EU to contribute to managing their protection\r\nwhen adding these species to Appendix I and II to the Convention. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reef manta Manta\r\nalfredi falls under the CFP which offers the appropriate instruments for the\r\nEU to contribute to manage its protection when adding this species to Appendix I\r\nand II to the Convention. The species has been identified as a species separate\r\nfrom the Manta birostris shortly after that species had been added to\r\nAppendices I and II to the Convention in 2011.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European eel, Anguilla anguilla, is a fish species falling under the CFP which offers the\r\nappropriate instruments for the EU to contribute to managing its protection. Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1100/2007 of 18 September 2007 establishing measures for the\r\nrecovery of the stock of European eel[6]\r\nprovides for measures to protect the European eel, including the possibility\r\nfor Member States to develop Eel Management Plans jointly with countries\r\noutside the Union with whom they share eel habitats. Article IV of the\r\nConvention encourages international agreements for putting in place protection\r\nmeasures and thereby also encourages agreements on joint Eel Management Plans\r\npursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1100/2007. Article IV of the Convention\r\nmay also encourage further international agreements which for EU Member States\r\nmay not result in lower protection than is required under Council Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1100/2007. Article XII(3) of the Convention allows parties to adopt\r\nstricter domestic measures concerning the conservation of migratory species\r\nlisted in Appendices I and II. Furthermore, including Anguilla anguilla\r\nin Appendix II to the Convention would be consistent with the inclusion of this\r\nspecies in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered\r\nSpecies of Wild Fauna and Flora following the Community's proposal in 2007 and\r\nDecision of 25 June 2014 by the Commission established by Article 10.1 of the\r\nConvention for the Protection of the marine Environment of the North-East\r\nAtlantic (the \u2018OSPAR Convention') to protect the species as it is considered\r\nparticularly vulnerable in the North East Atlantic Ocean.[7] A new international\r\nagreement under the CMS for this species is not foreseen. Conservation measures\r\nwould rather consist in concerted actions that would benefit the conservation\r\nof the species.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To the extent that the\r\nConvention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals falls both\r\nwithin the competence of the Union and the competence of the Member States, the\r\nCommission and the Member States should cooperate closely for the adoption of\r\nthe amendments to the Appendices of the Convention, aiming for unity in the\r\ninternational representation of the Union.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nAt the eleventh meeting of the Conference\r\nof the Parties to the Convention on the conservation of migratory species of\r\nwild animals, the Commission shall present the following position of the Union in respect of the proposals to amend Appendices I and II to the Convention:\n(1)                   \r\nthe Commission is hereby authorised to support\r\nthe addition to Appendix I of the following species:\n(mammals)\n(a)         \r\nZiphius cavirostris\n(b)         \r\nPanthera leo persica\n(c)         \r\nEudorcas rufifrons\n(birds)\n(d)         \r\nOtis tarda\n(e)         \r\nCalidris pusilla\n(f)           \r\nCalidris tenuirostris\n(g)         \r\nCoracias garrulus\n(fish)\n(h)         \r\nAnoxypristis cuspidate, Pristis clavata,\r\nPristis pectinata, Pristis zijsron, Pristis pristis\n(i)           \r\nMobula mobular, Mobula japonica, Mobula\r\nthurstoni, Mobula tarapacana, Mobula eregoodootenkee, Mobula kuhlii, Mobula\r\nhypostoma, Mobula rochebrunei, Mobula munkiana\n(j)           \r\nManta alfredi;\n(2)                   \r\nthe Commission is hereby authorised to support\r\nthe addition to Appendix II of the following species\n(mammals)\n(a)         \r\nUrsus maritimus\n(b)         \r\nPanthera leo (all subspecies other than Panthera\r\nleo persica) \n(c)         \r\nKobus kob leucotis\n(birds)\n(d)         \r\nCardellina canadiensis\n(fish)\n(e)         \r\nAnguilla\r\nanguilla \n(f)           \r\nAlopias superciliosus, Alopias vulpinus, Alopias\r\npelagicus\n(g)         \r\nAnoxypristis cuspidate, Pristis clavata,\r\nPristis pectinata, Pristis zijsron, Pristis pristis\n(h)         \r\nCarcharhinus falciformis\n(i)           \r\nSphyrna lewini and Sphyrna mokarran\n(j)           \r\nMobula mobular, Mobula japonica, Mobula\r\nthurstoni, Mobula tarapacana, Mobula eregoodootenkee, Mobula kuhlii, Mobula\r\nhypostoma, Mobula rochebrunei, Mobula munkiana\n(k)         \r\nManta alfredi.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision is adressed to the Commission.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 82/461/EEC of 24 June 1982 on the\r\nconclusion of the Convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild\r\nanimals, OJ L 210, 19.7.1982, p. 10.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 82/461/EEC\r\nof 24 June 1982 on the conclusion of the Convention on the conservation of\r\nmigratory species of wild animals, (OJ L 210, 19.7.1982,\r\np. 10).\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision of 5 June 2014 authorising the\r\nEuropean Commission to submit, on behalf of the European Union, a proposal for\r\namendments to the Appendices to the Convention on the conservation of migratory\r\nspecies of wild animals with a view to the eleventh meeting of the Conference\r\nof the Parties\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L206, 22.7.1992, p. 7.\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L20, 26.1.2010, p. 7.\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 248, 22.9.2007, p.17.\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision adopted at the OSPAR Commission meeting of\r\n23 to 27 June 2014.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
