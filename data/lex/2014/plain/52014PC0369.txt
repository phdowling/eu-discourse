This decision was taken\r\nin the wake of the events of 1 April 2010. On that day, on the orders of\r\nthe Deputy Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, General Antonio Indjai, a group\r\nof mutinous soldiers arrested Chief of Staff Jos\u00e9 Zamora Induta and the Prime\r\nMinister of Guinea-Bissau, Mr. Gomes Junior. Following the mutiny, General Indjai\r\nbecame de facto Chief of Staff before being officially appointed on\r\n25 June 2010 by decree of the President, Mr Bacai Sanha, on a proposal\r\nfrom the government.\nThe European Union regards the mutiny of 1\r\nApril 2010 and the subsequent appointment of its main instigators to\r\nhigh-ranking posts in the military hierarchy as a serious and evident breach of\r\nthe essential elements of Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement (respect for\r\ndemocratic principles) and as a case of special urgency within the meaning of\r\nArticle 96(2)(b). A letter was therefore sent to the Guinea\u2011Bissau\r\nauthorities on 2 February 2011 to invite them to hold consultations.\nThe opening meeting of the consultations\r\ntook place in Brussels on 29 March 2011.\nIn the course\r\nof the meeting, the participants were informed of the proposals of the Guinea\u2011Bissau\r\nside for progressively ensuring the primacy of civilian authority, improving\r\ndemocratic governance, guaranteeing the safeguarding of constitutional order\r\nand the rule of law, and tackling impunity and organised crime.\nThe\r\nundertakings made by the Guinea-Bissau side comprise, in particular:\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe conduct and conclusion of judicial\r\ninvestigations and proceedings that are fully independent and carried out under\r\nappropriate logistic and security conditions, relating to the assassinations in\r\nMarch and June 2009;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe effective implementation of the security\r\nsector reform based on the strategy adopted by the national parliament and the\r\nlegislative package drawn up with the support of the EU's CSDP mission;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe renewal of the military hierarchy to ensure\r\nthe appointment to senior command of persons not involved in unconstitutional\r\nor illegal conduct or acts of violence, in conformity with the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations of the ECOWAS roadmap for Security Sector Reform;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe approval of and assistance of an experts'\r\nmission to support security sector reform and the protection of political\r\nfigures, to be carried out with the support of ECOWAS, the CPLP and/or other\r\npartners;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe preparation, adoption and effective\r\nimplementation of national operational plans to implement Security Sector\r\nReform and to combat drug trafficking;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe improvement of the administrative and\r\nfinancial management of civilian and military employees, and measures to combat\r\nmoney laundering.\nThe European\r\nUnion noted these undertakings in its conclusions of the consultations. It\r\nurged the representatives of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to undertake\r\njudicial investigations and proceedings into the events of 1 April 2010 to\r\nreinforce efforts to tackle the problem of impunity and to specify a more\r\ndetailed timetable for implementation of these undertakings in compliance with\r\nthe timeframe set out in the ECOWAS roadmap.\nThe European Union decided on 18 July 2011, by Council Decision\r\n2011/492/EU to adopt appropriate measures for the performance of these\r\nundertakings, including a scheme of mutual commitments for the gradual resumption\r\nof EU cooperation.\nOn 12 April 2012, a coup d'\u00e9tat by elements of the armed forces took\r\nplace after the first round of the presidential elections, due after the death\r\nin January of President Bacai Sanha; the Acting President and the Prime\r\nMinister were arrested. \nTwo years after the coup d'\u00e9tat of April 2012, legislative and\r\npresidential elections have finally taken place on 13 April and 18 May 2014.\r\nThese elections, judged by all international observers, including the EU\r\nElectoral Observation Mission, as free and credible, were a major step to the\r\nrestoration of the constitutional order.\nBy Council Decision 2013/385/EU of 15/7/2013, the appropriate\r\nmeasures set out in Council Decision 2011/492/EU were extended by one year,\r\nwith validity until 19/7/2014.\nThe Commission considers it important that Council Decision\r\n2011/492/EU does not expire as it continues providing a fundamental framework\r\nfor the promotion of democratic stability and rule of law in Guinea-Bissau. An\r\nextension of the deadline of one year, until 19 July 2015, is therefore proposed.\r\nHowever, taking into consideration the holding of credible elections and in order\r\nto be able to engage with and to support the democratically elected authorities\r\nto move the country towards more stability, democracy and development, it is\r\nproposed to suspend the application of the appropriate measures. \nConclusion\nIn the light of the above, the Council is\r\nrequested to adopt the attached draft proposal for a Council Decision extending\r\nthe validity of Decision 2011/492/EU, but suspending the application of its\r\nappropriate measures.\n2014/0186 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nextending the validity of Decision\r\n2011/492/EU and suspending the application of its appropriate measures \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to the Partnership Agreement between\r\nthe members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States of the one\r\npart, and the European Community and its Member States of the other part, signed\r\nin Cotonou on 23 June 2000[1]\r\n(hereinafter referred to as the 'ACP-EU Partnership Agreement'), as last\r\namended in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso on 22 June 2010[2], and in particular\r\nArticle 96 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Internal Agreement between\r\nthe representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting within the\r\nCouncil, on measures to be taken and procedures to be followed for the\r\nimplementation of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement[3], and in particular\r\nArticle 3 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\r\nCommission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision\r\n2011/492/EU[4],\r\nconsultations with the Republic of Guinea-Bissau under Article 96 of the ACP-EU\r\nPartnership Agreement were concluded and appropriate measures, as specified in\r\nthe Annex to that Decision, were taken.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision\r\n2013/385/EU[5],\r\nCouncil Decision 2011/492/EU was amended to extend further by one year, until\r\n19 July 2014 the period of application of the appropriate measures.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The essential elements\r\ncited in Article 9 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement continue to be violated\r\nand the current conditions in Guinea-Bissau do not ensure respect for human\r\nrights, democratic principles and the rule of law. It is therefore appropriate\r\nto extend the validity of Council Decision 2011/492/EU for a period of one\r\nyear.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, taking into\r\nconsideration the holding of peaceful, free and credible elections on 13 April\r\nand 18 May 2014, which represent a major step towards more democracy and\r\nstability, and in order to engage with and provide direct support to the\r\ndemocratically elected authorities in their efforts to consolidate the\r\ndemocratic institutions, reconcile the society and promote the socioeconomic\r\ndevelopment of Guinea Bissau, the appropriate measures set out in the Annex to\r\nCouncil Decision 2011/492/EU should be suspended.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  This Decision should be reviewed\r\nsix months after its entry into force.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe validity of Decision 2011/492/EU and of\r\nits appropriate measures is hereby extended until 19 July 2015. However, the\r\napplication of the appropriate measures is hereby suspended.\nThe appropriate\r\nmeasures shall be kept under constant review and shall be applied again if the\r\nsituation in Guinea Bissau is to seriously deteriorate. Such measures shall in any event be reviewed six\r\nmonths after the entry into force of this Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe letter in the Annex to this Decision shall\r\nbe sent to the authorities of Guinea-Bissau.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\ndate of its adoption. \nArticle\r\n4\nThis Decision shall be published in the Official\r\nJournal of the European Union.\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the Council\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe\r\nPresident\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n   ||   \n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 317, 15.12.2000, p. 3.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 287, 4.11.2010, p.3\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 317, 15.12.2000, p. 376, as amended in\r\nOJ L 247, 9.9.2006, p. 48.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2011/492/EU of 18 July 2011\r\nconcerning the conclusion of consultations with the Republic of Guinea-Bissau\r\nunder Article 96 ACP-EU Partnership Agreement (OJ L 203, 6.8.2011, p. 2). \n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2013/385/EU of 15 July 2013\r\nextending the period of application of the appropriate measures in Decision 2011/492/EU\r\nconcerning Guinea-Bissau and amending that Decision (OJ L 194, 17.7.2013, p.6).\r\n\nANNEX\r\nto the\r\nProposal for a Council Decision\r\nextending the validity of Decision 2011/492/EU and suspending the application\r\nof its appropriate measures \r\n\nH.E. the President of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau,\nH.E. the Prime Minister of the Republic of   Guinea-Bissau, \nSirs,\nFurther to the consultations which took\r\nplace in Brussels on 29 March 2011 in the framework of Article 96 of the ACP-EU\r\nPartnership Agreement, the European Union decided on 18 July 2011, by Council\r\nDecision 2011/492/EU to adopt appropriate measures, including a scheme of\r\nmutual commitments for the gradual resumption of EU cooperation.\nBy Council Decision 2013/385 of 15/7/2012, Council Decision 2011/492\r\nwas extended by one year, with validity until 19/7/2014.\nOver the last twelve months, during which interim\r\nauthorities were in place, no progress was made in terms of respect of human\r\nrights, fight against impunity, reform of the security sector or the fight\r\nagainst illegal trafficking, notably of drugs, which were foreseen in the\r\nscheme of mutual commitments for the resumption of the EU cooperation. \nHowever, the European Union is encouraged\r\nby the holding of free, peaceful and credible legislative and presidential\r\nelections on 13 April and 18 May 2014, which represented a major step towards\r\ndemocracy and stability in the country. The EU has therefore decided the\r\nsuspension of the measures applied under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement as\r\nset out in Council Decision of 2011/492/EU in order to be able to engage with\r\nand provide direct support to the democratically elected authorities in your\r\nefforts to consolidate, reconcile and develop the country, in collaboration\r\nwith other international partners. \nThe European Union attaches the utmost\r\nimportance to the provisions of Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement, since\r\nrespect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law\r\nconstitutes the essential basis of EU-Guinea Bissau relations and the European\r\nUnion will continue to closely follow the situation in the country.\nThe political and socioeconomic challenges\r\nthat the country faces are significant, but we are confident that you will\r\nendeavour to take, in dialogue with all political groups, the decisions that\r\nare necessary, both at economic and financial level, and in the crucial areas\r\nof security sector reform and the fight against impunity. \nThe European Union remains firmly committed\r\nto its partnership with the people of Guinea Bissau. The present European Union\r\ndecision to suspend the application of the appropriate measures and re-engage\r\nin dialogue and cooperation with the legitimate authorities is intended to\r\nprovide new impetus to enhancing EU-Guinea Bissau relations, with the aim of\r\nnormalising bilateral relations. However, the commitments made by Guinea Bissau\r\nin the framework of Article 96 Consultation remain applicable and the European\r\nUnion expects your Government to make all necessary efforts to achieve them as\r\na matter of priority.\nThe European Union calls on all parties to\r\nseize the momentum to move the country towards democratic stability, rule of\r\nlaw, respect of human rights and socio-economic development. \nYours faithfully,\n For the Council || For the Commission \n C.
