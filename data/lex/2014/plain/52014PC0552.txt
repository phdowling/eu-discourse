One\r\nimportant tool in this respect is the annual fixing of fishing opportunities in\r\nthe form of total allowable catches (TACs), quotas and fishing effort limits.\nThe objective of this proposal is to fix,\r\nfor the commercially most important fish stocks in the Baltic Sea, the fishing\r\nopportunities for Member States for 2015. With a view to simplifying and\r\nclarifying the annual TAC and quota decisions, fishing opportunities in the\r\nBaltic Sea have been fixed by a separate Regulation since 2006.\n\u00b7      General context\nThe scientific advice on stocks in the\r\nBaltic Sea for 2015 was delivered by the International Council for the\r\nExploration of the Sea (ICES) in May 2014 and by the Scientific, Technical and\r\nEconomic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) in June 2014.\nThe proposal contains two sections that are\r\nimportant for management of the Baltic fisheries in 2015 through fishing\r\nopportunities: one section fixing the TACs and quotas and a second limiting the\r\nfishing effort, by imposing limits on fishing vessels\u2019 activity (number of days\r\nat sea).\n\u00b7      Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\nFishing opportunities and the way they are\r\nallocated to Member States are regulated annually. The most recent instrument is\r\nCouncil Regulation (EU) No 1180/2013 of 19 November 2013 fixing for 2014 the\r\nfishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks\r\napplicable in the Baltic Sea.\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21\r\nDecember 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical\r\nmeasures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound, amending Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1434/98 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 88/98, is also of relevance to\r\nfisheries management in the Baltic Sea.\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 of 18\r\nSeptember 2007 establishing a multiannual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic\r\nSea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks, amending Regulation (EEC) No\r\n2847/93 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 779/97, outlines the control and\r\nmonitoring measures necessary for rebuilding the cod stocks in question. It\r\nalso lays down the rules for setting the TACs for the Western and Eastern cod\r\nstocks and the associated fishing effort limitations.\n\u00b7      Consistency with other EU policies and objectives\nThe proposed measures are in accordance\r\nwith the objectives and rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and are consistent\r\nwith the Union\u2019s policy on sustainable development.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u00b7      Collection and use of expertise\nMain organisations/experts consulted\nThe scientific organisations consulted were\r\nthe International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the\r\nScientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).\nThe Union asks ICES and STECF each year for\r\nscientific advice on the state of important fish stocks. The advice received\r\ncovers all Baltic stocks for which TACs are proposed.\n\u00b7      Consultation of interested parties\nThe Baltic Sea Advisory Council (BSAC) was\r\nconsulted at its Joint Demersal/Pelagic Working Group meeting in June 2014 on\r\nthe basis of the assessment of the fish stocks conducted by ICES. The\r\nscientific basis for the proposal was provided by ICES and STECF. The preliminary\r\nviews expressed on all the fish stocks concerned were considered and taken into\r\naccount as far as possible in the proposal without contradicting existing\r\npolicies or causing any deterioration in the state of vulnerable resources. The\r\nscientific advice on catch limitations was also discussed within BALTFISH\r\nforum. \n\u00b7      Impact assessment\nThe total amount of the Baltic fishing\r\nopportunities expressed in tones proposed for 2015 will increase by 12% when\r\ncompared to 2014 and will be set at the level of approximatelly 629 thousand\r\ntonnes[1].\r\nWhen calculated on the stock basis, an increase is observed in TACs of four herring\r\nstocks \u2013 on average by 31%, while decreases are observed for western cod stock\r\n\u2013 by 48%, sprat \u2013 by 17%, and two salmon stocks \u2013 by 15% in number of pieces.\nBased on average landed fish prices\r\nobserved in 2012 among eight Baltic Sea countries[2], the value of fishing\r\nopportunities for herring stocks in 2015 will increase by almost 80 million\r\neuros to a total value of 164 million euros. The biggest decrease is observed\r\nin western cod TAC, i.e. from 32 million euros in 2014 to 14 million euros in\r\n2015. However taking into account the fact that the cod quota in 2013 was utilised\r\nat 60% and presuming that the same catch rate remains in 2014 and 2015, the\r\nreduction in quota value will be less significant. \nThe proposal reflects not only short-term\r\nconcerns but is also part of a longer-term approach whereby the level of\r\nfishing is gradually reduced to and maintained at long-term sustainable levels.\r\nThe approach taken in line with the proposal will therefore, in the medium to\r\nlong term, result in a stable fishing effort and higher quotas. The long term\r\neffects of the approach are expected to be more sustainable fishing activities\r\nand increased landings\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7      Summary of the proposed action\nThe proposal seeks to establish the catch\r\nlimitations applicable to EU fisheries, in order to achieve the objective of\r\nthe Common Fisheries Policy which is to ensure that exploatation of living\r\nmarine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested\r\nspecies above levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield.\n\u00b7      Legal basis\nArticle 43(3) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the Union\u2019s\r\nexclusive competence as referred to in Article 3(1)(d) TFEU. The subsidiarity\r\nprinciple therefore does not apply.\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons.\nThe Common Fisheries Policy is a common\r\npolicy. According to Article 43(3) TFEU it is incumbent upon the Council to\r\nadopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\nThe Council Regulation in question\r\nallocates fishing opportunities to Member States. Having regard to Article\r\n16(6) and (7) and Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, Member States are\r\nfree to allocate such opportunities among regions or operators acording to the\r\ncriterias set in the mentioned Articles. Therefore, Member States have ample\r\nroom for manoeuvre on decisions related to the social/economic model of their\r\nchoice to exploit their allocated fishing opportunities.\nThe proposal has no new financial\r\nimplications for Member States. This particular Regulation is adopted by the\r\nCouncil every year, and the public and private means to implement it are\r\nalready in place.\n\u00b7      Choice of instrument\nProposed instrument: Regulation.\nThis is a proposal for fisheries management\r\non the basis of Article 43(3) TFEU.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe proposal has no implications for the EU\r\nbudget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\u00b7      Simplification\nThe proposal continues to provide for\r\nsimplification of administrative procedures for public authorities (EU or\r\nnational), as it contains provisions similar to those of the 2014 Regulation on\r\nthe fishing opportunities in the Baltic Sea.\n\u00b7      Review/revision/sunset clause\nThe proposal concerns an annual Regulation\r\nfor the year 2015 and therefore does not include a revision clause.\n\u00b7      Detailed explanation\nThe proposal fixes for 2015 the fishing\r\nopportunities for certain stocks or groups of stocks for Member States fishing\r\nin the Baltic Sea. \nThe landing obligation for stocks caught in\r\ncertain fisheries starts to become applicable from 1 January 2015. In the Baltic\r\nSea these fisheries cover stocks under TACs and quotas in this Regulation,\r\nnamely: small pelagic fisheries (herring and sprat stocks), salmon fisheries (salmon\r\nstocks), as well as, cod fisheries (cod stocks), where the species define the\r\nfishery. Catches of species that do not define the fisheries but are covered by\r\nTACs, i.e. plaice will be covered by the landing obligation in the Baltic from\r\n1 January 2017. With introduction of the landing obligation, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013,\r\nthe fishing opportunities proposed shall reflect the change from amount landed\r\nto amount caught. This is done on the basis of the received scientific advice\r\nfor the fish stocks in fisheries as refered to in Article 15(1) of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1380/2013.\nThe fishing opportunities should also be\r\nfixed in accordance with Articles 16(1) (referring to the principle of relative\r\nstability) and 16(4) (referring to the objectives of the Common Fisheries\r\nPolicy and the rules provided for in multiannual plans).\nThe proposed figures reflect current scientific\r\nadvice and consultation with the BSAC. Where relevant, in order to set the EU\r\nquotas for stocks shared with the Russian Federation, the respective quantities\r\nof these stocks were deducted from the TACs adviced by ICES.\nGiven the Commission\u2019s intention of\r\nensuring the sustainable use of fishery resources in line with the Union\u2019s\r\npolicy and international commitments while maintaining stable fishing\r\nopportunities, annual variations in TACs are limited as far as practicable\r\ntaking account of the status of a given stock.\nThe TACs and quotas allocated to Member\r\nStates are shown in Annex I to the Regulation.\nAll five pelagic stocks (four stocks of\r\nherring and one sprat stock) and western cod stock in the Baltic Sea are to be\r\nfished at MSY levels in 2015, therefore the TACs proposed correspond to the MSY\r\nfishing mortality. The TACs for Gulf of Finland salmon and plaice corespond to\r\nthe approach developed by ICES which is applied to data limited stocks. The TAC\r\nfor salmon in the main basin corresponds to the harvest control rule set out in\r\nthe Baltic multi-annual plan for the salmon stock (COM(2011) 470 final). The\r\nadvice and the TAC for eastern cod stock still to be clarified by ICES[3].\nThe retrospective analysis of western cod\r\nstock shows that the actual fishing mortality has been higher than the target\r\nindicated in the multi-annual plan for the Baltic cod stocks and it should be\r\nreduced by 10% in accordance with Article 6 of the multiannual plan. However,\r\nICES does not consider such reduction precautionary and thus provides its\r\nadvice reflecting bigger reduction which is based on MSY approach. In\r\naccordance with Article 7 of the multi-annual plan, the Council may adopt the\r\nTAC which is lower than the TAC resulting from applying Article 6. No such\r\nderogation is possible as regards the fishing effort and therefore, according\r\nto Article 8(4), the number of days at sea has to be reduced by 10%.\nDue to changes in biology of the eastern\r\ncod stock, ICES did not provide biological reference points for this stock,\r\ni.e. actual fishing mortality. The plan has been developed under the assumption\r\nthat the cod growth remains stable which is no longer the case. In recent\r\nyears, as recognized by ICES, the growth of the eastern cod stock has been\r\nreduced dramatically and the biological reference points can no longer be\r\nestablished. Therefore according to ICES, the multi-annual plan for Baltic cod\r\nstocks cannot be used as a basis for an advice for eastern cod stock and\r\ninstead ICES advised the TAC based on the data limited approach. This renders Articles\r\n6, 7 and 8 of the multiannual plan impossible to apply for eastern cod stock in\r\n2015, as the rules for setting TACs and effort contained in the plan are based\r\non these reference points. Therefore, pending a proposal for a new multi-annual\r\nplan for the Baltic and in order to prevent that the eastern cod stock is\r\nover-exploited due to lack of established TACs, it is appropriate to fix the\r\nfishing opportunities based on the approach developed by ICES, in accordance\r\nwith Article 5(1) of the plan and 43(3) of the Treaty.\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 847/96 introduced\r\nadditional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs, including\r\nflexibility provisions under Articles 3 and 4 for precautionary and analytical\r\nstocks respectively. Under its Article 2, when fixing the TACs, the Council\r\nshall decide to which stocks Articles 3 and 4 shall not apply, in particular on\r\nthe basis of the biological status of the stocks. More recently, the\r\nflexibility mechanism was introduced for all stocks covered by the landing\r\nobligation by Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013. Therefore, in order to avoid excessive flexibility that would\r\nundermine the principle of rational and responsible exploatation of living\r\nmarine biological resources and hinder the achievement of the objectives of the\r\nCommon Fisheries Policy, it should be clarified that Article 3 and 4 of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 847/96 apply only where Member States do not use the\r\nyear-to-year flexibility provided for in Article 15(9) of Regulation 1380/2013.\r\n\n2014/0254 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nfixing for 2015 the fishing opportunities\r\nfor certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[4]\r\nrequires that measures governing access to waters and resources and the\r\nsustainable pursuit of fishing activities be established taking into account\r\navailable scientific, technical and economic advice and, in particular, the\r\nreport drawn up by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for\r\nFisheries (STECF) as well as in the light of any advice received from Advisory\r\nCouncils established \u00a0for the relevant geographical areas or fields of\r\ncompetence.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is incumbent upon the\r\nCouncil to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities\r\nby fishery or group of fisheries, including , as appropriate, \u00a0certain\r\nconditions functionally linked thereto. In accordance with Article 16(1) and\r\n(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 fishing opportunities should be distributed\r\namong Member States in such a way as to ensure relative stability of each\r\nMember State's fishing activities for each stock or fishery and in accordance\r\nthe objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy established in Article 2(2) of\r\nthat.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The total allowable\r\ncatches (TACs) should therefore be established, in line with Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2913 and taking into account the principles mentioned in recital 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For small pelagic (herring\r\nand sprat), cod and salmon\u00a0 fisheries in the Baltic Sea the landing obligation\r\nreferred to in Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 \u00a0applies from 1\r\nJanuary 2015. Article 16(2) of that Regulation provides that, when the landing\r\nobligation is introduced in respect of a fish stock, fishing opportunities are\r\nto be fixed taking into account the change from fixing fishing opportunities\r\nthat reflect landings to fixing fishing opportunities that reflect catches.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, for stocks\r\nsubject to specific multiannual plans, in accordance with Article 16(4) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the fishing opportunities should be established\r\nin accordance with the rules laid down in those plans. Consequently, catch\r\nlimits and fishing effort limits for cod stock in subdivisions 22-24 should be\r\nestablished in accordance with the Baltic Sea Cod Plan established by Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1098/2007 [5].\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recent scientific advice shows\r\nthat the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) could not\r\nestablish the biological reference points for cod stock in subdivisions 25-32\r\nand instead it advised that the TAC for this cod stock\r\nbe based on the data limited approach. The absence of\r\nbiological reference points makes it impossible to follow the rules for setting\r\nthe fishing opportunities and effort levels for cod stock in subdivision 25-32.\r\nAs not fixing fishing opportunities could constitute a serious threat to the\r\nsustainibility of that stock, it is appropriate to fix the TACs for this cod stock\r\nat a level corresponding to the approach developed and advised by ICES.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the\r\nscientific advice, flexibility in the management of the fishing effort for cod\r\nstock in subdivisions 22-24 in the Baltic Sea can be introduced without\r\njeopardising the objectives of the Baltic Sea Cod Plan and without causing an\r\nincrease in fishing mortality. Such flexibility would allow for more efficient\r\nmanagement of the fishing effort where quotas are not allocated equally among\r\nthe fleet of a Member State and would facilitate swift reactions to quota\r\nexchanges. A Member State should, therefore, be allowed to allocate to vessels\r\nflying its flag additional days absent from port where an equal amount of days\r\nabsent from port is withdrawn from other vessels flying its flag.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of fishing\r\nopportunities as set out in this Regulation is subject to Council Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1224/2009 [6],\r\nand in particular Articles 33 and 34 thereof, concerning the recording of\r\ncatches and fishing effort and the information on data on the exhaustion of\r\nfishing opportunities. It is therefore necessary to specify the codes relating\r\nto landings of stocks subject to this Regulation which are to be used by the\r\nMember States when sending data to the Commission.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 847/96 introduced additional conditions for year-to-year\r\nmanagement of TACs, including flexibility provisions under Articles 3 and 4 for\r\nprecautionary and analytical stocks respectively. Under its Article 2, when\r\nfixing the TACs, the Council shall decide to which stocks Articles 3 and 4\r\nshall not apply, in particular on the basis of the biological status of the\r\nstocks. More recently, the flexibility mechanism was introduced for all stocks\r\ncovered by the landing obligation by Article 15(9) of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1380/2013. Therefore, in order to avoid excessive flexibility that\r\nwould undermine the principle of rational and responsible exploatation of\r\nliving marine biological resources, hinder the achievement of the objectives of\r\nthe Common Fisheries Policy and deteriorate the biological status of the stocks,\r\nit should be established that Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 shall\r\napply to analytical TACs only where Member States do not use the year-to-year\r\nflexibility provided for in Article 15(9) of Regulation 1380/2013.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid\r\ninterruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihoods of Union\r\nfishermen, it is important to open the fisheries covered by this Regulation as\r\nfrom 1 January 2015.
