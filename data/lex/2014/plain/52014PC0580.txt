Amendments to this Agreement were approved\r\nin 1963, 1976 and 1997. The European Community acceded to the GFCM on 16 June\r\n1998 through Decision 98/416/EC[1].\r\n Mediterranean and Black Sea EU Member States are also parties to this\r\nAgreement.\nThe GFCM is a so-called Regional Fisheries\r\nManagement Organisation (RFMO), with the aim of promoting the development,\r\nconservation, rational management and best utilization of living marine\r\nresources, as well as the sustainable development of aquaculture in the Mediterranean\r\nand Black Sea.\nAn amendment of the GFCM Agreement was\r\nlaunched in 2013 following a performance review finalised in 2011, which\r\nconcluded that the Agreement should be amended to clarify the objectives and\r\nfunctions of the GFCM, and strengthen its efficiency. \nThe amended Agreement was negotiated with\r\nthe GFCM Contracting Parties. The legal Service of the FAO also participated to\r\nthe debate. The Council authorised the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the\r\nUnion on matters falling within the Union's competence. The negotiations were\r\ncarried out by Member States and the Commission as per their respective areas\r\nof competence in accordance to the terms of the mandate. Throughout the\r\nnegotiations, Member States and the Commission coordinated regularly and\r\nclosely throughout the negotiation process. \u00a0\nThe Contracting Parties to the GFCM endorsed\r\nthe \"Amended Agreement for the establishment of the General Fisheries\r\nCommission for the Mediterranean\" at the GFCM 38 Annual Session on 19-24\r\nMay 2014. \nThe amended Agreement revises the structure\r\nand content of the current one, so as to bring it in line with modern RFMO\r\ninstruments. Main changes introduced are as follows:\n\u2013                        \r\nA clearer explanation of the purpose and\r\nunderlying principles of the GFCM Agreement. The new Agreement sets a clear\r\noverall objective of biological, social, economic and environmental\r\nsustainability of living marine resources. It also introduces definitions of\r\nthe terms that are necessary for the correct interpretation of the Agreement. Better\r\ndefined functions of the GFCM, which include the promotion of common fishery\r\nmanagement through multiannual management plans, the establishment of fisheries\r\nrestricted areas, and the collection and dissemination of data. In this\r\ncontext, the new Agreement integrates core elements of the Common Fisheries\r\nPolicy regarding the objective of maximum sustainable yield, the ecosystem and\r\nprecautionary approach, the reduction of discards, the fight against illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing. \n\u2013                        \r\nProvisions for the establishment of\r\nmeasures/sanctions to address non-compliance by Members/non-Members\n\u2013                        \r\nEstablishment of a well-defined dispute\r\nsettlement mechanism in case disputes arise between Contracting Parties. \nThe amended Agreement is in line with the\r\nmain objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy. \nThe proposal intends to conclude the amended\r\nGFCM Agreement on behalf of the European Union.\nThe text of the amended Agreement in annex\r\nto the proposed Council Decision will undergo a final legal check by the FAO,\r\nwhich should be finalised in October 2014. The text may therefore undergo\r\nchanges, which are not expected to be of substance. In order to avoid\r\nunnecessary delays in the conclusion of the amended Agreement, the Commission\r\nproceeds to the submission of the current proposal. The Commission will ensure\r\nthat the FAO validated text is submitted to the Council before discussions in\r\nthe Council Working Party start. \nThe Council is requested to adopt the\r\nproposal as soon as possible following the consent of the European Parliament.\n2014/0274 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nconcerning the conclusion, on behalf of\r\nthe European Union, of the amended Agreement for the establishment of the\r\nGeneral Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(6)(a), thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nCommission[2],\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[3],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement for the establishment of the General\r\nFisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), was established and approved\r\nat the Fifth Session of the FAO Conference in 1949, entered\r\ninto force on 20 February 1952. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Community\r\nbecame a contracting party to the GFCM through the adoption by the Council of Decision\r\n(98/416/EC) of 16 June 1998 on the accession of the\r\nEuropean Community to the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean[4].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By virtue of Article 1,\r\nthird paragraph, of the Treaty on European Union, the European Union has\r\nreplaced and succeeded to the European Community. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 November 2013 the\r\nCouncil authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, amendments\r\nto the GFCM Agreement on matters falling under the Union's competence.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Negotiations were carried\r\nout by Member States and the Commission as per their respective areas of\r\ncompetence in accordance to the mandate and in close coordination between them.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Negotiations were\r\nsuccessfully concluded at the GFCM meeting from 19 to 24 May 2014, which\r\nendorsed by consensus a text of an amended Agreement. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpuse of the amendment\r\nis to modernise the GFCM and reinforce its role in the conservation of\r\nfisheries resources in its area of competence. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objectives, general\r\nprinciples and functions of the GFCM been been reviewed and broadened to ensure\r\nthe long term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and\r\ntheir environment. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amended Agreement is\r\nin line with the principles of the Union's Common Fisheries Policy, it is therefore\r\nin the Union's interest to approve it, \nHAS ADOPTED THIS\r\nDECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe amended Agreement\r\nestablishing the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean as set out\r\nin the Annex is hereby concluded.\nArticle 2\nThe President of the\r\nCouncil shall designate the person empowered to proceed, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, to notify the FAO of the European Union's acceptance of the amended\r\nAgreement. \nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall\r\nenter into force 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of\r\nthe European Union.
