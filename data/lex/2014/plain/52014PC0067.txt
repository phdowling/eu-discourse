Since the rules need to\nbe compatible with one another, a complex international system for coordination\nand harmonisation has been developed between the organisations involved in this\nwork. The provisions are adapted following a two-year cycle. \nA large range of public and private sector\nexperts has been consulted during the preparation of these amendments. The\nfollowing technical meetings have been carried out during the development of\nthese amendments:\nat the United Nations Sub-Committee of\nExperts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods in its \n(1)                   \n41st session in Geneva, 25 June \u2013 4\nJuly 2012,\n(2)                   \n42nd session in Geneva, 3 \u2013 11\nDecember 2012, \n(3)                   \n43rd session in Geneva, 24 \u2013 28 June\n2013 and \n(4)                   \n44th session in Geneva, 25 November \u2013\n4 December 2013,\nat the UN-ECE \u2013 OTIF Joint Meeting of the\nRID Committee of Experts and the Working Party on the Transport of Dangerous\nGoods in its\n(1)                   \nautumn 2012 session in Geneva, 17 \u2013 21 September\n2012,\n(2)                   \nspring 2013 session in Bern, 18 \u2013 22 March 2013,\n\n(3)                   \nautumn 2013 session in Geneva, 17 \u2013 27 September\n2013, and\n(4)                   \nthere is a further Joint Meeting, spring 2014\nsession in Bern, 17 \u2013 21 March 2014, which is expected to recommend further\namendments applicable on 1 January 2015,\nat the standing working group of the RID\ncommittee of experts in its\n(1)                   \nfirst session in Riga, 12 \u2013 15 November 2012,\nand\n(2)                   \nsecond session in Copenhagen, 18 \u2013 22 November\n2013.\nIn these meetings the individual proposals\nfor amendments have been analysed and processed by the expert committees. In\nmost cases the recommended action has been agreed upon unanimously. Certain\nproposals have been recommended by a majority view of the experts. The RID expert\ncommittee will take decisions on these proposals on 22 May 2014.\nThe committee on the transport of dangerous\ngoods, established under Directive 2008/68/EC of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 24 September 2008 on the inland transport of dangerous goods[1], carried out\npreliminary discussions on the proposals in its meeting on 12 December 2013.\nThe European Railway Agency (ERA) has made\nan extensive impact assessment on the application of derailment detectors[2]. ERA concludes that the\ncompulsory application of these devices on wagons carrying certain dangerous\ngoods is not cost-effective.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe Union acceded to COTIF in July 2011 by\nvirtue of Council Decision 2013/103/EU[3].\nCOTIF is a mixed agreement where both the Union and all Member States are contracting parties. Annex III to the Decision establishes the internal arrangements\nfor the Council, the Member States and the Commission in proceedings under OTIF.\nIn matters of exclusive EU competence, the EU votes with the number of votes of\nall Member States which are members of COTIF. There are 26 EU Member States\nthat are also Member States of COTIF. Currently there are forty-six RID\nContracting states and forty-eight OTIF Member States.\nSince 1 January 1997 the Union has applied\nthe RID provisions to all transport on the EU territory, initially pursuant to\nCouncil Directive 96/49/EC of 23 July 1996 on the approximation of the laws of\nthe Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail[4]. In 2008 Directive\n96/49/EC was repealed by Directive 2008/68/EC which pursues the principles of\nits predecessor. \nArticle 4 of Directive 2008/68/EC, concerning third countries establishes that \"The transport of dangerous goods between Member States and third\ncountries shall be authorised in so far as it complies with the requirements of\nthe ADR, RID or ADN, unless otherwise indicated in the Annexes\"[5]. In addition, Recital\n12 of the Directive establishes that \"The use of means of transport\nregistered in third countries should be allowed for the international transport\nof dangerous goods within the territories of the Member States, subject to\ncompliance with the relevant provisions of the ADR, RID or ADN and of this\nDirective\". Therefore the matter of the above mentioned amendments falls entirely\nwithin exclusive Union competence.\nThus, in accordance with Article 35 of\nTitle VI of COTIF, once decided upon by the RID expert committee, the\namendments shall enter into force for all Contracting parties on the first day\nof the sixth month following that during which the Secretary General has given\nnotice of them to the Contracting Parties. A contracting party may formulate an\nobjection within the period of four months from the day of the notification. In\nthe case of objection by one-quarter of the Contracting Parties, the\nmodification shall not enter into force.\nIn the Contracting Parties which have\nformulated objections against a decision within the foreseen period, the\napplication of the Appendix C shall be suspended, in its entirety, from the moment\nthe decisions take effect, in so far as it concerns traffic with and between\nthose parties. However, in the case of objection to the validation of a\ntechnical standard or to the adoption of a uniform technical prescription, only\nthat standard or prescription shall be suspended in respect of traffic with and\nbetween the Member States from the time the decisions take effect; the same\nshall apply in the case of a partial objection.\nUnless a sufficient number of objections\nare raised by the parties, the amendments concerned under this proposal are\nexpected to enter into force on 1 January 2015 and become binding on the Union\nand the Member States, forming an integral part of the Union acquis.\nFinally, Article 38 of Title VII of COTIF\nestablishes that for the purposes of the exercise of the right to vote and the\nright to object provided for in Article 35\u00a72 and 35\u00a74, the regional\norganisation, in particular the European Union shall enjoy the number of votes\nequal to those of its members which are also Member States of the Organisation.\n\nThe proposal has been developed based on\nthe provisions of the Council Decision on EU accession to COTIF (Decision\n2013/103/EU). The legal basis of the proposed Council Decision is Article 91\nTFEU in conjunction with Article 218(9) TFEU.\nThe proposal for a Council Decision provides\nfor in its Annex a detailed list of the envisaged amendments, specifying which\namendments can be accepted by the Union and which amendments must be opposed. A\nmajority of the envisaged amendments are considered to be appropriate for the\nsafe transport of dangerous goods in a cost effective manner, taking into\naccount technological progress, and can therefore be supported.\nHowever, the amendment indicated with\nnumber 9 in the annex to the draft decision has not been developed enough to\ntake a decision in view of entry into force on 1 January 2015 and thus the\ndecision should be postponed to a later stage.\nAmendment 14 on the compulsory use of\nderailment detectors has been already discussed for the revision of 1 January\n2013 and the decision was postponed. While certain Member States support the\ninitiative there are others that oppose it. According to the impact assessment\ncarried out by ERA the measure would not be cost-efficient and more efficient\nalternative measures are available. Thus it is proposed to oppose this\namendment at this stage. However, this position is without prejudice to any\nfurther work and development in this area.\nWhere the amendments adopted by the RID expert\ncommittee referred are not in accordance with the Union's position established\nin the Annex to the draft decision, the Union should formulate an objection\nfollowing the procedure established in Article 35\u00a74 of Title VI of COTIF in order to\navoid such amendment to enter into force.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IMPLEMENTATION IN THE\nEUROPEAN UNION\nThe above mentioned amendments, to the\nextent that they become binding on the Union, will need to be incorporated into\nDirective 2008/68/EC on the inland transport of dangerous goods, which applies\nuniform rules under COTIF to the transport of dangerous goods by road, by rail\nor by inland waterway within or between Member States. To this end, the\nCommission has been empowered to adapt Annex II, Section II.1 to Directive\n2008/68/EC to scientific and technical progress. Once the objection period as\nregards the notification by the Secretary General of OTIF has expired, the\nCommission will launch the adaptation process.\n2014/0035 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be adopted by\nthe Union at the 53rd session of the OTIF Committee of Experts on\nthe Transport of Dangerous Goods as regards certain amendments to Appendix C to\nthe Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF) applicable\nfrom 1 January 2015\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91 in conjunction\nwith Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union acceded to the\nConvention concerning International Carriage by Rail of 9 May 1980 as amended\nby the Vilnius Protocol of 3 June 1999 (hereinafter referred to as the \"COTIF\nConvention\"), by virtue of Council Decision 2013/103/EU of 16 June 2011 on\nthe signing and conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the\nIntergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail on the accession\nof the European Union to the said Convention[6].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All Member States, with\nthe exception of Cyprus and Malta, are contracting parties to the COTIF\nConvention.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2008/68/EC of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 2008 on the inland\ntransport of dangerous goods[7] lays down requirements for the transport of dangerous goods by\nroad, by rail or by inland waterway within or between Member States, by referring\nto the Regulations concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by\nRail, appearing as Appendix C to the COTIF Convention (RID Annex). In addition,\nArticle 4 of this Directive provides that \"The transport of\ndangerous goods between Member States and third countries shall be authorised\nin so far as it complies with the requirements of the ADR, RID or ADN, unless\notherwise indicated in the Annexes.\" Therefore, the subject-matter of\nthese regulations, as well as their amendments, falls within the Union's exclusive competence. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Committee of Experts\non the Transport of Dangerous Goods set up in accordance with Article 13.1(d) of\nthe COTIF Convention, at its 53rd session due to take place on 22\nMay 2014, is expected to decide upon certain amendments to the RID Annex. These\namendments, which concern technical standards or uniform technical\nprescriptions, have the objective to ensure safe and efficient transport of\ndangerous goods whilst taking into account scientific and technical progress in\nthe sector and the development of new substances and articles that pose danger\nduring their transport.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The committee on the\ntransport of dangerous goods established by Article 9 of Directive 2008/68/EC\nhas carried out preliminary discussions on these amendments.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the proposed amendments\nare justified and beneficial, and should therefore be supported by the Union. However, certain proposed amendments are not proportional to the risks posed during\ntransport or are not efficient in improving transport safety and should\ntherefore be opposed. Furthermore, should the latter amendments be approved,\nthe Union should formulate an objection following the procedure established in\nArticle 35\u00a74 of Title VII of the COTIF Convention,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nPosition of the European Union\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position to be taken\nby the European Union at the 53rd session
