In accordance with Article 395(2) of the VAT Directive, the\r\nCommission informed the other Member States by letters dated 1 September 2014\r\nof the request made by Romania. By letter dated 3 September 2014, the\r\nCommission notified Romania that it had all the information necessary to\r\nconsider the request.\nGeneral context\nChapter 1 of Title XII of the VAT Directive\r\nallows for the possibility for Member States to apply special schemes for small\r\nenterprises, including the possibility of exempting taxable persons below a\r\ncertain annual turnover. This exemption implies that a taxable person does not\r\nhave to charge VAT on his supplies and, consequently, he cannot deduct the VAT\r\non his inputs.\nUnder Article 287(18) of the VAT Directive,\r\n  Romania may exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no\r\nhigher than the equivalent in national currency of EUR 35 000 at the conversion\r\nrate on the day of its accession.\nIn 2011, Romania requested a derogation in\r\norder to simplify VAT obligations for small traders and to ease the collection\r\nof the tax for the national tax administration. By Council Decision 2012/181/EU\r\nof 26 March 2012, the Council authorised Romania to exempt from VAT taxable\r\npersons whose annual turnover is no higher than the equivalent in national\r\ncurrency of EUR 65 000 until 31 December 2014. This measure is optional for\r\ntaxable persons.\nRomania has now\r\nrequested an extension of that measure.\nFrom the information provided by Romania, it appears that more than 10000 taxable persons benefited from VAT exemption as a\r\nresult of the application of the measure. In addition, the structure of the\r\nRomanian economy shows that more than 84% of the total number of taxpayers has\r\na turnover below EUR 65 000. Approximately 21% of such taxpayers are registered\r\nfor VAT and contribute to only 1.81% in the total of the VAT revenues and to\r\nonly 0.54% in the total state budget revenues. Romania considers that this\r\nmeasure brings simplification both for taxable persons and for the tax\r\nadministration. It is proposed to extend the derogation for another period\r\nuntil 31 December 2017.\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nSimilar derogations have been granted to\r\nother Member States. \nConsistency with the other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThe measure is in line with the Union's\r\nobjectives for small businesses, as laid out in Commission Communication\r\n\"Think small first\" \u2013 a \"Small Business Act\" for\r\nEurope\" (COM(2008) 394 of 25 June 2008).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nNot relevant.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThe proposal for a Council Implementing Decision\r\naims at continuing a simplification measure which removes many of the VAT\r\nobligations for businesses operating with an annual turnover no higher than the\r\nequivalent in national currency of EUR 65 000 and therefore has a potential\r\npositive impact.\nBecause of the narrow scope of the\r\nderogation, and its limited application in time, the scope will in any case be\r\nlimited.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nAuthorisation for Romania to continue to\r\napply a derogating measure from the VAT Directive as regards a simplification\r\nmeasure for businesses with an annual turnover no higher than the equivalent in\r\nnational currency of EUR 65 000 at the conversion rate on the day of its\r\naccession.\nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive.\nSubsidiarity principle\nConsidering the provision of the VAT\r\nDirective on which the proposal is based, the proposal falls under the\r\nexclusive competence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle\r\ntherefore does not apply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons.\nThe Decision concerns an authorisation\r\ngranted to a Member State upon its own request and does not constitute any\r\nobligation.\nGiven the limited scope of the derogation,\r\nthe special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: Council Implementing Decision.\nUnder Article 395 of the VAT Directive,\r\nderogation from the common VAT rules is only possible with the authorisation of\r\nthe Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission. Moreover, a\r\nCouncil Implementing Decision is the most suitable instrument since it can be\r\naddressed to individual Member States.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the EU\r\nbudget because Romania will carry out a compensation calculation in accordance\r\nwith Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC EURATOM) 1553/89.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nLimitation clause\nThe proposal is limited in time.\n2014/0302 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nextending the application of Council\r\nImplementing Decision 2012/181/EU authorising Romania to apply a special\r\nmeasure derogating from Article 287 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common\r\nsystem of value added tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive\r\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax[1], and in particular\r\nArticle 395(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\r\nCommission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letters registered with\r\nthe Commission on 28 April 2014 and 22 August 2014, Romania requested\r\nauthorisation for a measure derogating from Article 287 (18) of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC in order to continue to exempt from value added tax (VAT) taxable\r\npersons whose annual turnover is no higher than the equivalent in national\r\ncurrency of EUR 65 000 at the conversion rate on the day of accession. Through\r\nthat measure, those taxable persons would continue to be exempted from certain\r\nor all of the obligations in relation to VAT referred to in Chapters 2 to 6 of\r\nTitle XI of Directive 2006/112/EC.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nsecond paragraph of Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission\r\ninformed the other Member States by letter dated 1 September 2014 of the\r\nrequest made by Romania. By letter dated 3 September 2014, the Commission\r\nnotified Romania that it had all the information necessary to consider the\r\nrequest.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A special scheme for small\r\nenterprises is already available to Member States under Title XII of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC. Under point (18) of Article 287 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Romania may exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than the\r\nequivalent in national currency of EUR 35 000 at the conversion rate on the day\r\nof its accession.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Implementing Decision\r\n2012/181/EU of 26 March 2012 authorising Romania to introduce a special measure\r\nderogating from Article 287 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of\r\nvalue added tax[2],\r\nRomania was authorised, until 31 December 2014 and as a derogating measure, to\r\nexempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than the\r\nequivalent in national currency of EUR 65 000 at the conversion rate on the day\r\nof its accession. Given that this higher threshold has resulted in reduced VAT\r\nobligations for the smallest businesses, whilst the latter may still opt for\r\nthe regular VAT arrangements in accordance with Article 290 of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC, Romania should be authorised to apply the measure for a further\r\nlimited period. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From the information\r\nprovided by Romania, the measure will only have a negligible impact on the VAT collected\r\nat the stage of final consumption.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogation has no\r\nimpact on the Union\u2019s own resources accruing from VAT,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nBy way of derogation from point 18 of\r\nArticle 287 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Romania is authorised to exempt from VAT\r\ntaxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than the equivalent in national\r\ncurrency of EUR 65 000 at the conversion rate on the day of its accession to\r\nthe European Union. \nArticle 2\nThis decision shall apply from 1 January\r\n2015 until 31 December 2017.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to Romania.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 92, 30.03.2012, p. 26.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
