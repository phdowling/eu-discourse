Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the Commission\r\ndecided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten\r\namendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments\r\nshould endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they\r\nare responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily\r\nunderstandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a\r\ngiven matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament, the\r\nCouncil and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the\r\nfast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 385/96 of\r\n29 January 1996 on protection against injurious pricing of vessels[3]. The new Regulation\r\nwill supersede the various acts incorporated in it[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the\r\ncodification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of\r\na preliminary consolidation, in 22 official languages, of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 385/96 and the instrument amending it, carried out by the Publications\r\nOffice of the European Union, by means of a data\u2011processing system.\r\nWhere the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old\r\nand the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex II to the\r\ncodified Regulation.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\n(adapted)\n2014/0280 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non protection against injurious pricing of\r\nvessels (codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5, and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00ea \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 385/96[6]\r\nhas been substantially amended[7].\r\nIn the interests of clarity and rationality, that Regulation should be\r\ncodified.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 1\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Multilateral negotiations\r\nconducted under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\r\nDevelopment led to the conclusion, on 21 December 1994, of an\r\nAgreement Respecting Normal Competitive Conditions in the Commercial Shipbuilding\r\nand Repair Industry (\u2018the Shipbuilding Agreement\u2019).\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 2 (adapted)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It has been recognised in\r\nthe framework of the Shipbuilding Agreement that the special characteristics of\r\nship-purchase transactions have made it impractical to apply countervailing and\r\nanti-dumping duties, as provided \u00d6 for \u00d5 under Article\r\nVI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Agreement on Subsidies\r\nand Countervailing Measures, and the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI\r\nof \u00d6 the\r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \u00d5 1994 \u00d6 (\u2018the\r\n1994 Anti-Dumping Agreement\u2019) \u00d5 annexed to the\r\nAgreement establishing the World Trade Organization. The need to provide for an\r\neffective means of protection against sales of ships below their normal value\r\nwhich cause injury has led to the conclusion of a Shipbuilding Injurious\r\nPricing Code which, together with its Basic Principles, constitutes Annex III\r\nto the Shipbuilding Agreement (\u2018the IPI Code\u2019).\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 3 (adapted)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The text of \u00d6 the \u00d5 IPI Code is\r\nmainly based on the \u00d6 1994\r\nAnti-Dumping \u00d5 Agreement, but\r\ndeviates from \u00d6 that \u00d5 Agreement when\r\nwarranted by the specific nature of ship\u2011purchase transactions. Therefore\r\nthe language of the IPI Code \u00d6 should be\r\nreflected \u00d5 in \u00d6 Union \u00d5 legislation,\r\nto the extent possible on the basis of the text of [Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009[8]].\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 4 (adapted)\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Shipbuilding Agreement\r\nand the legislative provisions deriving therefrom are of significant importance\r\nfor \u00d6 Union \u00d5 law.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 5 (adapted)\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To maintain the balance of\r\nrights and obligations which the Shipbuilding Agreeement establishes, action\r\nshould be taken by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 against any\r\ninjuriously priced vessel whose sale at less than normal value causes injury to\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 6 (adapted)\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vis-\u00e0-vis\r\nshipbuilders from parties to the Shipbuilding Agreement, the sale of a vessel\r\nmay be subject to an investigation by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 only when the\r\nbuyer of the vessel is a \u00d6 Union \u00d5 buyer, and\r\nprovided the ship is not a military vessel.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 7 (adapted)\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is desirable to \u00d6 set\r\nout \u00d5 clear and\r\ndetailed rules on the calculation of \u00d6 the \u00d5 normal value.\r\nIn particular such value should where possible be based on a representative\r\nsale of a like vessel in the ordinary course of trade in the exporting country.\r\nIt is expedient to define the circumstances in which a domestic sale may be\r\nconsidered to be made at a loss and may be disregarded and in which recourse\r\nmay be had to sale of a like vessel to a third country or to constructed normal\r\nvalue. It is also desirable to provide for a proper allocation of costs, even\r\nin start-up situations. It is also necessary, when constructing normal value,\r\nto indicate the methodology to be applied in determining the amounts for\r\nselling, general and administrative costs and the profit margin that should be\r\nincluded in such value.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 8 (adapted)\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to be able to\r\napply correctly the instrument for combating injurious pricing, the Commission \u00d6 should \u00d5 take all\r\nnecessary steps to ascertain, in the large conglomerates and holdings of third\r\ncountries, the validity of accounting charges when the cost price structure\r\nneeds to be estimated.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 9 (adapted)\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When determining \u00d6 the \u00d5 normal\r\nvalue for non-market economy countries, it appears prudent to set out rules for\r\nchoosing the appropriate market-economy third country to be used for such\r\npurpose and, where it is not possible to find a suitable third country, to\r\nprovide that \u00d6 the \u00d5 normal\r\nvalue may be established on any other reasonable basis.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 10 (adapted)\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is expedient to define\r\nthe export price and to enumerate the adjustments which \u00d6 should \u00d5 be made in\r\nthose cases where a reconstruction of \u00d6 that \u00d5 price from the\r\nfirst open-market price is deemed necessary.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 11 (adapted)\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of ensuring\r\na fair comparison between \u00d6 the \u00d5 export\r\nprice and \u00d6 the \u00d5 normal\r\nvalue, it is advisable to list the factors, including contractual penalties,\r\nwhich may affect prices and price comparability.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 12 (adapted)\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is desirable to \u00d6 provide\r\nfor \u00d5 clear and\r\ndetailed guidance as to the factors which may be relevant for the determination\r\nof whether the injuriously priced sale has caused material injury or is\r\nthreatening to cause injury. In demonstrating that the price level of the sale\r\nconcerned is responsible for injury sustained by a \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry,\r\nattention should be given to the effect of other factors and in particular\r\nprevailing market conditions in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 13 (adapted)\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is advisable to define\r\nthe term \u2018 \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\u2019 by\r\nreference to the capability to build a like vessel and to provide that parties\r\nrelated to exporters may be excluded from such industry, and to define the term\r\n\u2018related\u2019.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 14 (adapted)\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to \u00d6 set\r\nout \u00d5 the procedural\r\nand substantive conditions for lodging a complaint against injurious pricing,\r\nincluding the extent to which it should be supported by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, and\r\nthe information on the buyer of the vessel, injurious pricing, injury and\r\ncausation which such complaint should contain. It is also expedient to specify\r\nthe procedures for the rejection of complaints or the initiation of\r\nproceedings.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 15 (adapted)\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the buyer of the\r\ninjuriously priced vessel is established in the territory of another\r\nContracting Party to the Shipbuilding Agreement, a complaint may also contain a\r\nrequest that an investigation be initiated by the authorities of that\r\nContracting Party. Such request \u00d6 should \u00d5 be transmitted\r\nto the authorities of the Contracting Party, where warranted.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 16\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where appropriate, an\r\ninvestigation may also be initiated upon a written complaint by the authorities\r\nof a Contracting Party to the Shipbuilding Agreement, in accordance with this\r\nRegulation and under the conditions of the Shipbuilding Agreement.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 17 (adapted)\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to \u00d6 specify \u00d5 the manner in\r\nwhich interested parties should be given notice of the information which the\r\nauthorities require. \u00d6 Interested\r\nparties \u00d5 should have\r\nample opportunity to present all relevant evidence and to defend their\r\ninterests. It is also desirable to set out clearly the rules and procedures to\r\nbe followed during the investigation, in particular the rules whereby\r\ninterested parties are to make themselves known, present their views and submit\r\ninformation within specified time limits, if such views and information are to\r\nbe taken into account. It is also appropriate to set out the conditions under\r\nwhich an interested party may have access to, and comment on, information\r\npresented by other interested parties. There should also be cooperation between\r\nthe Member States and the Commission in the collection of information.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 18\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to provide\r\nthat the termination of cases should, irrespective of whether an injurious\r\npricing charge is imposed or not, take place no later than one year from the\r\ndate of initiation or the date of delivery of the vessel, as the case may be.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigations or\r\nproceedings should be terminated where the margin of injurious pricing is de\r\nminimis.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 19\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation may be\r\nterminated without the imposition of an injurious pricing charge if the sale of\r\nthe injuriously priced vessel is definitively and unconditionally voided or if\r\nan alternative equivalent remedy is accepted. The need to avoid jeopardising\r\nachievement of the aim pursued under this Regulation should, however, be given\r\nspecial consideration.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 20 (adapted)\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An injurious pricing charge\r\nequal to the amount of the injurious pricing margin \u00d6 should \u00d5 be imposed by\r\ndecision on the shipbuilder whose injuriously priced sale of a vessel has\r\ncaused injury to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry,\r\nwhere all the conditions provided for in this Regulation are fulfilled. Precise\r\nand detailed rules should be provided for the implementation of such decision,\r\nincluding all measures necessary for its actual enforcement, in particular the\r\ntaking of countermeasures if the shipbuilder does not pay the injurious pricing\r\ncharge within the applicable time limit.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 21 (adapted)\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to \u00d6 set\r\nout \u00d5 precise rules for\r\nthe denial of the right to load and unload in \u00d6 Union \u00d5 ports to\r\nvessels built by shipbuilders subject to countermeasures.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 22\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The obligation to pay the\r\ninjurious pricing charge expires only when such charge is fully paid or at the\r\nend of the period during which the countermeasures are applicable.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 23 (adapted)\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any action taken under this\r\nRegulation should not be contrary to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 interest.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 24 (adapted)\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In acting pursuant to this\r\nRegulation, the \u00d6 Union should \u00d5 bear in mind\r\nthe need for rapid and effective action.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 26\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is expedient to provide\r\nfor verification visits to check information submitted on injurious pricing and\r\ninjury, such visits being, however, conditional on proper replies to\r\nquestionnaires being received.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 27\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to provide\r\nthat, where parties do not cooperate satisfactorily, other information may be\r\nused to establish findings and that such information may be less favourable to\r\nthe parties than if they had cooperated.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 28\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision should be made\r\nfor the treatment of confidential information so that business secrets are not\r\ndivulged.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\nrecital 29 (adapted)\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is essential that\r\nprovision be made for the proper disclosure of the essential facts and considerations\r\nto parties which qualify for such treatment and that such disclosure be made,\r\nwith due regard to the decision-making process in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , within a\r\ntime period which permits parties to defend their interests.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .5 (adapted)\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The implementation of the\r\nprocedures provided for in \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation\r\nrequires uniform conditions for the adoption of measures necessary for its\r\nimplementation in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[9],\n\u00ea 385/96\r\n(adapted)\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nPrinciples and definitions\n1. An injurious pricing charge may be\r\nimposed on the builder of any injuriously priced vessel whose sale to a buyer\r\nother than a buyer of the country in which the vessel originates causes injury.\n2. A vessel is to be considered as being\r\ninjuriously priced if the export price of the vessel sold is less than a\r\ncomparable price for \u00d6 a \u00d5 like vessel,\r\nin the ordinary course of trade, when sold to a buyer of the exporting country.\n3. For the \u00d6 purposes \u00d5 of this\r\nRegulation, \u00d6 the following definitions shall apply: \u00d5\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u2018vessel\u2019 \u00d6 means \u00d5 any\r\nself-propelled sea-going vessel of 100 gross tonnes and above used for\r\ntransportation of goods or persons or for performance of a specialised service\r\n(for example, ice breakers and dredgers) and any tug of 365 kW and over;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u2018like vessel\u2019 \u00d6 means \u00d5 any vessel of\r\nthe same type, purpose and approximate size as the vessel under consideration\r\nand possessing characteristics closely resembling those of the vessel under\r\nconsideration;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u2018same general category of\r\nvessel\u2019 \u00d6 means \u00d5 any vessel of\r\nthe same type and purpose, but of a significantly different size;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u2018sale\u2019 \u00d6 covers \u00d5 the creation\r\nor transfer of an ownership interest in the vessel, except for an ownership\r\ninterest created or acquired solely for the purpose of providing security for a\r\nnormal commercial loan;\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u2018ownership interest\u2019 \u00d6 includes \u00d5 any contractual\r\nor proprietary interest which allows the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such\r\ninterest to take advantage of the operation of the vessel in a manner\r\nsubstantially comparable to the way in which an owner may benefit from the\r\noperation of the vessel. In determining whether such substantial comparability\r\nexists, the following factors shall be considered, inter alia:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the terms and circumstances of the\r\ntransaction,\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 commercial practice within the\r\nindustry,\n(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether the vessel subject to the\r\ntransaction is integrated into the operations of the beneficiary or\r\nbeneficiaries, and\n(iv)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether in practice there is a\r\nlikelihood that the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such interests will take\r\nadvantage of, and the risk for, the operation of the vessel for a significant\r\npart of the life-time of the vessel;\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u2018buyer\u2019 \u00d6 means \u00d5 any person\r\nwho, or any company which, acquires an ownership interest, including by way of\r\nlease or long-term bareboat charter, in conjunction with the original transfer\r\nfrom the shipbuilder, either directly or indirectly, including a person who, or\r\ncompany which, owns or controls a buyer, or gives instructions to the buyer. A\r\nperson or company owns a buyer when it has more than a 50 % interest in\r\nthe buyer. A person or company controls a buyer when the person or company is\r\nlegally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over\r\nthe buyer, which is presumed at a 25 % interest. If ownership of a buyer\r\nis shown, a separate control of it is presumed not to exist unless established\r\notherwise. There may be more than one buyer of any one vessel;\n(g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u2018company\u2019 \u00d6 means \u00d5 any company or\r\nfirm constituted under civil or commercial law, including cooperative\r\nsocieties, and other legal persons governed by public or private law, including\r\nthose which are non-profitmaking;\n(h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u2018Contracting Party\u2019 \u00d6 means \u00d5 any third\r\ncountry party to the Shipbuilding Agreement.\nArticle 2\nDetermination of injurious pricing\nA. Normal\r\nvalue\n1. The normal value shall normally be based\r\non the price paid or payable, in the ordinary course of trade, for a like\r\nvessel by an independent buyer in the exporting country.\n2. Prices between parties which appear to\r\nbe associated or to have a compensatory arrangement with each other may not be\r\nconsidered to be in the ordinary course of trade and may not be used to\r\nestablish normal value unless it is determined that they are unaffected by the\r\nrelationship.\n3. When there are no sales of like vessels\r\nin the ordinary course of trade, or where, because of the particular market\r\nsituation, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value of\r\nthe like vessel shall be calculated on the basis of the export price of a like\r\nvessel, in the ordinary course of trade, to an appropriate third country,\r\nprovided that this price is representative. If such sales to any appropriate\r\nthird country do not exist or do not permit a proper comparison, the normal\r\nvalue of the like vessels shall be calculated on the basis of the cost of\r\nproduction in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for selling,\r\ngeneral and administrative costs and for profits.\n4. Sales of like vessels in the domestic\r\nmarket of the exporting country, or export sales to a third country, at prices\r\nbelow unit production costs (fixed and variable) plus selling, general and\r\nadministrative costs may be treated as not being in the ordinary course of\r\ntrade by reason of price, and may be disregarded in determining normal value, only\r\nif it is determined that such sales are at prices which do not provide for the\r\nrecovery of all costs within a reasonable period, which should normally be five\r\nyears.\n5. Costs shall normally be calculated on\r\nthe basis of records kept by the shipbuilder under investigation, provided that\r\nsuch records are in accordance with the generally accepted accounting\r\nprinciples of the country concerned and that it is shown that the records\r\nreasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the vessel\r\nunder consideration.\nConsideration shall be given to evidence\r\nsubmitted on the proper allocation of costs, provided that it is shown that\r\nsuch allocations have been historically utilised. In the absence of a more\r\nappropriate method, preference shall be given to the allocation of costs on the\r\nbasis of turnover. Unless already reflected in the cost allocations under this\r\nsubparagraph, costs shall be adjusted appropriately for those non-recurring\r\nitems of cost which benefit future and/or current production, or for\r\ncircumstances in which costs are affected by start-up operations.\n6. The amounts for selling, \u00d6 for \u00d5 general and\r\nadministrative costs and for profits shall be based on actual data pertaining\r\nto production and sales, in the ordinary course of trade, of like vessels by\r\nthe shipbuilder under investigation. When such amounts cannot be determined on\r\nthis basis, the amounts may be determined on the basis of:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the weighted average of the\r\nactual amounts determined for other shipbuilders of the country of origin in\r\nrespect of production and sales of like vessels in that country's domestic\r\nmarket;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the actual amounts applicable to\r\nproduction and sales, in the ordinary course of trade, of the same general\r\ncategory of vessels for the shipbuilder in question in the domestic market of\r\nthe country of origin;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 any other reasonable method,\r\nprovided that the amount for profit so established shall not exceed the profit\r\nnormally realised by other shipbuilders on sales of vessels of the same general\r\ncategory in the domestic market of the country of origin.\nFurthermore, the profit added in\r\nconstructing value shall, in all instances, be based upon the average profit\r\nrealised over a reasonable period of time of normally six months both before\r\nand after the sale under investigation and shall reflect a reasonable profit at\r\nthe time of such sale. In making such calculation, any distortion which is\r\ndemonstrated to result in a profit which is not a reasonable one at the time of\r\nthe sale shall be eliminated.\n7. Given the long lead time between\r\ncontract and delivery of vessels, a normal value shall not include actual costs\r\nfor which the shipbuilder demonstrates that they are due to force majeure\r\nand that they are significantly over the cost increase which the shipbuilder\r\ncould reasonably have anticipated and taken into account when the material\r\nterms of sales were fixed.\n8. In the case of sales from non-market\r\neconomy countries and, in particular, those to which Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n625/2009[10]\r\napplies, normal value shall be determined on the basis of the price or\r\nconstructed value in a market economy third country, or the price from such a\r\nthird country to other countries, including the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , or, where\r\nthose are not possible, on any other reasonable basis, including the price\r\nactually paid or payable in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 for the like\r\nvessel, duly adjusted if necessary to include a reasonable profit margin.\nAn appropriate market economy third country\r\nshall be selected in a not unreasonable manner, due account being taken of any\r\nreliable information made available at the time of selection. Account shall\r\nalso be taken of time limits.\nThe parties to the investigation shall be\r\ninformed shortly after its initiation of the market economy third country\r\nenvisaged and shall be given 10 days to comment.\nB. Export\r\nprice\n9. The export price shall be the price\r\nactually paid or payable for the vessel under consideration.\n10. In cases where there is no export price\r\nor where it appears that the export price is unreliable because of an\r\nassociation or a compensatory arrangement between the shipbuilder and the buyer\r\nor a third party, the export price may be constructed on the basis of the price\r\nat which the vessel is first resold to an independent buyer, or, if the vessel\r\nis not resold to an independent buyer or is not resold in the condition in\r\nwhich it was originally sold, on any reasonable basis.\nIn \u00d6 those \u00d5 cases,\r\nadjustment for all costs, including duties and taxes, incurred between the\r\noriginal sale and resale, and for profits accruing, shall be made so as to\r\nestablish a reliable export price.\nThe items for which adjustment shall be\r\nmade \u00d6 shall \u00d5 include those\r\nnormally borne by a buyer but paid by any party, either inside or outside the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , which\r\nappears to be associated or to have a compensatory arrangement with the\r\nshipbuilder or buyer, including usual transport, insurance, handling, loading\r\nand ancillary costs, customs duties, and other taxes payable in the importing\r\ncountry by reason of the purchase of the vessel, and a reasonable margin for\r\nselling, general and administrative costs and profit.\nC.\r\nComparison\n11. A fair comparison shall be made between\r\nthe export price and the normal value. This comparison shall be made at the\r\nsame level of trade and in respect of sales made at, as \u00d6 closely \u00d5 as possible,\r\nthe same time, which will normally mean sales within three months before or\r\nafter the sale under investigation, or in the absence of such sales, any\r\nappropriate period. Due allowance shall be made in each case, on its merits,\r\nfor differences which affect price comparability, including differences in\r\nconditions and terms of sale, contractual penalties, taxation, level of trade,\r\nquantities, physical characteristics, and any other differences which are also\r\ndemonstrated to affect price comparability. Where, in cases referred to in paragraph\r\n10, price comparability has been affected, the normal value shall be\r\nestablished at a level of trade equivalent to the level of trade of the\r\nconstructed export price, or due allowance made, as warranted, under this\r\nparagraph. Any duplication when making adjustments shall be avoided, in\r\nparticular in relation to discounts and contractual penalties. When the price\r\ncomparison requires a conversion of currencies, such conversion shall be made\r\nusing the rate of exchange on the date of sale, except that when a sale of\r\nforeign currency on forward markets is directly linked to the export sale\r\ninvolved the rate of exchange in the forward sale shall be used. For the\r\npurpose of this provision, the date of sale shall be the date on which the\r\nmaterial terms of sale are established, normally the date of contract. However,\r\nif the material terms of sale are significantly changed on another date, the\r\nrate of exchange on the date of the change should be applied. In such case,\r\nappropriate adjustments shall be made to take into account any unreasonable\r\neffect on the injurious pricing margin due solely to exchange rate fluctuations\r\nbetween the original date of sale and the date of this change.\nD.\r\nInjurious pricing margin\n12. Subject to the relevant provisions\r\ngoverning fair comparison, the existence of injurious pricing margins shall\r\nnormally be established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average\r\nnormal value with a weighted average of prices of all sales, or by a comparison\r\nof individual normal values and individual export prices on a\r\ntransaction-to-transaction basis. However, a normal value established on a\r\nweighted average basis may be compared to prices of all individual sales, if\r\nthere is a \u00d6 significant\r\ndifference in the \u00d5 pattern of\r\nexport prices among different purchasers, regions or time periods, and if the\r\nmethods specified in the first sentence of this paragraph would not reflect the\r\nfull degree of injurious pricing being practised.\n13. The injurious pricing margin shall be\r\nthe amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price. Where injurious\r\npricing margins vary, a weighted average injurious pricing margin may be\r\nestablished.\nArticle 3\nDetermination of injury\n1. Pursuant to this Regulation, the term\r\n\u2018injury\u2019 shall, unless otherwise specified, be taken to mean material injury to\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry,\r\nthreat of material injury to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry or\r\nmaterial retardation of the establishment of such an industry and shall be\r\ninterpreted in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n2. A determination of injury shall be based\r\non positive evidence and shall involve an objective examination of : \n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the effect of the sale at less\r\nthan normal value on prices in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 market for\r\nlike vessels; and\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the consequent impact of that\r\nsale on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\n3. With regard to the effect of the sale at\r\nless than normal value on prices, consideration shall be given to whether there\r\nhas been significant price undercutting by the sale at less than normal value\r\nas compared with the price of like vessels of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, or\r\nwhether the effect of such sale is otherwise to depress prices to a significant\r\ndegree or prevent price increases, which would otherwise have occurred, to a\r\nsignificant degree. No one or more of \u00d6 those \u00d5 factors can\r\nnecessarily give decisive guidance.\n4. Where\r\nsales of vessels from more than one country are simultaneously subject to\r\ninjurious pricing investigations, the effects of such sales shall be\r\ncumulatively assessed only if it is determined that:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the margin of injurious pricing\r\nestablished in relation to the purchases from each country is more than de\r\nminimis as defined in Article 7(3); and \n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a cumulative assessment of the\r\neffects of the sales is appropriate in the light of the conditions of\r\ncompetition between vessels sold by \u00d6 non\u2011Union \u00d5 shipbuilders\r\nto the buyer and the conditions of competition between such vessels and the\r\nlike \u00d6 Union \u00d5 vessels.\n5. The examination of the impact of the\r\nsale at less than normal value on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\r\nconcerned shall include an evaluation of all relevant economic factors and\r\nindices having a bearing on the state of the industry, including the fact that\r\nan industry is still in the process of recovering from the effects of past\r\ndumping, injurious pricing or subsidisation, the magnitude of the actual margin\r\nof injurious pricing, actual and potential decline in sales, profits, output,\r\nmarket share, productivity, return on investments, utilisation of capactiy,\r\nfactors affecting \u00d6 Union \u00d5 prices, actual\r\nand potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages,\r\ngrowth, ability ro raise capital or investments. This list is not exhaustive,\r\nnor can any one or more of these factors necessarily give decisive guidance.\n6. It must be demonstrated, from all the\r\nrelevant evidence presented in relation to paragraph 2, that the sale at less\r\nthan normal value is causing, or has caused, injury within the meaning of this\r\nRegulation. Specifically, \u00d6 that \u00d5 shall entail a\r\ndemonstration that the price levels identified pursuant to paragraph 3 are\r\nresponsible for an impact on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry as\r\nprovided for in paragraph 5, and that \u00d6 that \u00d5 impact exists\r\nto a degree which enables it to be classified as material.\n7. Known factors other than the sale at\r\nless than normal value which at the same time are injuring the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry shall\r\nalso be examined to ensure that injury caused by \u00d6 those \u00d5 other factors\r\nis not attributed to the sale at less than normal value under paragraph 6.\r\nFactors which may be considered in \u00d6 that \u00d5 respect \u00d6 shall \u00d5 include the\r\nvolume and prices of sales by shipbuilders of countries other than the\r\nexporting country not realised at less than normal value, contraction in demand\r\nor changes in the patterns of consumption, restrictive trade practices of, and\r\ncompetition between, third country and \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers,\r\ndevelopments in technology and the export performance and productivity of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\n8. The effect of the sale at less than\r\nnormal value shall be assessed in relation to the production of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry of\r\nlike vessels when available data permit the separate identification of that\r\nproduction on the basis of such criteria as the production process, producers'\r\nsales and profits. If such separate identification of that production is not\r\npossible, the effects of the sale at less than normal value shall be assessed\r\nby examination of the production of the narrowest group or range of vessels,\r\nwhich includes the like vessel, for which the necessary information can be\r\nprovided.\n9. A determination of a threat of material\r\ninjury shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or\r\nremote possibility. The change in circumstances which would create a situation\r\nin which the sale at less than normal value would cause injury must be clearly\r\nforeseen and imminent.\nIn making a\r\ndetermination regarding the existence of a threat of material injury,\r\nconsideration should be given to such factors as:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sufficient freely disposable\r\ncapacity of the shipbuilder or an imminent and substantial increase in such\r\ncapacity indicating the likelihood of substantially increased sales at less\r\nthan normal value, account being taken of the availability of other export\r\nmarkets to absorb any additional exports; \n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether vessels are being\r\nexported at prices that would, to a significant degree, depress prices or\r\nprevent price increases which otherwise would have occurred, and would probably\r\nincrease demand for further purchases from other countries.\nNo one of the factors listed above by\r\nitself can necessarily give decisive guidance, but the totality of the factors\r\nconsidered must lead to the conclusion that further sales at less than normal\r\nvalue are imminent and that, unless protective action is taken, material injury\r\nwill occur.\nArticle 4\nDefinition of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\n1. For the purposes of this Regulation, the\r\nterm \u2018 \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\u2019\r\nshall be interpreted as referring to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers as a\r\nwhole capable of producing a like vessel with their present facilities or whose\r\nfacilities can be adapted in a timely manner to produce a like vessel, or to\r\nthose of them whose collective capability to produce a like vessel constitutes\r\na major proportion, as defined in Article 5(6), of the total \u00d6 Union \u00d5 capability to\r\nproduce a like vessel. However, when producers are related to the shipbuilder,\r\nexporters or buyers or are themselves buyers of the allegedly injuriously\r\npriced vessel, the term \u2018the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\u2019 may\r\nbe interpreted as referring to the rest of the producers.\n2. For the purpose of paragraph 1,\r\nproducers shall be considered to be related to the shipbuilder, exporters or\r\nbuyers only if:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 one of them directly or\r\nindirectly controls the other; or\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 both of them are directly or\r\nindirectly controlled by a third person; or\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 together they directly or indirectly\r\ncontrol a third person, provided that there are grounds for believing or\r\nsuspecting that the effect of the relationship is such as to cause the producer\r\nconcerned to behave differently from non-related producers.\nFor the purpose of this paragraph, one shall\r\nbe deemed to control another when the former is legally or operationally in a\r\nposition to exercise restraint or direction over the latter.\n3. The provisions of Article 3(8) shall be\r\napplicable to this Article.\nArticle 5\nInitiation of proceedings\n1. Except as provided for in paragraph 8,\r\nan investigation to determine the existence, degree and effect of any alleged\r\ninjurious pricing shall be initiated upon a written complaint by any natural or\r\nlegal person, or any association not having legal personality, acting on behalf\r\nof the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\nThe complaint may be submitted to the\r\nCommission or to a Member State, which shall forward it to the Commission. The\r\nCommission shall send Member States a copy of any complaint it receives. The\r\ncomplaint shall be deemed to have been lodged on the first working day\r\nfollowing its delivery to the Commission by registered mail or the issuing of\r\nan acknowledgement of receipt by the Commission.\nWhere, in the absence of any complaint, a Member State is in possession of sufficient evidence of injurious pricing and of resultant\r\ninjury to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, it\r\nshall immediately communicate such evidence to the Commission.\n2. A complaint under paragraph 1 shall be\r\nfiled no later than:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 six months from the time that the\r\ncomplainant knew, or should have known, of the sale of the vessel, \u00d6 when: \u00d5\ni)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  the complainant was invited to\r\ntender a bid on the contract at issue through a broad multiple bid or any other\r\nbidding process;\nii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  the complainant actually did so\r\ntender a bid; and\niii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  the bid of the complainant\r\nsubstantially met bid specifications;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 nine months from the time that\r\nthe complainant knew, or should have known, of the sale of the vessel in the\r\nabsence of an invitation to tender, provided that a notice of intent to apply,\r\nincluding information reasonably available to the complainant to identify the\r\ntransaction concerned, had been submitted no later than six months from that\r\ntime to the Commission or a Member State.\nIn no event shall a complaint be filed\r\nlater than six months from the date of delivery of the vessel.\nThe complainant may be considered to have\r\nknown of the sale of a vessel from the time of publication of the fact of the\r\nconclusion of the contract, along with very general information concerning the\r\nvessel, in the international trade press.\nFor the purpose of this Article, a broad\r\nmultiple bid shall be interpreted to mean a bid in which the proposed buyer\r\nextends an invitation to bid to at least all the shipbuilders known to the\r\nbuyer to be capable of building the vessel in question.\n3. A complaint under paragraph 1 shall\r\ninclude evidence:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of injurious pricing;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of injury;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of a causal link between the injuriously\r\npriced sale and the alleged injury; and\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 that, if the\r\nvessel was sold through a broad multiple bid, the complainant was invited to\r\ntender a bid on the contract at issue, it actually did so, and the bid of the\r\ncomplainant substantially met bid specifications (\u00d6 namely \u00d5, delivery date\r\nand technical requirements); or\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 that, if the vessel was sold through\r\nany other bidding process and the complainant was invited to tender a bid on\r\nthe contract at issue, it actually did so, and the bid of the complainant\r\nsubstantially met bid specifications; or\n(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 that, in the absence of an invitation\r\nto tender a bid other than under a broad multiple bid, the complainant was\r\ncapable of building the vessel concerned and, if the complainant knew, or\r\nshould have known, of the proposed purchase, it made demonstrable efforts to\r\nconclude a sale with the buyer consistent with the bid specifications in\r\nquestion. The complainant may be considered to have known of the proposed\r\npurchase if it is demonstrated that the majority of the relevant industry has\r\nmade efforts with that buyer to conclude a sale of the vessel in question, or\r\nif it is demonstrated that general information on the proposed purchase was\r\navailable from brokers, financiers, classification societies, charterers, trade\r\nassociations, or other entities normally involved in shipbuilding transactions\r\nwith whom the complainant had regular contacts or dealings.\n4. The complaint shall contain such\r\ninformation as is reasonably available to the complainant on the following:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00d6 the \u00d5 identity of\r\nthe complainant and a description of the volume and value of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 production of\r\nthe like vessel by the complainant. Where a written complaint is made on behalf\r\nof the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, the\r\ncomplaint shall identify the industry on behalf of which the complaint is made\r\nby a list of all known \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\ncapable of building the like vessel and, to the extent possible, a description\r\nof the volume and value of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 production of\r\nthe like vessel accounted for by such producers;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a complete description of the\r\nallegedly injuriously priced vessel, the names of the country or countries of\r\norigin or export in question, the identity of each known exporter or foreign\r\nproducer and the identity of the buyer of the vessel in question;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00d6 the \u00d5 prices at\r\nwhich such vessels are sold in the domestic markets of the country or countries\r\nof origin or export (or, where appropriate, the prices at which such vessel is\r\nsold from the country or countries of origin or export to a third country or\r\ncountries or on the constructed value of the vessel) and \u00d6 the \u00d5 export prices\r\nor, where appropriate, the prices at which such vessel is first resold to an\r\nindependent buyer;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the effect of the injuriously\r\npriced sale on prices of the like vessel on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 market and the\r\nconsequent impact of the sale on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, as\r\ndemonstrated by relevant factors and indices having a bearing on the state of\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, such\r\nas those listed in Article 3(3) and (5).\n5. The Commission shall, as far as\r\npossible, examine the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the\r\ncomplaint, to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the\r\ninitiation of an investigation.\n6. An investigation shall not be initiated\r\npursuant to paragraph 1 unless it has been determined, on the basis of an\r\nexamination as to the degree of support for, or opposition to, the complaint\r\nexpressed by \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\ncapable of building the like vessel, that the complaint has been made by or on\r\nbehalf of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry. The\r\ncomplaint shall be considered to have been made by or on behalf of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry if it\r\nis supported by those \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\nwhose collective capacity to produce the like vessel constitutes more than 50 %\r\nof the total capacity of that portion of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\r\nexpressing either support for or opposition to the complaint. However, no\r\ninvestigation shall be initiated when \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\nexpressly supporting the complaint account for less than 25 % of\r\ntotal capacity of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\ncapable of producing the like vessel.\n7. The authorities shall avoid, unless a\r\ndecision has been made to initiate an investigation, any publicising of the\r\ncomplaint seeking the initiation of an investigation. However, before\r\nproceeding to initiate an investigation, the government of the exporting\r\ncountry concerned shall be notified.\n8. If, in special circumstances, \u00d6 the\r\nCommission decides \u00d5 to initiate an\r\ninvestigation without having received a written complaint by or on behalf of\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry for\r\nthe initiation of such investigation, this shall be done on the basis of\r\nsufficient evidence of injurious pricing, injury, a causal link, and that a\r\nmember of the allegedly injured \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry met\r\nthe criteria of paragraph 3 (d), to justify such initiation.\nWhere appropriate, an investigation may\r\nalso be initiated upon a written complaint by the authorities of a Contracting\r\nParty. Such a complaint shall be supported by sufficient evidence to show that\r\na vessel is being, or has been, injuriously priced and that the alleged sale to\r\na \u00d6 Union \u00d5 buyer at less\r\nthan normal value is causing, or has caused, injury to the domestic industry of\r\nthe Contracting Party concerned.\n9. The evidence of both injurious pricing\r\nand injury shall be considered simultaneously in the decision on whether or not\r\nto initiate an investigation. A complaint shall be rejected where there is\r\ninsufficient evidence of either injurious pricing or of injury to justify\r\nproceeding with the case.\n10. The complaint may be withdrawn prior to\r\ninitiation, in which case it shall be considered not to have been lodged.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .5(1) (adapted)\n11. Where it is apparent that there is\r\nsufficient evidence to justify initiating proceedings, \u00d6 the\r\nCommission \u00d5 shall do so\r\nwithin 45 days of the date on which the complaint was lodged, or, in the case\r\nof initiation pursuant to paragraph 8, no later than six months from the time\r\nthe sale of the vessel was known or should have been known, and shall publish a\r\nnotice in the Official Journal of the European Union.

It shall also state the period within which\r\ninterested parties may apply to be heard by the Commission in accordance with\r\nArticle 6(5).\n13. The Commission shall advise the\r\nexporter, the buyer(s) of the vessel and representative associations of\r\nproducers, exporters or buyers of such vessels known to it to be concerned, as\r\nwell as representatives of the country the vessel of which is subject to such\r\ninvestigation and the complainants, of the initiation of the proceedings and,\r\nwith due regard to the protection of confidential information, provide the full\r\ntext of the written complaint received pursuant to paragraph 1 to the exporter,\r\nand to the authorities of the exporting country, and make it available upon\r\nrequest to other interested parties involved.\nArticle 6\nThe investigation\n1. Following the initiation of the\r\nproceedings, the Commission, acting in cooperation with the Member States and,\r\nwhere appropriate, with the authorities of third countries, shall commence an\r\ninvestigation at \u00d6 Union \u00d5 level. Such\r\ninvestigation shall cover both injurious pricing and injury and these shall be\r\ninvestigated simultaneously.\n2. Parties receiving questionnaires used in\r\nan injurious pricing investigation shall be given at least 30 days to reply.\r\nThe time-limit for exporters shall be counted from the date of receipt of the\r\nquestionnaire, which for this purpose shall be deemed to have been received one\r\nweek from the day on which it was sent to the exporter or transmitted to the\r\nappropriate diplomatic representative of the exporting country. An extension to\r\nthe 30-day period may be granted, due account being taken of the time limits of\r\nthe investigation, provided that the party shows due cause for such extension,\r\nin terms of its particular circumstances.\n3. The Commission may request the\r\nauthorities of third countries, where appropriate, as well as the Member\r\nStates, to supply information, and Member States shall take whatever steps are\r\nnecessary in order to give effect to such requests.\nThey shall send to the Commission the\r\ninformation requested together with the results of all inspections, checks or\r\ninvestigations carried out.\nWhere \u00d6 that \u00d5 information is\r\nof general interest or where its transmission has been requested by a Member State, the Commission shall forward it to the Member States, provided it is not\r\nconfidential, in which case a non-confidential summary shall be forwarded.\n4. The Commission may request the\r\nauthorities of third countries, where appropriate, as well as the Member\r\nStates, to carry out all necessary checks and inspections, particularly amongst\r\n\u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers, and\r\nto carry out investigations in third countries, provided that the firms\r\nconcerned give their consent and that the government of the country in question\r\nhas been officially notified and raises no objection.\nMember States shall take whatever steps are\r\nnecessary in order to give effect to such requests from the Commission.\nOfficials of the Commission shall be\r\nauthorised, if the Commission or a Member State so requests, to assist the\r\nofficials of Member States in carrying out their duties. Likewise, officials of\r\nthe Commission may assist the officials of the authorities of third countries\r\nin carrying out their duties, upon agreement between the Commission and such\r\nauthorities.\n5. The interested parties which have made\r\nthemselves known in accordance with Article 5(12) shall be heard if they\r\nhave, within the period prescribed in the notice published in the Official\r\nJournal of the European \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , made a\r\nwritten request for a hearing showing that they are an interested party likely\r\nto be affected by the result of the proceedings and that there are particular\r\nreasons why they should be heard.\n6. Opportunities shall, on request, be\r\nprovided for the shipbuilder, the buyer(s), representatives of the government\r\nof the exporting country, the complainants, and other interested parties, which\r\nhave made themselves known in accordance with Article 5(12), to meet those\r\nparties with adverse interests, so that opposing views may be presented and\r\nrebuttal arguments offered.\nProvision of such opportunities must take\r\naccount of the need to preserve confidentiality and of the convenience to the\r\nparties.\nThere shall be no obligation on any party\r\nto attend a meeting, and failure to do so shall not be prejudicial to that\r\nparty's case.\nOral information provided under this\r\nparagraph shall be taken into account insofar as it is subsequently confirmed\r\nin writing.\n7. The complainants, the shipbuilder, the\r\nbuyer(s) and other interested parties, which have made themselves known in\r\naccordance with Article 5(12), as well as the representatives of the exporting\r\ncountry, may, upon written request, inspect all information made available by\r\nany party to an investigation, as distinct from internal documents prepared by\r\nthe authorities of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or its Member\r\nStates, which is relevant to the presentation of their cases and not\r\nconfidential within the meaning of Article 13, and is used in the\r\ninvestigation.\nSuch parties may respond to such\r\ninformation and their comments shall be taken into consideration, wherever they\r\nare sufficiently substantiated in the response.\n8. Except in the circumstances provided for\r\nin Article 12, the information which is supplied by interested parties and upon\r\nwhich findings are based shall be examined for accuracy as far as possible.\n9. For proceedings involving price to price\r\ncomparison, where a like vessel has been delivered, the investigation shall be\r\nconcluded no later than one year from the date of initiation.\nFor proceedings in which the like vessel is\r\nunder construction, the investigation shall be concluded no later than one year\r\nfrom the date of delivery of that like vessel.\nInvestigations involving constructed value\r\nshall be concluded within one year of their initiation or within one year of\r\ndelivery of the vessel, whichever is the later.\n\u00d6 Those \u00d5 time limits\r\nare suspended to the extent that Article 16(2) is applied.\nArticle 7\nTermination without measures,\r\nimposition and collection of injurious pricing charges\n1. Where the complaint is withdrawn, the\r\nproceedings may be terminated.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .5(2)\n2. Where measures are unnecessary the\r\ninvestigation or proceedings shall be terminated. The Commission shall\r\nterminate the investigation in accordance with the examination procedure\r\nreferred to in Article 10(2).\n\u00ea 385/96\n3. There shall be immediate termination\r\nwhere it is determined that the margin of injurious pricing is less than 2 %,\r\nexpressed as a percentage of the export price.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .5(2) (adapted)\n4. Where the facts as finally established\r\nshow that there is injurious pricing and injury caused thereby, an injurious\r\npricing charge shall be imposed on the shipbuilder by the Commission \u00d6 acting \u00d5 in accordance\r\nwith the examination procedure referred to in Article 10(2). The amount of the\r\ninjurious pricing charge shall be equal to the margin of injurious pricing\r\nestablished. The Commission shall, after having informed the Member States,\r\ntake the necessary measures for the implementation of its decision, in\r\nparticular the collection of the injurious pricing charge.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\n(adapted)\n5. The shipbuilder shall pay the injurious\r\npricing charge within 180 days of notification to it of the imposition of the\r\ncharge, which for this purpose shall be deemed to have been received one week\r\nfrom the day on which it was sent to the shipbuilder. The Commission may give\r\nthe shipbuilder a reasonably extended period of time to pay where the\r\nshipbuilder demonstrates that payment within 180 days would render it insolvent\r\nor would be incompatible with a judicially supervised reorganisation, in which\r\ncase interest shall accrue on any unpaid portion of the charge, at a rate equal\r\nto the secondary market yield on medium term \u00d6 euro \u00d5 bond in the\r\nLuxembourg stock exchange plus 50 basis points.\nArticle 8\nAlternative remedies\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .5(3)\nThe investigation may be terminated without\r\nthe imposition of an injurious pricing charge if the shipbuilder definitively\r\nand unconditionally voids the sale of the injuriously priced vessel or complies\r\nwith an alternative equivalent remedy accepted by the Commission.\n\u00ea 385/96\nA sale shall be considered to have been\r\nvoided only where all contractual relationships between the parties concerned\r\nby the sale in question have been terminated, all consideration paid in\r\nconnection with the sale is reimbursed and all rights in the vessel concerned\r\nor parts thereof are returned to the shipbuilder.\nArticle 9\nCountermeasures \u2014 denial of loading\r\nand unloading rights\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .5(4)\n1. If the shipbuilder concerned does not\r\npay the injurious pricing charge imposed under Article 7, countermeasures under\r\nthe form of denial of loading and unloading rights shall be imposed by the\r\nCommission on the vessels built by the shipbuilder in question.\nThe Commission shall provide information to\r\nthe Member States once the grounds for countermeasures referred to in the first\r\nsubparagraph arise.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\n(adapted)\n2. The decision imposing the\r\ncountermeasures shall enter into force 30 days after its publication in the Official\r\nJournal of the European \u00d6 Union \u00d5 and\r\nshall be repealed on full payment of the injurious pricing charge by the\r\nshipbuilder. The countermeasure shall cover all vessels contracted for during a\r\nperiod of four years from the date of entry into force of the decision. Each\r\nvessel shall be subject to the countermeasure for a period of four years after\r\nits delivery. Such periods may be reduced only following and in accordance with\r\nthe outcome of an international dispute settlement procedure concerning the\r\ncountermeasures imposed.\nThe vessels subject to the denial of\r\nloading and unloading rights shall be specified by decision to be adopted by\r\nthe Commission and published in the Official Journal of the European \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\n3. The Member States' customs authorities\r\nshall not grant permission to load or unload to vessels subject to the denial\r\nof loading and unloading rights.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .5(5)\nArticle 10\nCommittee procedure\n1. The Commission shall be assisted by the\r\nCommittee established by [Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009]. That Committee\r\nshall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n2. Where reference is made to this\r\nparagraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 11\nVerification visits\n1. The Commission shall, where it considers\r\nit appropriate, carry out visits to examine the records of exporters,\r\nshipbuilders, traders, agents, producers, trade associations and organisations,\r\nto verify information provided on injurious pricing and injury. In the absence\r\nof a proper and timely reply, a verification visit may not be carried out.\n2. The Commission may carry out\r\ninvestigations in third countries as required, provided \u00d6 that \u00d5 it obtains the\r\nagreement of the firms concerned, that it notifies the representatives of the\r\ngovernment of the country in question and that the latter does not object to\r\nthe investigation. As soon as the agreement of the firms concerned has been obtained\r\nthe Commission \u00d6 shall \u00d5 notify the\r\nauthorities of the exporting country of the names and addresses of the firms to\r\nbe visited and the dates agreed.\n3. The firms concerned shall be advised of\r\nthe nature of the information to be verified during verification visits and of\r\nany further information which needs to be provided during such visits, though\r\nthis should not preclude requests made during the verification of further\r\ndetails to be provided in the light of information obtained.\n4. In investigations carried out under\r\nparagraphs 1, 2 and 3, the Commission shall be assisted by officials of those\r\nMember States who so request.\nArticle 12\nNon-cooperation\n1. In cases in which any interested party\r\nrefuses access to, or otherwise does not provide, necessary information within\r\nthe time limits provided in this Regulation, or significantly impedes the\r\ninvestigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be\r\nmade on the basis of the facts available.\nWhere it is found that any interested party\r\nhas supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be\r\ndisregarded and use may be made of facts available.\nInterested parties should be made aware of\r\nthe consequences of non-cooperation.\n2. Failure to give a computerised response\r\nshall not be deemed to constitute non-cooperation, provided that the interested\r\nparty shows \u00d6 that \u00d5 presenting the\r\nresponse as requested would result in an unreasonable extra burden or\r\nunreasonable additional cost.\n3. Where the information submitted by an\r\ninterested party is not ideal in all respects it should nevertheless not be\r\ndisregarded, provided that any deficiencies are not such as to cause undue\r\ndifficulty in arriving at a reasonably accurate finding and that the\r\ninformation is appropriately submitted in good time and is verifiable, and that\r\nthe party has acted to the best of its ability.\n4. If evidence or information is not\r\naccepted, the supplying party shall be informed forthwith of the reasons\r\ntherefor and shall be granted an opportunity to provide further explanations\r\nwithin the time limit specified. If the explanations are considered\r\nunsatisfactory, the reasons for rejection of such evidence or information shall\r\nbe disclosed and given in published findings.\n5. If determinations, including those\r\nregarding normal value, are based on the provisions of paragraph 1, including\r\nthe information supplied in the complaint, it shall, where practicable and with\r\ndue regard to the time limits of the investigation, be checked by reference to\r\ninformation from other independent sources which may be available, such as\r\npublished price lists, official statistics of sales and customs returns, or\r\ninformation obtained from other interested parties during the investigation.\n6. If an interested party does not\r\ncooperate, or cooperates only partially, so that relevant information is\r\nthereby withheld, the result may be less favourable to the party than if it had\r\ncooperated.\nArticle 13\nConfidentiality\n1. Any information which is by nature\r\nconfidential (for example, because its disclosure would be of significant\r\ncompetitive advantage to a competitor or would have a significantly adverse\r\neffect upon a person supplying the information or upon a person from whom he\r\nhas acquired the information) or which is provided on a confidential basis by\r\nparties to an investigation shall, if good cause is shown, be treated as such\r\nby the authorities.\n2. Interested parties providing\r\nconfidential information shall be required to \u00d6 provide \u00d5 non-confidential\r\nsummaries thereof. Those summaries shall be in sufficient detail to permit a\r\nreasonable understanding of the substance of the information submitted in\r\nconfidence. In exceptional circumstances, such parties may indicate that such\r\ninformation is not susceptible of summary. In such exceptional circumstances, a\r\nstatement of the reasons why summarisation is not possible must be provided.\n3. If it is considered that a request for\r\nconfidentiality is not warranted and if the supplier of the information is\r\neither unwilling to make the information available or to authorise its\r\ndisclosure in generalised or summary form, such information may be disregarded\r\nunless it can be satisfactorily demonstrated from appropriate sources that the\r\ninformation is correct. Requests for confidentiality shall not be arbitrarily\r\nrejected.\n4. This Article shall not preclude the\r\ndisclosure of general information by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 authorities,\r\nand in particular of the reasons on which decisions taken pursuant to this\r\nRegulation are based, or disclosure of the evidence relied on by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 authorities\r\ninsofar as is necessary to explain those reasons in court proceedings. Such\r\ndisclosure must take into account the legitimate interest of the parties\r\nconcerned that their business secrets should not be divulged.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .5(6)\n5. The Commission and the Member States, including the officials of either, shall not reveal any information received\r\npursuant to this Regulation for which confidential treatment has been requested\r\nby its supplier, without specific permission from that supplier. Exchanges of\r\ninformation between the Commission and Member States, or any internal documents\r\nprepared by the authorities of the Union or the Member States, shall not be\r\ndivulged except as specifically provided for in this Regulation.\n\u00ea 385/96\r\n(adapted)\n6. Information received pursuant to this\r\nRegulation shall be used only for the purpose for which it was requested.\nArticle 14\nDisclosure\n1. The complainants, the shipbuilder, the\r\nexporter, the buyer(s) of the vessel and their representative associations, and\r\nrepresentatives of the exporting country, may request disclosure of the details\r\nunderlying the essential facts and considerations \u00d6 on \u00d5 the basis of\r\nwhich it is intended to recommend the imposition of an injurious pricing\r\ncharge, or the termination of an investigation or proceedings without the\r\nimposition of a charge.\n2. Requests for final disclosure, as\r\ndefined in paragraph 1, shall be addressed to the Commission in writing and be\r\nreceived within time limits set by the Commission.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .5(7) (adapted)\n3. \u00d6 Final \u00d5 disclosure\r\nshall be \u00d6 given \u00d5 in writing. It\r\nshall be \u00d6 made \u00d5 , due regard\r\nbeing had to the need to protect confidential information, as soon as possible\r\nand, normally, not less than one month before a definitive decision. Where the\r\nCommission is not in a position to disclose certain facts or considerations at\r\nthat time, they shall be disclosed as soon as possible thereafter.\nDisclosure shall not prejudice any\r\nsubsequent decision which may be taken by the Commission, but where such a\r\ndecision is based on any different facts and considerations they shall be\r\ndisclosed as soon as possible.\n\u00ea 385/96\n4. Representations made after disclosure is\r\ngiven shall be taken into consideration only if received within a period to be\r\nset by the Commission in each case, which shall be at least 10 days, due\r\nconsideration being given to the urgency of the matter.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .5(8)\nArticle 15\nReport\nThe Commission shall include information on\r\nthe implementation of this Regulation in its annual report on the application\r\nand implementation of trade defence measures presented to the European\r\nParliament and to the Council pursuant to [Article 22a of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1225/2009].\n\u00ea 385/96\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 16\nFinal provisions\n1.
