Scientific advice from the International\r\nCouncil for the Exploration of the Sea ('ICES'[1])\r\nhas indicated that the current exploitation rates for some of these stocks are\r\nnot consistent with achieving maximum sustainable yield. A management plan for\r\nthe Baltic Sea cod stocks has been in place since 2007[2] but the stocks of\r\nherring and sprat are not yet subject to a management plan. This hinders the\r\nsustainable management of these fisheries, and does not provide stability of\r\nfishing opportunities for the fishermen operating in these fisheries. \nIn addition to providing the basis for capture\r\nfisheries, cod, herring and sprat are also important components of the Baltic\r\necosystem and there are also strong biological interactions between them. Cod\r\npredate on sprat and herring meaning that the size of the cod stock affects the\r\nsize of the herring and sprat stocks and vice versa. There are some\r\nindications from scientific analyses that the biological interactions within\r\nand between these species in the Baltic may mean that higher fishing pressures\r\nthan are currently advised may be sustainable. However, the Scientific,\r\nTechnical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF)[3] have advised[4] that more scientific\r\nwork is needed in order to understand the risks of fishing at these higher\r\nvalues.\nThe productivity of Baltic fish stocks,\r\nparticularly cod and sprat, can be strongly influenced by environmental\r\nconditions in the Baltic. Spawning of cod in the Eastern Baltic is limited to\r\nthe deep areas where salinities in the deeper water are sufficiently high to\r\nallow egg fertilisation and for the fertilised eggs to float. Limited inflow of\r\noceanic water from the North Sea has resulted in oxygen depletion in these deep\r\nsaline waters since the mid-1980s and cod reproduction has only been successful\r\nin the southern spawning areas. If there was a substantial inflow of North Sea water to the Eastern Baltic, this could lead to much higher recruitment of cod\r\nthan has been seen in recent years. For sprat, there is a link between\r\nrecruitment and temperature, with more young fish recruiting to the stock in\r\nwarmer conditions. This linkage implies that the occurrence of, for example,\r\ntwo successive hard winters, could have severe consequences for the sprat\r\nstock.\nIn view of the strong influence that\r\nbiological interactions and environmental effects have on the Baltic stocks of\r\ncod, herring and sprat, it is desirable to be able to the adapt exploitation\r\nrates and patterns of these stocks in the light of improvements in scientific\r\nunderstanding of the interactions and of changes in environmental conditions.\r\nSuch an approach would also be consistent with the ecosystem approach to\r\nfisheries management. The first step towards such adaptive management would be\r\nto incorporate all relevant stocks into a single management plan. This would\r\ninclude target fishing mortalities expressed in ranges for each of the stock\r\nwhich would be the basis for setting annual TACs for those stocks. The adaptation\r\nwould then come from updating the fishing mortality and stock size reference\r\npoints for each stock where scientific advice indicated that this was\r\nappropriate. \nThe objective of the proposal is to\r\nestablish a management plan for the Baltic stocks of cod, herring and sprat.\r\nThe plan will ensure the sustainable exploitation of these stocks, and provide\r\nstability of fishing opportunities, while ensuring that management is based on\r\nthe most up to date scientific information on interactions within and between\r\nthe stocks and with other aspects of the ecosystem and environment. The\r\nspecific objective of the initiative shall be to ensure that the Baltic stocks\r\nof cod, herring and sprat are exploited in a sustainable way according to the\r\nprinciples of maximum sustainable yield and of the ecosystem approach to\r\nfisheries management. To this end, these stocks should be harvested at levels\r\nwhich can produce the maximum sustainable yield. \nIn cod and pelagic fisheries by-catches of\r\nflatfish occur, namely plaice, flounder, turbot and brill. The exploitation of\r\ncod and pelagic stocks should not jeopardize the sustainability of flatfish in\r\nthe Baltic.\nThe plan will apply to all Union fishing\r\nvessels irrespective to their overall length in the Baltic Sea as this is in\r\nconformity with the rules of the CFP and is in line with the effect of the\r\nvessels on the fish stocks concerned.\u00a0 \n\u00b7     \r\nGeneral context\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cod in the Eastern and\r\nWestern Baltic are considered to be two separate stocks. There are a number of\r\ndifferent herring stocks in the Baltic, with the main stock being found in the\r\nsea's eastern basin. There are smaller stocks in the Bothnian Sea, the Bothnian Bay, the Gulf of Riga and the Western Baltic. The latter stock spawns in the\r\nWestern Baltic, and then migrates into the Skagerrak and the Eastern North Sea\r\nin order to feed. In these areas it mixes with North Sea herring and is taken\r\nas part of a mixed-stock fishery. There is one stock of sprat in the Baltic.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two Baltic cod stocks\r\nare currently subject to a management plan2 and management measures\r\nfor the fisheries on these stocks include the setting of annual TACs,\r\nrestrictions on fishing effort and technical measures including minimum mesh\r\nsizes, catch composition rules a minimum landing size and closed areas/seasons.\r\nCurrent management of the fisheries for herring and sprat include annual TACs\r\nand technical measures including mesh size and catch composition rules.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The small stock of herring\r\nin the Bothnian Bay is considered by ICES to be data-limited so it is not at\r\npresent possible to fully evaluate the stock's status as the basis of catch\r\nadvice. For this reason the plan does not include a harvest rule for this\r\nstock. Taking account of the small size of that stock and the fishery\r\nexploiting that stock, it is not proportionate to establish a separate TAC for\r\nthat stock. Instead, provision is made for catches from this stock to form part\r\nof a combined area Bothnian sea/Bothnian bay herring TAC. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As of 1 January 2014 Regulation\r\n(EU) 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December\r\n2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy sets out the rules of the CFP, including\r\nthe provisions on multiannual plans and establishing the landing obligation for\r\nstocks subject to TAC. Article 9 and 10 lists the principles, objectives and\r\ncontent of multiannual plans. Pursuant to Article 15 the landing obligation in\r\nthe Baltic Sea will apply to pelagic and salmon fishery and species that define\r\nthe fishery from 2015, and all other species covered by TAC from 1 January\r\n2017. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ntargets corresponding to maximum sustainable yield are expressed as range\r\nvalues advised by ICES. These ranges allow for a maximum sustainable\r\nyield-based management for the stocks concerned, and appear to allow for\r\nadaptations in case of changes in the scientific advice, while at the same\r\npreserving a high level of predictability. Such targets are supplemented with\r\nsafeguard provisions linked to a trigger conservation reference point. For the\r\nstocks concerned these reference points are expressed as a spawning stock\r\nbiomass, which is obtained from the latest benchmarking exercise conducted by\r\nICES. In the absence of advice on spawning biomass level, the trigger should\r\nbe, when scientific advice states that a stock is under threat.\u00a0 \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with Article 15 of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 an obligation to land all catches of cod, herring,\r\nsprat and plaice in the cod, herring and sprat fishery in the Baltic Sea is\r\nincluded in the plan to contribute to the implementation of the discard ban,\r\nexcept in circumstances where there is evidence of high survival rates. In line\r\nwith Article 16(7) of regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, Member States are required\r\nto allocate the TACs to vessels flying their flag taking into account the\r\nlikely composition of the catch and the obligation to land all catches. In\r\norder to achieve this, Member States may adopt national measures, such as retaining\r\ncertain reserve of the national TAC available or quota swaps with other Member\r\nStates. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with scientific\r\nadvice from STECF4, the plan does not include annual limits on\r\nfishing effort. \n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n18 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 Member States having direct management\r\ninterest may submit joint recommendations for, amongst others, certain measures\r\nto be adopted, where the Commission has been granted power to adopt\r\nimplementing or delegated acts for achieving the objectives of a multiannual\r\nplan. To this end, the plan establishes regional cooperation in respect of\r\nadopting technical measures, provisions for the landing obligation and specific\r\nconservation measures for the bycatches in the fisheries for the stocks\r\nconcerned. \n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\noverall ambition of the CFP on the conservation of fisheries resources and with\r\nspecific regards to Articles 9 and 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 which\r\nrequests the development of multiannual plans, the main elements of the plan\r\nare: \n\u2013     \r\nObjectives and targets (Achieve levels of\r\nfishing mortality consistent with the principle of maximum sustainable yield); \n\u2013     \r\nConservation reference points expressed in\r\nspawning biomass levels and specific conservation measures;\n\u2013     \r\nProvisions related to the landing obligation;\n\u2013     \r\nFramework of technical measures;\n\u2013     \r\nPeriodic evaluation of the plan based on\r\nscientific advice. \n\u00b7     \r\nExisting Union provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the Common\r\nFisheries Policy, amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1954/2003 and (EC) No\r\n1224/2009 and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 2371/2002 and (EC) No\r\n639/2004 and Council Decision 204/585/EC[5]\r\nsets the general framework for the CFP and identifies the situations in which\r\nthe Council shall adopt multiannual plans. \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 of 18\r\nSeptember 2007 establishing a multiannual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic\r\nSea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks, amending regulation (EEC) No\r\n2847/93 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 779/97 sets out the rules for the\r\nsustainable exploitation of the Baltic Sea cod stocks. \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2187/05 of 21\r\nDecember 2005 of 21 December 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through\r\ntechnical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound, amending\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1434/98 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 88/98 outlines\r\ntechnical conservation measures in the Baltic Sea i.e. catch composition rules,\r\nminimum mesh size, minimum landing size, closed areas and closed seasons for\r\nsalmon fisheries. It also establishes a prohibition on drift netting in the\r\nBaltic.\nThe annual Council Regulations fixing the\r\nfishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups\r\nof fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea set the TAC levels for the stocks\r\nconcerned (cod, herring and sprat) and plaice (for instance for 2014 Council\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1180/2013 of 19 November 2013 fixing for 2014 the fishing\r\nopportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in\r\nthe Baltic Sea). \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009\r\nestablishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules\r\nof the common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No\r\n2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No\r\n2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No\r\n1098/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC)\r\nNo 2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006 sets the general\r\ncontrol requirements for fisheries as well as specific control requirements for\r\nmultiannual plans. \n\u00b7     \r\nConsistency with the other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThe proposal and its objectives are consistent\r\nwith the Union's policies, especially environmental, social, market and trade\r\npolicies. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u00b7     \r\nConsultation with interested parties \nConsultation methods, main sectors\r\ntargeted and general profile of respondents\nSince the main interest in the Baltic\r\nstocks of cod, herring, sprat and flatfish is for commercial capture fisheries,\r\nthe consultation has been centred on the Baltic Sea Advisory Council (BSAC) and\r\nfisheries administrations of Baltic Sea member states. The BSAC consists of\r\nrepresentatives from the fishing sector and other interest groups affected by\r\nthe Common Fisheries Policy. The fishing sector includes fisheries\r\nassociations, producer organisations, processors, market organisations. The\r\nother interest groups include environmental NGOs, consumers, women\u2019s networks,\r\nrecreational and sports fishermen and subsistence fishermen.\nThe consultation and development process\r\nfor this initiative followed the established DG MARE procedure for the\r\ndevelopment and evaluation of long term management plans. The procedure\r\ninvolves two stages. The first stage is a retrospective evaluation, looking\r\nback at the past performance of an existing management plan. This is followed,\r\nif required, by a prospective evaluation, looking forward at possible\r\nreplacement multiannual plans and their potential impacts. Each stage involves\r\na series of meetings of expert groups of the Scientific, Technical and Economic\r\nCommittee for Fisheries (STECF). These meetings are organised in order to\r\naddress terms of reference specified by DG MARE. All of these meetings are open\r\nto representatives of ACs and Member States who are able to provide input and\r\nraise issues they consider to be relevant. In the current case, there was also\r\nfurther consultation with BSAC and Member States on specific elements of the\r\nplan after the completion of the STECF evaluation process.\nScientific/expertise domains concerned\nAs outlined above, STECF experts provided\r\nadvice throughout the evaluation process. This included input from fisheries\r\nscientists, but also experts in other disciplines, including economics and\r\nsocial sciences. Scientific advice was also received from ICES. \nSummary of responses and how they have\r\nbeen taken into account\nFollowing a prospective evaluation for a\r\nmanagement plan for the pelagic stocks[6],\r\nboth retrospective[7]\r\nand prospective evaluation[8]\r\nof the existing Baltic cod plan, in June 2011 the decision was made to move to\r\na multi-species plan for the Baltic stocks of cod, herring and sprat. This\r\ndecision was made in consultation with the Member States and stakeholders at a\r\nmeeting of the regional forum called BALTFISH. Subsequently the decision was\r\nformalised at the Fisheries Council meeting in October 2011[9]. The context for this\r\ndecision was the requirement anticipated in the reform of the CFP for\r\nmanagement plans to cover multiple stocks where possible.\nThe decision to go with a multi-species\r\nplan for the Baltic stocks necessitated the start of a new round of STECF meetings. To provide the basis for a prospective evaluation, DG MARE\r\norganised a number of meetings of experts, most of which were held jointly\r\nbetween STECF and ICES. All of these meetings were open to stakeholders, and\r\nmembers of BSAC participated in all of them. The meetings were organised as\r\nfollows:\nscoping meeting of STECF expert working\r\ngroup on multi-annual management plans in Edinburgh, UK over 28 November to 2\r\nDecember 2011[10].\r\n\nICES Workshop on Integrated/Multispecies\r\nAdvice for Baltic Fisheries, held at Charlottenlund, Denmark over 6-8 March 2012[11].\r\n\nmeeting of the STECF expert working group\r\non multi-annual management plans, in Rostock, Germany, over 26 to 30 March 2012[12]. \nFollowing the sequence of meetings\r\nsummarised above, STECF advised that a management plan based on the current,\r\nsingle-species MSY targets would meet the criteria of providing high long-term\r\nyield, with minimal risk to the stock. In short, such a plan would be\r\nconsistent with the principles of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). They also\r\nnoted that a more multi-species approach might allow higher target fishing\r\nmortalities on some stocks, but that more scientific work would be required to\r\nevaluate the risks associated with such an approach. In the light of this\r\nadvice, a discussion paper was prepared which presented these two options and\r\ntheir implications. This was discussed with MS at a BATFISH meeting, and with\r\nBSAC, both in mid-June 2012. \nWith the adoption of the Regulation on the\r\nReform of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2013 and the publication of the Final\r\nReport of the Task force on multiannual plans established by the European\r\nParliament and Council in April 2014[13],\r\nfurther consultations were conducted with the stakeholders in BSAC and with MS\r\nadministrations' in BALTFISH. This took place during Mach \u2013 June 2014.\nMeans used to make the expert advice\r\npublicly available\nReports of all of the relevant STECF expert\r\nmeetings can be found on the STECF website: https://stecf.jrc.ec.europa.eu/. \nIn addition, throughout the consultation\r\nprocess the stakeholders were actively involved at every stage of the\r\nsubsequent development of the initiative.\n\u00b7     \r\nImpact assessment \n\u00b7        \r\nPrior to drafting the multiannual plan,\r\nextensive impact assessment was carried out. During the assessment three\r\noptions were analysed from biological, environmental and economic-social\r\naspects. The option with most beneficial impact has been then developed into\r\nthe present multiannual plan. To ensure sustainable fisheries at MSY level by\r\n2015 for the stocks concerned is to achieve biological and environmental\r\nbenefits. The probable reduction in the overall amount of fishing would also\r\nimply a reduction in emissions from vessel engines.\n\u00b7        \r\nAs for the economic-social impact, bringing the\r\nherring and sprat stocks under a management plan would provide a systematic\r\nbasis for setting annual TACs in a way which would provide the pelagic sector\r\nwith predictability of catches which would help support business planning and\r\nstability of supply. It would also add value, as management plans are usually a\r\nprerequisite for a fishery to obtain certification from, for example, the\r\nMarine Stewardship Council (MSC). Fish caught in such certified fisheries can\r\nthen attract a higher price in the market. \n\u00b7        \r\nLowering fishing opportunities might result in\r\nslight profit reduction for the fishermen, processing industry, and it might\r\nnegatively affect the consumers in the short term, but restoring the status of\r\nstocks will ensure long-term benefits in terms of profit and sustainable\r\nfishery. Furthermore, the temporary reduction of quotas normally results in\r\nincreasing the price for that stock. \n\u00b7        \r\nThe abolishment of fishing effort system and of\r\nrequirement of single area fishing will simplify the legal framework and reduce\r\nadministrative burden on MS and industry.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7     \r\nLegal basis \nArticle 43(2) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \n\u00b7     \r\nSubsidiarity principle \nProvisions of the proposal relate to the\r\nconservation of marine biological resources, measures that fall under the\r\nexclusive competence of the Union.

Therefore, it is necessary to adapt the exploitation rates of cod,\r\nherring and sprat in the Baltic Sea so as to ensure that the exploitation of\r\nthese stocks restores and maintains them above levels that can produce the\r\nmaximum sustainable yield. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Common Fisheries Policy\r\nis to contribute to the protection of the marine environment, to the\r\nsustainable management of all commercially exploited species, and in particular\r\nto the achievement of good environmental status by 2020, as set out in Article\r\n1(1) of Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[17].\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes the rules\r\nof the common fisheries policy ('CFP') in line with the international\r\nobligations of the Union. The objectives of the CFP are, amongst others, to\r\nensure that fishing and aquaculture are environmentally sustainable in the\r\nlong-term, to apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and to\r\nimplement the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recent scientific advice\r\nfrom the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ('ICES') and the\r\nScientific, Technical and Economic Committee on Fisheries ('STECF') has\r\nindicated that the exploitation of the stocks of cod, sprat and some of the\r\nherring stocks are in excess of that required to achieve maximum sustainable\r\nyield. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A management plan for the\r\ncod stocks has been in place since 2007[18]\r\nbut the stocks of herring and sprat are not yet subject to similar plans. Since\r\nstrong biological interactions exist between the cod and pelagic stocks, the\r\nsize of the cod stock can affect that of the herring and sprat stocks and vice\r\nversa. In addition, Member States and stakeholders have expressed support\r\nfor the development and implementation of management plans for the key Baltic\r\nstocks.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The multiannual plan\r\nestablished by this Regulation should, in accordance with Articles 9 and 10 of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013, be based on scientific, technical and economic\r\nadvice and contain, objectives, quantifiable targets with clear timeframes,\r\nconservation reference points and safeguards.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\r\nestablish a multi-species fisheries plan taking into account the dynamics\r\nbetween the stocks of cod, herring and sprat, and also considering the by-catch\r\nspecies of the fisheries for these stocks, namely the Baltic stocks of plaice,\r\nbrill, flounder and turbot. The objective of this plan should be to aim at\r\nachieving and maintaining maximum sustainable yields for the stocks concerned.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exploitation of cod\r\nand pelagic stocks should not jeopardise the sustainability of the stocks taken\r\nas by-catches in these fisheries, namely the Baltic stocks of plaice, brill,\r\nflounder and turbot. Therefore, the plan should also aim at ensuring the\r\nconservation of these by-catch stocks above biomass levels corresponding to\r\nprecautionary approach.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, as Article 15 of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 introduced a landing obligation, including for all\r\nspecies covered by TACs, the plan should also aim at contributing to the\r\nimplementation of the landing obligation for cod, herring, sprat and plaice.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 16(4) of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1380/2013 requires that fishing opportunities be fixed in accordance with\r\nthe targets set out in the multiannual plans.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These targets should\r\ntherefore be established and expressed in terms of fishing mortality rates,\r\nbased on scientific advice[19].\r\n\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to establish\r\nconservation reference points to allow for additional precaution when a stock\r\nsize is reduced to certain critical level posing serious risk. Such conservation\r\nreference points should be determined at levels of minimum spawning biomass of\r\na stock that is consistent with full reproductive capacity. Remedial measures\r\nshould be envisaged in case the stock size falls below minimum spawning\r\nbiomass.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of stocks taken\r\nas by-catches, in the absence of scientific advice on such levels of minimum\r\nspawning biomass, specific conservation measures should be adopted when\r\nscientific advice states that a stock is under threat.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fish caught when fishing\r\nwith trapnets, pots and creels have a high survivability due to the\r\ncharacteristics of those gears which do not cause damage to the fish, as confirmed\r\nby experimental fishing trips. Therefore, in addition to cases set out in\r\npoints (a) to (c) of Article 15(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, it is\r\nappropriate to exempt cod, herring, plaice and sprat from the landing\r\nobligation in those fisheries.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to comply with the\r\nlanding obligation established by Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013, the plan should provide for other management measures as set out\r\nunder points (a) to (c) of Article 15(4) of that Regulation. Such measures should\r\nbe laid down by way of delegated acts. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The plan should also\r\nprovide for certain accompanying technical measures to be adopted, by way of\r\ndelegated acts, in order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of\r\nthe plan, in particular as regards the protection of juveniles or spawning\r\nfish. Pending the revision of Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005[20], it should also be\r\nenvisaged that such measures may, where necessary for the achievement of the\r\nobjectives of the plan, derogate from certain non-essential elements of that\r\nRegulation.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to adapt to the\r\ntechnical and scientific progress in a timely and proportionate fashion and to\r\nensure flexibility and allow evolution of certain measures, the power to adopt acts\r\nin accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion should be delegated to the Commission in respect of supplementing this\r\nRegulation as regards remedial measures concerning plaice, flounder, turbot and\r\nbrill, implementation of the landing obligation and technical measures. It is\r\nof particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate\r\nconsultations during its preparatory work, including at experts level. The\r\nCommission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous,\r\ntimely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European\r\nParliament and Council.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n18 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, where the Commission has been\r\ngranted powers to adopt delegated acts in respect of certain conservation\r\nmeasures as set out in the plan, Member States having a direct management\r\ninterest in the Baltic Sea fisheries should have the possibility to submit\r\njoint recommendations for such measures, so that these measures are well\r\ndesigned to correspond to the particularities of the Baltic Sea and its\r\nfisheries. The deadline for submitting these recommendations should be\r\nestablished, as required by Article 18(1) of that Regulation.\u00a0 \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to ensuring\r\ncompliance with the measures laid down in this Regulation, specific control\r\nmeasures should be adopted in addition to those provided for in Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1224/2009[21].\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recognising that the Baltic\r\nSea is a rather small fishing area where mainly small vessels carry out short\r\nfishing trips, the use of prior notification as requested by Article 17 of\r\nRegulation (EC) 1224/2009 should be extended to cover all vessels with an\r\noverall length of eight metres or more, and the prior notifications should be\r\nsubmitted at least one hour before the estimated time of arrival at port. However,\r\nconsidering the effect of fishing trips involving very small quantities of fish\r\non the stocks concerned and the administrative burden of prior notifications\r\nrelated to those, it is appropriate to establish a threshold for such prior\r\nnotifications, when these vessels retain on board at least 300 kg cod or two\r\ntons pelagic stocks.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thresholds should be\r\nestablished for the stocks of cod, herring and sprat, which a fishing vessel is\r\nrequired to land in a designated port or a place close to the shore, in\r\naccordance with Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009. Moreover, when\r\ndesignating these ports or places close to the shore, Member States should\r\napply the criteria provided in Article 43(5) of that Regulation in such a way\r\nas to ensure effective control of the stocks covered by this Regulation.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n10(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 provisions should be established for the\r\nperiodical assessment by the Commission of the adequacy and effectiveness of\r\nthe application of this Regulation. Such assessment should follow and be based\r\non benchmarking evaluation of the stocks concerned carried out by ICES. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n9(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, prior to drafting the plan, its likely\r\neconomic and social impact was duly assessed[22].\r\n\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the time-frame,\r\nit is expected that for the stocks concerned maximum sustainable yield should\r\nbe reached by 2015. It should be maintained from there on.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of fishing\r\neffort regime it is necessary to delete the specific rules on special fishing\r\npermit and replacement of vessels or engines applicable to the Gulf of Riga. Accordingly, Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 should be amended.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007[23] should be repealed, \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\r\nSUBJECT MATTER , SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject-matter\r\nand scope\n1.
