After Russia's accession to the WTO and the entry into force of the Stabilisation\r\nand Association Agreement with Serbia, Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 lost\r\nits main purpose.\nMoreover, Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 was\r\nused to impose quantitative limits to certain textiles products originating\r\nfrom the People's Republic of China during a limited period and to eventually\r\nuse the transitional product-specific safeguard mechanism for China. This mechanism expired on 11 December 2013. \nThe present proposal, therefore, foresees the\r\nrepeal Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 in order to promote legal certainty.\n2014/0334 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No\r\n3030/93 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third\r\ncountries\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EEC)\r\nNo 3030/93[1]\r\nentered into force on 9 November 1993 and was applied as from 1 January 1993. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 22 August 2012, the Russian Federation acceded to the World Trade Organization. As\r\na consequence, the Republic of Serbia remained the last country with which the\r\nEuropean Union had a bilateral agreement on trade in textiles. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 29 April 2008, the\r\nStabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and\r\ntheir Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other\r\npart[2] was signed. It entered\r\ninto force on 1 September 2013. On 1 February 2010, the Interim Agreement on\r\ntrade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part,\r\nand the Republic of Serbia, of the other part[3]\r\nentered into force. Since then, Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 no longer applied\r\nto the Republic of Serbia.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Title I of Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 427/2003[4]\r\nexpired on 11 December 2013.
