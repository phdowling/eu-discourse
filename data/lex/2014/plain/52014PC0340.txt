To this end, Regulation\r\nNo 883/2013 on investigations by OLAF is to be amended. \nThese objectives will be achieved by\r\nestablishing a Controller of procedural guarantees, tasked with two functions: \n\u00b7              \r\nReviewing complaints lodged by persons under investigation\r\nabout violation of their procedural guarantees, \n\u00b7              \r\nAuthorizing OLAF to conduct certain\r\ninvestigative measures in respect of members of EU institutions. \nGeneral context\nIn 2013, after many years of intense negotiations,\r\nthe institutions agreed on a new legal framework for OLAF investigations. This\r\nresulted in Regulation 883/2013 on OLAF investigations which entered into force\r\non 1 October 2013. The Regulation brought substantial changes to OLAF's\r\norganisation and investigative procedures, in particular as regards reinforcing\r\nOLAF's governance and strengthening the procedural guarantees of persons\r\nconcerned by OLAF investigations. These changes are currently being\r\nimplemented. \nIn July 2013, the Commission adopted its\r\nproposal on the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) which includes a\r\nseries of Union-level procedural safeguards. Together with that proposal, the\r\nCommission adopted a Communication on improving the governance of OLAF and\r\nreinforcing the procedural safeguards in investigations (COM(2013)533 final).\r\nThe Communication called for a step-by-step approach to accompany the\r\nestablishment of the EPPO and further measures to strengthen OLAF's governance\r\nand enhance procedural safeguards in its investigations, even before the\r\nestablishment of the EPPO.\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nThe proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU,\r\nEuratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning\r\ninvestigations conducted by the OLAF. Other legal acts regulating the\r\nprotection of the financial interests of the EU are:\n\u2013              \r\nCouncil Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/1996\r\nconcerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in\r\norder to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud\r\nand other irregularities,\n\u2013              \r\nCouncil Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 on\r\nthe protection of the European Communities financial interests,\n\u2013              \r\nThe Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999\r\nbetween the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the\r\nCommission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by\r\nthe European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS\r\nOF IMPACTS \nAnalysis of Impacts\nThe proposal is accompanied by a Staff\r\nWorking Document (Analysis of Impacts), which weighs several possible scenarios\r\nas a mean to achieve the policy objectives of this initiative. These policy\r\nobjectives are to achieve the highest possible level of protection of\r\nfundamental rights for EU citizens while maintaining the highest possible level\r\nof protection of EU financial interests and safeguarding the reputation of the\r\nEU institutions. The analysis looks at the impact of each option in terms of its\r\neffectiveness in meeting the policy objectives, its financial cost, its impacts\r\non the institutional framework and its acceptability to stakeholders. \nThis Analysis of Impacts found that the\r\npolicy objectives could be reached most effectively by appointing an external\r\nController of procedural guarantees who would act on complaints and authorise\r\ncertain investigative measures related to members of the institutions. This\r\nwould allow, at an acceptable budgetary cost, the procedural safeguards to be\r\nstrengthened, while still respecting the need for effective protection of the\r\nEU financial interests. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal provides for the establishment\r\nof a Controller of procedural guarantees, who would be tasked with reviewing\r\ncomplaints lodged by persons concerned in OLAF investigations about the\r\npotential non-respect of their procedural guarantees. The Controller would also\r\nbe responsible for authorising certain investigative measures related to members\r\nof EU institutions. \nWhen examining a complaint, the Controller\r\nwould review whether procedural guarantees provided for in Article 9, Regulation\r\nNo 883/2013 were respected. For example, he would review whether the notice\r\nperiod for inviting persons concerned to an interview was respected, without,\r\nhowever, taking any position on whether and how to conduct this interview. He\r\nwould listen to both parties involved before issuing a non-binding\r\nrecommendation to the Director-General of OLAF. If the Director-General chooses\r\nnot to follow the Controller\u2019s recommendation, he should state the reasons for\r\ndoing so in a note attached to the final investigation report submitted to the\r\nnational authorities or, where relevant, to institutions, bodies, offices or\r\nagencies of the European Union concerned. Given the nature of the tasks the\r\nController will be entrusted with, the position should be held by a person with\r\nsenior legal expertise in the fields of fundamental rights and criminal law,\r\nand eligible to be appointed to judicial office in at least one Member State or in an EU Court. He should be able to perform his duties in complete\r\nindependence and within the time limits foreseen in this Regulation.\nThis new complaints procedure does not\r\naffect any of the other existing complaint procedures, such as the procedure\r\noffered by the EU Staff Regulation, the European Ombudsman or the European Data\r\nProtection Supervisor. The Controller will also be subject to the requirements\r\nof Regulation 45/2001 on data protection, in particular its Articles 2, 4, 25\r\nand 26. \nRegarding the use of certain investigative\r\nmeasures towards members of EU institutions, a new measure is proposed, whereby\r\nthe Director-General of OLAF must ask for the Controller\u2019s authorisation if\r\nOLAF intends to carry out an inspection of the professional offices of these\r\nmembers. This includes taking of copies of documents or any other form of data\r\nstorage located in their professional offices. This requirement is inspired by\r\nthe proposal for a European Public Prosecutor's Office as the future EPPO will\r\nrequire similar authorisation from the competent judicial authorities in Member\r\nStates. This is to reflect the special way in which members of EU institutions\r\nhave been appointed or elected, as well as their particular responsibilities\r\nand their status, which may justify specific provisions to ensure the proper\r\nfunctioning of the institutions to which they belong. \nLegal basis \nThe proposal is based on art. 325 TFEU on\r\ncombating fraud.\nSubsidiarity and proportionality\r\nprinciples \nThis proposal has no impact on Member States\u2019 powers and\r\nresponsibilities for combating fraud affecting the financial interests of the\r\nEU. It concerns only OLAF's investigations, which are currently laid out in an\r\nEU Regulation. In addition, the above-mentioned actions are limited to what is\r\nnecessary in order to attain the proposed objectives, which is compliant with\r\nthe principle of proportionality. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe budgetary implications of this proposal\r\nare mainly related to human resources. It requires the establishment of the\r\nController of procedural guarantees and members of his secretariat. It is\r\nenvisaged that the Controller would have the status of a Special Advisor remunerated\r\nat the level of an AD15, which\u00a0 appears as the most appropriate status in view\r\nof the expected tasks. With regard to the term of office of five years, the\r\nunderlying contracts would in this case be issued for administrative reasons in\r\ncompliance with Article 123 (1) of the Conditions of Employment of Other\r\nServants. The obligations under Article 123 (2) CEOS would be deemed fulfilled\r\nthrough the appointment procedure. He would work\r\npart-time (25 per cent in the first year and 50 per cent thereafter) and would\r\nbe assisted by a secretariat initially composed of two persons in the administrators\u2019\r\nfunction group and one secretarial assistant in the assistants/secretarial\r\nclerks\u2019 function group, which could be expanded or reduced in view of its\r\nworkload. The Controller would also have a substitute, who would have the same\r\nstatus and grade as the Controller and would be called upon to act only in case\r\nthe Controller is not available. For administrative purposes, they would all be\r\nattached to the Commission, while benefitting from specific guarantees ensuring\r\ntheir full independence in the exercise of their functions.\n2014/0173 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\r\n883/2013 as regards the establishment of a Controller of procedural guarantees\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 325 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Court\r\nof Auditors[1]\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's institutions\r\nand Member States attach great importance to the protection of the financial\r\ninterests of the European Union and to the protection of the fundamental rights\r\nof the citizens. Procedural guarantees of persons concerned by OLAF\u2019s\r\nadministrative investigations should be strengthened without obstructing OLAF in\r\nthe exercise of its powers and responsibilities. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU, Euratom)\r\nNo 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council brought substantial\r\nchanges to the conduct of OLAF\u2019s investigative activities, as regards, in\r\nparticular, clarifying OLAF\u2019s investigative procedures, strengthening the\r\nprocedural guarantees of persons concerned by OLAF\u2019s investigations and clarifying\r\nthe general monitoring role of the Supervisory Committee. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Communication\r\nCOM(2013)533 of 17 July 2013 on Improving OLAF's governance and reinforcing\r\nprocedural safeguards in investigations, the Commission has put forward\r\nconcepts for further strengthening the procedural guarantees of persons\r\nconcerned by OLAF administrative investigations, even before the establishment\r\nof the European Public Prosecutor's Office on which the Commission has proposed\r\na Regulation[2].\r\n\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its opinion No 2/2013\r\nof December 2013, OLAF\u2019s Supervisory Committee, expressed the view that the\r\nremedies offered to persons concerned by OLAF\u2019s investigations against\r\npotential violation of their rights and procedural guarantees should be\r\nstrengthened and that a transparent and efficient complaints procedure should\r\nbe put in place within OLAF. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a\r\nconsistent high level of protection of procedural guarantees, all persons concerned\r\nby OLAF investigations should be offered enhanced remedies against potential\r\nviolations of their rights. A Controller of procedural guarantees, external to\r\nand independent from OLAF, should therefore be established and be tasked with\r\nreviewing OLAF\u2019s compliance with the procedural guarantees of the persons\r\nconcerned by OLAF investigations laid down in Article 9 of Regulation No\r\n883/2013. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to review\r\ncomplaints in due time and enable effective protection of the defence rights, complaints\r\nrelated to notice periods or time limits provided for in the Regulation, such\r\nas the notice period for invitation to an interview, should be lodged before\r\nthe expiry of the ordinary period foreseen in the Regulation.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Controller should be\r\nrecruited from outside the EU institutions. For administrative purposes, the\r\nController should nevertheless be attached to the Commission, while benefitting\r\nfrom sufficient guarantees to ensure his full independence. In agreement with\r\nthe Controller, the Commission should provide for his supporting staff. The\r\ncall for applications for the post should specify the eligibility requirements\r\nand the selection criteria applicable to the position. The post entails\r\nfunctions normally entrusted to persons appointed to judicial office and candidates\r\nmust be persons who are able to perform the duties in complete independence and\r\nwithin the time limits foreseen in this Regulation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mandate of the\r\nController should be established without prejudice to the already existing complaints\r\nmechanisms. However, in order to streamline the procedures, if an official or\r\nother servant of the EU lodges a complaint with the Controller while a\r\ncomplaint on the same issue is being examined in accordance with Article 90a of\r\nthe Staff Regulations, the Director-General shall await the recommendation of the\r\nController before taking a decision in accordance with Article 90a. Times limits\r\nprovided for under Article 90a should apply. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid any\r\nunnecessary complaint procedure, OLAF should be immediately informed by the\r\nController when a complaint is lodged and be given the opportunity to remedy\r\nthe issue or explain why it cannot comply with the complainant\u2019s request. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Controller should\r\nexamine the complaint in a swift and adversarial procedure, which should, in\r\nprinciple, not be longer than fifteen working days, verifying the legality of\r\nthe investigative measure concerned. However, the Controller should respect\r\nOLAF\u2019s discretion to conduct the investigation under way as this may compromise\r\nOLAF\u2019s independence. In order to be able to fulfil his function, OLAF should\r\ncommunicate to the Controller any information relevant to the complaint. The\r\nController should give the complainant and the Office the opportunity to\r\nprovide comments on the issue submitted to him. In order to comply with its\r\nduty to conduct the investigation continuously, OLAF should not be prevented\r\nfrom continuing the investigation while a complaint is being examined. The\r\nreview of the complaint should not unduly prolong OLAF\u2019s investigation and\r\nprocedures. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the procedures governing\r\nOLAF investigations, the specificities of the status of the members of the EU\r\ninstitutions defined in the Treaty on the European Union should be recognised\r\nand reflected in specific provisions aimed at ensuring the proper functioning\r\nof the institutions to which they belong. Indeed the political mandate,\r\nindependent status, special responsibilities and/or special procedure of\r\nelection or appointment of the members of the EU institutions distinguish them,\r\nnot individually but functionally, from other persons concerned by OLAF\u2019s\r\ninvestigations. Inspection by OLAF\u2019s staff of the professional office of\r\nmembers of EU institutions, with a view to taking copies of documents or any\r\nother data support, should therefore be made subject to prior authorisation by\r\nthe Controller. The Controller should carry out an objective assessment of the\r\nlegality of the investigative measure OLAF intends to conduct and whether the\r\nsame objective could be achieved by less intrusive means.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation No 45/2001 of 18\r\nDecember 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of\r\npersonal data by the Community institutions and bodies is applicable to the\r\nprocessing of personal data for the purposes of this Regulation.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation in no way\r\ndiminishes the powers and responsibilities of the Member States to take\r\nmeasures to combat fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting\r\nthe financial interests of the Union. Entrusting to an independent Controller\r\nthe task of examining complaints and issuing prior authorisations to OLAF is\r\naccordingly in full compliance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in\r\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond\r\nwhat is necessary in order to step up the fight against fraud, corruption and\r\nany other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nAmendment to Regulation 883/2013\nRegulation No 883/2013 is amended as\r\nfollows: \n1) In Article 2, the following\r\nparagraph (8) is added after paragraph (7):\n\u201c(8) \u201cmember of an EU institution\u201d shall mean a\r\nmember of the European Parliament, a member of the European Council, a\r\nrepresentative of a Member State at ministerial level in the Council, a member\r\nof the European Commission, a member of the Court of Justice of the European\r\nUnion, a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank and a\r\nmember of the Court of Auditors.\u201d\n2) In Article 9(2) fourth\r\nsub-paragraph, the following second sentence is inserted:\n\u201cThe person concerned shall however be informed\r\nof his rights at the beginning of the taking of the statements, in particular\r\nof the right to be assisted by a person of his choice.\u201d\n3) The following Articles 9a, 9b and 9c\r\nare inserted after Article 9:\n\"Article\r\n9a\nThe Controller\r\nof procedural guarantees\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any person concerned by an\r\ninvestigation by the Office shall be entitled to lodge a complaint with the\r\nController of procedural guarantees (hereinafter \u201cthe Controller\u201d) regarding\r\nthe respect by the Office of the procedural guarantees provided in Article 9.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Complaints may be lodged at\r\nthe latest one month after the complainant becomes aware of the relevant facts\r\nthat constitute the alleged violation of his procedural guarantees.

The recommendation shall be submitted to the\r\nOffice and communicated to the complainant. In exceptional cases, duly\r\nmotivated in a letter addressed to the Director-General, the Controller may\r\ndecide on extending the period for issuing the recommendation by a further 15\r\ndays. The absence of a recommendation by the Controller within the time limits\r\nset out in this paragraph shall be deemed closure of the complaint without a recommendation.\r\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without interfering with\r\nthe conduct of the investigation under way, the Controller shall examine the\r\ncomplaint in an adversarial procedure. Upon their consent, the Controller may\r\nask witnesses to provide written or oral explanations he considers relevant in\r\nascertaining the facts. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Director-General shall\r\nnot be obliged to follow the Controller\u2019s recommendation on the issue. However\r\nwithout prejudice to Article 7(5), if he decides not to follow the\r\nrecommendation, he shall communicate to the complainant and to the Controller\r\nthe main reasons for that decision, inasmuch as it does not affect the on-going\r\ninvestigation. He shall state the reasons for not following the Controller\u2019s\r\nrecommendation in a motivated note to be attached to the final investigation\r\nreport. \n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Director-General may\r\nrequest, indicating a time limit, the opinion of the Controller on any matter\r\nrelated to the respect of procedural guarantees in his mandate,\r\nincluding on the decision to defer information of the person concerned referred\r\nto in Article 9(3).\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Without prejudice to the time\r\nlimits provided for in Article 90a of the Staff Regulations, where a complaint\r\nhas been lodged with the Director-General by an official or other servant of\r\nthe EU in accordance with Article 90a of the Staff Regulations and the official\r\nor other servant has lodged a complaint with the Controller related to the same\r\nissue, the Director-General shall await the recommendation of the Controller\r\nbefore replying to the complaint.) \nArticle 9b\nPrior authorisation for certain investigative measures\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without prejudice to the\r\nindependence of the Office with respect to the discretion to conduct the\r\ninvestigation under way, the Director-General shall first obtain the\r\nauthorisation of the Controller when the Office intends to exercise its power to\r\ninspect the professional office of a member of an EU institution at the\r\npremises of an EU institution during an internal investigation or to take copies\r\nof documents or of any data support located in this office, irrespective of the\r\nnature of the support on which the data is stored.

It will also raise OLAF\u2019s perceived accountability.\nThe Controller will also authorise OLAF to carry out inspections of\r\noffices and taking of copy of documents and thus take into account the special\r\nway in which they were elected or appointed.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added\r\nvalue of EU involvement: Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nOLAF is an EU body and therefore any additional mechanism of control\r\nshould be placed at the same level. The Controller of procedural guarantees\r\nwould ensure the highest level of protection of procedural rights, with the\r\nlowest possible impact on the duration and effectiveness of OLAF\r\ninvestigations. It would also check the legality of certain investigative measures\r\nrelated to members of EU institutions and whether the same result could be\r\nachieved by using less intrusive means. This approach is justified by the\r\nspecial status of the members of EU institutions, the way they were elected or\r\nappointed, as well as their statutory independence. \n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past \nThe Hearing Officer for competition proceedings provides\r\ncompanies under investigation with an effective way of complaining against\r\npossible non-respect by the Commission of certain procedural rights. The\r\nController of procedural guarantees should provide persons concerned in OLAF\r\ninvestigations with a review mechanism inspired by the one in place in the\r\nfield of competition, and adapted to the legal framework of anti-fraud\r\ninvestigations. \nProposals to establish such a complaints\r\nprocedure, external to OLAF, have already been discussed in the past. The\r\nCommission had introduced in its previous proposal to amend Regulation No.\r\n1073/1999 on investigations conducted by OLAF - COM(2006) 244 final - the\r\nconcept of a \u201cReview adviser\u201d, while in its 2011 amended proposal - COM(2011)\r\n135 - the concept a of \u201creview procedure\u201d. Both proposed functions were\r\ndesigned to ensure a swift control of the compliance with procedural rights of\r\npersons concerned by OLAF investigations. However, neither of the two proposals\r\nwas acceptable to the legislator because of difficulties to reconcile a high\r\ndegree of independence from OLAF with the need for cost-efficiency and\r\ncost-neutrality.\nThe Commission now proposes the establishment of a Controller of\r\nprocedural guarantees, who would be independent, but administratively attached\r\nto the Commission. The office of the Controller would be expressly endowed with\r\nguarantees of complete independence vis-\u00e0-vis OLAF, the Commission and the\r\nother EU institutions.\nThe revised OLAF Regulation which has entered into force in\r\nOctober 2013 provides for a set of procedural rights for the persons concerned\r\nby OLAF\u2019s internal and external investigations, as well as for witnesses.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments: Requirement(s)\r\nto be met in the short or long term\nOLAF Regulation 883/2013 was designed to strengthen the governance\r\nof OLAF, reinforcing procedural rights in internal and external investigations\r\nand OLAF's exchange of information both with the institutions and with the\r\nMember States\u2019 authorities. The Office of the Controller completes Regulation 883/2013\r\nwith an independent handling of complaints concerning the rights provided for\r\nin this Regulation. \nThe initiative is also compatible and coherent with the Regulation\r\non the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (COM(2013) 534\r\nfinal). The establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO)\r\nwill bring about a substantial change in the way investigations concerning\r\nfraud and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the\r\nEuropean Union are carried out in the Union. In the future, for criminal\r\nconduct falling within the remit of the EPPO, the ensuing investigations would\r\nbe conducted by the EPPO as a prosecutorial body, rather than \u2013 as today \u2013 by\r\nOLAF which carries out administrative investigations. This change would entail,\r\nfor the persons under investigation by the EPPO, the application of procedural\r\nguarantees typical of a judicial body. The reinforcement of procedural\r\nguarantees of persons concerned by OLAF investigations through the\r\nestablishment of a Controller of procedural guarantees represents, to a certain\r\nextent, a preparatory step in the direction of establishing the EPPO.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\u00fd Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\r\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) planned[5] \nFrom the 2014 budget\n\u00fd Direct management by the Commission\n\u2013     \r\n\u00fd by its departments, including by its staff in the Union\r\ndelegations; \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 by the executive agencies; \n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Indirect management by delegating implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial\r\nRegulation;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the\r\nextent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\r\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic\r\nact.\n\u2013       If more than one management mode is\r\nindicated, please provide details in the \"Comments\" section.\nComments \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \n2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specify frequency and conditions.
