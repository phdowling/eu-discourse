In response to requests from several Member States,\r\nthe Commission, together with the government experts concerned, considered\r\nwhether to open autonomous tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial\r\nproducts.\nOn 17 December 2013 the Council\r\nadopted Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013 opening and providing for the\r\nmanagement of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural\r\nand industrial products so that Union demand for the products in question could\r\nbe met under the most favourable conditions.\nTariff quotas of the Union should be opened\r\nat zero or reduced duty rates for appropriate volumes, without disturbing the\r\nmarkets for such products. Discussions at meetings of the Economic Tariff\r\nQuestions Group (ETQG) showed that the Member States were ready to open quotas\r\nfor the products listed in the Annex to this proposal for a Regulation, without\r\ndisturbing the markets for such products. ETQG consists of delegations from all\r\nMember States plus Turkey. It met three times before the changes laid down in\r\nthis proposal have been agreed.\nEach request (new, amended or rolled-over\r\nrequests) has been assessed carefully by the group. In particular, preventing\r\nany harm for EU producers, the strengthening and consolidation of the competiveness\r\nof EU production and the creation or maintenance of employment are part of the\r\nexamination of each case. This assessment has been carried out by discussions\r\nwithin the group and consultation by Member States of the concerned industries,\r\nassociations, chambres of commerce and other stakeholders involved.\nFor reasons of clarity it was decided to\r\npublish a consolidated version of the Annex to this regulation which will fully\r\nreplace the Annex set out in Council Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013.\nThe proposal is in line with agricultural,\r\ntrade, entreprise, development and external relations policies. Especially this\r\nproposal is not at the expense of countries enjoying a preferential trading\r\nagreement with the EU (e.g. GSP, ACP regime, candidate countries and potential\r\ncandidates).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH\r\nTHE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe ETQG, in which government experts from\r\nall Member State are represented, was consulted. All listed quotas correspond\r\nto agreements or compromises reached in the discussions of the group, as above\r\nmentioned.\nThere was no mention of potentially serious\r\nrisks with irreversible consequences.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis of this regulation proposal\r\nis Article 31 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\nBy virtue of Article 31 of the TFEU\r\nautonomous tariff suspensions and quotas are fixed by the Council acting on\r\nqualified majority on the basis of a Commission proposal, therefore a\r\nregulation is the appropriate instrument.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiary principle therefore does not apply.\nThe proposal complies with the principle of\r\nproportionality as this set of measures is in line with the principles set out\r\nto simplify the procedures for the operators engaged in foreign trade and in accordance\r\nwith the Commission communication concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and\r\nquotas (C 363, 13.12.2011 p.6).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nUncollected customs duties of a total\r\namount of approximately 15,9 Mio \u20ac/year. The effect on the traditional own\r\nresources of the budget is \u2013 EUR 11 913 967 /year (75% x EUR 15 885 290 /year).\n2014/0325 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013\r\nopening and providing for the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the\r\nUnion for certain agricultural and industrial products \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\r\nsufficient and uninterrupted supply of certain goods insufficiently produced in\r\nthe Union and to avoid any disturbances on the market for certain agricultural\r\nand industrial products, autonomous tariff quotas have been opened by Council\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1388/2013[1]. Products within those\r\ntariff quotas can be imported into the Union at reduced or zero duty rates. For\r\nthe reasons indicated, it is necessary to open, with effect from 1 January 2015,\r\ntariff quotas at zero duty rates for an appropriate volume as regards nine\r\nadditional products.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In certain cases, the existing\r\nautonomous tariff quotas of the Union should be adapted. In the case of three\r\nproducts, it is necessary to amend the product description for clarification\r\npurposes and in order to take into account the most recent product\r\ndevelopments. In the case of seven other products the TARIC codes should be changed\r\nbecause of CN and classification changes. In \u00a0the case of another product, the quota\r\nvolume needs to be increased in the interest of economic operators of the Union.\r\nAlso, for reasons of clarity one quota period should be specified and one order\r\nnumber should be changed.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of one product,\r\nthe autonomous tariff quota of the Union should be closed with effect from 1 January\r\n2015 as it is not in the Union\u2019s interest to continue granting it as from that\r\ndate.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tariff quotas should be\r\nreviewed regularly with the possibility of deletion on request of a party concerned.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the number of\r\namendments to be made in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013, in the\r\ninterests of clarity and rationality that Annex should be replaced.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As some of the changes to the\r\ntariff quotas provided for in this Regulation have to take effect on 1 January 2015,\r\nthis Regulation should apply from that date,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThe Annex to Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1388/2013 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal\r\nof the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:\nCouncil Regulation amending Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 1388/2013 opening and providing for the management of autonomous tariff\r\nquotas of the Union for certain agricultural and industrial products\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGET LINES\nChapter and Article: Chapter 12, Article\r\n120\nAmount budgeted for the year 2015: \u20ac 16 701 200 000 \u00a0\u20ac (B 2015)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FINANCIAL IMPACT\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial implications\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial impact on\r\nexpenditure but has a financial impact on revenue.
