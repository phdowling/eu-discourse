These d\u00e9marches\r\nconsisted inter alia of actions providing reasons of its actions,\r\nopportunity for the countries to respond and refute, right to ask for and\r\nprovide additional information, proposed actions plans to remedy the situation\r\nas well as adequate time to answer and reasonable time to remedy the situation.\r\n\nOn DATE MONTH 2014\r\nthe Commission, by Commission Implementing Decision, identified Sri Lanka as a third country that the Commission considers as a non-cooperating third\r\ncountry pursuant to the IUU Regulation.\nThe attached\r\nproposal for a Council Implementing Decision is based on the findings which\r\nhave confirmed that Sri Lanka has failed to discharge the duties incumbent upon\r\nit under international law as flag, port, coastal or market State. \nIt is\r\ntherefore proposed that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a\r\nDecision.\nLegal basis\nCouncil\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 on establishing a Community\r\nsystem to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing.\nSubsidiarity\r\nprinciple\nThe proposal\r\nfalls under the exclusive competence of the European Union. The subsidiarity\r\nprinciple therefore does not apply.\nProportionality\r\nprinciple\nThe proposal\r\ncomplies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe form of\r\naction is described in the IUU Regulation and leaves no scope for national\r\ndecision.\nIndication of\r\nhow financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national\r\ngovernments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is\r\nminimised and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of\r\ninstruments\nProposed\r\ninstruments: decision.\nOther means\r\nwould not be adequate for the following reason:\nOther means\r\nwould not be adequate because the IUU Regulation does not provide for\r\nalternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nUnion budget.\n2014/0294 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\namending the list of non-cooperating third\r\ncountries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008\r\nestablishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 establishing a Community system to prevent,\r\ndeter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, amending\r\nRegulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1936/2001 and (EC) No 601/2004 and\r\nrepealing Regulations (EC) No 1093/94 and (EC) No 1447/1999[2], and in particular\r\nArticle 33 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\r\nthe European Commission, \nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 INTRODUCTION\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n1005/2008 (the IUU Regulation) establishes a Union system to prevent, deter and\r\neliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VI of the IUU\r\nRegulation lays down the procedure with respect to the identification of\r\nnon-cooperating third countries, d\u00e9marches in respect of countries identified\r\nas non-cooperating third countries, the establishment of a list of\r\nnon-cooperating countries, removal from the list of non-cooperating countries,\r\npublicity of the list of non-cooperating countries and any emergency measures.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n32 of the IUU Regulation, the Commission notified by a Decision of 15 November\r\n2012[3] (Decision of 15 November\r\n2012) eight third countries of the possibility of their being identified as third\r\ncountries that the Commission considers as non-cooperating third countries. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Decision of 15\r\nNovember 2012, the Commission included the information concerning the essential\r\nfacts and considerations underlying such identification. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also on 15 November 2012,\r\nthe Commission notified the eight third countries by separate letters of the\r\nfact that it was considering the possibility of identifying them as non-cooperating\r\nthird countries. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission\r\nhighlighted, in those letters, that in order to avoid being identified and\r\nproposed for formal listing as a non-cooperating third country as envisaged in\r\nArticles 31 and 33 of the IUU Regulation, the third countries concerned were\r\ninvited to establish, in close cooperation with the Commission, an action plan\r\nto rectify the shortcomings identified in the Decision of 15 November 2012. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence, the\r\nCommission invited the eight third countries concerned: (i) to take all\r\nnecessary measures to implement the actions contained in the action plans\r\nsuggested by the Commission; (ii) to assess the implementation of the actions\r\ncontained in the action plans suggested by the Commission; and (iii) to send\r\nevery six months detailed reports to the Commission assessing the\r\nimplementation of each action as regards, inter alia, their individual\r\nand/or overall effectiveness in ensuring a fully compliant fisheries control\r\nsystem. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The eight third countries\r\nconcerned were given the opportunity to respond in writing on issues explicitly\r\nindicated in the Decision of 15 November 2012 as well as on other relevant\r\ninformation, allowing them to submit evidence in order to refute or complete\r\nthe facts invoked in the Decision of 15 November 2012 or to adopt, as\r\nappropriate, a plan of action to improve and measures taken to rectify the\r\nsituation. The eight countries were assured of their right to ask for, or to\r\nprovide, additional information. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 November 2012, the\r\nCommission opened a process of dialogue with the eight third countries and indicated\r\nthat it considered a period of 6 months as being in principle sufficient for\r\nreaching an agreement. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission continued to\r\nseek and verify all information it deemed necessary. The oral and written\r\ncomments submitted by the eight countries following the Decision of 15 November\r\n2012 were considered and taken into account. The eight countries were kept\r\ninformed either orally or in writing on the Commission's considerations.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 24 March 2014, the\r\nCouncil Implementing Decision 2014/170/EU establishing a list of\r\nnon-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and\r\neliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing[4] was adopted. Three of the eight countries concerned by the Decision\r\nof 15 November 2012 were listed as non-cooperating countries as they, despite\r\ntaking some measures, still failed to discharge their\r\nduties under international law as flag and coastal State\r\nto take action to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By an Implementing Decision\r\nof DATE MONTH 2014[5],\r\nthe Commission identified the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka) as a non-cooperating third country in fighting IUU fishing. In accordance with\r\nthe IUU Regulation, the Commission provided the reasons why it considered that Sri Lanka failed to discharge its duties under international law as flag, port, coastal or\r\nmarket State to take action, prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Council Implementing\r\nDecision placing Sri Lanka on the list of non-cooperating third countries in\r\nfighting IUU fishing should therefore be taken in the context of the\r\nimplementation of the IUU Regulation as a result of investigation and dialogue\r\nprocedures which were carried out in line with the substantive and procedural\r\nrequirements laid out in the IUU Regulation. This Decision is based on those\r\ninvestigation and dialogue procedures, including the correspondence exchanged\r\nand the meetings held, as well as the Decision of 15 November 2012 and Decision\r\nof DATE MONTH 2014. The reasons underlying those procedures and acts are the\r\nsame as those underlying this Decision. This Decision placing Sri Lanka on the list of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing should\r\nentail the consequences stated in Article 38 of the IUU Regulation. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon the adoption of the\r\nCouncil Implementing Decision placing Sri Lanka on the list of non-cooperating\r\nthird countries in accordance with Article 33 of the IUU Regulation, the\r\nDecision of DATE MONTH 2014 identifying Sri Lanka as a non-cooperating third\r\ncountry will become obsolete.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 34(1)\r\nof the IUU Regulation the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal\r\nfrom the Commission, is to remove a third country from the list of\r\nnon-cooperating third countries if that country demonstrates that the situation\r\nthat warranted its listing has been rectified. A removal decision is also to take\r\ninto consideration whether the listed third countries concerned have taken\r\nconcrete measures capable of achieving a lasting improvement of the situation. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE WITH RESPECT TO SRI LANKA\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 November 2012, the\r\nCommission notified Sri Lanka pursuant to Article 32 of the IUU Regulation that\r\nit considered the possibility of identifying Sri Lanka as a non-cooperating\r\nthird country and invited Sri Lanka to establish in close cooperation with its\r\nservices an action plan to rectify the shortcomings identified in the Decision\r\nof 15 November 2012. During the period from December 2012 to June 2014, Sri Lanka made written submissions making its views known and met with the Commission to\r\ndiscuss relevant points. The Commission provided Sri Lanka with relevant information\r\nin writing. The Commission continued to seek and verify all information it\r\ndeemed necessary. The oral and written comments submitted by Sri Lanka following the Decision of 15 November 2012 were considered and taken into account, while Sri Lanka was kept informed either orally or in writing of the Commission's considerations.\r\nThe Commission took the view that the areas of concern and shortcomings as\r\ndescribed in the Decision of 15 November 2012 had not been addressed\r\nsufficiently by Sri Lanka. Moreover, the Commission concluded that the measures\r\nsuggested in a plan of action had not been fully implemented. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IDENTIFICATION OF SRI LANKA AS A NON-COOPERATING THIRD COUNTRY\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the\r\nDecision of 15 November 2012, the Commission analysed\r\nthe duties of Sri Lanka and evaluated its compliance with its international\r\nobligations as flag, port, coastal or market State. For the purpose of that\r\nreview, the Commission took into account the parameters listed in Article 31(4)\r\nto (7) of the IUU Regulation.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission reviewed the\r\ncompliance of Sri Lanka in line with the findings of Decision of 15 November\r\n2012, and having regard to relevant information provided thereon by Sri Lanka, the suggested plan of action, and the measures taken to rectify the situation. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main shortcomings\r\nidentified by the Commission in the suggested plan of action related to several\r\nfailures to implement international law obligations, linked in particular to\r\nthe lack of adoption of an adequate legal framework, lack of an adequate and\r\nefficient monitoring system, lack of an observer scheme, lack of a deterrent\r\nsanctioning system, and to improper implementation of the catch certification\r\nscheme. Other identified shortcomings relate, more generally to compliance with\r\ninternational obligations including Regional Fisheries Management Organisations\r\n(RFMOs) recommendations and resolutions, and the conditions for registration of\r\nvessels according to international law. A lack of compliance with\r\nrecommendations and resolutions from relevant bodies such as the International\r\nPlan of Action against Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing of the\r\nUnited Nations (IPOA-IUU) was also identified. However, the lack of compliance\r\nwith non-binding recommendations and resolutions was considered only as\r\nsupporting evidence and not as a basis for the identification.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Implementing\r\nDecision of DATE MONTH 2014, the Commission identified Sri Lanka as a non-cooperating third country pursuant to the IUU Regulation. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to the\r\npossible constraints upon Sri Lanka as a developing country, it is noted that\r\nthe specific development status and overall performance of Sri Lanka with respect to fisheries are not impaired by its general level of development. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having\r\nregards to the Decision of 15 November 2012 and the Decision of DATE MONTH\r\n2014, and to the dialogue process with Sri Lanka carried out by the Commission\r\nand its outcome, it can be concluded that Sri Lanka's actions\r\nin light of its duties as flag State are insufficient to comply with Articles 94,\r\n117 and 118 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and\r\nArticles 18, 19 and 20 of United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA).\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, Sri Lanka has failed to discharge its duties under international law as flag State to take action to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU\r\nfishing and it should therefore be included in the Union\r\nlist of non-cooperating third countries. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTABLISHMENT OF A LIST OF NON-COOPERATING\r\nTHIRD COUNTRIES\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\r\nreached with regard to Sri Lanka, that country should be added to the list of\r\nnon-cooperating third countries established by the Decision of 24 March 2014 in\r\naccordance with Article 33 of the IUU Regulation. The Annex to the Implementing\r\nDecision 2014/170/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Actions in respect of Sri Lanka in the form of measures that should be applied are listed in Article 38 of the\r\nIUU Regulation. The prohibition of importation covers all fishery products as defined\r\nin Article 2(8) of the IUU Regulation since the identification as a\r\nnon-cooperating third country is not due to the lack of appropriate measures\r\nadopted in relation to IUU fishing affecting a given stock or species. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IUU fishing, inter alia,\r\ndepletes fish stocks, destroys marine habitats, undermines the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources, distorts competition, endangers food security, puts honest fishermen\r\nat an unfair disadvantage and weakens coastal communities. In view of the\r\nmagnitude of the problems related to IUU fishing, it is considered necessary\r\nfor the Union to implement expeditiously the actions in respect to Sri Lanka as a non-cooperating country. In the light of the foregoing, this Decision should\r\nenter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official\r\nJournal of the European Union. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If Sri Lanka demonstrates that the situation that warranted its listing has been rectified, the\r\nCouncil, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, is to remove\r\n  Sri Lanka from the list of non-cooperating third countries in line with\r\nArticle 34 (1) of the IUU Regulation. Any removal decision shall also take into\r\nconsideration whether Sri Lanka has taken concrete measures capable of\r\nachieving a lasting improvement of the situation, \nDECIDES AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nThe Annex to Implementing Decision\r\n2014/170/EU is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Decision. \nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\nday following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union. \nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 1.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Decision of 15 November 2012 on notifying\r\nthe third countries that the Commission considers as possible of\u00a0 being\r\nidentified as non-cooperating third countries pursuant to Council Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and\r\neliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (OJ C 354, 17.11.2012, p.\r\n1).\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 91, 27.3.2014, p.43\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Implementing Decision of DATE MONTH 2014\r\nidentifying the third countries that the Commission considers as non-\r\ncooperating third countries pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008\r\nestablishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing (OJ C XX, dd.mm.2014, p.X).\nANNEX\nList of non-cooperating third countries in\r\nfighting Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing\nto the\nProposal for a COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING\r\nDECISION\namending the list of\r\nnon-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and\r\neliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\nBelize\nKingdom of Cambodia\nRepublic of Guinea\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
