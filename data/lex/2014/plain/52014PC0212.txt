A number of actions relevant to\r\nSMEs were set out in the Communication on \u201cAn Integrated Industrial Policy for\r\nthe Globalisation Era\u201d[2], one of Europe 2020\u2019s seven key flagship initiatives. The review of\r\nthe Small Business Act[3] and the Single Market Acts I[4]\r\nand II[5] also included actions designed to improve access to finance and to\r\nfurther reduce the costs of doing business in Europe. \nCompanies find it costly and difficult to\r\nbe active across borders and only a small number of SMEs invests abroad. The\r\nreasons for this include the diversity of national legislations, in particular\r\ndifferences in national company laws, and the lack of trust in foreign\r\ncompanies among customers and business partners. In order to overcome the lack\r\nof trust, companies often establish subsidiaries in other Member States. The\r\nadvantage of this being that they are able to provide customers with the brand\r\nand reputation of the parent company, whilst also offering them the security of\r\ndealing with a company which has the legal status of a national rather than\r\nforeign company. Establishing a company abroad involves, among others, the\r\ncosts of meeting legal and administrative requirements in other countries,\r\nwhich are frequently different to what companies are used to \u201cin the home\r\ncountry\u201d. Those costs (including the additional necessary legal advice and\r\ntranslation) are likely to be particularly high for groups of companies, since\r\nany parent company, and particularly an SME parent, is presently faced with\r\ndifferent requirements for each country in which it wishes to establish a\r\nsubsidiary. \nEuropean small and medium-sized enterprises\r\n(SMEs) - have an essential role to play in strengthening the EU economy.\r\nHowever, they still face a number of obstacles, which hamper their full\r\ndevelopment within the Internal Market, and therefore prevent them from making\r\ntheir full potential contribution to the EU economy.\nThe European Commission aimed to address\r\nthese costs in its 2008 proposal for a European Private Company Statue (SPE).[6] This proposal was intended to offer SMEs an instrument facilitating\r\ntheir cross-border activities, which would be simple, flexible and uniform in\r\nall Member States. It was issued in a response to a number of calls from\r\nbusinesses for the creation of a truly European form of a private limited\r\nliability company. Despite strong support from the business community it has\r\nnot been, however, possible to find a compromise allowing for the unanimous\r\nadoption of the Statute among Member States. The Commission decided that it\r\nwould withdraw the SPE proposal (the REFIT exercise[7])\r\nand instead announced to come up with the proposal of an alternative measure\r\ndesigned to address at least some of the problems addressed by the SPE. This approach is consistent with the 2012 Action Plan on European company\r\nlaw and corporate governance[8], which reaffirmed the Commission\u2019s commitment to launch other\r\ninitiatives, further to the SPE proposal, in order to enhance cross-border\r\nopportunities for SMEs. \nThe overall objective of this proposal,\r\nwhich provides an alternative approach to the SPE, is to make it easier for any\r\npotential company founder, and in particular for SMEs, to set-up companies\r\nabroad. This should encourage and foster more entrepreneurship and lead to more\r\ngrowth, innovation and jobs in the EU. \nThe proposal would facilitate cross-border\r\nactivities of companies, by asking Member States to provide in their legal\r\nsystems for a national company law form that would follow the same rules in all\r\nMember States and would have an EU-wide abbreviation - SUP (Societas Unius\r\nPersonae). It would be formed and operate in\r\ncompliance with the harmonised rules in all Member States which should diminish\r\nset-up and operational costs. In particular, the costs could be reduced by the\r\nharmonised registration procedure, a possibility of on-line registration with a\r\nuniform template of articles of association and a low legal capital required for\r\nthe set-up. The creditors would be protected by the obligation imposed on the SUP\r\ndirectors (and in some cases on the SUP single-member) to control\r\ndistributions. To enable businesses to reap the full benefits of the internal\r\nmarket, Member States should not require that an SUP's registered office and\r\nits central administration be necessarily located in the same Member State.\nIn parallel to this proposal, the\r\nCommission is also carrying out related work aimed at improving legal certainty\r\nfor companies and more generally regarding the law applicable to them when\r\noperating in other Member States, in line with the 2009 European Council\u2019s\r\nStockholm Programme on an open and secure Europe serving and protecting\r\ncitizens[9].\nThis proposal, once adopted, will repeal\r\nDirective 2009/102/EC and amend Regulation 1024/2012[10] in order to allow for the use of the Internal Market Information\r\nSystem (IMI).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONSULTATIONS WITH\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nThe initiative builds on the research conducted\r\nin the preparation of previous EU initiatives such as the 2008 SPE proposal and\r\non a number of relevant consultations and discussions which have taken place\r\nsubsequently to this proposal. \nAs a part of the reflection process on the\r\nfuture of EU company law, in April 2011 the Reflection Group of company law\r\nexperts published a report with a number of recommendations.[11] The report called for increased efforts to simplify the legal\r\nregime applicable to SMEs. It mentioned in particular the need to simplify the\r\nformalities before a company can be established (e.g. registration, access to\r\nelectronic procedures). The report also proposed introducing a simplified\r\ntemplate for single-member companies across the EU, which would allow both\r\nsingle shareholder start-ups and holding companies with wholly owned\r\nsubsidiaries to reduce transaction costs and avoid unnecessary formalities. \nOn the basis of this report, the Commission\r\nlaunched a broad public consultation on the future of European company law in\r\nFebruary 2012. The conclusion included the opinions of interested parties on possible\r\nmeasures to provide further support to European SMEs at EU level. Nearly 500\r\nresponses were received, from a wide range of stakeholders including public\r\nauthorities, trade unions, business federations, investors, academics and\r\nindividuals. A vast majority were in favour of Commission actions supporting\r\nSMEs, but views differed as to the means to achieve it. The Commission has also\r\nbenefited from input from company law experts involved in the Reflection Group,\r\ne.g. as regards advice on the key aspects of the potential future Directive on\r\nsingle-member companies.\nA more detailed on-line public consultation\r\non single-member companies was launched in June 2013[12], examining whether the harmonisation of national rules\r\non single-member companies could provide companies, and in particular SMEs,\r\nwith simpler and more flexible rules and reduce their costs. A total of 242\r\nresponses were received from a broad range of stakeholders including companies,\r\npublic authorities, trade unions, business federations, universities and individuals.\r\nOf those respondents who expressed an opinion 62% of\r\nrespondents considered that the harmonisation of rules for single-member\r\nprivate limited liability companies could facilitate cross-border activities of\r\nSMEs; 64% considered that such an initiative should\r\ninclude rules relating to on-line registration with a standardised registration\r\nform throughout the EU. \nOn 13 September 2013, the Commission\u2019s\r\nInternal Market and Services Directorate-General met a number of EU business\r\nrepresentatives[13]. Most participants supported the initiative emphasising the\r\npositive impact it could have on companies in the EU. However, they stressed\r\nthat this initiative should not be considered as a fully-fledged alternative to\r\nthe SPE and that the efforts towards the SPE should continue.\nOther stakeholders, such as notaries, were also\r\ngenerally supportive of the initiative, but raised a number of concerns relating\r\nspecifically to the security of on-line registration of companies and to the\r\nneed to guarantee the appropriate level of control over the procedure. In\r\naddition, some stakeholders were of the opinion that the reduction of the minimum\r\ncapital requirement should be accompanied by appropriate measures e.g. a solvency\r\ntest or restrictions on the distribution of dividends. \nThe Impact Assessment carried out by the\r\nCommission discards a number of options at the outset (most\r\nnotably, the introduction of a new supranational legal form; harmonisation of\r\ncompany law related to establishment of subsidiaries with only SMEs as founders\r\nor both in the form of public and private limited liability companies) due to their\r\ninfeasibility and/or a lack of support from stakeholders. \nThe options considered following the\r\nassessment envisaged the creation of forms of national company law for\r\nsingle-member private limited liability companies with harmonised conditions,\r\nin particular in respect of the registration process and the minimum capital\r\nrequirement.\nThe chosen policy option, that would provide\r\nfor the possibility of on-line registration, with the standard template for the\r\narticles of association, a minimum capital requirement of EUR 1, accompanied by\r\na balance sheet test and a solvency statement, was chosen. Compared to the\r\nother policy options, it provides the best overall solution, as measured by its\r\neffectiveness in achieving the objectives (in particular a reduction in costs\r\nfor companies), its efficiency and its level of coherence with EU policies.\nThe Impact Assessment Board adopted an\r\noverall positive opinion on the Impact Assessment on 20 November 2013. The comments received from the Board resulted in the modification\r\nof the sections regarding: the problem definition and problem tree, the size of\r\nthe market and the policy options and their impacts. In addition, the\r\ndescription of the situation in Member States was converted into tables and the\r\nsummary of the results of the 2013 on-line consultation was added. In\r\nparticular, following the opinion of the Impact Assessment Board, the Impact\r\nAssessment includes now the options on a minimum capital requirement and\r\ncreditors' protection as well as regarding on-line registration and the use of\r\nthe uniform template for the articles of association. Moreover, the size of the\r\nmarket concerned is showed more prominently in the Impact Assessment: there are\r\naround 21 million SMEs in the EU out of which approximately 12 million are\r\nlimited liability companies and around half of them (5,2 million) are\r\nsingle-member private limited liability companies.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nLegal basis, subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality \nThe proposal is based on Article 50 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)\r\nwhich is the legal basis for the EU competence to act in the area of company\r\nlaw. In particular, Article 50(2)(f) TFEU provides for\r\nprogressive abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment as regards\r\nthe conditions for setting-up subsidiaries. \nThe draft proposal does not establish a new\r\nsupra-national legal form for the single member company but rather contributes to the progressive abolition of restrictions on freedom of\r\nestablishment as regards the conditions for setting up subsidiaries in the\r\nterritories of Member States. In principle, the objective of the draft proposal\r\ncould thus have been achieved through the independent adoption of identical\r\nlaws by the Member States. Under these circumstances, Article 50 provides a\r\nsufficient legal basis for the proposal and recourse to Article 352 TFEU is not\r\nnecessary.\nAccording to the principle of subsidiarity\r\nthe EU should act only where it can provide better results than intervention at\r\nMember States\u2019 level. \nThe solutions adopted so far by individual\r\nMember States with regard to the reduction of set-up costs have not been so far\r\ncoordinated at EU level. Such coordination among Member States, which would aim\r\nat introducing in national legal systems identical requirements for a\r\nparticular national company law form, although theoretically possible, also\r\nappears unlikely in the near future. Instead, it is likely that individual\r\nactions by Member States will continue to result in divergent outcomes, as\r\nillustrated in detail by the Impact Assessment.\nIn particular, individual actions by Member\r\nStates, most often, focus on their specific national context and usually would\r\nnot seek to facilitate the cross-border establishments. For instance, a requirement\r\nof a physical presence before the notary or any other authority of the Member State of registration, although not directly discriminatory, has a different impact\r\non residents and non-residents. The costs for foreign founders are likely to be\r\nmore significant than for domestic founders. Also, on-line registration\r\naccessible in practice only to nationals or residents, which appears acceptable\r\nin the national context, generates additional costs for foreign companies,\r\nwhich are not incurred by domestic ones. \nIt appears, therefore, that without any\r\naction at EU level only non-harmonised national solutions would be available\r\nand SMEs would continue to face barriers making their expansion abroad more\r\ndifficult and the resulting costs would in particular affect foreign founders.\r\nThe simplification resulting from harmonised rules is theoretically possible to\r\nbe achieved by Member States acting individually, but it is highly unlikely. In\r\nthis context, the targeted EU intervention appears to comply with the principle\r\nof subsidiarity. \nAs regards the principle of\r\nproportionality, the EU action should be appropriate to achieve the objectives\r\nof the policy pursued and should be limited to what is necessary to achieve\r\nthem. It is appropriate to harmonise the conditions of setting-up and operation\r\nof single-member limited liability companies to achieve a higher cross-border participation\r\nof SMEs in the Internal Market. This action should facilitate and encourage the\r\nset-up of companies, and in particular lead to the increase of the number of\r\nsubsidiaries within the EU. It does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve\r\nthis objective, since it does not attempt to fully harmonise all aspects\r\nrelated to the operation of single-member limited liability companies, but is limited\r\nto those aspects which are the most important in the cross-border context.The new Directive, which repeals the existing Directive on\r\nsingle-member companies, also ensures that the content\r\nand form of the proposed EU action does not go beyond what is necessary and\r\nproportionate in order to achieve the regulatory objective.\nDetailed Explanation of the Proposal\nPart 1: General rules for single-member private\r\nlimited liability Companies\nThe general rules for single-member private\r\nlimited liability companies apply to all companies listed in Annex I, including\r\nthe companies referred to in the second part of this Directive (Articles 1-5).\r\nThe Twelfth Council Company Law Directive 89/667/EEC,\r\nwhich was codified by Directive 2009/102/EC,\r\nhas introduced a legal instrument allowing for the limitation of\r\nliability of a company with a single-member throughout the EU. Furthermore, the\r\nprovisions of the first part of this Directive require disclosure of\r\ninformation about a single-member company in a register accessible to the\r\npublic and regulate both decisions taken by the single member and contracts\r\nbetween the single member and the company. If a Member State also grants public\r\nlimited liability companies the possibility of having a single shareholder, the\r\nrules of the first part of the Directive apply to those companies as well. \nPart 2: Specific rules for the Societas\r\nUnius Personae (SUP)\nChapter 1: General provisions\nThe provisions of the second part of this\r\nDirective apply to single-member private limited liability companies\r\nestablished in the form of an SUP (Article 6). \nWhere a matter\r\nis not covered by this Directive, relevant national law should apply. \nChapter 2: Formation of an SUP\nThe Directive restricts the possible ways\r\nof founding an SUP to either establishing a company ex nihilo (founding\r\nan entirely new company) or converting a company which already exists under\r\nanother company law form. Certain provisions for each of these two methods are\r\nmade in the Directive (Articles 8 and 9) and the process of forming an SUP is\r\nalso governed by national rules for private limited liability companies. \nAn SUP can be formed ex nihilo by\r\nany natural or legal person, even if the latter is a single-member limited\r\nliability company. Member States should not prevent\r\nSUPs from being single-members in other companies.\nOnly private limited liability companies\r\nlisted in Annex I are allowed to form an SUP by conversion. A company which\r\nconverts to an SUP preserves its legal personality. The Directive refers to\r\nnational law with regard to conversion procedures.\nAccording to this Directive, an SUP must have\r\nits registered office and either its central administration or its principal\r\nplace of business in the EU (Article 10).\nChapter 3: Articles of association\nThe Directive provides for the standard\r\ntemplate for the articles of association, the use of which is obligatory in the\r\ncase of on-line registration. It further sets out the minimum content of the\r\ntemplate, as will be included in the implementing act to be adopted by the\r\nCommission (Article 11). \nThe articles of association can be changed\r\nafter registration, but the changes must comply with the provisions of the Directive\r\nand national law (Article 12).\nChapter 4: Registration of an SUP\nProvisions relating to the registration\r\nprocedure form the main part of this Directive being a critical issue in\r\nfacilitating the establishment of subsidiaries in EU countries other than the\r\nhome country of the company. The Directive requires Member States to offer a\r\nregistration procedure that can be fully completed electronically at a distance\r\nwithout requiring the need of a physical presence of the founder before the\r\nauthorities of Member State of registration. It must therefore also be possible\r\nfor all communication between the body responsible for registration and the\r\nfounder to be carried out electronically. The registration of the SUP must be\r\ncompleted within three working days in order to allow companies to be formed\r\nquickly (Article14). \nMoreover, the\r\nDirective contains an exhaustive list of documents and details which Member\r\nStates may require for the registration of an SUP. After registration, the SUP\r\nmay change the documents and details in accordance with the procedure specified\r\nby national law (Article 13).\nChapter 5: Single share\nAs an SUP has only one shareholder, it is only\r\nallowed to issue one share that cannot be split (Article 15). \nChapter 6: Share capital\nThe Directive prescribes that the share\r\ncapital shall be at least EUR 1, or at least one unit of the national currency in\r\n  Member State in which this is not the euro. Member States should not impose\r\nany maximum limits on the value of the single-share or the paid-up capital and\r\nshould not require an SUP to build legal reserves. However, the Directive\r\nallows SUPs to build voluntary reserves (Article 16).\nThe Directive\r\nalso contains rules regarding distributions (e.g. dividends) to the\r\nsingle-member of the SUP. A distribution may take place if the SUP satisfies a\r\nbalance-sheet test, demonstrating that after the distribution the remaining assets\r\nof the SUP will be sufficient to fully cover its liabilities. In addition, a\r\nsolvency statement must be provided to the single-member by the management body\r\nbefore any distribution is made. The inclusion of the two requirements in the\r\nDirective ensures a high level of protection of creditors, which should help\r\nthe label \u2018SUP\u2019 to develop a good reputation (Article 18).\nChapter 7: Structure and operational\r\nprocedures of an SUP\nThe Directive covers the decision-making powers\r\nof the single member, the workings of the management body and the\r\nrepresentation of the SUP in relation to third parties (Article 21). \nIn order to facilitate cross-border\r\nactivities of SMEs and other companies, the Directive grants the single-member\r\nto right to take decisions without the need to organise a general meeting and\r\nlists subjects that must be decided by the single member. The single-member\r\nshould be able to take other decisions than mentioned by this Directive,\r\nincluding the delegation of its powers to the management body, if it is\r\npermitted by national law.\nOnly natural persons can become directors\r\nof SUPs, unless the law of the Member State of registration allows legal\r\npersons to do so. The Directive includes certain provisions on the appointment\r\nand removal of directors. The directors are responsible for managing the SUP,\r\nand also represent the SUP in its dealings with third parties. It is envisaged\r\nthat the SUP may be an attractive model for groups of companies and the\r\nDirective therefore allows the single-member to give instructions to the\r\nmanagement body. However, these instructions must comply with national laws\r\nprotecting the interest or of other parties (Article 22).\nThe SUP can be converted into another national\r\nlegal form. In case the requirements of this Directive are no longer fulfilled,\r\nthe SUP is required to either transform into another company law form or to\r\ndissolve. If it fails to do so, national authorities must have the power to\r\ndissolve the company (Article 25).\nPart 3: Final provisions\nThe Directive requires the Member States to\r\nlay down appropriate penalties for breaches of the Directive, of national law\r\nor of the articles of association (Article 28). It also empowers the Commission\r\nto adopt delegated and implementing acts. \nIn order to keep the list of company law\r\nforms in Member States up-to-date, the Commission will propose an amendment to\r\nAnnex I, when necessary, through a delegated act, which will not require\r\nreopening of the Directive and going through the legislative procedure (Article\r\n1 (2). Also, it is proposed to delegate the power to adopt two implementing\r\nacts to the Commission \u2013 with regard to the templates for registration and\r\narticles of association (Articles 11 (3) and 13 (2)). The templates contained\r\nin the implementing acts would be easier to adapt to changing business\r\nenvironment than the ones adopted in the ordinary legislative procedure. In\r\ndrafting the templates, the Commission will be assisted by the Company Law\r\nCommittee. \nThe Directive repeals Directive 2009/102/EC\r\nwhich is replaced by this Directive and amends Regulation 1024/2012[14] in order to allow for the\r\nuse of the Internal Market Information System (IMI) (Articles 29 and 30).\nMember States must transpose the provisions\r\nof this Directive no later than two years from the date of its adoption. In the\r\nmeantime, the Commission will adopt the necessary implementing acts. Member\r\nStates are invited to start the process of implementation immediately after the\r\nentry into force of the Directive. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EXPLANATORY DOCUMENTS\nAccording to the Joint Political\r\nDeclaration of 27 October 2011, the European Commission should only request\r\nexplanatory documents if it can \"justify on a case by case basis [\u2026] the\r\nneed for, and the proportionality of, providing such documents, taking into\r\naccount, in particular and respectively, the complexity of the directive and of\r\nits transposition, as well as the possible administrative burden\".\nThe Commission considers that in this\r\nparticular case it is justified to ask Member States to provide it with explanatory\r\ndocuments in view of the existing implementation challenges that arise, inter\r\nalia, due to the considerable degree of variations in the ways in which company\r\nlaw is regulated in Member States (e.g. in civil codes, company law codes and\r\ncompanies acts).\nImplementation measures will have a number\r\nof effects at a national level, and will influence, for example national\r\ncompany law, the registration procedure, communications between the body\r\nresponsible for registration and the founder, websites of the competent authorities\r\nand on-line e-identification procedure. In particular, the provisions of the\r\nsecond part of the Directive will most likely be transposed into several\r\nnational acts. This could particularly be the case in Member States with more\r\nthan one central business register.\nIn this context, the notification of\r\ntransposition measures will be essential to clarify the relationship between\r\nthe provisions of this Directive and national transposition measures, and\r\ntherefore to assess the conformity of national legislation with the Directive. \nThe simple notification of individual\r\ntransposition measures would not be self-explanatory and would not therefore allow\r\nthe Commission to ensure that all the EU legal provisions were faithfully and\r\nfully implemented. The explanatory documents are necessary to gain a full\r\nunderstanding of the way in which Member States are transposing the provisions\r\nof the Directive into national law. Member States are encouraged to present the\r\nexplanatory documents in the form of easily readable tables showing how the\r\nindividual national measures adopted correspond to the provisions of the\r\nDirective.\nGiven the above, the following recital is included\r\nin the proposed Directive: \"In accordance with the Joint Political\r\nDeclaration of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents of 28\r\nSeptember 2011, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases,\r\nthe notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents\r\nexplaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the\r\ncorresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this\r\nDirective, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be\r\njustified\".\n2014/0120 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non single-member private limited liability\r\ncompanies \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 50 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2009/102/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\r\nof 16 September 2009 in the area of company law on single-member\r\nprivate limited-liability companies[15],\r\nhas made it possible for individual entrepreneurs to operate under limited liability\r\nthroughout the Union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part I of this Directive\r\ntakes over the provisions of Directive 2009/102/EC as regards all single-member\r\nlimited liability companies. It requires that in case all shares come to be\r\nheld by a single shareholder, its identity should be disclosed to the public by\r\nthe entry in the register. This Directive also provides that decisions taken by\r\nthe single shareholder exercising the power of the general meeting as well as\r\nthe contracts between the shareholder and the company should be recorded in\r\nwriting, unless they relate to contracts concluded under market conditions in\r\nthe ordinary course of business. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Establishing single-member\r\nlimited liability companies as subsidiaries in other Member States entails costs\r\ndue to the diverse legal and administrative requirements which must be met in\r\nthe Member States concerned.

This is important for the Union economy as SMEs account for two-thirds\r\nof employment in the Union and offer significant potential for growth and for\r\nthe creation of jobs.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The improvement of the\r\nbusiness environment, especially for SMEs, by reducing transaction costs in Europe, promoting clusters and promoting the internationalisation of SMEs, were the key\r\nelements of the initiative \u201cIndustrial policy for the globalisation era\u201d\r\noutlined in the Commission Communication on the Europe 2020 strategy[17]. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with the Europe\r\n2020 strategy, the Review of the Small Business Act for Europe[18] advocated further progress\r\nin making smart regulation a reality, enhancing market access and promoting\r\nentrepreneurship, job creation and inclusive growth. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\r\ncross-border activities of SMEs and the establishment of single-member\r\ncompanies as subsidiaries in other Member States, the costs and administrative\r\nburdens involved in setting-up these companies should be reduced. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The availability of a\r\nharmonised legal framework governing the formation of single-member companies,\r\nincluding the establishment of a uniform template for the articles of\r\nassociation should contribute to the progressive\r\nabolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment as regards the conditions\r\nfor setting up subsidiaries in the territories of Member States and lead to a\r\nreduction in costs. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Single-member private\r\nlimited liability companies formed and operating in compliance with this\r\nDirective should add to their names a common, easily identifiable abbreviation\r\n\u2013 SUP (Societas Unius Personae).\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To respect Member States\u2019 existing\r\ntraditions of company law, flexibility should be afforded to them as regards\r\nthe manner and extent to which they wish to apply harmonised rules governing\r\nthe formation and operation of SUPs. Member States may apply Part 2 of this Directive\r\nto all single-member private limited liability companies so that all such\r\ncompanies would operate and be known as SUPs. Alternatively, they should\r\nprovide for the establishment of an SUP as a separate company law form which\r\nwould exist in parallel with other forms of single-member private limited\r\nliability company provided for in national law. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure that the\r\nharmonised rules are applied as widely as possible, both natural and legal\r\npersons should be entitled to form SUPs. For the same reason private limited\r\nliability companies that were not formed as SUPs should be able to benefit from\r\nthe SUP framework. They should be able to be transformed into SUPs in\r\naccordance with applicable national law.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To enable business to enjoy\r\nthe full benefits of the internal market, Member States should not require the\r\nregistered office of an SUP and its central administration to be in the same Member State.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to make it easier\r\nand less costly to establish subsidiaries in other Member States, the founders of SUPs should not be obliged to be physically present before\r\nany Member State's registration body.\r\nThe register should be accessible from any Member State and a company founder should be able to make use of\r\nexisting points of single contact created under Directive 2006/123/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[19] as a gateway to national on-line\r\nregistration points. It should, therefore, be possible to establish SUPs\r\nfrom distance and fully by electronic means. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a high\r\nlevel of transparency, all documents registered at the register of companies should\r\nbe made publicly available via the system of\r\ninterconnection of registers referred to in Article 4a(2) of Directive\r\n2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[20]. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure a high level of\r\nuniformity and on-line accessibility, the documents used to register SUPs should\r\nfollow a uniform format available in all official languages of the Union. Each  Member State may require registration to be completed in an official language\r\nof the Member State concerned, but are also encouraged to allow for\r\nregistration in other official languages of the Union. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with the\r\nrecommendations set out in the European Commission's 2011 Review of the Small\r\nBusiness Act[21]\r\nto reduce the start-up time for new enterprises, SUPs should receive the\r\ncertificate of registration in the relevant register of a Member State within three working days. This facility should only be available to the newly created\r\ncompanies and not to existing entities that wish to convert to SUPs as the\r\nregistration of such entities by their very nature, may take more time. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each Member State should designate a competent electronic registration point. To support the designated bodies in exchanging information about\r\nthe identity of the founder, Member States may use the means provided for under\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1024/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[22]. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provisions concerning the\r\nestablishment of single-member private limited companies should not affect the\r\nright of Member States to maintain existing rules\r\nconcerning the verification of the registration process, provided that the\r\nwhole registration procedure may be completed electronically and at a distance.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of the template of\r\narticles of association should be required if the SUP is registered electronically.\r\nIf another form of registration is allowed by national law, the template does\r\nnot have to be used, but the articles of association need to comply with the\r\nrequirements of the Directive. The minimum capital required for the formation\r\nof a single-member private limited liability company varies\r\namong the Member States. Most Member States have already taken steps\r\ntowards abolishing the minimum capital requirement or keeping it at a nominal level.\r\nThe SUPs should not be subject to a high mandatory capital requirement, since\r\nthis would act as a barrier to their formation. Creditors, however, should be\r\nprotected from excessive distributions to single-members, which could affect\r\nthe capacity of an SUP to pay its debts. Such protection should be ensured by\r\nthe imposition of minimum balance sheet requirements (liabilities not exceeding\r\nassets) and the solvency statement prepared and signed by the management body. There\r\nshould be no further restrictions placed on the use of capital by the\r\nsingle-member.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to prevent abuse\r\nand simplify control SUPs should neither issue any further shares nor should\r\nthe single share be split. Nor should SUPs acquire or own their single\r\nshare whether directly or indirectly. Rights attached to the single share\r\nshould only be exercised by one person. Where Member States allow for\r\nco-ownership of a single share, only one representative should be entitled to act\r\non behalf of the co-owners and be considered as a single-member for the purpose\r\nof this Directive.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a high\r\nlevel of transparency, decisions taken by the single-member of an SUP\r\nexercising the powers of the general meeting should be recorded in writing. Such\r\ndecisions should be disclosed to the company and their written record kept for\r\nat least five years. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The management body of an\r\nSUP should be composed of one or more directors. Only natural persons should be\r\nappointed as directors, unless the Member State of registration allows legal\r\npersons to act as directors. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\r\noperation of groups of companies, instructions issued by the single-member to\r\nthe management body should be binding. Only where following such instructions\r\nwould entail violating the national law of the Member State in which the\r\ncompany is registered, the management body should not follow them. With the\r\nexception of any provision in the articles of association which limit the\r\ncompany's representation to all directors jointly, any other limitation of\r\npowers of the directors, following from the articles of association, should not\r\nbe binding insofar as it concerns third parties.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member States should\r\nlay down rules on penalties applicable to the infringements of the provisions\r\nof this Directive and should ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should\r\nbe effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reduce the administrative\r\nand legal costs associated with the formation of companies and to ensure a high\r\nlevel of consistency in the registration process across Member States, implementing\r\npowers to adopt the templates for registration and for the articles of\r\nassociation of an SUP should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[23].\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to accommodate future\r\nchanges to the laws of Member States and to Union legislation concerning\r\ncompany types, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the\r\nCommission to update the list of undertakings contained in Annex I. It is of\r\nparticular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations\r\nduring its preparatory work, including at experts' level. The Commission, when\r\npreparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely\r\nand appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament\r\nand Council.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with the Joint Political Declaration of Member States and the\r\nCommission of 28 September 2011 on explanatory documents[24], Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the\r\nnotification of their transposition measures with one or more documents\r\nexplaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the\r\ncorresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this\r\nDirective, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be\r\njustified. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of\r\nthis Directive, namely, to facilitate the establishment of single-member\r\nprivate limited liability companies, including SUPs cannot be sufficiently\r\nachieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of their scale and\r\neffects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in\r\naccordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the\r\nTreaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality,\r\nas set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary\r\nto achieve those objectives.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since substantial\r\namendments are being made to Directive 2009/102/EC, in the interests of clarity\r\nand legal certainty that Directive should be repealed.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nPart 1\r\nGeneral Provisions \nArticle 1 \r\nScope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The coordination measures provided\r\nfor in this Directive shall apply to the laws, regulations and administrative\r\nprovisions of the Member States relating to:\n(a)          \r\nthe types of company listed in Annex I;\n(b)         \r\nSocietas Unius Personae (SUP) referred to in Article 6. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States shall inform\r\nthe Commission within two months of any changes to the types of private limited\r\ncompanies provided for in their national law affecting the contents of Annex I.\r\n\nIn such a case the Commission shall be\r\nempowered to adapt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 26,\r\nthe list of companies contained in Annex I.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a Member State allows other companies than those listed in Annex I to be established as or become\r\nsingle-member companies, as defined in Article 2 (1), Part 1 of this Directive\r\nshall also apply to them.\nArticle 2\r\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the\r\nfollowing definitions shall apply:\n(1)                   \r\n\"single-member company\" means a\r\ncompany whose shares are held by a single person; \n(2)                   \r\n\u201cconversion\u201d means any process by which an\r\nexisting company becomes or ceases to be an SUP; \n(3)                   \r\n\"distribution\" means any financial\r\nbenefit derived directly or indirectly from the SUP by the single-member, in\r\nrelation to the single share , including any transfer of money or property.\r\nDistributions may take the form of a dividend, and may be made through a\r\npurchase or sale of property or by any other means;\n(4)                   \r\n\"articles of association\" means articles\r\nof association or statutes or any other rules or\r\ninstruments of incorporation establishing a company; \n(5)                   \r\n\"director\" means any member of the\r\nmanagement body either formally appointed or who de facto acts as a director. \nArticle 3\r\nDisclosure\nWhere a company becomes a single-member\r\ncompany because all its shares come to be held by a single person, that fact,\r\ntogether with the identity of the sole member, must either be recorded in the\r\nfile or entered in the register as referred to in Article 3(1) and (3) of\r\nDirective 2009/101/EC or be entered in a register kept by the company and\r\naccessible to the public. \nArticle 4\r\nGeneral meeting\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The single-member shall\r\nexercise the powers of the general meeting of the company. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decisions taken by the single-member\r\nexercising powers referred to in paragraph 1 shall be recorded in writing. \nArticle 5\r\nContracts between the single member\r\nand the company\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contracts between the single-member\r\nand the company shall be recorded in writing.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States may decide not\r\nto apply paragraph 1 to contracts concluded under market conditions in the\r\nordinary course of business which are not detrimental to the single-member\r\ncompany.\nPart 2\r\nSocietas Unius Personae \nChapter 1 \r\nLegal form and General Principles \nArticle 6\r\nLegal form\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States shall\r\nprovide for the possibility of registering private single-member limited\r\nliability companies in accordance with the rules and procedures set out in this\r\nPart.
