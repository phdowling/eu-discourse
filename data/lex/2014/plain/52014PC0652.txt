The\r\nConvention applies to the prevention of, preparedness for and response to\r\nindustrial accidents at sites where hazardous activities take place capable of\r\ncausing transboundary effects. \nThe Seveso II Directive[2] is the legal instrument to fulfill the obligations\r\nof the European Union arising out of the Convention. Annex\r\nI to the Convention and Annex I to the Seveso II Directive list categories of and\r\nindividual hazardous substances for the purpose of defining hazardous\r\nactivities. In June 2015 the Seveso II Directive will be replaced by the Seveso\r\nIII Directive[3],\r\nwhich amongst others, modifies Annex I.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nAt its 7th meeting in 2012, the\r\nConference of the Parties (CoP) to the UNECE Convention on the Transboundary\r\nEffects of Industrial Accidents mandated the Working Group on the Development\r\nof the Convention (WGD) to draft a revised Annex I to the Convention to bring\r\nit in line with the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification\r\nand Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) and to maintain consistency with the\r\ncorresponding European Union legislation (i.e. the Seveso III Directive). \nThe Working Group finalised a proposal for\r\nthe amendment of Annex I to the Convention. EU Member States' experts and the Commission participated\r\nin the discussions. The proposal was endorsed by the Bureau of the Convention\r\nat its meeting in July 2014 and will be submitted in the CoP for adoption at\r\nits December 2014 meeting. \nAs this proposal aligns\r\nAnnex I to the Convention with Annex I to the Seveso III Directive, it would\r\nnot cause any environmental or social-economic impacts in the EU. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe draft text adjusts the content of Annex\r\nI to the Convention to that of Annex I to the Seveso III Directive.\r\nConsequently it is fully in line with existing European Union legislation and all\r\nrelevant reservations expressed by the European Union regarding the current\r\nAnnex I to the Convention can be lifted once the proposed amendment is adopted\r\nby the Conference of the Parties and has become effective.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposed decision\r\ndoes not have budgetary implications for the Union.\nIn view of the above, at the eighth meeting of the UNECE\r\nConvention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents, the European Union\r\nshould support the adoption of the draft revised Annex I. \r\n\n2014/0301 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf\r\nof the European Union, at the Eighth Conference of the Parties to the Helsinki\r\nConvention on Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents with regard to the\r\nproposal for an amendment of Annex I\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union is a Party to\r\nthe UNECE Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents1 (hereinafter referred to as \"the\r\nConvention\").\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex I to the Convention\r\ncontains categories and named hazardous substances for the purpose of defining\r\nhazardous activities.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with Article 26 paragraph 4 of the Convention any amendment to Annex\r\nI shall become effective, for those Parties to the Convention which have not\r\nnotified their objection, twelve months after its communication to the Parties\r\nby the Executive Secretary upon its adoption at the Conference of the Parties by\r\na nine-tenths majority of the Parties present and voting at the meeting, provided\r\nat least sixteen Parties have not notified objections.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The text of the proposal\r\nfor an amendment to Annex I was agreed within the Working Group on the\r\nDevelopment of the Convention, endorsed by the Bureau of the Convention and\r\nwill be proposed for adoption at the next Conference of the Parties, taking\r\nplace in Geneva from 3 to 5 December 2014.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendment to Annex I\r\nwould fully align it to Annex I to Directive 2012/18/EU of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 4 July 20123.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendment to Annex I\r\nto the Convention should therefore be approved.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reservation introduced\r\nby the European Union at the time of adoption of the first amendment to Annex I\r\nof the Convention was based on current discrepancies between Annex I and the EU\r\nlegislation in force, which will no longer exist after Annex I has been\r\namended. This reservation should be lifted once the amendment to Annex I of the\r\nConvention has become effective.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe position to be taken by the European\r\nUnion at the Eighth Conference of the Parties to the Convention shall be to support\r\nthe proposed amendment of Annex I to the Convention as contained in the Annex\r\nto this Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe President of the Council is hereby\r\nauthorised to designate the person(s) empowered to withdraw on behalf of the Union\r\nthe remaining reservations contained in Annex I to Council Decision 98/685/EC\r\nsubject to the amendment to Annex I to the Convention referred to in Article 1\r\nbecoming effective pursuant to Article 26 (4) of the Convention.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 98/685/EC of 23 March 1998 on the conclusion by the\r\nEuropean Community of the Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial\r\nAccidents (OJ L 326 of 3.12.1998, p. 5).\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nDirective 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards\r\ninvolving dangerous substances (OJ L 10 of 14.01.1997, p. 13).\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2012/18/EU of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council of 4 July 2012 on the control of major-accident hazards involving\r\ndangerous substances, amending and subsequently repealing Council Directive\r\n96/82/EC (OJ L 197, 24.7.2012, p. 1).\nANNEX\nAttachment\nto the Proposal for a \nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on\r\nbehalf of the European Union, at the Eighth Conference of the Parties to the\r\nHelsinki Convention on Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents with\r\nregard to the proposal for an amendment of Annex I \nProposal for amendment of Annex I to the\r\nUNECE Convention on Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Submitted by the\r\nWorking Group on the Development of the Convention\r\n\nThe Conference of the Parties,\nRecognizing\r\nthe need to update the categories of substances and preparations and the named\r\nsubstances and their threshold quantities, as contained in annex I to the\r\nConvention, for the purposes of introducing the criteria of the United Nations\r\nGlobally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals\r\n(ST/SG/AC.10/30/Rev.4) and of maintaining consistency with the corresponding EU\r\nlegislation,\nBearing in mind its decision to undertake a revision of the hazardous substances\r\nand their quantities as contained in annex I and its decision 2004/4 on\r\nestablishing the Working Group on the Development of the Convention,\nAcknowledging the proposal to amend annex I, drawn up by the Working Group on the\r\nbasis of a thorough review (for reference see the minutes of two meetings:\r\nWGD3/3-4 September 2013 and WGD4/28-29 April 2014) and supported by the Bureau,\nAmends annex\r\nI to the Convention on hazardous substances for the purposes of defining\r\nhazardous activities as indicated below.\nProposed revision of annex I to the\r\nConvention\nHazardous substances for the purposes of defining hazardous activities1\nWhere a substance or mixture named in Part II\r\nalso falls within one or more categories in Part I, the threshold quantity\r\ngiven in Part II shall be used.\nFor the identification of hazardous activities,\r\nParties shall take into consideration the actual or anticipated hazardous\r\nproperties and/or quantities of all hazardous substances present or of\r\nhazardous substances which it is reasonable to foresee may be generated during\r\nloss of control of an activity, including storage activities, within a\r\nhazardous activity. \n1.
