INTRODUCTION\nMembers of the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) and the Seychelles have reached the concluding stage of an agreement on\r\nthe terms for the accession of the Seychelles to the organization. This comes after\r\n19 years of negotiations, which began when the Seychelles submitted its\r\napplication to join the WTO in 1995. The Seychelles\u2019 request for accession has\r\nbeen examined taking into account the overall bilateral trade relations with the Seychelles in the context of the EU-ACP partnership and an undertaking by\r\nthe Seychelles to pursue trade liberalisation in a full Economic and\r\nPartnership Agreement. A Council Decision approving the terms of the Seychelles\u2019 accession is required by the TFEU, before the EU can formally support that\r\napproval in the WTO.\nA summary of the terms of the accession is\r\nset out below.\nII. SUMMARY OF TERMS OF THE SEYCHELLES\u2019 WTO ACCESSION BY SECTOR\nSchedules of commitments\nGoods (overall)\nThe average final bound rate (FBR) in the\r\naccession schedule of the Seychelles is 16.1 %.\nThe average FBR for agricultural products\r\nat 26.8% is higher than the 10.5% observed for industrial goods. \nThe Seychelles will implement all the FBRs\r\nas from the date of accession.\nThese average levels for tariffs are\r\nreasonable considering the small size and vulnerability of the economy of the Seychelles. Past EU practice has been to accept these tariff levels as reasonable for\r\neconomies of comparable size.\nIndustrial Goods \n\u2013              \r\nThe average FBR for non-agricultural products is\r\n10.5%.\n\u2013              \r\nThe highest averages of around 25% are observed\r\nin fisheries, furniture and footwear.\n\u2013              \r\nThe Seychelles concede duty-free treatment for\r\nPharmaceuticals, Medical Equipment, and Information Technology (ITA) products,\r\nbinding the final bound rates for these products at 0%.\n\u2013              \r\nThe highest tariff peaks are at 200% for retreaded/regrooved\r\ntyres and for second-hand clothing. \nAgricultural goods \n\u2013              \r\nThe average FBR for agricultural products is\r\n26.8%.\n\u2013              \r\nThe highest tariff peaks in agriculture are at\r\n250% for beer and whisky in plastic bottles, and at 200% for tobacco.\nServices \nThe Seychelles will undertake market access\r\nand national treatment commitments in a broad range of services sectors,\r\nincluding professional, computer and other business services, communication\r\nservices, construction services, distribution services, educational services, environmental\r\nservices, financial (insurance and banking) services, health and social services,\r\ntourism services and transport services (maritime transport and transport\r\nauxiliary services).\nProtocol commitments\nIn the final, multilateral stage of the\r\naccession process, WTO Members collectively sought to ensure the basic\r\ncompatibility of the Seychelles\u2019 trade laws and institutions with WTO rules and\r\nagreements, setting these out in the Protocol of accession and Working Party\r\nReport. Against this background, the Seychelles has undertaken standard Working\r\nParty Report's commitments and renounced to any transitional periods, except as\r\nregards the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which will be fully\r\nimplemented only as from December 2015. \nIn this regard the Seychelles has inter alia committed to remove all other duties and charges and to\r\nbind them at 0% upon accession and also to replace by an authorisation system\r\nthe current prohibition of imports applicable to some SPS-related products\r\n(hides and fur skins and palm plants), second-hand vehicles, left-hand drive\r\nvehicles, automotive bodies and camouflage clothing\nIII. RECOMMENDATION\nIn submitting the terms of Accession of the\r\n Seychelles to the WTO for approval by the Council, the Commission considers\r\nthese terms as representing a balanced and ambitious package of market opening\r\ncommitments, which will bring substantial benefits to the Seychelles and its WTO trading partners alike.\n2014/0307 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be taken by\r\nthe European Union within the General Council of the World Trade Organization\r\non the accession of the Republic of Seychelles to the WTO\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 91, 100(2) and the\r\nfirst subparagraph of Article 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9)\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\n31 May 1995 the Government of the Republic of Seychelles applied for accession to the Marrakesh Agreement\r\nestablishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), pursuant to Article XII of\r\nthat Agreement.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Working Party on the accession of the Republic of the Seychelles was established on 11 July 1995 in order to reach agreement on terms of accession acceptable to the Republic of   Seychelles and all WTO Members.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, on behalf\r\nof the Union, has negotiated a comprehensive series of market opening\r\ncommitments on the part of the Republic of Seychelles which satisfy the Union's\r\nrequests, taking into account the bilateral tarde relations with the Seychelles\r\nin the context of the EU-ACP partnership and the undertaking by the Seychelles\r\nto pursue trade liberalisation in a full Economic and Partnership Agreement.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These commitments are now\r\nembodied in the Protocol of Accession of the Republic of Seychelles to the WTO.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accession to the WTO is\r\nexpected to make a positive and lasting contribution to the process of economic\r\nreform and sustainable development in the Republic of Seychelles.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Protocol of Accession\r\nshould therefore be approved.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article XII of the\r\nAgreement establishing the WTO provides that the terms of accession are to be\r\nagreed between the acceding Member and the WTO, and that the Ministerial\r\nConference of the WTO approves the terms of accession on the WTO side.
