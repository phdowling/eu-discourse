On the basis of that agreement, an EU\u2011Tunisia Action Plan\r\nunder the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) was approved by the two parties\r\nin May 2005 for a period of five years. Within this framework EU\u2011Tunisia relations\r\nhave developed and matured substantially. The presentation in March 2010\r\nof a Tunisian proposal to attain an advanced status[1] gave a further impetus\r\nto these relations and marked a significant deepening of relations in the areas\r\nof political relations, security, economics, trade and various sectors, and in\r\npeople-to-people contacts.\nWhen the current ENP Action Plan expired in\r\n2010, it was deemed appropriate to negotiate and conclude a new Action Plan\r\nbased on the objectives and ambitions of the joint document on privileged\r\npartnership. However, pending the conclusion of the new Action Plan, both parties\r\nagreed in September 2010 to continue to apply the 2005 Action Plan.\nEU-Tunisia relations are conducted in the\r\nbroader context of a region where the overall political situation has been in a\r\nstate of flux since early 2011.\nThe Joint Communication \u2018A new response to\r\na changing neighbourhood\u2019[2]\r\noutlined a new approach which aims at a higher level of differentiation,\r\nallowing each partner to develop its links with the EU based on its own\r\naspirations, needs and capacities, but also on mutual accountability and the\r\ndegree of commitment to the universal values of human rights, democracy and the\r\nrule of law, and the capacity to implement jointly agreed priorities. This new\r\nAction Plan clearly sets out the priority objectives of EU-Tunisia relations,\r\nwhile taking full account of the privileged partnership and the comprehensive\r\nscope of EU\u2011Tunisia relations.\nThe European External Action Service (EEAS), in close\r\ncooperation with the European Commission and the EU Member States, has\r\nheld exploratory talks with Tunisia which have resulted in an agreement on a\r\ndraft Action Plan, including the list of priority measures to be carried out\r\nunder the Plan. At the last EU-Tunisia\r\nAssociation Council meeting on 14 April 2014 both sides noted that they\r\nhad reached an agreement. The\r\nfinalisation of technical consultations on each side was notified through an\r\nexchange of letters.\nThe new EU-Tunisia Action Plan sets out\r\nspecific measures for the fulfilment of the parties\u2019 obligations under the\r\nEuro-Mediterranean Agreement. It also provides a broader framework for further\r\nstrengthening EU-Tunisia relations to achieve a significant measure of economic\r\nintegration and a deepening of political cooperation, in accordance with the\r\noverall objectives of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement. Pursuant to the\r\nEuropean Neighbourhood Instrument Regulation[3],\r\nthe Action Plan is a key point of reference for setting the priorities of the Union under the ENP. The ENP, as a single policy framework, will continue to act as a\r\ncatalyst, based in particular on partnership and joint ownership, as well as\r\nperformance\u2011driven differentiation and tailor\u2011made assistance. The\r\nEuropean Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Security Policy ('High Representative') annex hereto the text\r\nof a joint proposal for a Council Decision on the position to be taken by the\r\nEuropean Union within the EU-Tunisia Association Council on the adoption of a\r\nrecommendation on the implementation of the Action Plan.\nThe European Commission and the High\r\nRepresentative therefore request the Council to adopt the attached joint\r\nproposal for a Council Decision.\n2014/0316 (NLE)\nJoint Proposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the

Plan\r\nSummary\nI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 INTRODUCTION\nSince 14 January 2011 Tunisia has\r\nturned a new page in its modern history thanks to a peaceful revolution in\r\nfavour of human dignity and freedom, whose sole mover was the Tunisian people.\r\nThis revolution has laid the foundations for the development of true democracy\r\nbased on the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nThese values, shared with the European\r\nUnion, have inspired the two parties to raise their relations to a higher, more\r\nstrategic level, namely a privileged partnership. Thanks to the revolution,\r\nradically new vistas have opened up in relations between Tunisia and the EU.\r\nThe EU is determined to make a long-term commitment to support Tunisia's\r\ndemocratic transition, aware that success will have beneficial repercussions on\r\nboth Tunisia's prosperity and that of the region as a whole. Support for the Tunisian transition is a historic\r\nopportunity for the EU to respond practically, effectively and positively to\r\nthe challenges posed by both Tunisia and the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019, in accordance with\r\nthe revamped Neighbourhood Policy of 2011.\nA new neighbourhood policy\nIn response to the historic challenges\r\nfacing its neighbourhood, the EU has formulated a new approach with the aim of\r\noffering solutions better suited to the rapid development of its partner\r\ncountries and their need for reforms to establish and consolidate healthy\r\ndemocracies, support sustainable and inclusive economic growth and manage\r\ncrossborder links and flows.\nThis new approach[1] is based on mutual\r\naccountability and a shared commitment to the universal values of human rights,\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law. It offers greater differentiation in the\r\nformulation of support, in line with the ambitions of the partner country for\r\ncloser ties with the EU, with its specific needs and capacity, and with\r\nprogress in implementing reforms, consolidating democracy and the rule of\r\nlaw and upholding human rights and fundamental freedoms. It will also\r\ntranslate this further deepening of relations into greater economic integration\r\nand a deepening of political cooperation in the areas of governance, security,\r\nconflict resolution and the adoption of joint initiatives in international\r\nforums on issues of common interest.\nThe new Neighbourhood Policy approach is\r\ndesigned: (a) to give greater support to partners committed to consolidating\r\ndemocracy and upholding the rule of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms and\r\ngender equality; (b) to support the development of a sustainable and inclusive\r\neconomy that reduces social and regional inequalities, creates jobs and\r\nimproves living standards; (c) to establish a closer partnership with the\r\npeople and civil societies of partner countries.\nNew priorities for Tunisia\nThe Tunisian revolution brings with it the\r\nhope of a better life for Tunisians, marking a break with an outdated\r\ndevelopment model long marred by structural economic and social cleavages.\nThe new approach is thus based on the\r\nbuilding of a new society which aims to be inclusive and balanced, founded on\r\ngood governance and transparency and the equitable distribution of wealth.\nPriority is given to employment and social\r\ncohesion, regional development, security and stability, and transitional\r\njustice with a view to anchoring the democratic transition in a long-term\r\nprocess.\nThese priorities also underline the commitment\r\nto step up the reforms necessary to establish democratic institutions that\r\nrespect human rights and fundamental rights and confirm Tunisia's desire to\r\nbuild an open and modern society, a plural cultural space and dynamic social\r\nfabric.\nEconomic and social reforms will also be\r\nstepped up in order to revive the economy and promote job-creating sustainable\r\ngrowth based on knowledge and innovation.\nEfforts will focus on the development of a\r\njust, solidarity-inspired social policy that is beneficial to all categories\r\nand regions and on the modernisation of the fabric of the economy, with a\r\ngreater focus on more innovative, environmentally friendly activities with a\r\nhigh technological content, and on improved competitiveness and a more\r\nattractive business climate to foster private initiative and public-private\r\npartnerships.\nA\r\nprivileged partnership\nThe conditions are thus right for Tunisia\r\nand the EU to raise their relations to a higher, more strategic level and step\r\nup integration, in view of their shared greater ambitions. Rapprochement with\r\nthe European Union constitutes a permanent and fundamental foreign-policy\r\nchoice by Tunisia[2],\r\nin parallel with the promotion of Maghreb integration and consolidation of\r\nrelations with the Arab, Mediterranean and African countries. Tunisia and the\r\nEuropean Union also share the view that greater economic liberalisation and\r\neconomic and social integration are a source of growth and employment and so\r\npromote inclusive development and shared prosperity.\nWith the privileged partnership Tunisia\r\nwishes to advance to a new level of integration with the EU which is as high as\r\npossible.\nThis new status reflects the desire of both\r\nparties to be part of a process of rapprochement that transcends the limits of\r\nfree trade and includes the mutually beneficial effective mobility of people\r\nand increased knowledge-sharing.\nIt is essential to take account of the\r\nhuman and scientific dimension to this partnership in order to bring civil\r\nsociety, private operators, researchers and students, and local and regional\r\nauthorities closer together, something that will send a strong political signal\r\nto both parties' citizens and business communities.\nThis jointly prepared evolving action plan\r\nfor 2013-2017 constitutes the reference framework for identifying the\r\npriorities for strengthening relations between the two parties at all levels\r\n(political, economic, scientific, social, cultural and human).\nIn this flexible framework, and on the\r\nbasis of the implementation of the privileged partnership in accordance with\r\nArticle 8 of the Treaty on European Union and of the aspirations of the EU and\r\nTunisia to deepen their relations, the parties agree to start canvassing the\r\npossibility of reaching a new agreement governing their relations.\nKey elements of the privileged\r\npartnership between the European Union and Tunisia\nCloser relations between the EU and Tunisia\r\nin the framework of a privileged partnership will take the following forms:\n(a) Deeper political cooperation. The parties hope to give a fresh impetus to political dialogue and\r\ncooperation. In particular, it will involve greater high-level political\r\ndialogue, parliamentary cooperation, cooperation on security issues,\r\ncooperation on democracy and the rule of law, including gender equality, human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, and greater cooperation with the Council of\r\nEurope and other international organisations. It also includes enhanced\r\ncooperation on security, justice, border management and the fight against\r\norganised crime.\n(b) Greater social and economic\r\nintegration with the European Union in order to build a Common Economic Area. The privileged partnership is also designed to achieve a deeper\r\neconomic, social and human integration of the partners. It reflects the\r\nchallenges faced by Tunisia in the transition to democracy, including economic\r\nrecovery and the imperatives of solidarity and sustainable development. With an\r\neye to the development of trade and economic links, it is planned to conclude a\r\ndeep and comprehensive free trade agreement (DCFTA) between Tunisia and the\r\nEuropean Union that will contribute to Tunisia's gradual integration into the\r\nEU's internal market EU and the eventual establishment of a Common Economic\r\nArea.\nTunisia wants to work towards greater\r\nregulatory harmonisation through a gradual approximation of legislation. In\r\naccordance with this Action Plan, Tunisia and the EU will jointly determine\r\nwhich sectors will have priority for approximation. Having identified the\r\ndiscrepancies between Tunisian legislation and the acquis communautaire,\r\nTunisia will set out the approximation objectives in relation to the acquis\r\ncommunautaire in a national harmonisation programme, while the EU will\r\nprovide accompanying measures to support the achievement of these objectives.\nThis integration will be underpinned by an\r\nenhanced dialogue on the socio-economic reforms that will embrace economic\r\nperformance, the promotion of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the\r\ndevelopment of an integrated employment strategy and social inclusion, together\r\nwith extensive sectoral cooperation covering key areas such as energy,\r\ntransport, industry, agriculture, the environment and climate change (see Annex\r\n2).\n(c) A closer partnership between\r\npeoples. A privileged partnership is unimaginable\r\nwithout the strengthening of ties between peoples through closer links and\r\ndirect cooperation between individuals and organisations. In this context\r\ncooperation and exchanges in the areas of education, vocational training,\r\nemployment, research and innovation, health, culture and youth play a key\r\nrole. The dialogue will also cover migration, mobility and security with\r\nthe aim of concluding a mobility partnership establishing a framework\r\nfor balanced and responsible cooperation on the movement of people, management\r\nof legal migration, the links between migration and development, protection of\r\nmigrants' rights and efforts to stop illegal migration, immigration-related\r\norganised crime and readmission.\nSimilarly, the strengthening of relations\r\nbetween the EU and Tunisia involves a broad mobilisation of all non-state\r\nactors and members of civil society, who have an important role to play in\r\nmaking democratisation a success. Consultation\r\nmechanisms will be established in order to ensure that civil society fully\r\nassumes its role as interlocutor in the dialogue with the authorities and the\r\nEuropean institutions, in particular in terms of finalising and implementing\r\nthis Action Plan.\nA new method\nThe qualitative leap that the EU and\r\nTunisia propose to make in their relations will be based on a number of\r\nprinciples and tools that will help ensure that the objectives are achieved\nSpecific, clear targeted commitments\r\nover a period of 5 years. Deeper relations imply\r\nthat the partners enter into major commitments in a few priority sectors in\r\norder to meet the challenges of the democratic transition: economic recovery,\r\npromotion of SMEs and sustainable and inclusive development, employment,\r\nimproved living conditions and less inequality; the consolidation of the rule\r\nof law, good governance and democratic pluralism, independence of the\r\njudiciary, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, gender equality,\r\nreform of the security sector, independence of the media and support for civil\r\nsociety. The privileged partnership should also help bring our societies\r\ntogether in the broadest sense, through an expanded intercultural dialogue.\nParticipation in EU agencies and\r\nprogrammes. Another tool contributing to the goal\r\nof greater integration between Tunisia and the EU is Tunisia's participation in\r\na number of EU agencies and programmes with a legal basis providing for\r\nthe participation of non-member countries. The Action Plan sets out the\r\npractical steps to take here.\nMore ambitious technical and financial\r\nsupport, tailored to Tunisia\u2019s priorities and in\r\nline with the new guidelines of the European Neighbourhood Policy, that will\r\nsupport the implementation of the objectives of the Association Agreement in\r\nthe framework of the EU's post-2014 financial perspectives. The privileged\r\npartnership raises the expectation that the EU will provide an appropriate\r\nlevel of financial assistance to Tunisia matching the scale of the reforms, its\r\nspecific needs, its capacity and progress in implementing reforms.\nThe EU has already\r\nconfirmed its decision to increase significantly its support for Tunisia,\r\npledging at least \u20ac400 million for the period 2011-2013 (compared with the\r\n\u20ac240 million which had been set aside before the revolution). The funds set aside will be used primarily to accompany the reforms\r\nnecessary to establish a democratic state (support for the organisation of\r\nelections, reform of the security sector, the judiciary and the media, and\r\nassistance with the process of transitional justice and the upholding of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms) and to pursue economic recovery and strengthen\r\nsocial cohesion (economic reforms, promotion of employment and regional\r\ndevelopment, and efforts to reduce social exclusion, inequality and poverty,\r\ninstitutional capacity-building, etc.).\nIn addition, some Member States, the\r\nEuropean Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction\r\nand Development (EBRD) will provide substantial support, in particular for\r\ninvestment, infrastructure, private-sector support and employment, inter\r\nalia via their G8 commitments (Deauville Partnership). The programming of\r\nthis support in line with the relevant procedures will take into account\r\ncommitments made under the Action Plan and any other relevant instrument,\r\nincluding the findings of the EU\u2011Tunisia Task Force of 28 and\r\n29 September 2011.\nFlexibility and interim evaluation. The five-year Action Plan may be reviewed by the Association Council\r\nin the light of progress in implementation or of any new requirements arising\r\nfrom circumstances in Tunisia or the European Union. The bodies set up under\r\nthe Association Agreement will make appropriate proposals.\nMonitoring implementation of the Action\r\nPlan. The introduction of reforms in several key\r\nsectors will require the setting of clear targets and the availability of\r\nadequate resources. To ensure the best possible implementation and link the\r\nobjectives and progress made in achieving these objectives with the aid\r\nprovided, there will be regular monitoring by the Association Committee and the\r\nsubcommittees established under the Association Agreement and through each\r\nparty's progress reports.\nThe two parties will review the\r\nsubcommittees with a view to adjusting their membership and responsibilities to\r\nthe new ambitions of the privileged status.\nII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ACTION PLAN\nWishing to give this Action Plan a\r\ncharacter that is both strategic and operational, the parties agree to focus\r\ntheir cooperation on a limited number of areas and objectives, as summarised in\r\nthe table in Annex 1.\nIn addition, the achievement of the Action\r\nPlan's objectives will call for an enhanced dialogue on the socio-economic\r\nreforms, including employment policy, social inclusion and strategies to revive\r\nthe economy with a view to sustainable, knowledge-based growth, and\r\nwide-ranging sectoral cooperation covering key areas such as energy, transport,\r\nindustry, agriculture, tourism, skills development, the environment and climate\r\nchange\nThis is the reference document for\r\nimplementation of the Association Agreement (AA). It covers all the areas\r\ncovered by the AA and provides a framework for the overall cooperation between\r\nTunisia and the EU, including the work of the Association Committee and\r\nsubcommittees. The subcommittees have the task of formulating, on the basis of\r\nthe priorities identified in the Action Plan, the specific actions needed to\r\npursue these goals.\nIn the period ahead, the parties will focus\r\ntheir priorities on the following areas:\nRule of law and democracy\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Establishing a democratic\r\nelectoral system, in particular by consolidating the independence and\r\nfunctioning of the independent electoral commission responsible for the\r\nmanagement and organisation of

The DCFTA, which will be an integral part of\r\nthe AA, will thus cover a large number of areas of common interest (non\r\nexhaustive list: the focus will be on priority sectors chosen by the two parties\r\nin the framework of legislative approximation):\n\u00b7                        \r\nfurther liberalisation to improve market access\r\nfor agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fishery products\r\nand industrial products, taking into account the circumstances of both parties;\n\u00b7                        \r\ntechnical regulations for industrial products,\r\nstandards, conformity assessment and market surveillance;\n\u00b7                        \r\nsanitary and phytosanitary measures;\n\u00b7                        \r\nliberalisation of trade in services and\r\ninvestment protection; \n\u00b7                        \r\npublic procurement;\n\u00b7                        \r\ncompetition policy;\n\u00b7                        \r\ncapital movements and payments;\n\u00b7                        \r\nprotection of intellectual property rights,\r\nincluding the protection of Tunisian and European geographical indications;\n\u00b7                        \r\ncustoms;\n\u00b7                        \r\ntrade facilitation;\n\u00b7                        \r\ndialogue on trade defence instruments;\n\u00b7                        \r\ntrade and sustainable development.\nIn negotiating the DCFTA the parties will\r\ntake into account the sensitivity of certain sectors and provision will be made\r\nfor asymmetrical commitments appropriate to the development differential\r\nbetween the two parties. The DCFTA should also\r\nidentify the priorities for regulatory approximation with the acquis\r\ncommunautaire on the basis of mutual interests; a dynamic approach should\r\nbe adopted to allow for additional regulatory approximation at a later date and\r\ngradual implementation.\nUnder the DCFTA the two parties will thus\r\naim to achieve the following.\n3.1 Better access to markets for goods
