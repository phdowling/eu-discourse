Article 2 of the EIF Statutes commits the EIF to support EU\r\npolicy objectives. The current activities of the EIF cover on the one hand\r\ninvestments in venture capital and lower mid-market funds as well as mezzanine\r\nfunds to improve the availability of risk capital for high-growth and\r\ninnovative SMEs. On the other hand, it provides guarantees and credit\r\nenhancement through securitisation to improve the lending capacity of financial\r\nintermediaries and thus the availability and terms of debt for beneficiary\r\nSMEs. The EIF operates using either its own funds or by managing mandates[1] on behalf of the EIB,\r\nthe Commission or national and regional governments. \nThe EIF's statutory goal to support EU\r\npolicies has been reflected in the exceptional growth of both equity\r\ninvestments and guarantees during the recent crisis. It is expected that this\r\neffort will result in a total of EUR 1.5bn of commitments in private equity\r\nfunds leveraging EUR 6.4bn in 2013. In terms of guarantees, the EIF expects to\r\ncommit in 2013 EUR 1.9bn, catalysing EUR 7.5bn in loans to SMEs[2].\nFollowing the capital increase of the EIF\r\nin 2007, the subscribed capital amounts to EUR 3 billion divided into 3\r\n000 shares each with a nominal value of EUR 1 million. The paid-in capital of\r\nthe EIF is currently EUR 600 million (i.e. 20 % of subscribed capital). As of\r\nOctober 2013, the EIF is owned by the EIB (62.1 %), the European Union (30 %)\r\nand 24 public and private financial institutions (7.9 %). \nThe European Council of June 2012 requested\r\nto develop the action of the EIF, particularly as regards its venture capital\r\nactivity, in liaison with existing national structures. In June 2013, the\r\nEuropean Council called for an increase in the credit enhancement capacity of\r\nthe EIF. The call was made in the context of the \"New Investment Plan for\r\nEurope\", which places particular emphasis on SME finance, a core activity\r\nof the EIF. In October, the European Council requested all efforts to continue to\r\nrestore normal lending to the economy and facilitate financing of investment,\r\nparticularly with respect to SMEs.\nIn response to the conclusions of the European\r\nCouncil, the EIF has identified a number of financing solutions for further supporting\r\nSMEs and for ensuring the highest impact of its funds. Two principal delivery\r\nchannels are proposed for their implementation:\n\u00b7                        \r\nFacilitating the supply of debt finance to SMEs\r\nthrough credit enhancement operations, including the SME Initiative; and \n\u00b7                        \r\nCreating additional investment capacity for\r\nprivate equity, mezzanine and venture and growth capital. \nEIF own resources will be key to support\r\nthese activities as well as to ensure alignment of interest with other\r\nmandates, including EU mandates such as Horizon 2020 and COSME, through\r\nco-investment. \nAs a result of these initiatives, the EIF\r\nis expected to double its overall guarantee and venture capital exposure over the\r\ncoming years. Each of EIF's business lines involves different risks, which are\r\nreflected by a certain level of economic capital allocation needing to be set\r\naside. For risk management considerations, the sum of the capital allocation\r\nshould not exceed EIF own funds. Given the growth plans described above, the\r\ncurrent buffer is expected to decrease rapidly. As a consequence, an increase\r\nin EIF's available capital is required in order to meet statutory capital\r\nrequirements and to maintain its AAA credit rating, which is crucial for the\r\nEIF credit enhancement activity. \nInitially, the EIF had presented two\r\nalternatives for enhancing its capacity: \n\u00b7                        \r\nScenario 1: Increase of paid-in portion from 20%\r\nto 40%\n\u00b7                        \r\nScenario 2: Increase of subscribed capital with\r\npaid-in portion of 20%\nWhereas under scenario 1, all existing\r\nshareholders would be obliged to participate or sell their shares in the EIF as\r\ndiffering paid-in ratios per share would not be possible, scenario 2 leaves the\r\nchoice to existing shareholders whether to subscribe or\r\nnot to new shares, proportionally to their current stake in EIF's capital. \nIn September 2013, the options for the\r\nincrease in the EIF's capital were informally discussed by EIF management with all\r\nEIF financial institution shareholders who provided positive feedback on the\r\ncapital increase as such. However, the notion that shareholders would be\r\nobliged to participate or lose their entire shareholding was not considered\r\nacceptable. In addition, there was a broad consensus about the importance of maintaining the EIF's tripartite ownership\r\nstructure. EIF thus retained only scenario 2 in its\r\nfinal proposal.\nOn 26 November 2013, the EIF Board of\r\nDirectors approved, as to its rationale, the increase in the EIF subscribed\r\ncapital by up to EUR 1,500 million, of which 20 % will be paid-in. This would imply the subscription\r\nof 450 additional shares by the EU. The technical modalities and process will\r\nbe submitted to the Board of Directors in due course. In line with the Statutes\r\nof the EIF, a capital increase has to be approved by the General Meeting of the EIF where the Commission\r\nhas a blocking minority for this decision.[3]\r\n\nIn December 2013, the EIB Board of\r\nDirectors approved the EIF capital increase and authorised the submission to\r\nthe EIB Board of Governors.\nThe December European Council also called\r\non the Commission and the EIB to further enhance the capacity of the EIF\r\nthrough an increase in its capital with a view to reaching final agreement by\r\nMay 2014.\nThe capital increase should be complemented\r\nby a new EIB Risk Enhancement Mandate (EREM), amounting to up to EUR 2.3 billion\r\nfor the period 2014-2016. Thanks to (i) the increased capacity created by the\r\ncapital increase and (ii) the new EIB's mandate, the EIF expects to deploy\r\nannually between EUR 2 billion and EUR 3 billion for credit enhancement\r\ntransactions (catalysing between EUR 11 billion and EUR 20 billion of SME\r\nlending per annum) starting in 2014 and reaching a peak in 2015. Moreover, additional private equity commitments of EUR 400 million will be\r\ndeployed.\nIn the context of the capital increase, a\r\nreinforcement of the current public-private shareholding structure will be\r\nsought through a full participation from the financial institution shareholders.\r\nIt is also an opportunity for broadening the EIF shareholder base by\r\nattracting more like-minded, national/regional promotional institutions, in\r\nline with the Commission sponsored external evaluation and the spirit of June\r\n2012 European Council conclusions.\nConsidering the need to respond to the\r\nconclusions of the European Council in a timely manner and given the urgency to\r\nsupport the EU policy goals in the field of growth and job creation in the\r\npost-crisis environment, the capacity created by EIF's capital increase is sought to be enhanced\r\nalready in 2014. A conclusion of the ordinary legislative procedure would be necessary to\r\nenable the EU to support the capital increase in the EIF's General Meeting in\r\nspring 2014. Otherwise, a delay to\r\n2015 would occur.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nAs required by Council Decision 2007/247/EC[4] approving the EU\r\nparticipation in the previous capital increase of the EIF, the Commission\r\ncarried out in 2012 an external evaluation of the EIF own resources activity. This\r\nevaluation took into account the views of various stakeholders, ranging from\r\nrepresentatives from Member States, the EIB, the financial institutions to the\r\nCommission. Furthermore, the evaluators consulted financial institutions\r\nshareholders, private equity/venture capital fund managers who had received\r\ninvestment from EIF\u2019s own resources, originators of securitisation transactions\r\nwith EIF involvement as well as representatives of relevant industry bodies. This\r\nevaluation confirmed the added value of the EU shareholding on the following\r\ngrounds:\n\u00b7      Through the EU shareholding, the European Commission is represented\r\nin the General Meeting of the EIF and in the EIF\u2019s Board of Directors (with two\r\nout of seven members) which gives the EU significant influence over the setting\r\nof the EIF's strategic and operational objectives. This helps to promote and\r\nanchor key EU policy objectives in the EIF's operations;\n\u00b7      The EU shareholding creates a framework for the promotion of EU\r\npolicies in a working relationship with the EIB and other financial public and private shareholders. The joint Board activity with other shareholders, and\r\nthe EIB in particular, supports greater organisational understanding and\r\nstronger working relationships between key stakeholders in the SME financing\r\nlandscape; \n\u00b7      Credit rating stability: The joint shareholding partnership of the\r\nEIB and the EU in the EIF has provided the underpinning for the AAA/Aaa rating\r\nof the EIF. A strong credit rating is crucial for EIF's financing instruments\r\nto be effective.\nWhile EIF own resources activity generates\r\nconsiderable added value in the financial markets, reflecting the EIF\u2019s market\r\norientated approach to delivery of policy impacts, the evaluation also\r\nidentified a number of areas in which the policy impact of EIF own resources\r\nactivity could be enhanced. Following the conclusions of the evaluation, the\r\nCommission has prepared a follow-up action plan which was presented to the\r\nCouncil and the Parliament in November 2012 and is currently being implemented.\r\nThe main conclusions of the evaluation and the appropriate actions taken as\r\nrequested by the Commission are the following:\n\u00b7        \r\nThere is a need to reinforce the clarity of EU\r\npolicy objectives to be achieved by the EIF. In this context, the desired\r\nbalance of financial and policy returns as well as the desired level of\r\ndividend distribution should be reviewed. At the Commission's request, the EIF\r\nhas prepared a report to the Board on the value added framework of the EIF as\r\nwell as a review of the ex-post impact assessment which were finalized in April\r\n2013. As a consequence, an ex-post impact assessment report will be introduced\r\ncollecting data on the real impact of individual transactions on SMEs.\r\nFurthermore, the Commission requested a reassessment of the EIF's dividend\r\npolicy. In 2013, a decision was taken by the Annual General Meeting of the EIF\r\nto depart from the standard 40% dividend pay-out ratio (from the net profit)\r\nand to distribute 20% of the net profit as dividends. The decision will be\r\nreviewed again in the 2014 Annual General Meeting. \n\u00b7        \r\nGiven the distinctive and demonstrable value of\r\neach shareholder group in contributing to the full added value of the EIF,\r\nefforts should be made to fully maintain the tripartite structure of the EIF.\r\nThe shareholding by financial institutions should at a minimum be maintained\r\nand, ideally, expanded. In response to this conclusion, the Commission requested the EIF management to make an effort in\r\norder to engage more like-minded institutions as new financial institution\r\nshareholders. The management of the EIF has also been\r\nasked to report regularly to the Board about the activities undertaken by the\r\nEIF to attract new financial institution shareholders. \n\u00b7        \r\nDue to the limited added value of systematic\r\nco-investment only with the Risk Capital Mandate awarded to the EIF by the EIB,\r\nthe EIF will be requested to regularly co-invest with other\r\nmandates, including EU mandates like Horizon 2020 and COSME, to ensure better alignment\r\nof interest between the Commission and the EIF.\nGiven the availability of a recent external\r\nevaluation and in accordance with the proportionality principle and past\r\npractice, the Commission proposes not to develop a formal impact assessment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nCouncil Decision 94/375/EC of 6 June 1994\r\non Community membership of the European Investment Fund[5] contains a specific\r\nprovision on capital increases in Article 3. However, this provision is deemed\r\nexcluded as legal basis for a new decision on an EIF capital increase in view\r\nof the development of the case-law of the European Court of Justice regarding\r\nso-called \"secondary legal bases\". Instead, a legal base in primary\r\nlaw should be proposed. \nIn light of the objectives and activities\r\nof the EIF, as set out in its Statutes and decisions taken by its governing\r\nbodies in accordance with the Statutes, and in light of the primary aim pursued\r\nwith the capital increase, which is to\n\u2013                        \r\nrespond to the call of the European Council to\r\nincrease the credit enhancement capacity of the EIF, in particular in favour of\r\nSMEs, and\n\u2013                        \r\ncreate additional capacity for equity investment\r\nin support of SMEs and innovation research and technological development of\r\nundertakings in the Member States, \nthus promoting action in support of the\r\nUnion's industry, Article 173(3) TFEU is considered as the appropriate legal\r\nbasis for the proposed capital increase.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nConsidering the proposed increase in\r\nsubscribed capital by up to EUR 1.5 billion, the Commission will need to\r\npurchase up to 450 new shares.\nThe table below\r\nsummarises how the EU share in EIF's capital will evolve following the proposed\r\ncapital increase. It shows the capital of the EIF subscribed by the EU divided\r\ninto the paid-in and callable part before and following the current capital\r\nincrease.\nEU share in EIF's capital (EUR million)\n Paid-in capital || Callable capital || Total subscribed capital after increase \n Existing (before 2014) || Proposed increase || Total || Existing (before 2014) || Proposed increase || Total \n 180 || 90 || 270 || 720 || 360 || 1,080 || 1,350 \nThe EU subscription to the new shares in\r\nthe EIF would be made over a four year period starting in 2014. The resources\r\nneeded for the purchase of 450 shares are estimated at approx. EUR 175 million.\r\nThis estimate is based on EIF's projections for the development of EIF's share\r\nprice during the subscription period 2014-2017. The share issue price will be\r\nbased on an agreed formula, the Repurchase Share Price Undertaking (RSPU). It\r\nincludes the paid-in part of the equity as well as various reserves (e.g.\r\nstatutory reserve, retained earnings) and the profit of the financial year,\r\nminus the dividends paid out. The changes in the reserves are difficult to\r\nestimate given that one of the reserves reflects changes in market valuations\r\nof private equity investments made by the EIF and value changes related to\r\nEIF's treasury. The actual share price in each subscription period will be\r\nbased on the audited financial statements of the previous year. \nThe Commission proposes that the dividends\r\nwhich will be paid by the EIF during the years 2014-2017 will be used to cover\r\npart of the cost of the new shares. Assuming the 2013 level of the dividend\r\npay-out ratio of 20 % to remain constant for the next four years, the dividends\r\nto be received during this period are estimated at around EUR 11.5 million.\r\nHowever, it needs to be stressed that the EIF uses a dividend pay-out ratio of\r\n33% as a working assumption for their calculations in the document proposing\r\nEIF's capital increase to its Board of Directors. If this level of dividends\r\nwas assumed, the purchase of 450 shares would require approx. EUR 172 million\r\nand the estimated dividends received during 2014-2017 would reach approx. EUR\r\n19 million. The dividends are decided annually by the General Meeting of the\r\nEIF.\nConsequently, at this stage both the share\r\nissue price and the level of dividends cannot be calculated exactly for the\r\nwhole period of subscription. In any case, the price to be paid by the EU for\r\nits part of the increase is not expected to exceed the sum of indicative budget\r\nappropriation for EUR 170 million plus the dividends received during 2014-2017.\r\n\u00a0The Commission proposes to make use of appropriations already programmed for\r\nfinancial instruments under COSME and Horizon 2020 programmes to enhance access\r\nto financing for SMEs. \nLike the EIF, the COSME Regulation pursues the\r\ngoal of improving access to finance, particularly for SMEs, promoting\r\nentrepreneurship and entrepreneurial culture. In the Horizon 2020 Regulation,\r\nfinancial instruments are referred to as the main source of funding for\r\nactivities close to market that are supported under the programme and EIF will\r\nplay an important role in the implementation of such financial instruments.\r\nTherefore, it is proposed to use part of the appropriations available for COSME\r\nand Horizon 2020 for the proposed EIF capital increase. The necessary\r\nadjustment to the 2014 budget will be proposed separately in a draft amending budget.\r\n\n\u00a0\n2014/0034 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the participation of the European Union\r\nin the capital increase of the European Investment Fund\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 173(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee, \nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Council\r\nDecision 94/375/EC of 6 June 1994 on Community membership of the European\r\nInvestment Fund[6],\r\nthe European Investment Fund (the Fund) was founded in 1994 to \"stimulate\r\nsustained and balanced growth within the Community\". \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following an increase of\r\nthe Fund's subscribed capital in 2007, the authorised capital of the Fund is\r\nEUR 3 billion, divided into 3 000 shares of EUR 1 million each with a ratio of\r\n20 % paid-in. The Union, represented by the Commission, participated in the\r\nprevious increase of the Fund's subscribed capital in accordance with Council\r\nDecision 2007/247/EC of 19 April 2007 on the Community participation in the\r\ncapital increase of the European Investment Fund[7].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, the Union,\r\nrepresented by the Commission, is currently subscribed to in total 900 shares\r\nof the Fund for a nominal value of EUR 900 million, of which EUR 180 million\r\nare paid-in. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Council of 28-29\r\nJune 2012 adopted the \"Compact for Growth and Jobs\" to stimulate\r\nsmart, sustainable, inclusive, resource efficient and job-creating growth. In\r\nthis context, the European Council in its conclusions emphasized, among the\r\nfurther urgent actions needed at Union level to boost growth and jobs, enhance\r\nthe financing of the economy and make Europe more competitive as a location for\r\nproduction and investment, that the action of the Fund should be developed,\r\nparticularly as regards its venture activity, in liaison with existing national\r\nstructures such as national promotional banks and institutions.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to further\r\npromote investment and access to credit, the European Council of 28-29 June\r\n2013 launched a \"New Investment Plan for Europe\" to support small and\r\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and boost the financing of the economy. In this\r\ncontext, the European Council in its conclusions asked the Commission and the\r\nEIB to implement an increase in Fund's credit enhancement capacity as a matter\r\nof priority.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recalling that restoring\r\nnormal lending to the economy, in particular to SMEs, remains a priority, the European\r\nCouncil of December 2013 called on the Commission and the EIB to further\r\nenhance the capacity of the Fund through an increase in its capital with a view\r\nto reaching final agreement by May 2014.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current size of Fund's\r\nown funds does not allow for a substantial increase in the Fund's activity, in\r\nresponse to the call of the European Council, as the guarantee and venture\r\ncapital operations of the Fund may not exceed the ceilings set by Article 26 of\r\nthe Statutes of the Fund or by the General Meeting of the Fund. Furthermore,\r\nthe credit enhancement capacity of the Fund is limited by the size of its\r\navailable own funds.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Fund's Board of\r\nDirectors has therefore on 26 November 2013 given its approval as to its\r\nrationale the increase in the Fund's subscribed capital by up to EUR 1,500\r\nmillion, allowing for the necessary increase of the own funds. The technical\r\nmodalities and detailed procedure for the increase will be submitted to the\r\nBoard of Directors in due course requesting authorisation to submit a proposal to\r\nthe 2014 General Meeting of the Fund for approval.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New shares should be\r\nsubscribed by the Fund\u2019s shareholders at their discretion over a four-year\r\nperiod, starting in 2014 and ending in 2017. The price of the new shares should\r\nbe set annually and be based on the net asset value formula agreed between the\r\nFund's shareholders.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The annual dividends to be\r\nreceived during the years 2014 to 2017 for the participation of the Union in\r\nthe Fund should be considered as external assigned revenue and be used to cover\r\npart of the cost of the capital increase. This should increase the amount of\r\nbudgetary funds available for the capital increase, thus supporting the\r\nobjective of maintaining the relative shareholding of the Union in the Fund at its\r\ncurrent level (30 %).\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate for the\r\nUnion to participate in the capital increase of the Fund in order to achieve\r\nthe Union's objectives of encouraging an environment favourable to initiative and\r\nto the development of undertakings throughout the Union, particularly SMEs, and\r\nof fostering better exploitation of the industrial potential of its policies of\r\ninnovation, research and technological development, as articulated in the\r\nconclusions of the European Council of June 2012, June 2013 and December 2013\r\nand detailed in the \"Compact for Growth and Jobs\" and \"New\r\nInvestment Plan for Europe\". \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow the Union\r\nrepresentative in the EIF General Meeting to vote on the capital increase as\r\nsoon as possible, the Decision should enter into force on the day following\r\nthat of its publication.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nIn addition to its current shareholding in\r\nthe European Investment Fund (the Fund), the Union shall subscribe for up to\r\n450 shares each of a nominal value of EUR 1 million in the Fund.

Finally,\r\nthe participation in the current capital increase will ensure that the EU share\r\nin the capital of the EIF remains at least constant and is not diluted.\nCredit enhancement and guarantee operations\nOver the next programming period, the EIF is\r\nexpected to significantly increase its credit enhancement activity, deploying\r\nannually between EUR 2.0 billion and 3.0 billion (to catalyse annually between\r\nEUR 11 billion to EUR 20 billion of SME lending) with a specific effort in 2015\r\nand 2016. This additional credit enhancement activity requires an increase of\r\nEIF's own resources by EUR 400 million, complemented by an EIB mandate of up to EUR 2.3 billion for the\r\nyears 2014-2016 The increase in activity should result in an increase of 50% in\r\nthe number of SMEs covered by credit enhancement and guarantee operations by\r\nthe EIF.\nPrivate Equity operations\nThe additional capital will enhance EIF's focus\r\non critical gaps in the seed, venture and growth capital markets. These key\r\ninitiatives will provide support both to reasearch, development and innovation\r\npolicy and to jobs, growth and social cohesion policy. In total, the additional\r\ncommitments of EUR 400 million will need to be backed up by EUR 150-200 million\r\nof additional EIF own funds. The increase in activity\r\nshould result in an increase of 50% in the number of SMEs benefitting from\r\nprivate equity operations by the EIF.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\r\nimpact \nThe attainment of objectives will be measured\r\nby the number of credit enhancement transactions, by the catalytic effect\r\nachieved, by the volume of debt made available to SMEs, the number of SMEs\r\nassisted as well as the geographical diversification. The results will be\r\nmeasured by the increase in the number of SMEs covered by credit enhancement\r\nand guarantee operations by the EIF.\nWith regard to venture capital operations, the\r\nimpact will be measured by the number of transactions, the number of companies\r\nsupported, the leverage (i.e. total amount co-invested) as well as the\r\ncatalytic effect (i.e. co-invested amount directly attributable to EIF), the\r\nvolume of disbursements to final beneficiaries as well as well as the\r\ngeographical diversification. The results will be measured by the increase in\r\nthe number of SMEs benefitting from private equity operations by the EIF.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term\nThe EIF uses its own resources as capital\r\nallocation for its guarantee operations and as equity payments for its venture\r\ncapital investments. The current size of EIF's own funds limits the EIF's\r\nability to significantly increase the venture capital activity and the credit\r\nenhancement activity requested by the European Councils of June 2012, June 2013\r\nand December 2013. \n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added\r\nvalue of EU involvement \nThe additional capacity created by the EIF\r\ncapital increase will enable the EIB Group to leverage an estimated additional\r\nEUR 45 billion in new loans and leases in the next 7 years. The capital increase\r\nwould also enhance the EIF's potential for co-operation with its shareholders\r\n(the Commission, the EIB and the financial institutions) and third parties in\r\nthe implementation of credit enhancement operations. \nThe additional investment capacity of the EIF\r\nwill also be used for the European venture capital market, particularly in the\r\narea of start-up and seed finance. This will enhance EIF's contribution to the\r\npursuit of the EU 2020 goal of smart, sustainable and job-creating growth, in\r\nparticular to implementation of the following flagship initiatives addressing\r\nSME access to finance:\n\u00b7      \"Innovation Union\";\n\u00b7      \"An industrial policy for the globalisation era\";\n\u00b7      \"An action plan to improve access to finance for SMEs\".\nFinally, the proposed capital increase would also\r\nbe an opportunity to bolster the role of financial institutions in the EIF by\r\nincreasing their shareholdings. \n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nCouncil Decision 2007/247/EC called for an\r\nevaluation of the Fund\u2019s own resources activity by 31 July 2012. This\r\nevaluation demonstrated the added value of EIF own resources activity in\r\ndelivering European SME finance activity (risk capital and debt finance)\r\nincluding investment volumes achieved, development of innovative financial instruments,\r\nand the building of investment infrastructure and ecosystems based upon\r\npartnership and shared knowledge. As set out in the Explanatory Memorandum\r\n(section 2. Results of Consultation with Interested Parties and Impact\r\nAssessments), the evaluation concluded that a strong and valid case remains for\r\nan EU shareholding in the EIF.\nNotwithstanding the observed added value, the\r\nevaluation identified a number of areas in which the policy impact of EIF own\r\nresources activity could be further enhanced. In response to the conclusions of\r\nthe evaluation, the Commission has prepared a follow-up action plan in order to\r\nfurther improve the value added of the EU shareholding in the EIF. The action\r\nplan was presented to the Council and the Parliament in November 2012 and is\r\ncurrently being implemented.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments \nThe Commission systematically promotes close\r\ncooperation and joint initiatives of the EIB Group. These efficient actions are\r\nincreasingly necessary to sustain recovery in a fragile economic environment.\nFurthermore, EIF's own resources complement the\r\nEU and EIB mandates (such as the financial instruments under COSME and Horizon\r\n2020 and the EIB Risk Capital Resources Mandate). EIF's own resources will be\r\nrequired to leverage EU funds,. \n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \r\nx Financial impact from 2014 to 2017 \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from [YYYY\r\nto YYYY],\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) planned[11] \nFrom the 2014 budget\nX Direct management by the\r\nCommission\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting rules\r\n\nThe EIF's Annual Report and the Annual Activity\r\nReport of the Audit Board will continue to be submitted to the Council and the\r\nEuropean Parliament as foreseen in Council Decision 2007/247/EC. \nThe Board of Directors assesses the vast\r\nmajority of EIF's individual operations and monitors the venture capital and\r\nguarantee portfolios.
