Penalties for infringements\u2013Compromise procedure:\nThe penalty for the infringement shall be\r\nset by S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe according to the provisions of current national\r\nlegislation.\nWhere settling the infringement involves\r\nlegal proceedings, before these are launched, and provided that the\r\ninfringement does not involve a criminal act, a compromise procedure shall be\r\nundertaken between S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and the European Union in order to\r\ndetermine the terms and level of the penalty. A representative of the flag\r\nState of the vessel and of the European Union may participate in that\r\ncompromise procedure. The compromise procedure shall finish at the latest three\r\ndays after notification of the vessel's detention.\n4. Legal proceedings \u2013 Bank security\nIf the compromise procedure fails and the\r\ninfringement is brought before the competent court, the owner of the vessel\r\nwhich committed the infringement shall deposit a bank security at a bank\r\ndesignated by S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, the amount of which, as set by S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9\r\nand Pr\u00edncipe, shall cover the costs linked to the detention of the vessel, the\r\nestimated fine and any compensation. The bank security may not be recovered\r\nuntil the legal proceedings have been concluded.\nThe bank security shall be released and returned to the vessel owner\r\nwithout delay after the judgment has been delivered:\na) in full, if no penalty has been imposed;\nb) for the amount of the remaining balance,\r\nif the penalty is a fine which is lower than the amount of the bank security.\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe shall inform the European\r\nUnion of the outcome of the legal proceedings within seven days of the judgment\r\nbeing delivered.\n5. Release of the vessel and the crew:\nThe vessel and its crew shall be authorised\r\nto leave the port once the penalty has been paid in a compromise procedure, or\r\nonce the bank security has been deposited.\nAppendices\n1 \u2013 Fishing authorisation application form\n2 \u2013 Catch declaration form\n3\u2013 Coordinates of the zone in which fishing\r\nis prohibited\n4\u2013 Format of VMS position message\n5\u2013 Guidelines for managing and implementing\r\nthe electronic reporting system for fishing activities (ERS)\nAppendix 1\nS\u00c3O TOM\u00c9 AND\r\nPR\u00cdNCIPE - EUROPEAN UNION FISHERIES AGREEMENT\nFISHING\r\nAUTHORISATION APPLICATION FORM\nI\r\n- APPLICANT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Name of vessel owner:\r\n............................................................................................................................\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Address of vessel owner:\r\n........................................................................................................................\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Name of vessel owner\u2019s association or agent:\r\n.....................................................................\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Address of vessel owner\u2019s association or agent: ................................................................\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Telephone: .................\u00a0\u00a0 Fax:\r\n...................................

electronic reporting system for fishing activities (ERS)\nGeneral provisions\n(1)              \r\nAll EU fishing vessels must be equipped with an\r\nelectronic system, hereinafter referred to as \u2018ERS system\u2019, capable of\r\nrecording and transmitting data relating to the vessel's fishing activity,\r\nhereinafter referred to as \u2018ERS data\u2019, whenever the vessel is operating in the\r\nwaters of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe.\n(2)              \r\nAn EU vessel that is not equipped with an ERS,\r\nor whose ERS is not working, is not authorised to enter S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an waters in\r\norder to engage in fishing activities.\n(3)              \r\nERS data shall be transmitted in accordance with\r\nthe procedures of the vessel\u2019s flag State, i.e. they shall firstly be sent to\r\nthe Fisheries Monitoring Centre (hereinafter: FMC) of the flag State which will\r\nmake them automatically available to the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC. \n(4)              \r\nThe flag State and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe shall\r\nensure that their FMCs have the necessary IT equipment and software to\r\nautomatically transmit ERS data in xml format, [available via\r\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/cfp/control/codes/index_en.htm] and shall have a backup\r\nprocedure in place capable of saving and storing ERS data in a format which\r\nwill be computer-readable for at least three years.  \n(5)              \r\nAny change or update to this format shall be\r\nidentified and dated and must be operational six (6) months after its\r\nintroduction.\n(6)              \r\nERS data must be transmitted using the\r\nelectronic means of communication operated by the European Commission on behalf\r\nof the EU, referred to as the DEH (Data Exchange Highway).\n(7)              \r\nThe flag State and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe shall\r\neach designate an ERS correspondent who will act as the point of contact. \n(a)              \r\nERS correspondents shall be designated for a\r\nminimum period of six (6) months.\n(b)              \r\nThe FMCs of the flag State and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and\r\nPr\u00edncipe shall notify one another of the contact details (name, address,\r\ntelephone number, fax, e-mail address) of their ERS correspondent, before the\r\nsupplier starts production of the ERS.\n(c)              \r\nAny changes to the contact details of the ERS\r\ncorrespondent must be notified immediately.\nProducing and communicating ERS\r\ndata\n(8)              \r\nEU fishing vessels must:\n(a)              \r\nCommunicate on a daily basis ERS data for each\r\nday spent in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an waters;\n(b)              \r\nrecord the quantity of each species caught and\r\nkept on board as target species or by-catch, or discarded, for each fishing\r\noperation;\n(c)              \r\ndeclare the bad catch of each species specified\r\nin the fishing authorisation issued by S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe;\n(d)             \r\nidentify each species by its FAO 3-alpha code;\n(e)              \r\nexpress quantities in kilograms of live weight\r\nor, where necessary, the number of individual fish;\n(f)               \r\nrecord, in the ERS data, the transhipped and/or\r\nunloaded quantity of each species; \n(g)              \r\nrecord in the ERS data, every time S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an\r\nwaters are entered (COE message) or exited (COX message), a specific message\r\ncontaining the quantities held on board at the time of passing for each species\r\nspecified in the fishing authorisation issued by S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe;\n(h)              \r\ntransmit ERS data on a daily basis to the FMC of\r\nthe flag State, according to the format referred to in paragraph 3 above, by\r\n23:59 UTC at the latest.\n(9)              \r\nThe master is responsible for the accuracy of\r\nthe ERS data recorded and sent. \n(10)          \r\nThe FMC of the flag State shall send the ERS\r\ndata automatically and without delay to the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC. \n(11)          \r\nThe FMC of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe shall confirm\r\nthat it has received the ERS data by means of a return message and shall handle\r\nall ERS data confidentially. \nFailure of the on-board ERS and/or\r\ntransmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State\n(12)          \r\nThe flag State shall immediately inform the\r\nmaster and/or owner of a vessel flying its flag, or their agent, of any\r\ntechnical failure of the ERS installed on board or any breakdown in\r\ntransmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State. \n(13)          \r\nThe flag State shall inform S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and\r\nPr\u00edncipe of the failure detected and the corrective measures taken. \n(14)          \r\nIn the event of a breakdown in the on-board ERS,\r\nthe master and/or owner shall ensure the ERS is repaired or replaced within ten days.\r\nIf the vessel makes a call at a port within those ten days, it may only\r\nresume fishing activity in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an waters once its ERS is in perfect working\r\norder, unless S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an authorities allow otherwise. \n(15)          \r\nFollowing a technical failure in its ERS, a\r\nfishing vessel may not leave port until:\n(a)              \r\nits ERS is in working order again, to the\r\nsatisfaction of the flag State and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, or\n(b)              \r\nit receives authorisation from the flag State.\r\nIn the latter case, the flag State shall inform S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe of its\r\ndecision before the vessel leaves. \n(16)          \r\nAny EU vessel operating in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an waters\r\nwith a faulty ERS must transmit all ERS data on a daily basis and by\r\n23:59 UTC at the latest to the FMC of the flag State by any other\r\navailable means of electronic communication accessible by the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC. \n(17)          \r\nERS data which could not be made available to\r\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe via the ERS owing to a failure shall be transmitted by\r\nthe FMC of the flag State to the FMC of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe by another\r\nmutually agreed form of electronic communication. This alternative transmission\r\nshall be considered a priority, it being understood that it will not be\r\npossible to comply with the transmission deadlines usually applicable.\n(18)          \r\nIf the FMC of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe does not\r\nreceive ERS data from a vessel for three consecutive days, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and\r\nPr\u00edncipe may instruct the vessel to immediately call at a port of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and\r\nPr\u00edncipe\u2019s choosing in order to investigate. \nFMC failure \u2013 ERS data not received\r\nby S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC\n(1)              \r\nIn the event that ERS data are not received by\r\nan FMC, its ERS correspondent shall immediately inform the ERS correspondent\r\nfor the other FMC, and if necessary they shall work together to resolve the\r\nproblem.\n(2)              \r\nBefore the ERS becomes operational, the FMC of\r\nthe flag State and the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC shall mutually agree on the alternative\r\nmeans of electronic communication to be used in order to transmit ERS data in\r\nthe event of an FMC failure, and shall immediately inform one another of any\r\nchanges.\n(3)              \r\nIf the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC reports that ERS data have\r\nnot been received, the FMC of the flag State shall identify the causes of the\r\nproblem and take appropriate measures in order to resolve the problem. The FMC\r\nof the flag State shall inform the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC and the EU of the outcome of\r\nthe measures taken within 24 hours of recognising the failure. \n(4)              \r\nIf more than 24 hours is required in order\r\nto resolve the problem, the FMC of the flag State shall immediately transmit\r\nthe missing ERS data to the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC via one of the alternative means of\r\nelectronic communication referred to in point 17.\n(5)              \r\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe shall inform its competent\r\nmonitoring services (MCS) so that EU vessels are not considered by the S\u00e3o\r\nTom\u00e9an FMC to be in breach of their obligations for not transmitting ERS data,\r\nowing to a failure in one of the FMCs.\nFMC maintenance\n(1)              \r\nPlanned maintenance of an FMC (maintenance\r\nprogramme) which may affect the exchange of ERS data must be notified at least\r\n72 hours in advance to the other FMC, indicating, where possible, the date\r\nand duration of the maintenance work. Information about unplanned maintenance\r\nwork shall be sent to the other FMC as soon as possible.\n(2)              \r\nDuring the maintenance work, the provision of\r\nERS data may be put on hold until the system is operational again. The relevant\r\nERS data shall be made available immediately after the maintenance work has\r\nbeen completed.\n(3)              \r\nIf the maintenance work takes more than\r\n24 hours, ERS data shall be sent to the other FMC using one of the\r\nalternative means of electronic communication referred to in point 17.\n(4)              \r\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe shall inform its competent\r\nmonitoring services (MCS) so that EU vessels are not considered by the S\u00e3o\r\nTom\u00e9an FMC to be in breach of their obligations for not transmitting ERS data,\r\nowing to the maintenance of an FMC.\nANNEXE\r\nII\r\nScope of the empowerment and procedure for establishing the Union position in\r\nthe Joint Committee\n(1)              \r\nThe Commission shall be authorised to negotiate\r\nwith the Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and, where appropriate\r\nand subject to complying with paragraph 3 of this Annex, agree on modifications\r\nto the Protocol in respect of the following issues:\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 review of fishing opportunities in accordance with Articles 5\r\nand 6 of the Protocol;\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 decision on the modalities of the sectoral support in\r\naccordance with Article 3 of the Protocol;\nc)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 technical specifications and modalities falling within the\r\npowers of the Joint Committee in accordance with the Annex to the Protocol.\n(2)              \r\nIn the Joint Committee set up under the\r\nFisheries Partnership Agreement, the Union shall:\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 act in accordance with the objectives pursued by the Union\r\nwithin the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy; \nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 be in line with the Council conclusions of 19 March 2012 on\r\na Communication on the External dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy;\nc)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 promote positions that are consistent with the relevant\r\nrules adopted by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations.\n(3)              \r\nWhen a decision on modifications to the Protocol\r\nreferred to in paragraph 1 is foreseen to be adopted during a Joint Committee meeting,\r\nthe necessary steps shall be taken so that the position to be expressed on\r\nbehalf of the Union takes account of the latest statistical, biological and\r\nother relevant information transmitted to the Commission \nTo this effect\r\nand based on that information, a preparatory document setting out the\r\nparticulars of the envisaged Union position shall be transmitted by the\r\nCommission services, in sufficient time before the relevant Joint Committee meeting,\r\nto the Council or to its preparatory bodies for consideration and approval.\nIn respect of issues referred to in paragraph 1(a), the approval of the\r\nenvisaged Union position by the Council shall require a qualified majority of\r\nvotes.
