The NAFO is a Regional\r\nFisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) responsible for the conservation and\r\nmanagement of fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. The European Union\r\nbecame a contracting party to NAFO in 1979.\nPursuant to Article 218(9) of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union, the position to be adopted on behalf of the Union in RFMOs such as\r\nwhen they are called upon to adopt acts having legal effects, with the\r\nexception of acts supplementing or amending their institutional framework, must\r\nbe adopted by Council Decision, on a proposal from the Commission.\nSuch position within the RFMO is currently\r\nestablished according to a two tier approach. A Council Decision sets out the\r\nguiding principles and orientations of the Union's position on a multiannual\r\nbasis, whereas it is thereafter adjusted for each annual meeting by Commission\r\nnon-papers to be discussed in the Council Working Party.\nAs regards the NAFO, Council Decision 12372/09\r\nof 14 September 2009 provides for a review of the Union's position before the\r\n2014 annual meeting. Therefore, this proposal aims at setting out the Union's position within the NAFO for the period 2014-2019 and thereby replacing Council\r\nDecision 12372/09 of 14 September 2009 which is covering the period 2009-2014.\nThis revision aims\r\nat incorporating the principles and orientations of the new Common Fisheries\r\nPolicy (CFP), as laid down in Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[1], taking also into account the objectives of the Commission\r\nCommunication on the external dimension of the CFP[2]. Moreover, the Union's position has been adjusted to the Lisbon Treaty. At last, the position has been\r\naligned to the extent possible taking into account the specificities of the\r\ndifferent RFMOs. \nAs it is the case for the current\r\npositions, the following position contains principles and orientations. In\r\naddition, the standard process for the year to year specification of the Union\r\nposition has been incorporated as requested by Member States for positions\r\naligned more recently.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe external dimension of the CFP was part\r\nof the impact assessment for the CFP reform proposals. The principles and\r\norientations agreed for the new CFP are simply being transposed into the\r\nrevised positions. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe following Decision is based on the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\r\n43(2), in conjunction with Article 218(9) which provides that the Council, on a\r\nproposal from the Commission shall adopt a decision establishing the positions\r\nto be adopted on the Union's behalf in a body set up by an agreement, when that\r\nbody is called upon to adopt acts having legal effects. This shall apply to the\r\nposition to be adopted by the Commission, on behalf of the Union, in the NAFO. \nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[3]\r\nis the legal basis setting up the principles to be\r\nreflected in this negotiating mandate. \nThe following Decision shall replace\r\nCouncil Decision 12372/09 which is covering the period 2009-2014, and shall\r\ncover the period 2014-2019. \n2014/0074 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf\r\nof the European Union, in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 38 of the Treaty\r\non the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article 39\r\nthereof, provides that one of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy is\r\nto assure the availability of supplies. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[4] provides that the Union\r\nshall ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally\r\nsustainable in the long-term and are managed in a way that is consistent with\r\nthe objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits, and of\r\ncontributing to the availability of food supplies. It also provides that the Union shall apply the precautionary approach to fisheries managements, and shall aim to\r\nensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and\r\nmaintains population of harvested species above levels which can produce the\r\nmaximum sustainable yield. It also provides that the Union shall aim to take\r\nmanagement and conservation measures based on best available scientific advice,\r\nto promote fishing methods that contribute to more selective fishing and the\r\navoidance and reduction, as far as possible, of unwanted catches, to fish with\r\nlow impact on marine ecosystem and fishery resources and to gradually eliminate\r\ndiscards. Besides, the regulation specifically provides that these principles\r\nshall be applied by the Union in its external policy. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0\r\n3179/78[5],\r\nthe European Community approved the 1979 Convention on Future Multilateral\r\nCo-operation in Northwest Atlantic Fisheries (the NAFO Convention), which\r\nestablished the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries\r\nOrganisation (NAFO) and was subsequently amended in 2007, ratified by\r\nthe European Union in 2010[6].\r\nWithin the NAFO, the General Council is responsible for internal affairs and\r\nexternal relations and the Fisheries Commission is responsible for the adoption\r\nof conservation and enforcement measures designed to ensure the long-term\r\nconservation and sustainable use of the fishery resources in the NAFO Regulatory\r\nArea as defined in the NAFO Convention and to minimise the impact of fishing\r\nactivities on marine eco-systems. Such measures may become binding upon the Union.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\nV.2 of the amended NAFO Convention, the NAFO Fisheries Commission and the NAFO\r\nGeneral Council will merge upon ratification of this Convention to become the\r\nNAFO Commission.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 218(9)\r\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\r\nthe position to be adopted on behalf of the Union in\r\nRegional Fisheries Management Organisations when they are called upon to adopt\r\nacts having legal effects, with the exception of acts supplementing or amending\r\ntheir institutional framework, must be adopted by Council decision, on a\r\nproposal from the Commission.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the evolving\r\nnature of fishery resources in the NAFO Convention Area and the consequent need\r\nfor the position of the Union to take account of new developments, including\r\nnew statistical, biological and other information presented before or during\r\nthe annual Meeting of the General Council and the\r\nFisheries Commission of the NAFO (the NAFO Annual\r\nMeeting) \u00a0\u00a0, procedures must be established, in line with the principle of\r\nsincere cooperation among the Union institutions enshrined in Article 13(2)\r\nTEU, for the year-to-year specification of the Union position;\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe position to be taken by the European Union in the annual Meeting\r\nof the NAFO when that body is called upon to adopt decisions having legal\r\neffects is set out in Annex I to this Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe\r\nyear-to-year specification of the Union position to be taken in the annual\r\nMeeting of the NAFO shall be conducted in accordance with Annex II to this\r\nDecision.\nArticle 3\nThe Union position set out in Annex I to the present Decision shall\r\nbe assessed and, where appropriate, revised by the Council upon a proposal from\r\nthe Commission, at the latest for the annual Meeting of the NAFO in 2019.\nArticle 4\nThis Decision replaces Council Decision 12372/09 of 14
