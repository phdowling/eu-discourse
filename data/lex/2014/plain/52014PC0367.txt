It accounts for over 25 %\r\nof total employment and a significant proportion of economic activity in the EU\r\nMember States. An efficient and productive public sector can be a strong driver\r\nof economic growth through its support for, and governance of, the private\r\nsector. At a time when governments are facing up to the challenge of ensuring\r\nfinancial consolidation while fostering growth, competitiveness and employment,\r\nthere is strong justification for efficiency gains, better governance, faster\r\ndelivery and more user involvement in the public sector[1].\nYears of work around\r\nthemes such as interoperability, eGovernment, open data, cloud computing and\r\nsocial innovation have brought within reach a suite of mature concepts and\r\ntools. The core novelty is the capacity of open data, participative tools and\r\ninteroperable platforms to unleash unprecedented speed, efficiency and quality\r\nin the creation and delivery of public goods and services. The potential for\r\ninterlinked and cooperative open governments joining together contributions\r\nfrom various sectors in an interoperable and secure manner is now high, and\r\nrealising this ambition will be a crucial element for the successful building\r\nof the digital single market.\nAs mentioned in its 2013 annual growth\r\nsurvey[2],\r\nthe Commission considers the cross-border interoperability of online services\r\nand the digitisation of European public administrations to be important\r\ncontributors to growth and increased efficiency. Interoperability between\r\nadministrations is a key enabler for more efficient and effective delivery of\r\ndigital services, while sharing and re-using existing interoperability\r\nsolutions could reduce the multiplication of costs. These are important\r\nproductivity factors that could improve and modernise public administrations at\r\nEU, national, regional and local levels[3].\nIn response to the current economic crisis,\r\nthe Commission has adopted another important initiative, the Europe 2020\r\nStrategy[4],\r\nto turn the EU into a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy, delivering high\r\nlevels of employment, productivity and social cohesion. Certain key challenges addressed by the Strategy relate directly to the\r\nmodernisation of European public administrations. As underlined in the Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE)[5],\r\na Europe 2020 flagship programme, interoperability is\r\nessential to maximising the social and economic potential of ICT and,\r\nconsequently, DAE can take off only\r\nif interoperability is ensured. The DAE\u2019s \u2018interoperability and standards\u2019 pillar ties in with policy priorities under other relevant initiatives such as the European Interoperability\r\nStrategy (EIS), the European Interoperability Framework (EIF)[6] and the 2012-15 e\u2011Commission Strategy[7].\nOn 24 and 25 October 2013, the European\r\nCouncil adopted conclusions stressing that the modernisation of public\r\nadministrations should continue, with the swift implementation of services,\r\nsuch as e-government, e-health, e-invoicing and e-procurement that rely on\r\ninteroperability. This will lead to more and better digital services for\r\ncitizens and enterprises across Europe, cost savings and increased efficiency, transparency and quality of service in the public sector.\nInteroperability programmes have come a\r\nlong way since they were first introduced in 1995. The Commission has demonstrated\r\nits dedication to interoperability solutions over a remarkably long period.\r\nToday, strong commitment on all sides is essential if the Commission and the Member States are to transform and modernise services within and across Europe. In this\r\ncontext, interoperability, as a key enabler, has led the way to achieving \u2018efficient\r\nand effective electronic cross-border and cross-sectoral interaction between\r\n[\u2026] administrations, [\u2026] enabling the delivery of electronic public services\r\nsupporting the implementation of EU policies and activities\u2019, as called for in\r\nthe decision on the previous programme (ISA Decision Article 1(2)[8]).\nTherefore, in responding to real needs, the\r\ncurrent proposal for the continuation of the Commission\u2019s interoperability\r\nprogramme will make a strong contribution to the modernisation of European public\r\nadministrations.\nThe proposal ties in with other initiatives\r\ncontributing to the modernisation of public administrations, such as the DAE, Horizon\r\n2020[9], Connecting Europe\r\nFacility (CEF)[10]\r\nand networks like the European Public Administration Network (EUPAN), the\r\nInvestment Funds and the European Structural Funds (in the latter two cases by\r\nensuring that funded projects are aligned with the EU\u2011wide\r\ninteroperability frameworks and specifications). In a recent report on powering\r\nEuropean public\u2011sector innovation[11],\r\ninteroperability and work under the previous programme are mentioned as factors\r\nconducive to digital innovation and overcoming barriers to public sector\r\nmodernisation.\nThis new programme should therefore be a\r\ncentral point of reference and an instrument enabling the ICT-based modernisation\r\nof the public sector in Europe and, consequently, an invaluable contribution to\r\nachieve the digital single market.\n1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The importance of\r\ninteroperability\nIn today\u2019s Europe, citizens are free to\r\nwork and re-locate and businesses are free to trade and operate within and across\r\nthe Union. In doing so, they frequently have to interact electronically with Member State administrations. To facilitate this interaction, Member States are gradually\r\nmodernising their administrations by improving business processes and ICT\r\ninfrastructures, thereby reducing their administrative burden and costs while\r\nincreasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the services they provide.\nHowever, because it takes place at national\r\nlevel and lacks European\u2011level interoperability, such change very often\r\nthrows up electronic barriers (\u2018e-barriers\u2019) that prevent citizens and\r\nbusinesses from using public services efficiently and impede the smooth\r\nfunctioning of the internal market.\nAt the same time, the challenges facing Europe increasingly require common policy responses and consequently the joining of Member\r\nStates\u2019 forces in implementing these. Applying a broad range of legislative\r\nacts is the shared responsibility of the Member States and the Commission and\r\nrequires interaction across borders and sectors by means of ICT interoperability\r\nsolutions, which are now an integral part of most legislative acts and a key\r\ninstrument for such interaction.\n1.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Background\nThe 1995-99 Interchange of Data between\r\nAdministrations (IDA) Programme[12]\r\naimed to promote the development and operation of trans-European telematic\r\nnetworks through which Member State administrations could exchange data with\r\neach other and/or the EU institutions.\nThe follow-on programme, IDA II (1999-2004) [13][14],\r\naimed to make the delivery of e\u2011Government\r\nservices to European businesses and citizens more efficient.\nThe 2005-09 IDABC Programme[15] aimed at the interoperable delivery of pan-European e\u2011Government\r\nservices to public administrations, businesses and citizens.\nThe 2010-15 ISA Programme[16] on interoperability solutions for European public administrations\r\nhad as its objective to support cooperation between European public\r\nadministrations by facilitating efficient and effective electronic cross-border\r\nand cross-sector interaction enabling the delivery of electronic public\r\nservices to help implement Union policies and activities.\nActivities under the above programmes have\r\ncontributed significantly to ensuring interoperability in the electronic\r\nexchange of information between European public administrations. In its Resolution\r\non a competitive digital single market \u2014 e-Government as a spearhead (3\r\nApril 2012), the European Parliament recognised the contribution and\r\noverarching role of the ISA Programme in defining, promoting and supporting the\r\nimplementation of interoperability solutions and frameworks for European public\r\nadministrations, achieving synergies, promoting the re-use of infrastructure,\r\ndigital services and software solutions, and translating public\r\nadministrations\u2019 interoperability requirements into specifications and\r\nstandards for digital services. The Parliament also called for an increase in\r\nthe financial allocations for interoperability solutions between the EU public\r\nadministrations for 2014-20.\nWith the ISA Programme coming to an end on\r\n31 December 2015, a new EU programme on interoperability solutions for European\r\npublic administrations, businesses and citizens is needed in order to:\n\u00b7                        \r\nmap and analyse the overall interoperability\r\nlandscape in Europe and avoid its fragmentation;\n\u00b7                        \r\nenable, promote and support a holistic approach\r\nto the collection, assessment, development, establishment, industrialisation,\r\noperation, improvement and maintenance of interoperability solutions, including\r\nsolutions that facilitate the re-use of data as well as its exchange, in\r\nsupport of cross-border or cross-sector interaction for European public\r\nadministrations and between them and enterprises and citizens; and\n\u00b7                        \r\npromote and support the re-usability,\r\nintegration and convergence of existing solutions, including those from other\r\nUnion policy areas.\nThe new programme will contribute to\r\nmeeting challenges and ensuring continuity while providing a forum for the exchange\r\nof ideas and experience.\n1.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Related EU initiatives and\r\ninteroperability in other policy areas\nIn the wider context, action under the\r\nprevious ISA Programme was continuously coordinated and aligned with the ongoing\r\nwork under the ICT Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP) of the Competitiveness\r\nand Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) and/or with the Commission\u2019s internal\r\nICT strategy, and with action in the context of the 2011-15 European e-Government\r\nAction Plan. The ISA Programme supported these and\r\nsimilar initiatives whenever they contributed to interoperability between EU\r\npublic administrations. \nISA was also well aligned with the CEF Programme,\r\nthe Union\u2019s funding instrument for trans-European networks in the fields of\r\ntransport, energy and telecommunications. CEF supports the deployment and\r\noperation of key cross-border digital services. The proposed programme is complementary\r\nto CEF by including in its scope bringing-up services to operational level, as required,\r\nbefore being taken on board by CEF. It is also one of the enabler and\r\ncontributor programmes for public sector innovation in Europe.\nInteroperability has also made a\r\nsignificant contribution in the area of cloud computing. As stated in the\r\nCommission communication \u2018Unleashing the Potential of Cloud Computing in Europe\u2019[17], interoperability\r\nplays an important role in supporting the \u201ccreation of public services based on\r\nstandards, scalable, and in\r\nline with the needs of a mobile population and businesses that want to benefit\r\nfrom the European digital single market\u201d. The proposed programme will take into\r\naccount the activities of the European Cloud Initiative regarding interoperability.\nInteroperability is an enabler of EU policy-making\r\nand successful implementation at sectoral level. The following policy areas,\r\namong others, rely on interoperability for their effective and efficient implementation:\n\u00b7                        \r\nInternal market: Directive\r\n2006/123/EC on services in the internal market[18]\r\nrequires Member States to offer service providers the possibility of completing\r\nelectronically and across borders all procedures and formalities needed to\r\nprovide a service outside their home country. In addition, in the area of\r\ncompany law, Directive 2012/17/EU[19]\r\nrequires the interoperability of Member States\u2019 central, commercial and\r\ncompanies registers via a central platform. Interconnecting company registers\r\nwill ensure cross-border exchange of information between registers and will\r\nfacilitate EU-level access for citizens and businesses to data on companies,\r\nthus improving the legal certainty of the business environment in Europe;\n\u00b7                        \r\nEnvironment: The INSPIRE\r\nDirective[20]\r\nrequires the adoption of common implementing rules laying down technical\r\ninteroperability arrangements and national infrastructures to be adapted so as\r\nto ensure that spatial data and services are interoperable and accessible\r\nacross borders in the Union;\n\u00b7                        \r\nHome affairs and Justice: Effectiveness relies on enhanced interoperability and synergies\r\namong European databases via, for example, the Visa Information System (VIS),\r\nthe Schengen Information System II (SIS II), the European Dactyloscopy system\r\n(Eurodac) and the e\u2011Justice portal;\n\u00b7                        \r\nCustoms, taxation and excise duties: with more than 20 years of experience in operating trans-European ICT systems spanning all Member States supporting\r\nbusiness services funded by the Fiscalis 2013[21]\r\nand Customs 2013[22]\r\nprogrammes, implemented and operated by the Commission and national\r\nadministrations, interoperability has proven a key success factor. The assets\r\ncreated under Fiscalis 2013 and Customs 2013 programmes are available for\r\nsharing and re-use from other policy areas on \u2018as is\u2019 basis;\n\u00b7                        \r\nHealth: Directive\r\n2011/24/EU on the application of patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare\r\nprovides rules for facilitating access to safe, high-quality cross-border\r\nhealthcare. The Directive sets explicit provisions for achieving wider interoperability\r\nof national ICT systems for the electronic exchange of health data. In\r\npharmaceuticals, the European Telematics network is managed by the European\r\nMedicines Agency, the national authorities and the Commission. It delivers\r\npractical solutions to streamlining the authorisation of medicinal products and\r\nan interoperable European pharmacovigilance network.\n\u00b7                        \r\nAnimal Health and Food safety: Effective solutions supporting the full chain of animal and animal\r\nproduct traceability and alerts have been applied for the past 10 years with steady\r\nimprovements. All actors in the chain (from business to administrations) are\r\ninvolved in the TRACES system. Electronic exchanges between the actors\r\n(including third countries) are based on international standards (UNCEFACT) and\r\na system of electronic signatures is being introduced to enable e-processing of\r\nalmost all official documents.\n\u00b7                        \r\nEuropean funds: All\r\nexchanges of information in relation with the European Regional Development\r\nFund, European Social Fund, Cohesion Fund, European Agricultural Fund for Rural\r\nDevelopment and European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, between beneficiaries and\r\nmanaging authorities, certifying authorities, audit authorities and\r\nintermediate bodies are carried out by means of electronic data exchange\r\nsystems[23],\r\nso as to facilitate interoperability with national and EU frameworks and allow\r\nbeneficiaries to submit all requisite information only once;\n\u00b7                        \r\nPublic sector information: Directive 2013/37/EU[24]\r\nprovides that, where possible and appropriate, public sector bodies make\r\ndocuments available in open and machine\u2011readable formats together with\r\ntheir metadata, at the best level of precision and granularity, in a format\r\nthat ensures interoperability, re-use and accessibility;\n\u00b7                        \r\nElectronic identity: The Commission\u2019s proposal for a Regulation on electronic\r\nidentification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal\r\nmarket[25]\r\nstresses that the EU needs an enabling framework to address cross\u2011border\r\ninteroperability and improve the coordination of national supervision schemes\r\non EU\u2011wide accepted electronic identification and electronic\r\nauthentication;\n\u00b7                        \r\nICT standardisation: Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 on European standardisation[26] refers to\r\ninteroperability as an essential outcome of standardisation and states that, in\r\norder to ensure interoperability in the single market and improve freedom of\r\nchoice for EU users in the field of ICT, it is appropriate to encourage the use\r\nof, or require compliance with, relevant technical specifications at Union\r\nlevel. In this context, the present programme should promote and, where appropriate,\r\nsupport the partial or full standardisation of existing interoperability\r\nsolutions.\n\u00b7                        \r\nProduction of European Statistics: In Regulation (EC) No 223/2009[27]\r\non European Statistics setting up the basis of the European Statistical System\r\n(ESS) and the subsequent Commission Communication 404 (2009)[28] on \u2018the production of\r\nEU statistics: a vision for the next decade\u2019, interoperability is a key enabler\r\nfor achieving efficiency gains, reducing the administrative burden reduction\r\nand improving the quality of EU statistics for EU citizens, enterprises and\r\npolicy makers.\n\u00b7                        \r\nIn the area of Public Procurement, Directives 2014/25/EU, 2014/24/EU and 2014/23/EU of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 28 March 2014 require Member States to\r\nimplement electronic procurement. They state that the tools and devices to be\r\nused for communicating by electronic means, as well as their technical\r\ncharacteristics, have to be interoperable with the information and\r\ncommunication technology products in general use. The Directive 2014/55/EU[29] on electronic\r\ninvoicing in public procurement adopted by the Parliament on 11 March\r\n2014concerns the development of a European standard for electronic invoicing in\r\npublic procurement to ensure interoperability between electronic invoicing\r\nsystems across the EU.\nHowever, for all the above sectorial\r\ninitiatives to unleash their full potential, cross-sector interoperability has\r\nto be considered and placed within the scope of the present programme.\n1.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the proposal\nTo enable efficient and effective\r\ninteraction with citizens and businesses, Member States should modernise their\r\nadministrations and provide interoperable digital services at national and\r\nEuropean level.\nIssues faced by public administrations\r\nstill include internal organisational complexity, lack of frameworks, ICT\r\narchitectures and tools enabling interoperability, cultural fragmentation and a\r\nlack of cooperation among dispersed institutional entities.\nThe 2012 interim evaluation of the ISA\r\nProgramme found that it was relevant[30]\r\nin responding to Member States\u2019 needs, on the basis\r\nthat those addressed by past and current Commission programmes, i.e. IDA,\r\nIDABC and ISA, still apply to European public administrations.\nThe present programme is therefore needed\r\nto:\n\u2013                        \r\nfacilitate cooperation among Member States and the Commission;\n\u2013                        \r\nmap and analyse the overall interoperability\r\nlandscape in Europe;\n\u2013                        \r\nenable, promote and support a holistic approach\r\nto collecting, assessing, developing, establishing, industrialising, operating,\r\nimproving and maintaining interoperability solutions, including solutions that\r\nfacilitate the re-use of data as well as its exchange, in support of\r\ncross-border or cross-sector interaction between European public\r\nadministrations, businesses and citizens; and\n\u2013                        \r\nat the same time, promote and support the re-usability,\r\nintegration and convergence of existing solutions, including those derived from\r\nother EU policy areas.\nA key factor in the success of any interoperability,\r\nespecially in the area of ICT, is to address it at the right legal level for maximum\r\neffect. It should be ensured that the ICT impact of proposed legislation is\r\nassessed and measured early in the EU legislative process and that ICT needs\r\nare identified in time, allowing for smooth implementation of the legislation when\r\nit comes into force.\nThe present programme will support and\r\npromote the assessment of the ICT implications of proposed or adopted Union\r\nlegislation and planning for the introduction of solutions to support the implementation\r\nof such legislation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of interested\r\nparties\nStakeholders\u2019 views on the future of the\r\nISA Programme (the present proposal) were collected between March 2013 and January\r\n2014 in five rounds of formal consultations with Member States. Twelve Commission\r\nDGs[31] were also consulted and their comments were taken into account in\r\nthe proposal.\nThe Commission presented the \u2018state of play\u2019\r\non preparation of the legal basis for the new ISA Programme to Member States in\r\ntwo official ISA Committee meetings and three ISA Coordination Group meetings.\r\nThis iterative process enabled it to gather Member States\u2019 feedback on the\r\nproposed legislation.\nThe Commission first informed the Member\r\nStates of its intention to introduce a new legal decision for the successor ISA\r\nProgramme in March 2013. It presented a draft of the legislation in an ISA Coordination\r\nGroup meeting in October 2013 and asked the Member States to provide feedback.\nThe feedback received from 16 Member States[32] in November 2013 indicated that:\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe new legislation should focus on avoiding duplication\r\nof effort and coordinating with other EU programmes (mentioned by 10 Member States);\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe monitoring of results should continue and\r\ninclude quantification of the programme benefits (mentioned by seven Member States);\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe new ISA Programme should contribute to the interoperability\r\n\u2018big picture\u2019 by using an architecture model/tool such as the European\r\nInteroperability Cartography (mentioned by six Member\r\nStates); and\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe Programme should be driven by a needs-based\r\napproach (mentioned by six Member States).\nOther, more minor comments were that:\n\u00b7                        \r\nthere is a need to involve different stakeholder\r\ngroups in the review of the legislation (e.g. citizens, businesses, academia)\r\nand to ensure that it addresses their situation;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe new legislation should stress the importance\r\nof re-using data, services and solutions;\n\u00b7                        \r\nspecific references in the legislation should encourage\r\nthe simplification of processes in the context of the modernisation of public\r\nadministrations; and\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe new programme should play the role of a\r\nfacilitator/incubator for Member State and\r\ninter-institutional cooperation so as to ensure that solutions are not only put\r\nin place but are also sustainable, without efforts being duplicated.\nThe latest feedback from Member States was\r\ngathered in the 16 January 2014 meeting of the ISA Committee, when the time\r\nplan for adoption of the new programme was presented and agreed. It was also agreed that, although the legislation should extend to\r\ncitizens and businesses, public administrations should remain the focal point to\r\nensure end-to-end interoperability.\n2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nThe impact assessment for the present programme\r\nwas based on a meta-evaluation from the previous programme\u2019s evaluations (2012 interim\r\nevaluation for the ISA Programme and the EIS implementation review) and on\r\nMember States\u2019 feedback.\nThe largely positive ISA interim evaluation\r\nconcluded that the ISA Programme was aligned with the Commission\u2019s policy\r\npriorities and Member States\u2019 needs and was implemented efficiently and\r\ncoherently, delivering results that were re-used by Commission services and\r\nMember States. However, it also identified some shortcomings and made\r\nrecommendations for action with regard to:\n\u00b7                        \r\ncommunication and\r\nawareness\u2011raising;\n\u00b7                        \r\nstakeholder involvement and project management\r\ncontinuity; and\n\u00b7                        \r\navoiding overlaps and\r\nduplication of work, increasing re-usability and ensuring sustainability.\nAlso, the evaluators considered that four\r\nout of the eleven recommendations from the final evaluation of the predecessor\r\nprogramme (IDABC) were still applicable to the ISA Programme.\nThe present programme takes the\r\nrecommendations of the interim report into account and addresses the\r\nshortcomings with specific activities, while aiming to consolidate, promote and\r\nexpand existing ISA Programme activities. In particular, the new programme will\r\nhelp identify, create and operate interoperability solutions, which will then\r\nbe provided for unlimited use to other Union\u2019s institutions and bodies, and national,\r\nregional and local public administrations, thus facilitating cross-border or\r\ncross-sector interaction between them. The programme will also develop\r\ninteroperability solutions autonomously or complement and support other Union\r\ninitiatives by piloting interoperability solutions as a \u2018solution incubator\u2019 or\r\nensuring their sustainability as a \u2018solution bridge\u2019.\nBy doing so, the programme will help reduce\r\nthe cost and administrative burden of cross\u2011border interaction for all concerned,\r\nfurther improve the internal market and freedom of movement in the EU without\r\nadministrative e-barriers, and contribute to the swift implantation of ICT\r\nsystems supporting EU legislation.\nIn the event of the present programme not\r\nbeing adopted, existing support for effective and efficient interaction between\r\nEuropean public administrations would be dropped, leading to multiplied costs\r\nand additional effort. Furthermore, the proliferation of disparate solutions\r\ncould inadvertently result in new or worse e-barriers, thus impeding the smooth\r\nfunctioning of the internal market and freedom of movement, i.e. the opposite of\r\nthe objective of modernising European public administrations.\nSimilarly, the establishment and operation\r\nof new interoperability solutions would no longer contribute to ensuring an\r\nefficient and effective exchange of data between European public\r\nadministrations. With no new programme, far fewer EU initiatives would be taken\r\nin support of interoperability, which is a pre\u2011condition for the delivery of cross-border or cross-sector online digital services\r\nof European public administrations.\nBy launching the present programme, the EU\r\nwill make an important contribution to ensuring smooth interaction between\r\nEuropean public administrations to the direct benefit of Member States,\r\nbusinesses and citizens.\nThe programme will add economic value by\r\nsupporting the proper functioning of the internal market through solutions that\r\nwill ensure:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 shorter response times in public\r\nadministrations\u2019 interaction with citizens and businesses;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the identification and re-use of\r\nexisting solutions to serve similar business needs; and\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the automation of cross-border\r\nand cross-sector transactions, thus saving resources and time.\nSocial value would be added in as far as\r\nthe programme activities will eventually benefit citizens and businesses as\r\nusers of cross-border and cross-sector electronic public services making use of\r\nsuch common and shared solutions.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of the proposed\r\nlegislation\nThe present programme succeeds the ISA\r\nProgramme and will consolidate, promote and expand its activities.\nIn particular, the new programme will:\n\u00b7                        \r\nhelp to identify, create and operate interoperability\r\nsolutions, which will then be provided for unlimited use to other Union\r\ninstitutions and bodies, and national, regional and local public\r\nadministrations, thus facilitating cross-border or cross-sector interaction\r\nbetween them;\n\u00b7                        \r\ndevelop interoperability solutions autonomously\r\nor complement and support other Union initiatives by piloting interoperability\r\nsolutions as a \u2018solution incubator\u2019 or ensuring their sustainability as a\r\n\u2018solution bridge\u2019; and\n\u00b7                        \r\nassess the ICT implications of existing and\r\nproposed EU legislation.\n3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nIn accordance with Article 170 of the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), to help achieve the\r\nobjectives referred to in Articles 26 and 174 TFEU and to enable citizens of\r\nthe European Union, economic operators and regional and local communities to\r\nderive full benefit from the setting\u2011up of an area without internal\r\nfrontiers, the Union should contribute to the establishment and development of\r\ntrans-European networks by means of actions to promote the interconnectivity\r\nand interoperability of national networks, as well as access to them.\nIn accordance with Article 172 TFEU\r\n(previously Article 156 of Treaty Establishing the European Community), \u2018the\r\nguidelines and other measures referred to in Article 171(1) shall be adopted by\r\nthe European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee\r\nand the Committee of the Regions. Guidelines and projects of common interest\r\nwhich relate to the territory of a Member State shall require the approval of\r\nthe Member State concerned.\u2019\n3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle\nThe subsidiarity principle applies insofar\r\nas the proposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the EU. \nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\r\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States acting independently, as this could\r\nnot produce the interoperability effects necessary for cross-border or\r\ncross-sector electronic public services or establish common and shared\r\nsolutions in support of the interaction between European public\r\nadministrations. \nEU action will achieve the objectives of\r\nthe proposal more effectively, as the programme will establish and operate\r\ninteroperability solutions in support of smooth interaction between public\r\nadministrations across borders or sectors, enabling the delivery of electronic\r\npublic services supporting the implementation of EU policies and activities.\nTherefore, the programme has a clear inherent\r\nEU dimension. The proposal therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle.\n3.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\nThe programme will support the provision of\r\ncommon and shared solutions, i.e. common frameworks, generic tools and common\r\nservices, to be applied, as appropriate, by European public administrations for\r\nthe exchange of information across borders or sectors. In the absence of other\r\nprovisions, the application of such solutions is subject to Member States\u2019 discretion.\r\n\nThe establishment and improvement of common\r\nframeworks and generic tools will be financed via the programme, while the use\r\nof such frameworks and tools is to be financed by the users at the\r\nadministrative level in question. The programme will finance the establishment,\r\nindustrialisation (i.e. bringing to a state of operational maturity) and\r\nimprovement of common services, but will finance their actual operation only where\r\nthis may serve the EU interests. In other cases, the use of the services,\r\nincluding their operation on a decentralised basis, will be financed by the\r\nusers.\nThe solutions established by the programme will\r\nreduce the financial and administrative burden on European public\r\nadministrations in interacting with each other. The proposal therefore complies\r\nwith the proportionality principle.\n3.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instruments\nAs with the previous ISA Programme, the legal\r\nact proposed is a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council, since\r\nin this particular case, a decision is the most appropriate means for complying\r\nwith the proportionality principle.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe financial envelope for implementation\r\nof the new ISA2 Programme for the period 1 January 2016 to 31\r\nDecember 2020 is EUR 130 928 000. The proposed envelope is consistent\r\nwith the current Multiannual Financial Framework for the years 2014-2020.\nFurther details are provided in the legislative\r\nfinancial statement accompanying the proposal.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nEuropean Economic Area\nThe\r\nproposed act concerns an EEA matter and should therefore extend to the European\r\nEconomic Area.\nCandidate countries\nThe proposed act is open\r\nto participation by candidate countries.\n2014/0185 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nestablishing a programme on interoperability\r\nsolutions for European public administrations, businesses and citizens (ISA2)\nInteroperability as a means for\r\nmodernising the public sector\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 172 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[33],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[34],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a series of Ministerial\r\nDeclarations (in Manchester on 24 November 2005, Lisbon on 19 September 2007,\r\nMalm\u00f6 on 18 November 2009 and Granada on 19 April\r\n2010), ministers invited the Commission to facilitate cooperation among Member\r\nStates by implementing cross-border and cross-sector interoperability solutions\r\nthat will enable more efficient and secure public services. Moreover, Member\r\nStates recognised that better public services need to be delivered with fewer\r\nresources, and that the potential of e-Government can be boosted by promoting a\r\nculture of collaboration and improving the conditions for interoperability in\r\nEuropean public administrations.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Communication of 19\r\nMay 2010 to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and\r\nSocial Committee and the Committee of the Regions on A Digital Agenda for\r\nEurope[35]\r\n(DAE), one of the flagship initiatives of its Europe 2020 Strategy[36], the Commission stressed\r\nthat interoperability is essential to maximise the social and economic\r\npotential of ICT and that, consequently, the Digital Agenda can take off only if interoperability is ensured.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Communication of 16 December 2010\r\nto the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social\r\nCommittee and the Committee of the Regions Towards interoperability for\r\nEuropean public services[37], the Commission introduced\r\nthe European Interoperability Strategy (EIS) and the European Interoperability\r\nFramework (EIF).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At Union level,\r\ninteroperability facilitates successful implementation of policies. The\r\nfollowing policies in particular rely on interoperability for their effective\r\nand efficient implementation:\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the area of the\r\ninternal market, Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[38]\r\nrequires Member States to offer service providers the possibility of completing\r\nelectronically and across borders all procedures and formalities needed to\r\nprovide a service outside their home country.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the area of company\r\nlaw, Directive 2012/17/EU[39]\r\nrequires the interoperability of Member States\u2019 central, commercial and\r\ncompanies registers via a central platform. The interconnection of company\r\nregisters will ensure cross-border exchange of information between registers\r\nand will facilitate EU-level access for citizens and businesses to data on\r\ncompanies, thus improving legal certainty in the business environment in Europe.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the area of\r\nenvironment, Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[40] requires the adoption\r\nof common implementing rules laying down technical interoperability\r\narrangements. In particular, that Directive requires national infrastructures to\r\nbe adapted to ensure that spatial data and services are interoperable and accessible\r\nacross borders in the Union.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the area of home\r\naffairs and justice, enhanced interoperability among European databases is the\r\nbasis of the Visa Information System (VIS)[41],\r\nthe Schengen Information System II (SIS II)[42],\r\nthe European Dactyloscopy system (Eurodac)[43]\r\nand the e\u2011Justice portal[44].\r\nFurthermore, on 24 September 2012, the Council adopted conclusions calling for the\r\nintroduction of the European Legislation Identifier (ELI) and highlighting the\r\nneed for interoperable searching and exchange of legal information published in\r\nnational official journals and legal gazettes, through the use of unique\r\nidentifiers and structured metadata.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interoperability has been\r\na key factor to success in the area of Customs, Taxation and excise duties, in\r\noperating trans-European ICT systems spanning all Member States supporting\r\ninteroperable business services funded by the Fiscalis 2013 and Customs 2013\r\nprogrammes, implemented and operated by the Commission and national\r\nadministrations. Assets created under Fiscalis 2013 and Customs 2013 programmes\r\nare available for sharing and re-use from other policy areas.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the area of health,\r\nDirective 2011/24/EU[45]\r\nprovides rules for facilitating access to safe, high-quality cross-border\r\nhealthcare. Specifically, the Directive established the eHealth Network to\r\naddress the interoperability challenge between electronic health systems. The\r\nNetwork can adopt guidelines on the minimum data set to be exchanged across\r\nborders in case of unplanned and emergency care and on ePrescription services\r\nacross national borders.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the area of European\r\nfunds, Article 122 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council[46]\r\nrequires all exchanges of information between beneficiaries and managing\r\nauthorities, certifying authorities, audit authorities and intermediate bodies\r\nto be carried out by means of electronic data\u2011exchange systems. These\r\nsystems are to facilitate interoperability with national and Union frameworks\r\nand allow beneficiaries to submit all requisite information only once.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the area of public\r\nsector information, Directive 2013/37/EU of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[47]\r\nstresses that public sector bodies should, where possible and appropriate, make\r\ndocuments available through open and machine-readable formats together with\r\ntheir metadata, at the best level of precision and granularity, in a format\r\nthat ensures interoperability, re-use and accessibility.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the area of electronic identity,\r\nthe proposal of the Commission of 4 June 2012 for a Regulation of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services\r\nfor electronic transactions in the internal market[48] highlights the need\r\nfor the Union to create an enabling framework to address cross-border\r\ninteroperability and to improve the coordination of national supervision\r\nschemes on Union-wide accepted electronic identification and electronic\r\nauthentication.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the area of ICT\r\nstandardisation, Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council[49]\r\nrefers to interoperability as an essential outcome of standardisation. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the area of research and\r\ninnovation, Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council, establishing Horizon 2020[50],\r\nclearly mentions that interoperable solutions and standards in ICT are key\r\nenablers for the partnering of industries at Union level. Collaboration around\r\ncommon, open\u2011technology platforms with spill-over and leverage effects\r\nwill allow a wide range of stakeholders to benefit from new developments and\r\ncreate further innovations.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In public procurement,\r\nDirectives 2014/25/EU[51],\r\n2014/24/EU[52]\r\nand 2014/23/EU[53]\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 March 2014 require Member\r\nStates to implement electronic procurement. They state that the tools and\r\ndevices to be used for communicating by electronic means, as well as their\r\ntechnical characteristics, must be interoperable with the information and\r\ncommunication technology products in general use. Moreover, Directive\r\n2014/55/EU[54]\r\non electronic invoicing in public procurement adopted by the Parliament on 11\r\nMarch 2014 concerns the development of a European standard for electronic\r\ninvoicing in public procurement to ensure interoperability between electronic\r\ninvoicing systems across the EU.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interoperability is also a fundamental\r\nelement of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) established by Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 1316/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council[55] in the area of\r\nbroadband infrastructure and services. The Regulation 2014/283/EU[56] on guidelines for\r\ntrans-European networks in the area of telecommunications infrastructure explicitly\r\nmentions that an operational priority for the CEF to achieve its objectives is the\r\ninteroperability, connectivity, sustainable deployment, operation and upgrading\r\nof trans-European digital service infrastructures as well as their coordination\r\nat Union level.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At political level, the\r\nCouncil has repeatedly called for even greater interoperability in Europe and for continued efforts to modernise European public administrations. In\r\nparticular, on 24 and 25 October 2013, the European Council adopted conclusions\r\nstressing that the modernisation of public administrations should continue\r\nthrough the swift implementation of services such as e-government, e-health,\r\ne-invoicing and e\u2011procurement, which rely on interoperability.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A single sector\r\ninteroperability perspective is associated with the risk that the adoption of different\r\nor incompatible solutions at national or sectoral levels will throw up new\r\ne-barriers that impede the proper functioning of the internal market and the\r\nassociated freedoms of movement, and undermine the openness and competitiveness\r\nof markets and the delivery of services of general interest to citizens and\r\nenterprises. In order to mitigate this risk, Member States and the Union should step up joint efforts to avoid market fragmentation and ensure cross\u2011border\r\nor cross-sector interoperability in the implementation of legislation, while\r\nreducing administrative burdens and costs, and promote commonly agreed ICT\r\nsolutions, while ensuring appropriate governance.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several successive programmes\r\nhave sought to ensure the coherent development and implementation of global and\r\nsectoral interoperability strategies, legal frameworks, guidelines, services\r\nand tools to address requirements under Union\u2011wide policies, such as:\n\u2013              \r\nthe IDA Programme (1999-2004) set up by Decision\r\n1719/1999/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[57] and by Decision No\r\n1720/1999/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[58],\n\u2013              \r\nthe IDABC Programme (2005-09) set up by Decision\r\n2004/387/EC e-Government[59];\r\nand the\n\u2013              \r\nthe ISA Programme (2010-15) set up by Decision No\r\n922/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[60].\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Activities under the IDA,\r\nIDABC and ISA Programmes have made important contributions to ensuring\r\ninteroperability in the electronic exchange of information between public\r\nadministrations of the Union. In its Resolution on a competitive digital\r\nsingle market \u2014 e-Government as a spearhead (3 April 2012)[61], the European\r\nParliament recognised the contribution of the ISA Programme and its overarching\r\nrole in defining, promoting and supporting the implementation of\r\ninteroperability solutions and frameworks for European public administrations,\r\nachieving synergies, promoting the re-use of solutions and translating their\r\ninteroperability requirements into specifications and standards for digital\r\nservices.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With Decision No 922/2009/EC\r\nceasing to apply on 31 December 2015, a new Union Programme on interoperability\r\nsolutions for European public administrations, businesses and citizens (ISA2)\r\nis needed in order to map and analyse the overall interoperability landscape in\r\n Europe and avoid its fragmentation. The Programme will enable, support and\r\npromote a holistic approach to the collection, assessment, development,\r\nestablishment, industrialisation, operation, improvement and maintenance of\r\ninteroperability solutions, including solutions that facilitate the re-use of\r\ndata as well as its exchange, in support of European public administrations\u2019\r\ncross\u2011border or cross-sector interactions with each other and with\r\nenterprises and citizens. Finally, the Programme will promote the re-usability,\r\nintegration and convergence of existing solutions, including those derived from\r\nother Union policy areas.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Solutions established or\r\noperated under the present ISA2 Programme should, as far as\r\npossible, form part of a consistent environment of services facilitating\r\ninteraction between European public administrations, enterprises and citizens,\r\nand ensuring, facilitating and enabling cross-border or cross-sector\r\ninteroperability.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Citizens and enterprises should\r\nalso benefit from common, re-usable and interoperable front-office services\r\nresulting from better integration of processes and exchange of data through the\r\nEuropean public administrations\u2019 back-offices.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ISA2 Programme\r\nshould be an instrument for public\u2011sector modernisation in the Union.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interoperability is\r\ndirectly connected with, and dependent on the use of, standards and common\r\nspecifications. The ISA2 Programme should promote and, where appropriate,\r\nsupport the partial or full standardisation of existing interoperability\r\nsolutions. This should be achieved in cooperation with other standardisation\r\nactivities at Union level, European standardisation organisations and other\r\ninternational standardisation organisations.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The modernisation of public\r\nadministrations is one of the key priorities for successful implementation of\r\nthe Europe 2020 Strategy. In this context, the Annual Growth Surveys published\r\nby the Commission in 2011, 2012 and 2013 show that the quality of European\r\npublic administrations has a direct impact on the economic environment and is therefore\r\ncrucial to stimulating productivity, competitiveness and growth. This is\r\nclearly reflected in the country-specific recommendations, which call for\r\nspecific action aimed at public administration reform.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013\r\nincludes a thematic objective of \u2018enhancing institutional capacity of public\r\nauthorities and stakeholders and an efficient public administration\u2019. In this\r\ncontext, the ISA2 Programme should tie in with programmes and\r\ninitiatives contributing to the modernisation of public administrations like\r\ne.g. the DAE, and related networks like e.g. the European Public\r\nAdministration Network (EUPAN) and seek synergies with them.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interoperability of\r\nEuropean public administrations concerns all levels of administration:\r\nEuropean, local, regional and national. It is therefore important that\r\nsolutions take into account their respective needs, as well as those of\r\ncitizens and enterprises where relevant.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 National administrations\r\ncan be supported in their endeavours through specific instruments under the\r\nEuropean Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). Close cooperation under the\r\nISA2 Programme should maximise the benefits expected from such instruments\r\nby ensuring that funded projects are aligned with the Union\u2011wide\r\ninteroperability frameworks and specifications such as the EIF.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Decision lays down a\r\nfinancial envelope for the entire duration of the ISA2 programme which\r\nconstitute the prime reference amount, within the meaning of Point 17 of the\r\nInterinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013[62] between the European\r\nParliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on\r\ncooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management, for the\r\nEuropean Parliament and the Council during the annual budgetary procedure.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consideration should be\r\ngiven to the possibility of using pre-accession funds to facilitate candidate\r\ncountries\u2019 participation in the ISA2 Programme and the adoption and\r\nfurther implementation in those countries of solutions provided under it.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ISA2 Programme\r\nshould contribute to the implementation of any follow-on initiatives in the\r\ncontext of Europe 2020 and the DAE. In order to avoid any duplication of\r\neffort, it should take account of other Union programmes in the field of ICT\r\nsolutions, services and infrastructures, in particular the CEF laid down in\r\nRegulation 1316/2013/EU and Horizon 2020 laid down in Regulation (EU) No\r\n1291/2013.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should\r\nbe conferred on the Commission.

At Union level,\r\ninter-service coordination will ensure that activities are aligned with those\r\nin other policy areas (e.g. European Semester, country-specific reports/recommendations)\r\nand with the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) and Digital Agenda pillar II on\r\ninteroperability and standards, with a view to maximising coherence and\r\nsynergies. The close cooperation and coordination with Member States and other policy areas will help the Programme constantly to assess actual needs, the\r\nproportionality of activities and the respect of subsidiarity.\nAs stressed in the explanatory memorandum, the ISA2 Programme\r\nwill add primarily financial and economic value to Union intervention and\r\ncontribute to the reinforcement and implementation of Union policies and\r\nlegislation, achieving considerable synergies through coordination across\r\nborders or sectors.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe Commission\u2019s report to the European Parliament and the Council\r\non the interim evaluation of the previous ISA Programme highlights the largely\r\npositive conclusions of the evaluation.

On that basis, it will continue to support\r\nexisting solutions, create new solutions and act as a facilitator for\r\ninteroperability solutions resulting from other Union initiatives that could\r\nbecome operational in the Union\u2019s digital service delivery channels. It will thus\r\navoid duplication of effort, strengthen collaboration between Member States and Commission services, and actively promote the re-use of existing solutions.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information concerning the\r\ninternal control system set-up\nExisting control methods applied by the Commission will cover\r\nappropriations under the Programme.\n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimate of the costs and\r\nbenefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error\nA large number of financial and administrative control mechanisms are\r\nprovided for.
