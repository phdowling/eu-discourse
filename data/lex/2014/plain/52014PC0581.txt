These engines contribute significantly to air\r\npollution and are accountable for roughly 15% of the nitrogen oxide (NOx) and\r\n5% of the particulate matter (PM) emissions in the EU.\nThe emissions\r\nlimits for these engines are currently set out in Directive 97/68/EC. This\r\nDirective was amended a number of times, but several technical reviews have\r\nconcluded that the legislation in its current form has shortcomings. The scope\r\nis overly restricted as it leaves out some engine categories. New emission\r\nstages were last introduced when the Directive was amended in 2004 and no\r\nlonger reflect the current state of technology. Furthermore, there is a\r\nmismatch between the emission limits for certain engine categories.\nFinally, there is recent conclusive evidence on\r\nthe adverse health effects of diesel exhaust emissions and especially about\r\nparticulate matter (i.e. diesel soot). One of the main findings is that the\r\nsize of the particles is a crucial factor behind the observed health effects.\r\nThis issue can only be addressed by limit values that are based on a particle\r\nnumber count (i.e. PN limit). Therefore, and in line with the developments in\r\nthe road sector, the introduction of a new emission stage (Stage V), which\r\nwould target particle number limits in addition to particle mass limits,\r\nappeared appropriate for the most relevant engine categories.\n\u00b7        \r\nGrounds for and\r\nobjectives of the proposal\nThe proposal seeks to protect human health and\r\nthe environment, and ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for\r\nengines in NRMM. It also seeks to address competitiveness and compliance\r\naspects.\nIn line with the EU's air quality policy, the\r\nobjective is to progressively reduce the emissions from new engines being\r\nbrought on the market and, thereby, replace the old, more polluting ones over\r\ntime. This is expected to result in a very significant emission reduction\r\noverall, but the reduction by engine category will vary depending on how\r\nstringent the specific requirements already are at present.\nThe proposal is also expected to alleviate the\r\npressure on Member States to take additional regulatory action that could\r\nhamper the internal market. Finally, the proposal seeks to remove obstacles to\r\nexternal trade through harmonised rules and by reducing the regulatory barriers\r\nthat result from diverging emission requirements. In particular with a view to\r\nbringing EU and US requirements closer together.\nFinally, the proposal\r\ncontributes to the competitiveness of the European industry by simplifying the\r\nexisting type-approval legislation, improving transparency and alleviating\r\nadministrative burden.\n\u00b7      Existing provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nThe existing emission requirements for NRMM\r\nengines are regulated in Directive 97/68/EC of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council of 16 December 1997 on the approximation of the laws of the Member\r\nStates relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate\r\npollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery\r\n(OJ L 59, 27.2.1998, p. 1).\nThe draft proposal and\r\nits implementing and delegated acts will carry over and improve on the existing\r\nrequirements laid down in the above act, following a technical review\r\nconcluding on a number of substantial shortcomings. Compared to the existing\r\nact, the proposal for a regulation will:\n\u2013              \r\nintroduce new emission\r\nlimits reflecting technological progress and EU policies in the on-road sector,\r\nwith a view to achieving EU air quality targets;\n\u2013              \r\nextend the scope, with\r\na view to improving market harmonisation (EU and international) and minimising\r\nthe risk of market distortions;\n\u2013              \r\nintroduce measures for\r\nsimplifying administrative procedures and improving enforcement, including\r\nconditions for better market surveillance.\n\u00b7      Consistency with the other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThe initiative under\r\nconsideration is aimed at improving the protection of the environment by\r\nupdating existing emission limits and by extending their scope, where\r\nappropriate. At the same time, it is aimed at ensuring the proper functioning\r\nof the single market, while removing unnecessary burden on the companies\r\noperating in it and internationally. It is, therefore, entirely consistent with\r\nthe Europe 2020 strategy and fully aligned to the EU's Sustainable Development\r\nStrategy. \nIn this context, the\r\ninitiative under consideration ties in with the following more specific\r\npolicies and objectives:\n\u2013              \r\nThe EU\u2019s 6th Environmental Action\r\nProgramme[1]\r\nwhich proposed to attain \u201clevels of air quality that do not give rise to\r\nsignificant negative impacts on, and risks to human health and the\r\nenvironment\u201d.\n\u2013              \r\nThe Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution[2] which provides a\r\ncomprehensive EU policy framework for reducing the adverse impact of air\r\npollution on human health and environment for the period up to 2020.\n\u2013              \r\nThe National Ceilings Directive 2001/81/EC which\r\nestablishes legally binding limits for the total permissible emissions at Member State level for several air pollutants. According to the official data reported\r\nunder said Directive, 12 Member States exceeded these limits in 2010 and,\r\ndespite some improvements, compliance problems will likely persist.\n\u2013              \r\nThe Ambient Air Quality Directive 2008/50/EC\r\nwhich sets legally binding limits for concentrations in outdoor air of major\r\nair pollutants such as particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide.\n\u2013              \r\nThe 2011 White Paper on Transport[3], in particular with\r\nregard to cleaner inland waterway and rail transportation. \nMore stringent\r\nrequirements for combustion engines in NRMM would positively contribute to the\r\nobjectives of all of the above policies.\nFinally, the proposal\r\nalso ties in with the industrial policy update of 2012[4] and could make an\r\nimportant contribution to technical harmonisation in the context of the EU-US\r\ntrade negotiations (TTIP).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of\r\ninterested parties and impact assessment\n\u00b7      Consultation of interested parties\nConsultation\r\nmethods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents\nIn developing the\r\nproposal the Commission has consulted stakeholders in a number of ways:\n\u2013              \r\nThere was an open\r\npublic internet consultation, covering all aspects of the proposal. Responses\r\nwere received from EU national and regional authorities of EU Member States\r\n(ministries, agencies), professional associations, industrial companies,\r\nnon-governmental organisations and social partners.\n\u2013              \r\nA stakeholder hearing\r\naccompanying the open public internet consultation was organised on 14 February\r\n2013 in Brussels, attended by approximately 80 participants.\n\u2013              \r\nIn the context of\r\nseveral Impact Assessment studies conducted in the past by external\r\nconsultants, stakeholders were invited to contribute and send in comments.\n\u2013              \r\nThe proposal has been\r\ndiscussed in several meetings of the Commission\u2019s Working Group of Experts on\r\nMachinery Emissions (GEME), which brings together industry, NGOs, as well as Member State and Commission representatives.\nSummary of responses\r\nand how they have been taken into account\nAn open public consultation started on 15\r\nJanuary 2013 and closed on 8 April 2013 (12 weeks duration). For this purpose,\r\na dedicated consultation web-page[5]\r\nwas set up and the Commission services prepared a 15 page consultation\r\ndocument, outlining key issues, study results and potential courses of action.\r\n69 responses were received in total. \nA detailed analysis of the results is included\r\nin Annex II to the Impact Assessment report and the individual responses can be\r\nviewed on the consultation web-page.\n\u00b7      Collection and use of expertise\nScientific/expertise\r\ndomains concerned\nThe proposal required\r\nthe assessment of different policy options as well as the associated economic,\r\nsocietal and environmental impacts.\nMethodology used\nThe Commission has\r\ncarried out various studies and regularly consulted stakeholders, as concerns\r\nthe feasibility of new limit values and the need to include new stages for\r\nexhaust emissions based on technical progress. The Impact Assessment builds on\r\nthe following external studies[6]:\n\u2013              \r\nA Technical Review of the Directive, submitted\r\nin two parts, by the JRC, which in part 1 includes an overview of emissions\r\ninventories for NRMM. Part 2, inter alia, focuses on spark ignition engines\r\n(small petrol engines and snowmobile engines) and, among others, analyses\r\nemission inventories and market sales of construction and agricultural\r\nmachinery.\n\u2013              \r\nAn Impact Assessment study by ARCADIS N.V.\r\nassesses the impacts of the policy options developed in the Technical Review of\r\nthe JRC. A complementary study by the same contractors looked specifically at\r\nthe impacts on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). In addition to the social\r\nand economic impact the environmental and health impact was also evaluated in\r\nthis study. \n\u2013              \r\nA study from Risk & Policy Analysis (RPA)\r\nand Arcadis, evaluates the current contribution of the NRMM sector to\r\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study also examines the feasibility of\r\nextending the emission limits for variable speed engines to constant speed\r\nengines and considers the option of aligning the exhaust emission limit values\r\nto US values.\n\u2013              \r\nThe PANTEIA study[7]\r\ncommissioned by DG MOVE analyses the situation in the inland navigation sectors\r\nand assesses specific measures for reducing emissions from inland waterway\r\ntransport.\nThe work on the impact\r\nassessment was followed and informed by an inter-service steering group which\r\nmet four times in 2013. All relevant Commission services were invited to\r\nparticipate in this group. The JRC further supported the analytical work with a\r\nresearch project on the effects of particulate number (PN) limits for certain\r\nengine categories.\nMeans used to\r\nmake the expert advice publicly available\nThe reports of the\r\naforementioned studies, respectively, are available on the DG Enterprise and\r\nIndustry website.\n\u00b7      Impact assessment\nThree main policy options were analysed in detail. Each consists of\r\nvarious sub-options for the engine categories and applications already covered\r\nby EU NRMM legislation, and for the ones that could come under its scope in the\r\nfuture. Alongside the no-policy change scenario, these options are:\nOption 2: Alignment with US standards in scope and limit values.\nOption 3: Step towards road sector ambition levels, for the most\r\nrelevant emission sources.\nOption 4: Extended level of ambition through enhanced monitoring\r\nprovisions.\nHowever, it was already taken into account in the analytical design\r\nthat the preferred choice might be a combination of elements from different\r\noptions. The analysis of costs and benefits was carried out in individual\r\nmodules that allow for regrouping elements.\nNon-legislative options (e.g. a voluntary agreement with industry) have\r\nbeen considered, but the initial analysis concluded that such an approach would\r\nbe unsuitable for reaching the initiative's objectives. This decision is based\r\non the consideration that emission limits for NRMM engines are unlikely to be\r\neffective and cannot guarantee a level playing field for all economic operators\r\nunless they are legally binding.\nThe impact assessment was accepted by the Impact Assessment Board\r\nfollowing its presentation on 20 November 2013. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal\r\nelements of the proposal\n\u00b7      Summary of the proposed action\nThe proposal\r\nsignificantly upgrades the NRMM engine type-approval system with respect to the\r\ntechnical requirements on emissions by adopting stricter levels, as well as\r\nintroducing the \u201csplit-level approach\u201d.\nThe proposal will,\r\nthrough the delegated acts foreseen herein, lay down in detail the new\r\nmandatory requirements for Stage V engine emission limits. In particular, the\r\ndelegated acts adopted under this proposal will include, amongst others:\n\u2013              \r\ndetailed technical\r\nrequirements of the test cycles;\n\u2013              \r\ntechnical test and\r\nmeasurement procedures;\n\u2013              \r\ndetailed arrangements\r\nand requirements for the exceptions granted under this Regulation;\n\u2013              \r\ndetailed provisions for\r\ntype-approval procedures.\n\u00b7      Legal basis\nThe legal basis of the\r\nproposal is Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe subsidiarity\r\nprinciple applies since the proposal does not fall under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union.\nAs the proposal\r\ninvolves amendments to existing EU legislation, only the EU can effectively\r\naddress the issues. Furthermore, the policy objectives cannot be sufficiently\r\nachieved by actions of the Member States.\nEuropean Union action\r\nis necessary to avoid the emergence of barriers to the single market notably in\r\nthe field of NRMM engines, and because of the transnational nature of air\r\npollution. Even though the effects of the main air pollutants are most severe\r\nclose to the source, the effects on air quality are not limited to the local\r\nlevel and cross-border pollution is a serious environmental problem that can\r\nrender national solutions ineffective. In order to solve the problem of air\r\npollution, concerted action at EU level is required.\nSetting up emission\r\nlimits and type-approval procedures at national level would potentially result\r\nin a patchwork of 28 different regimes, which would represent a serious\r\nobstacle to intra-Union trade. Moreover, it could impose a significant\r\nadministrative and financial burden on manufacturers who are active in more\r\nthan one market. Therefore, the objectives of the initiative under\r\nconsideration cannot be achieved without action at the EU level.\nFinally, a harmonised\r\napproach at EU level is expected to represent the most cost-efficient way for\r\nmanufacturers and end-users to achieve emission reductions.\nThe proposal therefore\r\ncomplies with the subsidiarity principle.\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies\r\nwith the proportionality principle for the following reasons.\nAs shown in the impact\r\nassessment, the proposal complies with the proportionality principle because it\r\ndoes not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives of\r\nensuring the proper functioning of the internal market while at the same time\r\nproviding for a high level of public safety and environmental protection.\nThe simplification of\r\nthe regulatory environment will significantly contribute to the reduction of\r\nadministrative costs for national authorities and industry.\n\u00b7      Choice of instruments\nProposed instruments:\r\nregulation.\nOther means would not\r\nbe adequate for the following reasons.\nDirective 97/68/EC has\r\nbeen substantially amended several times. For reasons of clarity,\r\npredictability, rationality and simplification, the Commission is proposing to\r\nreplace Directive 97/68/EC by a Regulation and a small number of delegated and\r\nimplementing acts. \nFurthermore, the use\r\nof a Regulation will ensure that the provisions concerned are directly\r\napplicable to manufacturers, approval authorities and technical services, and\r\nthat they can be updated much faster and more efficiently to take better\r\naccount of technical progress\nThe proposal uses the\r\n\u201csplit-level approach\u201d is already used in other pieces of legislation in the\r\narea of EU type-approval of motor vehicles. This approach foresees legislation\r\nin two steps:\n\u00b7      first, the fundamental provisions will be\r\nlaid down by the European Parliament and the Council in a Regulation based on\r\nArticle 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union through the\r\nordinary legislative procedure;\n\u00b7      secondly, the technical specifications\r\nimplementing the fundamental provisions will be laid down in delegated acts\r\nadopted by the Commission in\r\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary\r\nimplication\nThe cost associated to setting up an electronic database\r\nfor the exchange of type-approval information was already assessed in a\r\nfeasibility study[8]\r\ncommissioned by the UNECE in June 2006 and for cars, a European Type-Approval\r\nExchange System (ETAES) already exists in the EU.\nWhile the feasibility study was not done on a publicly\r\navailable database, it can still be assumed that the cost assessment provides a\r\nvalid indication of the costs involved.\nThe study predicted one off start-up costs in the \u20ac\r\n50,000 to \u20ac 150,000 range and operating costs of \u20ac 5,000 to \u20ac 15,000 per month,\r\ndepending on the length of the contract with the service provider. A similar\r\nmonthly range is provided for operating a help desk service, if required.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Additional\r\ninformation\n\u00b7      Simulation, pilot phase and transitional\r\nperiod\nThere are general and\r\nspecific transitional periods in the proposal in order to allow sufficient lead\r\ntime for engine and machinery manufacturers, as well as for administrations.\nFor the transition\r\nfrom the current emission standards to the new emission stage, a newly\r\ndeveloped transition scheme is proposed which is significantly simpler in\r\nadministrative terms for manufacturers of engines and machinery, whilst at the\r\nsame time substantially reducing the burden for the national approval\r\nauthorities.\nWith regard to the\r\nmonitoring of in-service emission performance of engines, pilot programmes are\r\nproposed with a view to developing appropriate testing procedures.\n\u00b7      Simplification\nThe proposal provides\r\nfor simplification of legislation.\nAn extremely complex\r\nDirective on NRMM engine emissions with 15 Annexes, which was amended 8 times\r\nwithout recasting, will be repealed.\nThe proposal provides\r\nfor simplification of administrative procedures for public authorities. The\r\nproposal is included in the Commission's rolling programme for up-date and\r\nsimplification of the \u2018acquis communautaire\u2019 and its Legislative Work Programme\r\nunder the reference 2010/ENTR/001.\n\u00b7      Repeal of existing legislation\nThe adoption of the\r\nproposal will lead to the repeal of existing legislation.\n\u00b7      European Economic Area\nThe proposed act\r\nconcerns an EEA matter and should therefore extend to the European Economic\r\nArea.\n2014/0268 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non requirements relating to emission\r\nlimits and type-approval for internal combustion engines for non-road mobile\r\nmachinery\r\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[9],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure[10],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The internal market\r\ncomprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of\r\ngoods, persons, services and capital must be ensured. To this end measures for\r\nthe reduction of air pollution by engines to be installed in non-road mobile\r\nmachinery were established by Directive 97/68/EC of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council[11].\r\nIt is appropriate to pursue efforts in the development and operation of the\r\ninternal market of the Union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The internal market should\r\nbe based on transparent, simple and consistent rules which provide legal\r\ncertainty and clarity from which businesses and consumers alike can benefit.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the aim of\r\nsimplifying and accelerating its adoption, a new regulatory approach has been\r\nintroduced in respect of Union engine type-approval legislation. Accordingly,\r\nthe legislator sets out the fundamental rules and principles and empowers the\r\nCommission to adopt delegated acts concerning further technical details. With\r\nregard to substantive requirements, this Regulation should therefore lay down\r\nonly fundamental provisions on the emission of gaseous and particulate\r\npollutants and empower the Commission to lay down the technical specifications\r\nin delegated acts.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[12] has already\r\nestablished a regulatory framework for the approval and market surveillance of\r\nagricultural and forestry vehicles. Owing to the similarity of the fields and\r\ngiven the positive experience derived from the application of Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 167/2013, many of the rights and obligations established by that Regulation\r\nshould be taken into consideration in respect of non-road machinery. However,\r\nit is essential that a distinct set of rules be adopted to fully take into\r\naccount the specific requirements of engines to be installed in non-road mobile\r\nmachinery.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should\r\ncontain substantive requirements relating to emission limits and EU\r\ntype-approval procedures for engines to be installed in non-road mobile\r\nmachinery. The main elements of the relevant requirements of this Regulation\r\nare based on the results of the impact assessment of 20 November 2013 carried\r\nout by the Commission analysing different options by listing possible\r\nadvantages and disadvantages in terms of economic, environmental, safety and\r\nsocietal aspects. Both qualitative and quantitative aspects were included in that\r\nanalysis. After comparison of the different options, the preferred options were\r\nidentified and chosen to form the basis for this Regulation.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation aims to\r\nlay down harmonised rules for the EU type-approval of engines to be installed\r\nin non-road mobile machinery, with a view to ensuring the functioning of the\r\ninternal market. For these purposes, new emission limits should be established\r\nto reflect technological progress and ensure convergence with Union policies in\r\nthe on-road sector, with a view to achieving Union air quality targets and\r\nreducing the emissions from non-road mobile machinery, thus resulting in a more\r\nproportionate share of machinery emissions in relation to road vehicle\r\nemissions. The scope of Union legislation in this field should be broadened,\r\nwith a view to improving market harmonisation at EU and international level and\r\nminimising the risk of market distortions. In addition, this Regulation aims to\r\nsimplify the current legal framework, including measures for simplifying administrative\r\nprocedures, and to improve the general conditions for enforcement, in\r\nparticular by strengthening the rules on market surveillance.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The requirements set out\r\nin respect of engines for non-road machinery and secondary engines for\r\npassenger and goods vehicles should follow the principles laid down in the\r\nCommission Communication of 5 June 2002 entitled \u2018Action plan \u201cSimplifying and\r\nimproving the regulatory environment\u201d\u2019.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Seventh General Union\r\nEnvironment Action Programme adopted by Decision No 1386/2013/EU of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[13]\r\nrecalls that the Union has agreed to achieve levels of air quality that do not\r\ngive rise to significant negative impacts on, and risks to, human health and\r\nthe environment. Union legislation has established appropriate emission limits\r\nfor ambient air quality for the protection of human health and sensitive\r\nindividuals in particular, as well as for national emission ceilings[14]. Following its\r\nCommunication of 4 May 2001, which established the \u2018Clean Air For Europe (CAFE)\r\nprogramme\u2019, the Commission adopted another Communication on 21 September 2005\r\nentitled \u2018Thematic strategy for air pollution\u2019. One of the conclusions of that\r\nthematic strategy is that further reductions in emissions from the transport\r\nsector (air, maritime and land transport), from households and from the energy,\r\nagricultural and industrial sectors are needed to achieve EU air quality\r\nobjectives. In this context, the task of reducing emissions from engines\r\ninstalled in non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) should be approached as part of\r\nan overall strategy. The Stage V emission limits are one of the measures\r\ndesigned to reduce the actual in-use emissions of air pollutants such as\r\nparticulate pollutants as well as ozone precursors such as nitrogen oxides\r\n(NOx) and hydrocarbons.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 12 June 2012, the World\r\nHealth Organisation (WHO), through its International Agency for Research on\r\nCancer (IARC), reclassified diesel engine exhaust as \u2018carcinogenic to humans\u2019\r\n(Group 1), based on sufficient evidence that exposure is associated with an\r\nincreased risk for lung cancer.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Achieving the Union's air quality objectives requires a continuous effort to reduce engine emissions. For\r\nthat reason, manufacturers should be provided with clear information on future\r\nemission limit values and should be afforded an appropriate period of time in\r\nwhich to attain them and pursue the requisite technical developments.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In setting emission limits\r\nit is important to take into account the implications for competitiveness of\r\nmarkets and manufacturers, the direct and indirect costs imposed on business\r\nand the benefits that accrue in terms of stimulating innovation, improving air\r\nquality, reducing health costs and increasing life expectancy.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Emissions from non-road\r\nmobile machinery engines constitute a significant proportion of the total\r\nman-made emissions of certain noxious atmospheric pollutants. Engines\r\nresponsible for a considerable share of air pollution by nitrogen oxides (NOx)\r\nand particulate matter (PM) should fall within the scope of the new emission\r\nlimit rules.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should keep\r\nunder review emissions which are, as yet, unregulated and which arise as a\r\nconsequence of the wider use of new fuel formulations, engine technologies and\r\nemission control systems. The Commission should also, where necessary, submit a\r\nproposal to the European Parliament and to the Council with a view to\r\nregulating such emissions.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\r\nencourage the introduction of alternative fuel vehicles, which can have low NOx\r\nand particulate emissions. Thus, limit values for total hydrocarbons should be\r\nadapted in order to take into account non-methane hydrocarbons and methane\r\nemissions.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\r\nemissions of ultrafine particulate pollutants (size of 0,1 \u03bcm and below)\r\nare controlled, the Commission should be empowered to adopt a number-based\r\napproach to emissions of particulate pollutants, in addition to the mass-based\r\napproach which is currently used. The number-based approach to emissions of\r\nparticles should draw on the results of the Particulate measurement programme\r\n(PMP) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and be\r\nconsistent with the existing ambitious objectives for the environment.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve these\r\nenvironmental objectives, it is appropriate to indicate that the particle\r\nnumber limits are likely to reflect the highest levels of performance currently\r\nobtained with particle filters by using the best available technology.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should adopt\r\nworldwide harmonised testing cycles in the test procedures that provide the\r\nbasis for EU type-approval emissions regulations. The application of portable\r\nemissions measurement systems for monitoring the actual in-use emissions should\r\nalso be considered.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to better control\r\nactual in-use emissions and to prepare the in-service conformity process, a\r\ntesting methodology for monitoring the emission performance requirements based\r\non the use of portable emission measurement systems should be adopted within an\r\nappropriate timeframe.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The correct functioning of\r\nthe after-treatment system, and more specifically in the case of NOx, is the\r\nbasic requirement for fulfilling the established limits for pollutant\r\nemissions. In this context, measures to guarantee the proper operation of\r\nsystems relying on the use of a reagent should be introduced.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Engines which are in\r\ncompliance with and covered by the scope of the new rules on emission limits\r\nand EU type-approval procedures should be permitted to be placed on the market\r\nin the Member States; those engines should not be subject to any other national\r\nemission requirement. Member State granting approvals should take the necessary\r\nverification measures in order to ensure the identification of engines produced\r\nunder each EU type-approval.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A limited number of\r\nexemptions should be granted to address the specific needs related to armed\r\nforces, logistic supply constraints, field testing of prototypes and the use of\r\nmachinery in explosive atmospheres.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The national authorities\u2019\r\nobligations laid down in the market surveillance provisions of this Regulation\r\nare more specific than the corresponding provisions of Regulation (EC) No\r\n765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council[15].\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\r\nprocedure for monitoring conformity of production, which is one of the\r\ncornerstones of the EU type-approval system, has been correctly implemented and\r\nfunctions properly, manufacturers should be regularly checked by the appointed\r\ncompetent authority or by an appropriately qualified technical service\r\ndesignated for that purpose.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union is a contracting\r\nparty of the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe\r\nconcerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles,\r\nequipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or used on wheeled vehicles and\r\nthe conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of\r\nthese prescriptions (\u2018Revised 1958 Agreement\u2019).\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence, UNECE\r\nregulations and the amendments thereto which the Union has voted in favour of\r\nor to which the Union has acceded, in application of Decision 97/836/EC, should\r\nbe recognized as equivalent to EU type-approvals granted under this Regulation.\r\nAccordingly, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in\r\norder to determine which UNECE regulations will apply to EU type-approvals.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council[16].\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to supplement this\r\nRegulation with further technical details, the power to adopt acts in\r\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion should be delegated to the Commission in respect of engine families,\r\ntampering, monitoring of in-service emission\r\nperformance, technical tests and measurement\r\nprocedures, conformity of production, separate delivery of an engine\u00b4s exhaust\r\nafter-treatment system, engines for field-testing, engines for use in hazardous\r\natmospheres, equivalence of engine type-approvals, information for OEMs and\r\nend-users, self-testing, standards and assessment of technical services, fully\r\nand partially gaseous fuelled engines, measurement of the particulate number\r\nand test cycles. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out\r\nappropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert\r\nlevel. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should\r\nensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\r\ndocuments to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should lay\r\ndown rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and\r\nensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective,\r\nproportionate and dissuasive.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to taking into\r\naccount on-going technical progress and the latest findings in the fields of\r\nresearch and innovation, it is appropriate to identify further pollutant\r\nemission reduction potential of engines installed in non-road mobile machinery.\r\nThe focus of these assessments should be on those engine categories that are\r\nincluded for the first time in the scope of this Regulation and on those for\r\nwhich emission limit values remain unaltered under this Regulation.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the interest of clarity,\r\npredictability, rationality and simplification and in order to reduce the\r\nburden for engine and machinery manufacturers, this Regulation should contain\r\nonly a limited number of implementation stages for the introduction of new\r\nemission levels and type-approval procedures. Timely definition of requirements\r\nis essential to ensuring sufficient lead-time for manufacturers to develop,\r\ntest and implement technical solutions for engines produced in series, and for\r\nmanufacturers and approval authorities in the Member States to put in place the\r\nnecessary administrative systems.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 97/68/EC has been\r\nsubstantially amended several times. In the interests of clarity,\r\npredictability, rationality and simplification, Directive 97/68/EC should be\r\nreplaced by a Regulation and a small number of delegated and implementing acts.\r\nThe use of a Regulation should ensure that the provisions concerned are\r\ndirectly applicable to manufacturers, approval authorities and technical\r\nservices, and that they can be updated much faster and more efficiently to take\r\nbetter account of technical progress.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\r\napplication of the new regulatory system set in place by this Regulation,\r\nDirective 97/68/EC should be repealed with effect from 1 January 2017. This\r\ndate should allow industry sufficient time to adapt to the new provisions laid\r\ndown in this Regulation and to the technical specifications and administrative\r\nprovisions to be set out in the delegated and implementing acts adopted\r\npursuant to this Regulation.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of\r\nthis Regulation, namely to lay down harmonised rules on the administrative and\r\ntechnical requirements relating to emission limits and EU type-approval\r\nprocedures for engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery, cannot be\r\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States, and can therefore, by reason of\r\ntheir scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt\r\nmeasures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in\r\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond\r\nwhat is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes emission limits\r\nfor gaseous pollutants and particulate matter and the

For the sub-categories where an A factor\r\nis defined, the HC limit for fully and partially gaseous fuelled engines\r\nindicated in the table is replaced by the one calculated with the following\r\nformula:\nHC = 0,19 + (1,5*A*GER)\nwhere GER is the average gas energy ratio\r\nover the appropriate cycle. Where both a steady-state and transient test cycle applies,\r\nthe GER shall be determined from the hot-start transient test cycle. Where more\r\nthan one steady-state test cycle applies, the average gas energy ratio shall be\r\ndetermined for each cycle individually.\nIf the calculated limit for HC exceeds the\r\nvalue of 0,19 + A the limit for HC shall be set to 0,19 + A.\nFigure 1. Schematic of HC emission limit as\r\nfunction of average gas energy ratio (GER)\n2. For sub-categories with a combined HC\r\nand NOx limit, the combined limit value for HC and NOx shall be reduced by 0,19\r\ng/kWh and apply for NOx only.\n3.
