The French\r\noutermost regions, however, are excluded from the territorial scope of the VAT\r\nand excise duty directives.\nThe TFEU, in particular Article 110, does\r\nnot in principle authorise any difference in the French outermost regions\r\nbetween the taxation of local products and the taxation of products from\r\nmetropolitan France, the other Member States or non\u2011member countries.\r\nArticle 349 of the TFEU (former Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty) provides,\r\nhowever, for the possibility of introducing specific measures for those regions\r\nbecause of the permanent handicaps which affect the economic and social conditions\r\nof the outermost regions. Such measures concern various policies, including\r\ntaxation.\nCouncil Decision 2004/162/EC of\r\n10 February 2004 (as amended by Council Decisions 2008/439/EC\r\nof 9 June 2008 and 448/2011/EU of 19 July 2011), adopted on\r\nthe basis of Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, authorised France, until\r\n1 July 2014, to apply exemptions or reductions to the \u2018dock dues\u2019 tax\r\nfor certain products produced in the French outermost regions (excluding Saint\r\nMartin). The Annex to that Decision contains a list of the products to\r\nwhich tax exemptions and reductions may be applied. The\r\ndifference between the taxation of locally manufactured products\r\nand that of other products may not exceed 10, 20 or 30 percentage\r\npoints, depending on the product. \nDecision 2004/162/EC sets out the reasons\r\nfor adopting specific measures: remoteness, raw-material and energy dependence,\r\nthe obligation to build up larger stocks, the small size of the local market\r\ncombined with the low level of export activity, etc. The combination of these\r\nhandicaps increases production costs and therefore the cost price of goods\r\nproduced locally, so that without specific measures they would be less\r\ncompetitive than those produced elsewhere, even taking into account the cost of\r\ntransporting such goods to the French overseas departments. This would make it\r\nharder to maintain local production. The specific measures contained in\r\nDecision 2004/162/EC were thus designed to strengthen local industry by making\r\nit more competitive.\nThe French authorities believe that the\r\nhandicaps suffered by the French outermost regions persist and between\r\n25 January and 7 June 2013 they sent several letters to the European\r\nCommission requesting that a system of differentiated taxation similar to the\r\ncurrent system be maintained after 1 July 2014 until 31 December\r\n2020. \nAnalysing the lists of the products to which\r\nthe French authorities wish to apply differentiated taxation is a lengthy\r\nprocess requiring verification, for each product, of the reasons for\r\ndifferential taxation and the proportionality of the tax, so as to ensure that\r\nsuch differential taxation does not undermine the integrity and the coherence\r\nof the Union legal order, including the internal market and common policies.\nThis work has not been completed because of the\r\nlarge number of products involved (several hundred) and the quantity of\r\ninformation to be collected on the structure of the relevant product markets:\r\nexistence of local production, existence of substantial imports (including\r\nthose from metropolitan France and other Member States) that might jeopardise\r\nthe continuation of local production, the absence of any monopoly or\r\nquasi-monopoly in local production, justification of the higher production\r\ncosts that handicap local products as compared with \u2018imported\u2019 products, and\r\nchecks to ensure that a differentiated tax would not be incompatible with other\r\npolicies of the Union.\nFailure to adopt any proposal before\r\n1 July 2014 might create a legal vacuum as it would rule out the\r\napplication of any differentiated taxation in the French outermost regions\r\nafter 1 July 2014, even in the case of products for which differentiated\r\ntaxation would prove justified in the end.\nAn additional period of six months is required\r\nto complete the work under way and to give the Commission time to present a\r\nbalanced proposal that takes account of the various interests at stake.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe relevant directorates-general of the\r\nEuropean Commission have been consulted on the text of this proposal.\nThe Commission has not used an impact\r\nassessment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n Summary of the proposed measures The proposal provides for a six-month extension of the validity of Council Decision 2004/162/EC of 10 February 2004 until 31 December 2014 instead of 1 July 2014. \n Legal basis Article 349 TFEU. \n Principle of subsidiarity Only the Council is authorised, on the basis of Article 349 TFEU, to adopt specific measures to adjust the application of the Treaties to the outermost regions, including the common policies, because of the permanent handicaps which affect the economic and social conditions of those regions. The proposal therefore complies with the principle of subsidiarity. \n Principle of proportionality The proposal complies with the principle of proportionality for the reasons set out below. \n The purpose of the proposal is to extend the existing system by six months to make it possible to complete the full analysis, product by product, of the request to authorise the application of differentiated taxation to offset the handicaps suffered by local products. || \n No other extension will be authorised until this product-by-product analysis of the French authorities' request has been completed. \n Choice of instrument \n Proposed instrument: Council decision. \n Other instruments would not have been appropriate for the following reasons: The text to be amended is itself a Council Decision, adopted on the same legal basis (Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty at the time). \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPACT\nThe proposal has no impact on the European\r\nUnion budget.\n2014/0101 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\namending the period of application of\r\nCouncil Decision 2004/162/EC concerning the dock dues in the French\r\noverseas departments\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 349 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[1],\nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nDecision 2004/162/EC[2]\r\nauthorises France to apply exemptions or reductions to dock dues for products\r\nproduced locally in the French overseas departments and listed in the\r\nAnnex to the Decision. The difference between the taxation\r\nof locally manufactured products and that of other products may not\r\nexceed 10, 20 or 30 percentage points, depending on the\r\nproduct. These exemptions or reductions constitute specific measures designed\r\nto offset the specific constraints facing the outermost regions provided for in\r\nArticle 349 of the Treaty which increase production costs for local\r\ncompanies and make it difficult for their products to compete with the same\r\nproducts imported from metropolitan France and other Member States or non-member countries. The exemptions from or reductions in the dues applicable to\r\nlocal products support the creation, maintenance and development of local\r\nproduction. Decision 2004/162/EC applies until 1 July 2014.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 France believes that the\r\nhandicaps suffered by the French outermost regions persist and has submitted a\r\nrequest to the Commission that a system of differentiated taxation similar to\r\nthe current system be maintained after 1 July 2014 until 31 December\r\n2020.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysing the lists of the\r\nproducts to which France wishes to apply differentiated taxation is a lengthy\r\nprocess requiring verification, for each product, of the reasons for differential\r\ntaxation and its proportionality, so as to ensure that such differentiated\r\ntaxation does not undermine the integrity and the coherence of the Union legal\r\norder, including the internal market and common policies.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This work has not yet been\r\ncompleted because of the large number of products involved and the quantity of\r\ninformation to be collected, in particular the quantification of the higher\r\nproduction costs that handicap local products and the structure of the product\r\nmarkets concerned.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Failure to adopt any\r\nproposal before 1 July 2014 might create a legal vacuum as it would\r\nrule out application of any differentiated taxation in the French outermost\r\nregions after 1 July 2014.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An additional period of\r\nsix months is required to make it possible to complete the work under way and\r\nto give the Commission time to present a balanced proposal that takes account\r\nof the various interests at stake.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2004/162/EC\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nIn Article 1(1) of Decision 2004/162/EC the\r\ndate \u20181 July 2014\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2014\u2019.\nArticle 2\nThis\r\nDecision shall apply from 2 July 2014.\nArticle 3\nThis\r\nDecision is addressed to the French Republic.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2004/162/EC of\r\n10 February 2004 concerning the dock dues in the French overseas\r\ndepartments and extending the period of validity of Decision 89/688/EEC\r\n(OJ L 52, 21.2.2004, p. 64).\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
