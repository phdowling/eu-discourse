These d\u00e9marches consisted inter alia of\r\nactions providing reasons of these d\u00e9marches, its actions, opportunity for the\r\ncountries to respond and refute, right to ask for and provide additional information,\r\nproposed actions plans to remedy the situation as well as adequate time to\r\nanswer and reasonable time to remedy the situation. \nOn 26 November 2013 the Commission, by\r\nCommission Implementing Decision, identified Belize, the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the Republic of Guinea as third countries that the Commission considers\r\nas non-cooperating third countries pursuant to the IUU Regulation.\nOn 24 March 2014 the Council, by Council\r\nImplementing Decision, established a list of non-cooperating third countries,\r\nincluding Belize, the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Republic of Guinea in fighting IUU fishing. \nThe attached proposal for a Council\r\nImplementing Decision is based on the findings which have confirmed that Belize demonstrated that the situation that warranted its listing has been rectified and Belize has taken concrete measures capable of achieving a lasting improvement of the\r\nsituation. \nIt is therefore proposed that the Council\r\nadopts the attached proposal for a Decision.\nLegal basis\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29\r\nSeptember 2008 on establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and\r\neliminate IUU fishing.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\r\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the IUU\r\nRegulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and administrative\r\nburden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local\r\nauthorities, economic operators and citizens is minimised and proportionate to\r\nthe objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: decision.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reason:\nOther means would not be adequate because\r\nthe IUU Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nUnion budget.\n2014/0295 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\namending the list of non-cooperating third\r\ncountries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008\r\nestablishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported\r\nand unregulated fishing \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing, amending Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC)\r\nNo 1936/2001 and (EC) No 601/2004 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1093/94 and\r\n(EC) No 1447/1999[2],\r\nand in particular Article 34(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\r\nthe European Commission \n\u00a0Whereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n1005/2008 (the IUU Regulation) establishes a Union system to prevent, deter and\r\neliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VI of the IUU\r\nRegulation lays down the procedure with respect to the identification of\r\nnon-cooperating third countries, d\u00e9marches in respect of countries identified\r\nas non-cooperating third countries, the establishment of a list of\r\nnon-cooperating countries, removal from the list of non-cooperating countries,\r\npublicity of the list of non-cooperating countries and any emergency measures.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n32 of the IUU Regulation, the \u00a0European Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) notified\r\nby\u00a0 Decision of 15 November 2012[3]\r\n(\"Decision of 15 November 2012\") eight third countries of the\r\npossibility of their being identified as third countries that it considers as\r\nnon-cooperating third countries. Among these countries there was Belize.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Decision of 15\r\nNovember 2012 the Commission included the information concerning the essential\r\nfacts and considerations underlying such possible identification. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also on 15 November 2012\r\nthe Commission notified the eight third countries, among which there was Belize, with separate letters of the fact that it was considering the possibility of\r\nidentifying them as non-cooperating third countries. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Implementing Decision\r\nof 26 November 2013[4]\r\n(\"Implementing Decision of 26 November 2013\"), the\r\nCommission identified Belize, the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Republic of Guinea as non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing. In accordance\r\nwith the IUU Regulation, the Commission provided the reasons for which it\r\nconsidered that those three countries failed to discharge their duties under\r\ninternational law as flag, port, coastal or market States to take action, to\r\nprevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n33 of the IUU Regulation, the Council, by Implementing Decision 2014/170 of 24\r\nMarch 2014[5],\r\n(\"Council Implementing Decision of 24 March 2014\") placed Belize, the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Republic of Guinea on the list of non-cooperating third\r\ncountries in fighting IUU fishing in accordance with the IUU Regulation..\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\u00a0 the\r\nestablishement bythe Council Implementing Decision of 24 March 2014 of the list\r\nof non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing, the Commission\r\noffered to the identified countries the opportunity to continue the dialogue\u00a0\r\nin line with the substantive and procedural requirements laid out in the IUU\r\nRegulation. The Commission continued to seek and verify all information deemed\r\nnecessary, including oral and writen comments, aiming at giving any identified\r\ncountry the opportunity to rectify the situation that warrented its listing,\r\nand to take concrete measures capable of remedying the identified failures.\r\nThis process resulted in the acknowledgement that Belize has rectified the\r\nsituation and taken remedial action.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 34 (1)\r\nof the IUU Regulation the Council should therefore amend the Implementing\r\nDecision of 24 March 2014 by removing Belize from the list of non\u2011cooperating\r\nthird countries.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon the adoption of this\r\nCouncil Implementing Decision removing Belize from the list of non-cooperating\r\nthird countries in accordance with Article 34(1) of the IUU Regulation, the\r\nCommission Implementing Decision of 26 November 2013 identifying Belize as a non-cooperating third country is without object. \n\u00a0\nREMOVAL OF BELIZE FROM THE LIST OF NON-COOPERATING THIRD COUNTRIES\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\u00a0 the adoption of\r\nthe Implementing Decision of 26 November 2013 and Council Implementing Decision\r\n2014/170 of 24 March 2014 the Commission continued the dialogue with Belize. In particular, Belize appears to have implemented the international law obligations\r\nand has adopted an adequate legal framework for fighting against IUU fishing;\r\nit introduced an adequate and efficient monitoring, control and inspection\r\nscheme; it created a deterrent sanctioning system and assured for the proper\r\nimplementation of the catch certification scheme. Belize improved furthermore\r\nits compliance with its international obligations, including those stemming\r\nfrom Regional Fisheries Management Organisations' (RFMOs) recommendations and\r\nresolutions. Belize \u00a0set up a new system of registration of vessels according\r\nto international law. Belize is currently compliant with the recommendations\r\nand resolutions from relevant bodies and has adopted its own National Plan Of\r\nAction against IUU, in line with the International Plan of Action against\r\nIllegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing of the United Nations (IPOA-UN). \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission reviewed the\r\ncurrent compliance of Belize with its international obligations as flag, port,\r\ncoastal or market State in line with the findings in the Decision of 15\r\nNovember 2012, Implementing Decision of 26 November 2013 and Council\r\nImplementing Decision of 24 March 2014 and with relevant information provided\r\nthereon by Belize.\u00a0 It also considered the measures taken to rectify the\r\nsituation as well as the guarantees provided by the competent authorities of Belize. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission concluded, on the basis of all of the above that the actions undertaken by Belize in light of its duties as flag State\r\nare sufficient to comply with the provisions of Articles 91, 94, 117 118 of\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), Articles 18, 19, 20\r\nof United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNSFA) and Article III(8) of FAO\r\nCompliance Agreement. The Commission concluded that the elements put forward by\r\n Belize demonstrate that the situation that warranted the listing of Belize has been rectified and that Belize has taken concrete measures capable of achieving a lasting\r\nimprovement of the situation. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the circumstances and\r\npursuant to Article 34(1) of the IUU Regulation the Council concludes that Belize should be removed from the list of non-cooperating countries. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ndecision taken by the Council does not preclude any subsequent\r\nstep taken by the Commission or the Council in the future, in line with Chapter VI of the IUU Regulation,\r\nin case factual elements were to reveal that Belize fails to discharge the\r\nduties incumbent upon it under international law as flag, port, coastal or\r\nmarket State, to take action to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the adverse\r\nconsequences provoked by a listing as non-cooperating third country, it is\r\nappropriate to give immediate effect to the delisting of Belize as non-cooperating third country. \nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe Annex to Council Decision 2014/170/EU\r\nis replaced by the Annex in this Decision\u00a0 \n\u00a0Article 2\nThis\r\nDecision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in\r\nthe Official Journal of the European Union.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 1.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Decision of 15\r\nNovember 2012 on notifying the third countries that the Commission considers as\r\npossible of being identified as non-cooperating third countries pursuant to\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to\r\nprevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\r\n(OJ C 354, 17.11.2012, p. 1).\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Implementing Decision\r\nof 26 November 2013 identifying the third countries that the Commission\r\nconsiders as non-cooperating third countries pursuant to Council Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and\r\neliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (OJ C 346, 27.11.2013, p.\r\n2).\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Implementing Decision 2014.170 of 24 March\r\n2014 (OJ L 91 27.03.2014, p 43-47) establishing a list of non-cooperating third\r\ncountries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008\r\nestablishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal,\r\nunreported and unregulated fishing.\nANNEX\nList of non-cooperating third countries in\r\nfighting Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing\nto the\nProposal for a COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING\r\nDECISION\namending the list of\r\nnon-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and\r\neliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\nKingdom of Cambodia\nRepublic of Guinea\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
