At\r\nits meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000, the European Council concluded\r\nthat Stabilisation and Association Agreements with Western Balkan countries\r\nshould be preceded by asymmetrical trade liberalisation. Asymmetrical trade\r\nliberalisation has been provided for by means of Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1215/2009 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories\r\nparticipating in or linked to the Stabilisation and Association process.\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1215/2009 applies until 31 December 2015.\nSince the launch of the Stabilisation and Association Process,\r\nStabilisation and Association Agreements have been\r\nconcluded between the Union and all concerned Western Balkan countries, with\r\nthe exception of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo.[1] Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised as a potential\r\ncandidate country for EU accession in 2003 and signed a Stabilisation and\r\nAssociation Agreement in 2008, agreeing to the EU\u2019s conditions for membership. Since\r\nthen, an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related\r\nmatters with Bosnia and Herzegovina applies, pending the finalisation of the ratification process of the Stabilisation\r\nand Association Agreement.\nHaving regard to differences in the scope\r\nof the tariff liberalisation under the contractual regimes which have been\r\ndeveloped between the Union and all participants to the Stabilisation and\r\nAssociation process and the preferences granted under Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1215/2009, it is suggested to prolong the duration of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1215/2009 until 31 December 2020, so as to give the beneficiaries of the\r\nexceptional trade measures and the European Union sufficient time to align,\r\nwhere appropriate, preferences granted under Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 with\r\nthose provided for under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements. Following\r\nthe enlargement of the European Union on 1 July 2013, Bosnia and Herzegovina have not yet accepted to adapt trade concessions granted under the Interim\r\nAgreement in order to take into account the preferential traditional trade\r\nbetween Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina under the Central European Free\r\nTrade Agreement (CEFTA). In case Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union do\r\nnot find an agreement on the adaptation of trade concessions, preferences granted to Bosnia and Herzegovina under Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1215/2009 should be suspended as of 1 January 2016. Once Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union have signed and applied provisionally an agreement\r\non the adaptation of trade concessions in the Interim Agreement, these\r\npreferences will be re-established. \nArticle 21(1) of the EU\r\nTreaty provides that the Union's action on the international scene shall be\r\nguided by the principles which have inspired its own creation, development and\r\nenlargement, and which it seeks to advance in the wider world, including\r\ndemocracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms and respect for human dignity.\r\nThe Union must respect and promote those principles also in its external\r\naction, including its common commercial policy. Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009\r\ndoes not provide any possibility to temporarily suspend the grant of exceptional trade measures in case of serious and systematic violations of the\r\nfundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law by its\r\nbeneficiaries. It is appropriate to introduce such possibility, so as to ensure\r\nthat swift action can be taken in case serious and systematic violations of the\r\nfundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law would\r\noccur in one of the countries and territories\r\nparticipating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and\r\nAssociation process.\nFinally, a technical\r\nadjustment regarding Montenegro's access to the additional global quota for wine\r\nimports is included.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the proposal is\r\nArticle 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposed Regulation does not incur additional\r\ncosts charged to the EU budget. For the years 2015 to 2020 there will be no additional\r\nloss of tariff revenue in respect of products originating\r\nfrom the current beneficiaries. Hypothetical revenue that\r\ncould have been generated by future exports is not considered as a loss of\r\ntariff revenue. \n2014/0197 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1215/2009 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories\r\nparticipating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and\r\nAssociation process and suspending its application with regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1215/2009[2] provides for asymmetrical trade liberalisation between the Union and the Western Balkan countries and territories concerned, granting them the benefit\r\nof exceptional and unlimited duty-free access to the Union market for almost\r\nall their products until 31 December 2015. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n1215/2009 does not provide any possibility to temporarily suspend the grant of exceptional\r\ntrade measures in case of serious and systematic\r\nviolations of the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law by its beneficiaries. It is\r\nappropriate to introduce such possibility, so as to ensure that swift action\r\ncan be taken in case serious and systematic violations of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of human rights,\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law would occur in one of the countries and territories participating in or linked to the European\r\nUnion's Stabilisation and Association process.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to\r\ndifferences in the scope of the tariff liberalisation under the contractual\r\nregimes which have been developed between the Union and all participants to the\r\nStabilisation and Association process and the preferences granted under Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, it is suggested to extend the\r\nperiod of application of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 until 31 December 2020,\r\nso as to give the beneficiaries of the exceptional trade measures and the\r\nEuropean Union sufficient time to align - where appropriate - preferences\r\ngranted under Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 with those provided for under the\r\nStabilisation and Association Agreements. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n1215/2009 provides for a global quota for imports into the Union of wine with\r\nthe Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes 220421 93-220421 98 and 220429 93-220429\r\n98. This quota is accessible to all Western Balkan countries or territories on\r\nexhaustion of their individual wine quota, as stipulated in their bilateral\r\nStabilisation and Association Agreements, with the exception of Montenegro. The Protocol on wine agreed with Montenegro includes a wine quota only for the CN\r\ncodes ex220410 and ex220421, which they have not been in a position to fill.\r\nThis effectively prevents Montenegro from accessing a duty-free wine quota for\r\nproducts not covered by its Stabilisation and Association Agreement In order to\r\nensure that all concerned Western Balkan countries and territories are treated\r\non an equal footing, it is appropriate to provide that Montenegro be also given\r\naccess to the global wine quota for products of CN code 220429, without the need to exhaust the individual\r\nquota.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the launch of the\r\nStabilisation and Association Process, Stabilisation and Association Agreements\r\nhave been concluded with all concerned Western Balkan countries, with the\r\nexception of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo[3].\r\nIn June 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to start negotiations for a\r\nStabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina was recognised as a potential candidate country for accession to\r\nthe Union in 2003 and on 16 June 2008 signed a Stabilisation and Association\r\nAgreement ('the Stabilisation and Association Agreement'), agreeing to the\r\nconditions for membership of the Union. Since then, an\r\nInterim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters with Bosnia and Herzegovina[4] ('the Interim Agreement') applies, pending the finalisation of the ratification process of the Stabilisation\r\nand Association Agreement. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has not yet accepted to adapt trade concessions\r\ngranted under the Interim Agreement in order to take into account the\r\npreferential traditional trade between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina under\r\nthe Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). In case, by the time of the\r\nadoption of this Regulation, an agreement on the adaptation of the trade\r\nconcessions set out in the Stabilisation and Association\r\nAgreement and in the Interim Agreement has not been signed\r\nand provisionally applied by European Union and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the preferences granted to Bosnia and Herzegovina should be suspended\r\nas from 1 January 2016. Once Bosnia-Herzegovina and the European Union will\r\nhave signed and provisionally applied an agreement on the adaptation of trade\r\nconcessions in the Interim Agreement, those preferences should be\r\nre-established,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation\r\n(EC) No 1215/2009 is amended as follows: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 2(1), the following\r\npoint (d) is added:\n\"(d) the abstention of the countries and\r\nterritories referred to in Article 1 from engaging in serious and systematic violations of human rights,\r\nincluding core labour rights, fundamental principles of democracy and the rule\r\nof law.\"\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 12, the second and the third paragraphs are replaced by the following:\n\"It shall apply until 31 December 2020.\"\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Annex I footnote (5)\r\nis replaced by the following text: \n\"(5) Access for wine\r\noriginating in Montenegro to the global tariff quota, insofar as it concerns\r\nproducts of CN code 2204 21, is subject to the prior exhaustion of the\r\nindividual tariff quota provided for in the Protocol on wine concluded with\r\nMontenegro.
