The objectives of the OIV are (i) to inform via publications and\r\norganisation of events and symposiums, (ii) to assist other international\r\norganisations involved in standardisation activities and (iii) to contribute to\r\ninternational harmonisation of existing practices and standards. Currently 45\r\nStates are members of the OIV, among which 21 are Member States of the Union. The EU is currently not a member of the OIV.\nAt EU level, pursuant to Regulation (EU) No\r\n1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013\r\nestablishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (CMO\r\nRegulation, OJ L 347, p. 671), certain resolutions adopted and published by the\r\nOIV affect EU law. The CMO Regulation provides for references to the OIV\r\nresolutions in the following provisions: \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 certain methods of analysis for\r\ndetermining the composition of the products of the wine sector adopted and\r\npublished by the OIV upon which the Commission must base itself unless they\r\nwould be ineffective or inappropriate in view of the objective pursued by the\r\nUnion (Article 80(5) of CMO Regulation);\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 certain purity and\r\nidentification specifications of substances used in oenological practices so\r\nthat the rules adopted and published by the OIV become ipso facto binding on\r\nthis matter within the EU (Article 9 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 606/2009\r\nof 10 July 2009 laying down certain detailed rules for implementing Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 479/2008 as regards the categories of grapevine products,\r\noenological practices and the applicable restrictions, OJ L 193 p. 1);\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 oenological practices adopted\r\nand published by the OIV that the Commission must take into account when it\r\nauthorises such practices (Article 80(3)(a) of CMO Regulation); and \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the same oenological practices\r\nwhere used, prior to their authorisation according to Article 80(3) of CMO\r\nRegulation, for the production of wines in third countries (Article 90(2) of\r\nCMO Regulation).\nSimilarly, pursuant to the Commission\r\nRegulation (EC) No 2870/2000 of 19 December 2000 laying down Community\r\nreference methods for the analysis of spirits drinks (OJ L 333, p. 20) certain\r\nresolutions adopted and published by the OIV affect EU law. Article 3 of\r\nRegulation 2870/2000 provides for reference to OIV resolutions where Community\r\nanalytical reference methods are not laid down for the detection and\r\nquantification of substances contained in a particular spirit drink.\nOn the basis of discussions held within the\r\ngroups of experts meeting to prepare the General Assembly of the OIV, it can be\r\nexpected that the following Resolutions, producing legal effect within the EU\r\nacquis, will be on the agenda of the General Assembly for adoption:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The draft Resolution OENO-TECHNO\r\n12-504 establish a new oenological practice. In accordance with Articles 80(3)(a)\r\nand 90(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, this Resolution will affect the\r\nacquis.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The draft Resolution OENO-SCMA\r\n03-262 establishes the purity and identification specifications of a substance\r\nused in an oenological practice. This oenological practices has been published\r\nand recommended by the OIV on condition that the specifications of the\r\nsubstance used is adopted (OIV International Code of Oenological practices, \u00a7\r\n2.1.20 and \u00a7 3.4.14). In accordance with Articles 80(3)(a) and 90(2) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1308/2013, and with Article 9 of Commission Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 606/2009, this Resolution will affect the acquis.\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The draft Resolutions OENO-SCMA 10-457,\r\n10-458, 11-480 and 12-512 establish methods of analysis. In accordance Article 80(3)(a)\r\nand (5) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, these resolutions will affect the\r\nacquis.\nThe above mentioned resolutions have been\r\nextensively discussed between scientific and technical experts of the wine\r\nsector. They contribute to the international harmonisation of the wine standard\r\nand they will set a framework which will ensure fair competition in the trading\r\nof wine sector products. They should therefore be supported.\nAs in the past, it can be expected that the\r\nagenda of the meeting of the General Assembly of the OIV will still evolve and\r\nthat further Resolutions affecting the acquis will be added to the agenda. In\r\norder to ensure efficiency of the work of the General Assembly while respecting\r\nthe rules of the Treaties, the Commission will in due time supplement and/or\r\namend the present proposal to enable the Council to adopt the position to be\r\ntaken also for these Resolutions.\n2014/0245 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be adopted on\r\nbehalf of the European Union with regard to certain resolutions to be voted in\r\nthe framework of the International Organisation for Vine and Wine (OIV)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43, in conjunction\r\nwith Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The International\r\nOrganisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) is an intergovernmental scientific and\r\ntechnical organisation active in the sector of vine, wine, wine-based drinks,\r\ntable grapes, raisins and other vine products.

Currently 45 States are members of the OIV, among\r\nwhich 21 are Member States of the Union. The EU is currently not a member of\r\nthe OIV.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At EU level, pursuant to\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[1], certain resolutions\r\nadopted and published by the OIV affect EU law. The CMO Regulation provides for\r\nreferences to the OIV resolutions in the following provisions: \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 certain methods of analysis for\r\ndetermining the composition of the products of the wine sector adopted and\r\npublished by the OIV upon which the Commission must base itself unless they\r\nwould be ineffective or inappropriate in view of the objective pursued by the\r\nUnion (Article 80(5) of CMO Regulation);\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 certain purity and identification\r\nspecifications of substances used in oenological practices so that the rules\r\nadopted and published by the OIV become ipso facto binding on this matter\r\nwithin the EU (Article 9 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 606/2009[2];\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 oenological practices adopted and\r\npublished by the OIV that the Commission must take into account when it\r\nauthorises such practices (Article 80(3)(a) of CMO Regulation); and \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the same oenological practices where\r\nused, prior to their authorisation according to Article 80(3) of CMO\r\nRegulation, for the production of wines in third countries (Article 90(2) of\r\nCMO Regulation).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the OIV will take place on 14 November 2014. On that\r\noccasion, the General Assembly will examine and possibly adopt Resolutions\r\nwhich will produce the legal effects referred to.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore necessary\r\nto adopt, before that meeting of the General Assembly of the OIV, the positions\r\nthat the Member States which are members of the OIV, acting jointly in the\r\ninterest of the EU, should take in the General Assembly of the OIV with regard\r\nto these Resolutions.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The draft Resolution\r\nOENO-TECHNO 12-504 establishes a new oenological practice.

This oenological practice has been\r\npublished and recommended by the OIV on condition that the specifications of\r\nthe substance used are adopted (OIV International Code of Oenological\r\npractices, \u00a7 2.1.20 and \u00a7 3.4.14). In accordance with Articles 80(3)(a) and\r\n90(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, and with Article 9 of Commission\r\nRegulation (EC) No 606/2009, this Resolution will affect the acquis.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The draft Resolutions\r\nOENO-SCMA 10-457, 10-458, 11-480 and 12-512 establish methods of analysis.
