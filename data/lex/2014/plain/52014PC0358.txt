New provisions are introduced, such as market\r\nconsultation, the new innovation partnership as a procedure, the introduction\r\nof compliance with environmental, social and labour law as a key requirement, evaluation\r\nof criteria in no particular order, award methodology based on the most economically\r\nadvantageous tender. In addition, concessions for works and services are\r\nintroduced for the first time in the FR and are subject to the same types of\r\nprocedures as public contracts. \nA second group of changes concern\r\nthe articles on exclusion. The grounds for exclusion are clarified and aligned\r\nwith the Directive as well as the possibility for the economic operator\r\nconcerned to take remedial measures. Exclusion is clearly separated from the\r\nrejection from a given procedure to avoid confusion. A single system is set up\r\nfor increasing the protection of the Union financial interests which takes into\r\naccount the existing Central Exclusion Database. The aim of the system is to\r\nensure the early detection and prevention of risk as well as the publication of\r\ninformation related to excluded economic operators. An exclusion panel is set\r\nup to take exclusion decisions after the analysis of the case and it guarantees\r\nthe right of defence of economic operators. \nA third group\r\nof changes is linked to clarifications of the text and simplifications. Within\r\nthe limits of the Directive and below the thresholds where the Directive\r\napplies, provisions concerning procurement\r\nare reviewed in order to ensure consistency of the vocabulary used throughout\r\nthe Title and to clarify certain rules. These clarifications and\r\nsimplifications concern publicity measures above and below thresholds, requirements\r\nfor opening and evaluation, rejection of non-compliant tenders, bank guarantees\r\nfor works and complex services contracts, the fact that Union institutions are\r\nconsidered central contracting authorities according to the Directive, the\r\nreference to applicable Directive thresholds, electronic procedures and the\r\nopening up of procurement by institutions to international organisations. \n2014/0180 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No\r\n966/2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 322 thereof, in\r\nconjunction with the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community,\r\nand in particular Article 106a thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Court\r\nof Auditors[3],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU, Euratom)\r\nNo 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[4] lays down the rules for\r\nthe establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the European\r\nUnion. In particular, it also contains rules on public procurement. On 26\r\nFebruary 2014 Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[5]\r\non public procurement and Directive 2014/23/EU of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council[6]\r\non the award of concession contracts have been adopted. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to adapt Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 in order to take into\r\naccount those Directives for contracts awarded by the Union institutions on\r\ntheir own account. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some definitions should be\r\nadded and certain technical clarifications should be made to ensure that the\r\nterminology of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 is in line with that of\r\nDirectives 2014/24/EU and 2014/23/EU. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ex-ante and ex-post\r\npublicity measures necessary to launch a procurement procedure should be\r\nclarified in the cases of contracts above and below the thresholds set out in\r\nDirective 2014/24/EU.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Regulation (EU,\r\nEuratom) No 966/2012 should include an exhaustive list of all the procurement\r\nprocedures available to the Union institutions regardless of threshold. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with Directive\r\n2014/24/EU, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 should allow for market\r\nconsultation prior to the launch of a procurement procedure. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A single system should be\r\nset up for increasing the protection of the Union financial interests that\r\ntakes into account the existing Central Exclusion Database. The aim of the\r\nsystem should be to ensure the early detection of risk as well as the\r\ncentralisation of excluded economic operators.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the operation of the\r\nearly detection and exclusion system is the responsibility of the Commission\r\nother institutions and bodies should participate directly in the early\r\ndetection of risks. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rules for exclusion\r\nfrom participation in procurement procedures should be improved in order to\r\nstrengthen the protection of the Union's financial interests. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The decision of exclusion\r\nof an economic operator from, in particular, participation in procurement\r\nprocedures, and the imposition of financial penalty should be taken by a newly\r\ncreated centralised panel, set up by the Commission. It should be composed of\r\nthe main concerned actors of the Commission and the institutions, bodies or Union\r\noffices involved. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with Directive\r\n2014/24/EU, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 should specify the list of\r\nillegal activities which constitute ground for exclusion concerning in\r\nparticular child labour or other forms of trafficking\r\nin human beings. It should be clarified that serious breach of a contract\r\nis a ground for exclusion. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The economic operator should\r\nnot be subject to a decision of exclusion when it can demonstrate its\r\nreliability by taking remedial measures. This possibility should not apply in\r\ncase of most severe criminal activities. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The newly created panel\r\nshould exclude the economic operator in case of grave professional misconduct,\r\nfraud, corruption, participation in a criminal organisation, money laundering,\r\nterrorist financing, terrorist related offences, child labour or other forms of\r\ntrafficking in human beings, and serious breach of contract on the basis of\r\nevidence.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The panel should guarantee\r\nthe right of defence of economic operators. In the cases of fraud, corruption\r\nor any other illegal activity affecting the financial interest of the Union which are not yet subject to a final judgement, the panel should be given the\r\npossibility to defer the opportunity given to the economic operator to submit\r\nits observations. This deferral should only be justified where there are\r\ncompelling legitimate grounds to preserve the confidentiality of the\r\ninvestigation. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The economic operator\r\nshould also be excluded by the contracting authority when a final\r\nadministrative decision or a final judgment has been taken in case of grave\r\nprofessional misconduct, non-compliance with the obligations related to the\r\npayment of social security contributions or the payments of taxes, fraud,\r\ncorruption, participation in a criminal organisation, money laundering,\r\nterrorist financing, terrorist related offences, child labour or other forms of\r\ntrafficking in human beings.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The criteria for exclusion should\r\nbe clearly separated from the criteria leading to a possible rejection from a\r\ngiven procedure. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any entity involved in the\r\nimplementation of the budget should share information about an economic\r\noperator when they take a decision of exclusion under their own responsibility\r\nin order to protect the Union\u2019s financial interests. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The duration of exclusion\r\nshould be limited in time, in line with Directive 2014/24/EU. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to improve\r\ndeterrence of the exclusion and financial penalty rules, information related to\r\neconomic operators in exclusion situation should be published on the internet\r\nsite of the Commission in line with data protection requirements set out in\r\nRegulation No 45/2001of the European Parliament and of the Council[7] and in Directive\r\n95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[8]. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with Directive\r\n2014/24/EU, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 should allow to verify exclusion,\r\napply selection and award criteria, as well as to verify compliance with the procurement\r\ndocuments in any order. As a result, it should be possible to reject tenders on\r\nthe basis of award criteria without prior check on exclusion or selection\r\ncriteria of the corresponding tenderer. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The award of contracts\r\nshould be carried out on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender\r\nin line with Directive 2014/24/EU. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be clarified that\r\nall tenders should be opened and evaluated for any procedure and regardless of\r\nwhether a specific opening committee or evaluation committee has been\r\nappointed. An award decision should always be the outcome of an evaluation. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that criteria are applied\r\nin no particular order, it is necessary to provide for the possibility for the rejected\r\ntenderers who submitted compliant tenders to receive the characteristics and\r\nrelative advantages of the successful tender if they so request. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The possibility to require\r\ncontractual guarantees in the case of works, supplies and complex services should\r\nbe provided in order to guarantee compliance with substantial contractual obligations\r\nin line with customary practice in these sectors to ensure proper contract\r\nimplementation throughout its duration. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to provide\r\nfor the possibility to suspend performance of a contract in order to ascertain\r\nwhether errors, irregularities or fraud have occurred. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to determine which\r\nthresholds and procedures are applicable to Union institutions, it is necessary\r\nto clarify that Union institutions are to be considered as central contracting\r\nauthorities as defined in Directive 2014/24/EU. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\r\ninclude a reference to the two thresholds provided for in Directive 2014/24/EU applicable\r\nto works and to supplies and services. These thresholds should also be applicable\r\nto concession contracts for reasons of simplification as well as sound\r\nfinancial management, considering the specificities of the Union institutions'\r\ncontracting needs. The update of these thresholds as provided for in Directive 2014/24/EU\r\nwould therefore be directly applicable to procurement by the Union institutions.\r\n\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to clarify\r\nthe conditions of application of the standstill period. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to clarify\r\nwhich economic operators have access to procurement by Union institutions depending\r\non their place of establishment and to provide explicitly for the possibility\r\nof such access also to international organisations. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The application of\r\nexclusion grounds should be extended to other instruments of execution of the\r\nbudget such as grants, prizes, financial instruments and remunerated experts as\r\nwell as in the case of indirect management. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\r\n966/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly, \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 is\r\namended as follows: \n(1)                   \r\nIn the first subparagraph of Article 60(2), point\r\n(d) is replaced by the following:\n\u201c(d) apply appropriate rules and procedures for\r\nproviding financing from Union funds through procurement, grants, prizes and\r\nfinancial instruments including the obligations set out in Article 108(5);\u201d; \n(2)                   \r\nThe heading of title V of Part One is replaced\r\nby the following: \n\u201cTITLE V \nPUBLIC PROCUREMENT AND CONCESSIONS\u201d; \n(3)                   \r\nIn Chapter 1 of Title V of Part One, the\r\nsections 1, 2 and 3 are replaced by the following: \n\u201cSection 1\nScope and award principles\nArticle 101\nDefinitions for the purpose of this Title\n1. \u2018Procurement\u2019 means the acquisition by means\r\nof a contract of buildings, works, supplies or services by one or more\r\ncontracting authorities from economic operators chosen by those contracting\r\nauthorities.\n2. \u2018Public contract\u2019 means a contract for\r\npecuniary interest concluded in writing between one or more economic operators\r\nand one or more contracting authorities within the meaning of Articles 117 and\r\n190, in order to obtain, against payment of a price paid in whole or in part\r\nfrom the budget, the supply of movable or immovable assets, the execution of\r\nworks or the provision of services. \nPublic contracts comprise: \n(a) building contracts; \n(b) supply contracts; \n(c) works contracts; \n(d) service contracts.\n3. \u2018Concession contract\u2019 means a contract for\r\npecuniary interest concluded in writing between one or more economic operators\r\nand one or more contracting authorities within the meaning of Articles 117 and\r\n190, in order to entrust the execution of works or the management of services\r\nto an economic operator. The remuneration shall consist either solely in the\r\nright to exploit the works or services or in that right together with payment. The\r\naward of a works or services concession shall involve the transfer to the\r\nconcessionaire of an operating risk in exploiting those works or services\r\nencompassing demand or supply risk or both. The concessionaire shall be deemed\r\nto assume operating risk where, under normal operating conditions, it is not\r\nguaranteed to recoup the investments made or the costs incurred in operating\r\nthe works or the services at stake. \n4. \u2018Contract\u2019 means a public contract or a\r\nconcession contract. \n5. \u2018Framework contract\u2019 means a public contract\r\nconcluded between one or more economic operators and one or more contracting\r\nauthorities, the purpose of which is to establish the terms governing contracts\r\nto be awarded during a given period, in particular with regard to price and,\r\nwhere appropriate, the quantity envisaged. \n6. \u2018Economic operator\u2019 means any natural or\r\nlegal person or public entity which offers to supply products, execute works or\r\nprovide services. \n7. \u2018Procurement document\u2019 means any document\r\nproduced or referred to by the contracting authority to describe or determine\r\nelements of the procedure including the publicity measures set out in Article\r\n103, tender specifications or descriptive document, draft contract and\r\ninvitation to tender. \n8. Except for Articles 106 to 108, this Title\r\nshall not apply to grants, or to contracts for technical assistance as defined\r\nin accordance with Article 125(8) concluded with the EIB or the European\r\nInvestment Fund.\n9. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt\r\ndelegated acts in accordance with Article 210 concerning detailed rules on the\r\ndefinition and scope of public and concession contracts, as well as framework\r\ncontracts and specific contracts.\nArticle 102\nPrinciples applicable to procurement\r\nprocedures and contracts\n1.

Procedures with a value below the thresholds\r\nset out in Article 118 or Article 190 shall be advertised by appropriate means.\n3. Publication of certain information on\r\ncontract award may be withheld where its release would impede law enforcement,\r\nor otherwise be contrary to the public interest, would harm the legitimate\r\ncommercial interests of economic operators or might prejudice fair competition\r\nbetween them.\n4. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt\r\ndelegated acts in accordance with Article 210 concerning detailed rules on the\r\nrequirements for the advertising of procedures and publication of notices.\nSection 3\nProcurement procedures\nArticle 104 \nProcurement procedures \n1. Procurement procedures for awarding\r\nconcession or public contracts including framework contracts shall take one of\r\nthe following forms: \n(a) open procedure; \n(b) restricted procedure including through a\r\ndynamic purchasing system; \n(c) design contests; \n(d) negotiated procedure; \n(e) competitive dialogue; \n(f) competitive procedure with negotiation; \n(g) innovation partnership; \n(h) procedures involving a call for expression\r\nof interest. \n2. Where a contract or a framework contract is\r\nof interest to two or more institutions, executive agencies or bodies referred\r\nto in Article 208 and 209, and whenever there is a possibility for realising\r\nefficiency gains, the contracting authorities concerned may carry out the\r\nprocedure and the management of the subsequent direct or framework contract on\r\nan interinstitutional basis under the lead of one of the contracting\r\nauthorities. \nThe bodies established by the Council under the\r\nCFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU may also participate in interinstitutional\r\nprocedures. \nThe terms of a framework contract may only\r\napply between those contracting authorities that are identified for this\r\npurpose from the launch of the procurement procedure and those economic\r\noperators party to the framework contract.\n3. Where a contract or framework contract is\r\nnecessary for the implementation of a joint action between an institution and\r\none or more contracting authorities from Member States, the procurement procedure\r\nmay be carried out jointly by the institution and the contracting authorities,\r\nin certain situations, which are to be specified in the delegated acts adopted\r\npursuant to this Regulation. \nJoint procurement may be conducted with EFTA\r\nstates, and Union candidate countries, if this possibility has been\r\nspecifically provided for in a bilateral or multilateral treaty.\n4. The contracting authority may use the\r\nnegotiated procedure only in cases provided for in the delegated acts adopted\r\npursuant to this Regulation.\n5. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt\r\ndelegated acts in accordance with Article 210 concerning detailed rules on the\r\ntypes of procurement procedures, dynamic purchasing system, joint procurement,\r\nlow value contracts and payment against invoices.\nArticle 105 \nPreparation of a procedure \n1. Before launching a procedure, the\r\ncontracting authority may conduct a preliminary market consultation with a view\r\nto preparing the procurement.\n2. In the procurement documents, the\r\ncontracting authority shall identify the subject matter of the procurement by\r\nproviding a description of its needs and the characteristics required of the\r\nworks, supplies or services to be bought and specify the applicable criteria.\r\nIt shall also indicate which elements define the minimum requirements to be met\r\nby all tenders.\n3. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt\r\ndelegated acts in accordance with Article 210 concerning detailed rules on the\r\ncontent of procurement documents and on the preliminary market consultation. \nArticle 106 \nExclusion criteria\n1. An economic operator shall be excluded from\r\nparticipation in procurement procedures in cases of: \n(a) bankruptcy, insolvency or winding-up\r\nproceedings, assets being administered by the courts or a liquidator, arrangement\r\nwith creditors, suspension of business activities, or any analogous situation\r\narising from a similar procedure provided for in national laws or regulations; \n(b) grave professional misconduct on the basis\r\nof evidence as established by a decision of the panel referred to in Article\r\n108 or by a final judgement or administrative decision;\n(c) non-compliance with the obligations\r\nrelating to the payment of social security contributions or the payment of\r\ntaxes in accordance with the legal provisions of the country in which it is\r\nestablished or with those of the country of the contracting authority or those\r\nof the country where the contract is to be performed as established by a final\r\njudgement or administrative decision; \n(d) fraud, corruption, participation in a\r\ncriminal organisation, money laundering, terrorist financing, terrorist-related\r\noffences, child labour or other forms of trafficking in human beings on the\r\nbasis of evidence established by the panel referred to in Article 108 or as\r\nestablished by a final judgement; \n(e) serious breach of a contract financed by\r\nthe Union\u2019s budget following a decision of the panel referred to in Article 108;\r\n\n(f) irregularity on the basis of evidence\r\nestablished by a decision of the panel referred to in Article 108 or by a final\r\njudgement or administrative decision. \n2. The economic operator shall be excluded\r\nwhere a person who is a member of the administrative, management or supervisory\r\nbody of that economic operator or has powers of representation, decision or\r\ncontrol is in a situation listed in paragraph 1. \n3. Except for cases provided for in point (d)\r\nof paragraph 1, the contracting authority may decide not to exclude the\r\neconomic operator concerned where it has taken remedial measures to demonstrate its reliability. \nFor a limited duration and pending the adoption\r\nof remedial measures referred to in the first subparagraph, the contracting\r\nauthority may decide not to exclude the economic operator concerned where it is\r\nindispensable to ensure the continuity of service. In\r\nsuch cases, the contracting authority shall justify its decision.\n4. Point (a) of paragraph 1 shall not apply in\r\nthe case of the purchase of supplies on particularly advantageous terms from\r\neither a supplier which is definitively winding up its business activities or\r\nthe liquidators in an insolvency procedure, an arrangement with creditors, or a\r\nsimilar procedure under national law. \n5. The\r\neconomic operator shall declare that it is not in one of the situations of\r\nexclusion listed in paragraph 1 of this Article or\r\nthat it is in one of the cases referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article. Where appropriate, the economic operator shall\r\nprovide the same declaration for an entity on whose\r\ncapacity it intends to rely. However,\r\nthe contracting authority may waive these requirements for very low value\r\ncontracts. \n6. Whenever requested by the contracting\r\nauthority, the economic operator shall provide appropriate evidence that it is\r\nnot in one of the situations of exclusion listed in paragraph 1. \nWhenever the contracting authority has doubts\r\nthat paragraph 2 is complied with, the economic operator shall upon request provide\r\ninformation on persons that are members of its administrative, management or\r\nsupervisory body or that have powers of representation, decision or control. It\r\nshall also provide upon request appropriate evidence that one or several of\r\nthose persons are not in one of the situations of exclusion listed in\r\nparagraph 1. \n7. The contracting authority may also verify whether a subcontractor is not in a situation of exclusion\r\nlisted in paragraph 1 of this Article or is in one of the cases referred\r\nto in paragraph 3 of this Article. \n8. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt\r\ndelegated acts in accordance with Article 210 concerning detailed rules on the\r\ndefinition of the situations of exclusion, remedial measures and on declaration\r\nand evidence that an economic operator is not in one of the situations of\r\nexclusion listed in paragraph 1 of this Article.\nArticle 107 \nRejection from a given procedure \n1. A contract shall not be awarded for a given\r\nprocedure to an economic operator who: \n(a) is in one of the situations of exclusion\r\nreferred to in Article 106(1) and (2); \n(b) has misrepresented the information required\r\nas a condition of participation in the procedure; \n(c) was previously involved in the preparation\r\nof procurement documents where this entails a distortion of competition that\r\ncannot be remedied otherwise. \n2. The Commission shall be\r\nempowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 210 concerning\r\ndetailed rules on the measures to avoid distortion of competition and on\r\ndeclaration and evidence that an economic operator is\r\nnot in one of the situations of exclusion listed in paragraph 1 of this Article. \nArticle 108 \nThe early detection and exclusion system\n1.
