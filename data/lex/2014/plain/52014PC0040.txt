"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 29.1.2014\nCOM(2014) 40 final\n2014/0017(COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\non reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n{SWD(2014) 30 final}{SWD(2014) 31 final}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed important regulatory gaps, ineffective supervision, opaque markets and overly-complex products in the financial system. The EU has adopted a range of measures in order to render the banking system more solid and more stable, including strengthened capital requirements, rules on improved governance and supervision and resolution regimes. The progress made on the establishment of the Banking Union is also decisive in this context. \n\n\nThe proposal regarding structural reforms of the EU banking sector, which is presented in a package with this proposal, is the final piece of the new regulatory framework, ensuring that even the largest banks in the EU become less complex and can be effectively resolved, with minimum implications for tax payers. \n\n\nHowever, the crisis highlighted the need to improve transparency and monitoring not only in the traditional banking sector but also in areas where non-bank credit activities took place, called \u201cshadow banking\u201d\n1\n. In practice, shadow banking entities and activities raise funding with deposit-like characteristics, perform maturity or liquidity transformation, allow credit risk transfer or use direct or indirect leverage.\u00a0At the end of 2012 global shadow banking assets accounted for EUR 53 trillion\n2\n, representing about half the size of the regulated banking system\u00a0and mainly concentrated in Europe (around EUR 23 trillion) and in the United States (around EUR 19.3 trillion).\n\n\nActions regarding these matters have been international and coordinated through the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) which initiated a comprehensive work on the identification of key risks of the shadow banking system\n3\n. The overarching aim, as reaffirmed on several occasions by the G20, is to eliminate the dark corners in the financial sector that have a potential impact on systemic risk or merely result from regulatory arbitrage and extend regulation and oversight to all systemically important financial institutions, instruments and markets. In this context, in August 2013, the FSB adopted a policy framework consisting of eleven Recommendations addressing shadow banking risks in securities lending and repos. These Recommendations were subsequently endorsed in September 2013 by the G20 Leaders. The framework covers transparency of securities lending and repo transactions from financial institutions towards authorities as well as between fund managers and end investors, minimum standards for cash collateral reinvestment, rehypothecation of client assets, minimum regulatory standards for collateral valuation and management and evaluation of the introduction of CCPs in inter-dealer repo markets. This Regulation focuses on improving the transparency of securities lending and repo transactions. Transparency is important in order to ensure that authorities and all market actors concerned get an appropriate understanding of how the markets work and the magnitude and nature of any potential risks. In this context, transparency is a fundamental issue since it provides the information necessary to develop effective and efficient policy tools to prevent systemic risks.\n\n\nIn October 2012, the Liikanen report\n4\n concluded that the existing and ongoing regulatory reforms do not address all the underlying problems in the EU banking sector and issued a number of recommendations. The follow-up of these recommendations through the Regulation on structural banking reform, adopted at the same time as this proposal, will ban and put structural constraints on certain trading activities of banks. However, as stated in the Green Paper on shadow banking, adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2012, reinforcing banking regulation could drive a substantial part of banking activities beyond the boundaries of traditional banking and towards shadow banking.\u00a0This would result in an increasingly opaque financial system and offer less scope for control by supervisors. This would come on top of already well-established links which currently exist between the regulated and the shadow banking sectors. Such regulatory arbitrage would greatly undermine the impact of the global and European financial reform efforts, creating substantial risks for financial instability.\u00a0For this reason, the legal proposal on structural reform needs to be accompanied by binding transparency and reporting requirements for SFTs. Thus, these two sets of regulatory measures complement and mutually reinforce each other.\n\n\nConfronted with these new legislative developments in the banking sector, including structural measures, it is possible that banks will shift parts of their activity into less regulated areas as shadow banking. In order to closely follow market trends regarding entities whose activities qualify as shadow banking, in particular in the area of securities financing transactions, it is necessary to implement transparency requirements that could aide supervisors and regulatory authorities in the identification of vulnerabilities as well as possible next steps to deal with any identified issues. \n\n\nIn order to ensure that the benefits achieved by strengthening the resilience of certain actors and markets are not diminished by financial risks moving to less regulated sectors, strengthening transparency and data availability in terms of shadow banking activities is essential. As highlighted in the Commission Communication on shadow banking and in the European Parliament Resolution on shadow banking of November 2012\n5\n, strengthening transparency and data availability, in particular for activities frequently undertaken by the shadow banking sector such as repurchase agreements and securities lending, also called securities financing transactions (SFTs)\n6\n, is essential. In this regard, the work undertaken by the FSB gives some precision about the transparency level that is required. Moreover, it is particularly important in order to observe the risks that may arise due to the interconnectedness of the regulated financial sector and the shadow banking sector, excessive leverage and pro-cyclical behaviour. Such an approach is fully in line with the 2013 FSB recommendations on shadow banking\n7\n, endorsed at the St-Petersburg G20 Summit, to dampen risks and pro-cyclical incentives associated with SFTs and rehypothecation that may exacerbate funding strains in times of market stress.\n\n\nSFTs, other equivalent financing structures and rehypothecation play a vital role in the global financial system. SFTs consist of any transaction that uses assets belonging to the counterparty to generate financing means. In practice, this mostly includes lending or borrowing of securities and commodities, repurchase (repo)\u00a0or reverse repurchase transactions, or buy-sell back or sell-buy back transactions. All these transactions have similar, even identical, economic effects. These techniques are used by almost all actors in the financial system, be they banks, securities dealers, insurance companies, pension funds or investment funds. They provide additional market liquidity, facilitate funding of market participants, support price discovery of tradable assets and enable monetary financing operations of central banks. However, they can also lead to credit creation via maturity and liquidity transformation and allow market participants to build large exposures to each other. The rehypothecation of the collateral to support multiple deals, in particular SFTs, allowed for increased liquidity as well as the build-up of hidden leverage and interconnectedness in the system. \n\n\nWhen confidence in the value of assets, safety of counterparties and investor protection collapsed it created wholesale market runs leading to a sudden deleveraging and/or public safety nets (central bank facilities, etc.). In this context, trust and funding liquidity evaporated and it became impossible for even the biggest and strongest banks to access either short or long-term funding. They contribute to an increase in leverage and strengthen the pro-cyclical nature of the financial system, which then becomes vulnerable to bank runs and sudden deleveraging. While these techniques can have a significant impact on the performance of investment funds, they are currently not properly disclosed to investors. Contrary to other financial institutions, investment funds\u2019 managers are using investor\u2019s money when engaging in SFT activities. Without complete and accurate information regarding the use of SFTs and the potential conflicts of interest that may occur, investors are unable to take informed decisions. Thus, it is fundamental to reduce the lack of transparency of SFTs, other equivalent financing structures and rehypothecation.\n\n\nAgainst this background, this Regulation aims at creating a safer and more transparent financial system and introduces measures to improve the transparency in three main areas: (1) the monitoring of the build-up of systemic risks related to SFT transactions in the financial system; (2) the disclosure of the information on such transactions to the investors whose assets are employed in these or equivalent transactions; and (3) the contractual transparency of rehypothecation activities. In practice, the proposed measures will cover the FSB recommendations 1 and 2 which require competent authorities to collect additional data on the use of SFTs, recommendation 5 which requires fund managers to be transparent towards their investors and recommendation 7 which in particular requires financial intermediaries to provide sufficient disclosure to their clients in relation to re-hypothecation of assets. Thus, these recommendations cover all the transparency aspects linked to the use of SFTs. To this end, this Regulation  complements the proposed Regulation on structural reform of banks.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe Commission launched a public consultation alongside its Green Paper on shadow banking on 19 March 2012. The input from stakeholders was wide and substantial. There was general support for a Commission initiative in this area and a growing consensus that supervision and a strengthened regulatory framework are needed to address the shadow banking system. The European Parliament's own-initiative report on shadow banking also highlighted the importance of appropriate measures in this area. Moreover, in November 2012 in preparing its international recommendations on shadow banking, the FSB conducted a public consultation on relevant problems in SFT markets, inter alia, the lack of transparency. As part of this consultation, there was broad support for more transparency in the securities lending and repo markets, while many respondents suggested taking into account existing reporting requirements and other available market data. Many stakeholders also agreed that trade repositories are likely to be the most effective way of collecting comprehensive repo and securities lending market data.\n\n\nA more targeted public consultation on different UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) issues was conducted in 2012 and stakeholders were notably asked about the need to increase the transparency requirements for investment funds. The Commission obtained a wealth of information about the current transparency standards in the asset management sector, as well as views on the possible ways to improve the transparency toward investors.\n\n\nThis initiative also reflects discussions with all major stakeholders, including securities and banking regulators, the ECB and all types of market participants. It takes into consideration the views expressed in a public consultation on shadow banking in 2012. The views of Member States were also sought. \n\n\nAn Inter-service Steering Group on bank structural reform was established in March 2013 with representatives from the Directorate Generals COMP, ECFIN, EMPL, ENTR, JUST, MARKT, SG, SJ, TAXUD and the JRC. The Impact Assessment Steering Group met in March 2013, April 2013 and September 2013 and supported the work on the Impact Assessment. The draft Impact Assessment was discussed with the Impact Assessment Board (the \u201cIAB\u201d) of the Commission on 16 October 2013. Following a negative opinion, a revised Impact Assessment was submitted in December 2013. \n\n\nThe impact assessment identifies three main problems in relation to securities financing transactions: the fact that regulators are unable to effectively monitor the use of SFTs, that there are risks that SFTs are used at the detriment of fund investors and that rehypothecation shifts the legal and economic risks in the market. Underlying all these problems are the core issues that were also identified by the FSB, namely the absence of comprehensive (frequent and granular) data on SFTs and that risk that SFTs create conflicts of interests between fund managers and fund investors.\n\n\nIn order to address the problems identified, the impact assessment concludes that a combination of different measures is necessary including reporting of SFTs to trade repositories, disclosure on the use of SFTs to fund investors and the need for prior consent to rehypothecation of the financial instruments and that these financial instruments are transferred to an account opened in the name of the receiving counterparty before rehypothecation can take place. This will ensure that the shadow banking activity of using SFTs is properly supervised and regulated. The use of SFTs as such will not be prohibited nor limited by specific restrictions but be more transparent. As such the retained options are not expected to create structural impacts on the SFT market. The retained options will increase the reporting costs for the counterparties but this increase will be outweighed by the benefits of having greater transparency for the competent authorities, clients, investors and society at large. \n\n\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n3.1.Legal basis\n\n\n\nThe legal basis for the proposal is Article 114(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which allows the adoption of measures for the approximation of national provisions aiming at the establishment and functioning of the internal market.\n\n\nThe FSB Recommendations and the developments envisaged following the structural reform of the Union banking sectior are likely to trigger the regulatory attention of Member States aiming to address the need for enhancing transparency of the activities that might migrate away from regulated banking groups towards shadow banks, where there may be less scope for control by supervisors. Uniform rules on transparency are thus needed to enhance financial stability, protect investors, enhance the cross-border provision of services and prevent regulatory arbitrage, and to prevent diverging national measures from creating obstacles to the smooth functioning of the internal market.. \n\n\n3.2.Subsidiarity\n\n\nUnder the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the TFEU, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive responsibility, the EU should act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at EU level. \n\n\nThis proposal aims at ensuring transparency of securities financing transactions, rehypothecation and other financing structures. The interlinkages of these shadow banking activities within the Internal Market and their systematic nature call for a coordinated Union action.\n\n\nThe majority of securities financing transactions as well as rehypothecation activities are performed on a cross-border basis between entities that often do not have their seats in the same jurisdiction and involve assets and currencies issued in different jurisdictions. Acting at the Union level is the minimum to cover a wide range of transactions and to allow regulatory authorities at national and Union level to have a comprehensive overview of the SFTs markets across the entire EU. The effectiveness of remedies implemented in an autonomous and uncoordinated way by individual Member States would likely be very low as such remedies would be able to capture just a portion of the market. Furthermore, given the systemic impact of the problems, uncoordinated action may even prove counterproductive because of the risk of data fragmentation and incoherence. Only aggregated data at the Union level can give the necessary macroeconomic picture that is required to monitor the use of SFTs. \n\n\nAs regards investment funds, the European fund industry has an important cross-border dimension. The share of cross-border assets for the European investment funds industry as a whole (UCITS and non-UCITS assets under management) has more than doubled during the last decade. As of 2012 around one of two investors buy a fund that is not domiciled in its country of residence. It is therefore important that the investor protection standards are applied evenly across the EU in order to ensure that all European investors benefit from the needed transparency over the use of SFTs.\n\n\n3.3.Proportionality\n\n\nUnder the principle of proportionality set out in Article 5 of the TFEU, the content and form of EU action should not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties.\n\n\nBy refraining from regulating other than introducing transparency of securities transactions, rehypothecation and other financing structures, the proposal is limited to the measures necessary to allow for an effective removal of the risks posed by shadow banking entities.\n\n\nThe Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n\n\n3.4.Detailed explanation of the proposal \n\n\nThe proposed Regulation contains measures addressing reporting of SFTs to trade repositories (Chapter II and III), reporting requirement on funds (Chapter IV) and requirements on counterparties engaging in rehypothecation (Chapter V). The remaining chapters, on scope and definitions (Chapter I), supervision and competent authorities (Chapter VI), relationships with third countries (Chapter VII), administrative sanctions and measures (Chapter VIII) and review and final provisions (Chapters IX and X) apply to all these parts.\n\n\nThis section briefly outlines the main components of this regulation. \n\n\n3.4.1.Scope of proposal (Chapter I)\n\n\nThis Regulation aims at enhancing financial stability in the EU by means of increasing transparency of certain market activities, such as SFTs, rehypothecation and other financing structures having equivalent economic effect as SFTs. It applies to all counterparties in SFT markets, investment funds as defined by Directives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU and any counterparty engaging in rehypothecation. The proposed Regulation covers all financial instruments provided as collateral as listed in Annex I Section C of Directive 2004/39/EC (MiFID).\n\n\n3.4.2.Transparency of SFTs\u00a0including registration and supervision of trade repositories (Chapters II and III)\n\n\n\n\nThis Regulation creates a Union framework under which financial or non-financial counterparties of a SFT will efficiently report the details of the transaction to trade repositories. This information will be centrally stored and easily and directly accessible to the relevant authorities, such as ESMA, ESRB, the ESCB, for the purpose of identification and monitoring of financial stability risks entailed by shadow banking activities of regulated and non-regulated entities. These provisions are in line with the FSB recommendations which state that jurisdictions should decide on the most appropriate way to collect data and build on existing data collection processes and market infrastructures where appropriate. The FSB further states that trade repositories are likely to be an effective way of collecting such data.\n\n\nThis reporting should, to the extent possible, minimise respective operational costs for market participants and, thus, be built around pre-existing infrastructures and processes. ESMA should consider the existing standards established by Regulation 648/2012/EC and regulating trade repositories for derivative contracts and their future developments when drawing up or proposing to revise the regulatory technical standards foreseen in this Regulation.\n\n\n3.4.3.Transparency towards investor (Chapter IV)\n\n\nThe new provisions on transparency of the use of SFTs and other financing structures rules, set by this Regulation, are closely linked to Directives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU since they form the legal framework governing the establishment, management and marketing of collective investment undertakings. In order to enable investors to become aware of the risks associated with the use of SFTs and other financing structures, fund managers should include detailed information on any recourse they have to these techniques in regular reporting intervals. The existing periodical reports that UCITS management or investment companies and AIF managers have to produce will be supplemented by this additional information on the use of SFTs and other financing structures. These new rules on transparency supplement the provisions of Directives 2009/65/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU on AIFMs. These new uniform rules on transparency of SFT and other financing structures should apply in addition to those laid down in Directives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU. These provisions are in line with the FSB Recommendations which state that authorities should review reporting requirements for fund managers to end-investors against the FSB proposal and consider whether any gaps need to be addressed.\n\n\n3.4.4.Transparency of rehypothecation (Chapter V)\n\n\nIn order to increase contractual and operational transparency minimum information requirements should be imposed to counterparties engaging in rehypothecation. Any rehypothecation should therefore take place only with the express knowledge of inherent risks and prior consent of the providing counterparty in a contractual agreement and should be appropriately reflected in the securities accounts. The counterparty receiving financial instruments as collateral will be allowed to rehypothecate them only with the express consent of the providing counterparty and only after having them transferred to its own account. This requirement should be read in addition to Directive 2002/47/EC and Directive 2004/39/EC. The FSB Recommendations state that authorities should ensure that the regulation of client assets should provide sufficient disclosure to clients in relation to rehypothecation for clients to understand the risks. This Regulation is in line with this Recommendation.\n\n\n3.4.5.Supervision and competent authorities (Chapter VI)\n\n\nThe proposed Regulation defines the rules for designating competent authorities, for different purposes, including authorisation, registration, supervision and enforcement of the measures regarding reporting of SFTs to trade repositories and engaging in rehypothecation. After being notified by Member States, ESMA has to publish a list of the competent authorities and update it continuously on its website.\n\n\nThis Regulation entrusts the supervision of compliance with rules on investment fund\u2019s transparency to the competent authorities already designated by Member States under Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to UCITS and Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM). The reporting of as well as the compliance with rules on rehypothecation should be supervised by competent authorities designated by Member States according to Article 16 of this Regulation.\n\n\n3.4.6.Relationships with third countries (Chapter VII)\n\n\nGiven the global nature of securities financing transactions, relevant authorities of different jurisdictions have to be able to access data held at trade repositories located in different jurisdictions. In order to ensure mutual direct access to data by the relevant authorities, Article 19 of this Regulation empowers the Commission to conclude cooperation agreements with relevant third countries, provided professional secrecy, including the protection of business secrets shared by the authorities with third parties, is ensured. \n\n\n3.4.7.Administrative sanctions and measures (Chapter VIII)\n\n\nMember States need to provide that appropriate administrative sanctions and measures can be applied to breaches of the proposed Regulation. To this end, a minimum set of administrative sanctions and measures should be available to the competent authorities, including withdrawal of authorisation, public warnings, dismissal of management, restitution of profits gained from the breaches of this Regulation where those can be determined, and administrative fines. When determining the type and level of sanctions, the competent authorities should take into account a number of criteria set in the Regulation, including the size and financial strength of the responsible person, the impact of the violation and the cooperative behaviour of the responsible person. The proposed Regulation does not prevent individual Member States from fixing higher standards.\n\n\n3.4.8.Review (Chapter IX)\n\n\nThe adoption of this Regulation would constitute the first set of transparency rules on SFTs, other financing structures and rehypothecation at EU level. It is therefore important to assess whether the measures described above have proved to be an effective and efficient way of achieving greater transparency of these activities. Therefore, three years after the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission will report on the suitability of the transparency measures and, if appropriate, submit a revised proposal.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\n\n\nThe financial and budgetary impact of the proposal is indicated in the legislative financial statement attached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2014/0017 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\non reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n8\n, \n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank\n9\n,\n\n\nAfter consulting the European Data Protection Supervisor\n10\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The 2008 global financial crisis revealed important regulatory gaps, ineffective supervision, opaque markets and overly-complex products in the financial system. The Union has adopted a range of measures in order to render the banking system more solid and more stable, including strengthening capital requirements, rules on improved governance and supervision and resolution regimes. The progress made on the establishment of the banking union is also decisive in this context. However, the crisis also highlighted the need to improve transparency and monitoring not only in the traditional banking sector but also in areas where non-bank credit activities take place, called \u201cshadow banking\u201d.\n\n\n(2)In the context of its work to curb shadow banking, the Financial Stability Board (the \"FSB\") and the European Systemic Risk Board (the \"ESRB\") have identified the risks that securities financing transactions (\"SFTs\") pose. SFTs allow for the build-up of leverage, pro-cyclicality and interconnectedness in the financial markets. In particular, a lack of transparency in the use of securities financing transactions (\"SFTs\") and other financing structures has prevented regulators and supervisors as well as investors from correctly assessing and monitoring the respective bank-like risks and level of interconnectedness in the financial system in the period preceding and during the financial crisis. Against this background, on 29 August 2013, the FSB adopted a policy framework for addressing shadow banking risks in securities lending and repos. This was subsequently endorsed in September 2013 by the G20 Leaders.\n\n\n(3)In March 2012, the Commission published a Green Paper on Shadow Banking. Based on the extensive feedback received and taking into account international developments, the Commission published on 4 September 2013, a Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on Shadow Banking\n11\n. The Communication stressed that the complex and opaque nature of SFTs makes it difficult to identify counterparties and monitor risk concentration. This also leads to the built-up of excessive leverage in the financial system.\n\n\n(4)A High-Level Expert Group chaired by Erkki Liikanen adopted a report on reforming the structure of the Union banking sector in October 2012. It discussed among other things the interaction between the traditional and the shadow banking systems. The report recognised the risks of shadow banking activities such as high leverage and pro-cyclicality, and it called for a reduction of the interconnectedness between banks and the shadow banking system, which had been a source of contagion in a system-wide banking crisis. The report also suggested certain structural measures to deal with remaining weaknesses in the Union banking sector.\n\n\n(5)Structural reforms of the Union banking system are dealt with in a separate legal proposal. However, imposing structural measures on banks could result in certain activities being shifted to less regulated areas such as the shadow banking sector. For these reasons, the legal proposal on structural reform of the Union banking sector should be accompanied by the binding transparency and reporting requirements for SFTs set out in this Regulation. Thus, the transparency rules of this Regulation complement the Union\u00a0structural reform rules.\n\n\n(6)This Regulation responds to the need to enhance transparency of securities financing markets and thus of the financial system. In order to ensure equivalent conditions of competition and international convergence,\u00a0this Regulation follows the FSB Recommendations.\u00a0It creates a Union framework under which information on SFTs can be efficiently reported to trade repositories and investors. This need for international convergence is reinforced by the probability that following structural reform of the Union banking sector activities that are currently exercised by traditional banks might migrate to the shadow banking sector and encompass financial and non-financial entities. Therefore, even less transparency may arise for regulators and supervisors in respect of those activities, preventing them from obtaining a proper overview of the risks linked to securities financing transactions. This would only aggravate already wellestablished links between the regulated and the shadow banking sectors in particular markets.\n\n\n(7)In order to respond to the issues raised by the FSB Recommendations and the developments envisaged following structural reform of the Union banking sector, Member States are likely to adopt divergent national measures which could create obstacles to the smooth functioning of the internal market and be to the detriment of market participants and financial stability. In addition, the lack of harmonised transparency rules makes it difficult for national authorities to compare the micro-level data stemming from different Member States and thus to understand the real risks individual market participants pose to the system. It is therefore necessary to prevent such distortions and obstacles from arising in the Union. Consequently, the appropriate legal basis for this Regulation should be Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"TFUE\"), as interpreted in accordance with the consistent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n\n(8)The new rules on transparency therefore provide for the reporting of details regarding SFTs concluded by all market participants, whereas they are financial or non-financial entities, including the composition of the underlying collateral, if the underlying collateral is available for use or has been used, and the haircuts applied. For reasons of efficiency, respective operational costs for market participants should be minimised and, thus, the new rules should build on pre-existing infrastructures and processes. Therefore, it is important that this legal framework is, to the extent possible, identical to that of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n12\n\u00a0in respect of the reporting of derivative contracts to trade repositories registered for that purpose. This should also enable trade repositories authorised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012/EC to fulfil the repository function assigned by the new rules, if they comply with certain additional criteria.\n\n\n\n\n(9)As a result, information on the risks inherent in securities financing markets will be centrally stored and easily and directly accessible, among others, to the European Securities and Markets Authority (\"ESMA\"), the European Banking Authority (\"EBA\"), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (\"EIOPA\"), the relevant competent authorities, the ESRB and the relevant central banks of the European System of Central Banks (\"ESCB\"), including the European Central Bank (\"ECB\"), for the purpose of identification and monitoring of financial stability risks entailed by shadow banking activities of regulated and non-regulated entities. ESMA should consider the existing standards established by Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No  648/2012/EC and regulating trade repositories for derivative contracts and their future developments when drawing up or proposing to revise the regulatory technical standards provided for in this Regulation and aim to ensure that the relevant competent authorities, the ESRB and the relevant central banks of the ESCB, including the ECB, have direct and immediate access to all the information necessary to perform their duties.\n\n\n(10)Without prejudice to the provisions of criminal or tax law, the competent authorities, ESMA, bodies or natural or legal persons other than the competent authorities, which receive confidential information, should use it only in the performance of their duties and for the exercise of their functions. However, this should not prevent the exercise, in accordance with national law, of the functions of national bodies responsible for the prevention, investigation or correction of cases of maladministration.\n\n\n(11)SFTs are used extensively by fund managers for efficient portfolio management. This use can have a significant impact on the performance of those funds. They can be used either to fulfil investment objectives or to enhance returns. Managers also have the possibility to use other financing structures that have effects equivalent to SFTs. Those other financing structures include total return swaps, liquidity swaps or collateral swaps. They are also extensively used by fund managers to get exposure to certain strategies or to enhance the returns. Both SFTs and other financing structures have in common that they increase the general risk profile of the fund whereas their use is not properly disclosed to investors. It is crucial to ensure that investors in such funds are able to make informed choices and to assess the overall risk and reward profile of investment funds.\n\n\n(12)Investments made on the basis of incomplete or inaccurate information as regards a fund's investment strategy can result in significant investor losses. It is therefore essential that investment funds disclose all relevant information linked to their use of SFTs. In addition, full transparency is especially relevant in the area of investment funds as the entirety of assets that are subject to SFTs are not owned by the fund managers but by the fund investors. Full disclosure as regards SFTs is therefore an essential tool to safeguard against possible conflicts of interest.\n\n\n(13)The new rules on transparency of SFTs and other financing structures are closely linked to Directives 2009/65/EC\n13\n and 2011/61/EU\u00a0of the European Parliament and of the Council\n14\n since they form the legal framework governing the establishment, management and marketing of collective investment undertakings.\n\n\n(14)Collective investment undertakings may operate as undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (\"UCITS\") managed by UCITS managers or investment companies authorised under Directive 2009/65/EC or as AIFs managed by alternative investment fund managers (\"AIFMs\") authorised or registered under Directive 2011/61/EU. These new rules on transparency supplement the provisions of those Directives. Hence, these new uniform rules on transparency of SFT and other financing structures should apply in addition to those laid down in Directives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU. \n\n\n(15)In order to enable investors to become aware of the risks associated with the use of SFTs and other financing structures, fund managers should include detailed information on any recourse they have to these techniques in regular reporting intervals. The existing periodical reports that UCITS management or investment companies and AIF managers have to produce should be supplemented by the additional information on the use of SFTs and other financing structures.\n\n\n(16)A fund's investment policy with respect to SFTs and other financing structures should be clearly disclosed in the pre-contractual documents, such as the prospectus for the UCITS funds and the pre-contractual disclosure to investors for the AIFs. This should ensure that investors understand and appreciate the inherent risks before they decide to invest in a particular UCITS and AIF.\n\n\n(17)Re-hypothecation provides liquidity and enables counterparties reducing funding costs. However, it creates complex collateral chains between traditional banking and shadow banking, posing financial stability risks. The lack of transparency on the extent to which financial instruments provided as collateral have been re-hypothecated and the respective risks in case of bankruptcy can undermine confidence in counterparties and magnify risks to financial stability.\n\n\n(18)This Regulation establishes information rules towards counterparties on rehypothecation which should not prejudice the application of sectorial rules adapted to specific actors, structures and situations. Therefore, the rules on re-hypothecation provided for in this Regulation should apply, for example, to funds and depositories only insofar as there are no more stringent rules on re-use foreseen within the framework for investment funds constituting a lex specialis and taking precedence over the rules contained in this Regulation. In particular, this Regulation should be without prejudice to any rule restricting the ability of counterparties to engage in rehypothecation of financial instruments that are provided as collateral by counterparties or persons other than counterparties.\n\n\n(19)In order to ensure compliance by counterparties, with the obligations deriving from this Regulation and to ensure that they are subject to similar treatment across the Union, administrative sanctions and measures which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive should be ensured. Therefore, administrative sanctions and measures set by this Regulation should satisfy certain essential requirements in relation to addressees, criteria to be taken into account when applying a sanction or measure, publication of sanctions or measures, key sanctioning powers and levels of administrative pecuniary sanctions. It is appropriate that measures and sanctions established under Directives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU apply to infringements of the investment funds transparency obligations under this Regulation. \n\n\n(20)Technical standards in the financial services sector should ensure consistent harmonisation and adequate protection of depositors, investors and consumers across the Union. As a body with highly specialised expertise, it is efficient and appropriate to entrust the ESMA with the elaboration of draft regulatory technical and implementing standards, which do not involve policy choices. ESMA should ensure efficient administrative and reporting processes when drafting technical standards. The Commission should be empowered to adopt regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n15\n\u00a0in the following areas: the details of the different types of SFTs, the details of the application for registration of a trade repository, and the frequency and the details of publication of and access to trade repositories' data. \n\n\n(21)The Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing technical standards developed by ESMA by means of implementing acts pursuant to Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 with regard to the format and frequency of the reports, , the format of the application for registration of a trade repository, as well as the procedures and forms for exchange of information on sanctions with ESMA. \n\n\n(22)The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the list of entities that should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation in order to avoid limiting their power to perform their tasks of common interest; specific details concerning definitions; the type of fees, the matters for which fees are due, the amount of the fees and the manner in which they are to be paid by trade repositories, and of the amendment of the the Annex in order to update information on SFT as well as other financing structures and information to investors. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n\n\n(23)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to take decisions on the assessment of rules from third countries for the purposes of recognition of third country trade repositories\n\n\n(24)In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate to ensure the transparency of certain market activities such as SFTs, rehypothecation and, where appropriate, other financing structures and to enable the monitoring and identification of the corresponding risks to financial stability. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Treaty on the European Union. \n\n\n(25)This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to the protection of personal data, the right to respect private and family life, the right to defence and the principle of ne bis in idem, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to property, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial. This Regulation must be applied according to these rights and principles.\n\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter I\n\n\nSubject, matter and scope\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nSubject matter\n\n\nThis Regulation lays down rules on the transparency of securities financing transactions (SFTs), other financing structures and rehypothecation.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nScope\n\n\n1.This Regulation shall apply to:\n\n\n(a)a counterparty to a SFT that is established: \n\n\n(1)in the Union, including all its branches irrespective of where they are located;

A decision of revocation shall put an end to the delegation of the power specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the publication of the decision in the Official Journal\u00a0of the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of any delegated acts already in force. \n\n\n4.As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n\n\n5.A delegated act adopted pursuant to Articles\u00a02(3), 3, 4, 11(2), 13(3) and 14(3) shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of 2 months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by 2 months at the initiative of the European Parliament or the Council.\n\n\nArticle 28\n\n\nEntry into force and application\n\n\n1.This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\n2.This Regulation shall apply from the date of entry into force, with the exception of:\n\n\n(a)Article 4(1), which shall apply 18 months after the date of entry into force; and\n\n\n(b)Articles 13 and 14, which shall apply 6 months after the date of entry into force.\n\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\nFor the European Parliament\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\n\nThe President\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n\n\n1.FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n1.1.Title of the proposal/initiative\n\n\n1.2.Policy area(s) concerned in the ABM/ABB structure\n\n\n1.3.Nature of the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.4.Objective(s)\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) envisaged \n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\n\n3.2.Estimated impact on expenditure\u00a0\n\n\n3.2.1.Summary of estimated impact on expenditure \n\n\n3.2.2.Estimated impact on operational appropriations \n\n\n3.2.3.Estimated impact on appropriations of an administrative nature\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4.Compatibility with the current multiannual financial framework\n\n\n3.2.5.Third-party contributions \n\n\n3.3.Estimated impact on revenue\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n\n\n1.FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n1.1.Title of the proposal/initiative \n\n\nRegulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions\n\n\n1.2.Policy area(s) concerned in the ABM/ABB structure\n17\n\u00a0\n\n\nInternal Market \u2013 Financial markets\n\n\n1.3.Nature of the proposal/initiative \n\n\n\uf0fd The proposal/initiative relates to a new action\n\n\n1.4.Objective(s)\n\n\n1.4.1.The Commission's multiannual strategic objective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative\u00a0\n\n\nContribute to reducing the risks to financial stability and restoring investor and other market participants' confidence in financial markets \n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\n\nIn the light of the general objectives above, the regulation aims at increasing the overall transparency of securities financing markets and rehypothecation, thus supporting the improved monitoring of these activities by supervisors and investors. It will contribute to the effective prevention of built-up of systemic risks and interconnectedness within the financial sector leading to systemic risk;\n\n\n1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\n\nIncreased transparecy  of securities financing transactions vis-\u00e0-vis supervisors;\n\n\nIncreased transparency of securities financing transactions and other financing structures vis-\u00e0-vis investors;\n\n\n\n\nIncreased operational and contractual transparency of rehypothecation vis-\u00e0-vis involved parties\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\nRelevant indicators to evaluate the proposal could include:\n\n\n\uf0b7size of different segments of SFT markets\n\n\n\uf0b7level of interconnectedness and market concentration\n\n\n\uf0b7proportion of SFTs in overall fund\n\n\n\uf0b7qualitative indicators on funds' disclosure of SFTs activities \n\n\n\uf0b7size of rehypothecation activities\n\n\n\uf0b7collateral velocity\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\nThe proposal regarding structural reforms of the EU banking sector, which is presented in a package with this proposal, is the final piece of the new regulatory framework, ensuring that even the largest banks in the EU become less complex and can be effectively resolved, with minimum implications for tax payers. However, the crisis highlighted the need to improve transparency and monitoring not only in the traditional banking sector but also in areas where non-bank credit activities took place, called \u201cshadow banking\u201d. \n\n\nIn the context of shadow banking, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the European Systemic Risk Board have identified the risks that SFTs present for both traditional banking and shadow banking. SFTs allow for the build-up of leverage, pro-cyclicality and interconnectedness in the financial markets. In particular, a lack of transparency in the use of SFTs and other financing structures has prevented regulators and supervisors as well as investors from correctly assessing and monitoring the respective bank-like risks and level of interconnectedness in the financial system in the period preceding and during the financial crisis. \n\n\nAgainst this background, on 29 August 2013, the FSB adopted a policy framework for addressing shadow banking risks in securities lending and repos. This was subsequently endorsed in September 2013 by the G20 Leaders and calls for granular and frequent reporting of SFTs, adequate disclosure of SFT activities to investors and specific rules on rehypothecation.\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement \n\n\nThis proposal aims at ensuring transparency of securities financing transactions, rehypothecation and other financing structures. The interlinkages of these shadow banking activities within the Internal Market and their systematic nature call for a coordinated Union action. Acting at the Union level is the minimum to cover a wide range of transactions and to allow regulatory authorities at national and Union level to have a comprehensive overview of the SFTs markets across the entire EU. The effectiveness of remedies implemented in an autonomous and uncoordinated way by individual Member States would likely be very low as such remedies would be able to capture just a portion of the market. Furthermore, given the systemic impact of the problems, uncoordinated action may even prove counterproductive because of the risk of data fragmentation and incoherence. Only aggregated data at the Union level can give the necessary macroeconomic picture that is required to monitor the use of SFTs.\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\u00a0\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments \n\n\n\n\nThe EU has already initiated a number of reforms to increase the transparency of financial markets. For instance, the Regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (European Market Infrastructure Regulation (the \"EMIR\") introduces measures to increase transparency of positions in derivatives for regulators as well as reduce systemic risks for market participants. EMIR ensures that information on all European derivative contracts are reported to trade repositories and directly and immediately accessible to supervisory authorities, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), to give policy makers and supervisors a clear overview of the derivatives markets. This Regulation will pursue the same transparency objectives, building on existing Regulation and entities (trade repositories authorised under EMIR) to allow going forward in the transparency of financial markets by providing more transparency on securities financing transactions. In addition, other legislative proposals already or shortly to be, adopted by the Commission complement this proposal in terms of increasing market transparency and integrity as well as containing market disorder and reinforce investor protection. This is the case of the current revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (\"MiFID\") which notably provides for transparency measures towards competent authorities. The proposed Regulation also complements AIFMD and UCITS Directives concerning the transparency towards investors of SFTs and other financing structures. It is consistent with these Union texts. It is also consistent with the priorities outlined by the European Commission in its Communication on Shadow \u2013 Addressing New Sources of Risk in the Financial Sector of the 4th of September 2013, which strengthened the need to increase transparency of securities financing transactions.\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\uf0fd Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\nEntry into force and start of application foreseen for 2015/2017.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n18\n\u00a0\n\n\nFrom the 2014 budget\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies; \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\uf0fd\u00a0Indirect management by delegating implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \"Comments\" section.\n\n\n\n\nComments \n\n\nESMA is a regulatory agency acting under the oversight of the Commission.\u00a0\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nThe proposal foresees that the Commission should review the effectiveness of the proposed measures on a periodic basis. \n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified\n\n\nIn relation to the legal, economical, efficient and effective use of appropriations resulting from the proposal it is expected that the proposal would not bring about new risks that would not be currently covered by an ESMA existing internal control framework.\n\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n2.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nFor the purposes of combating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) shall apply to the ESMA without any restriction.\n\n\nESMA shall accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and shall immediately adopt appropriate provisions for all EBA and ESMA staff.\n\n\nThe funding decisions and the agreements and the implementing instruments resulting from them shall explicitly stipulate that the Court of Auditors and OLAF may, if need be, carry out on-the-spot checks on the beneficiaries of monies disbursed by ESMA as well as on the staff responsible for allocating these monies.\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected\u00a0\n\n\n\uf0b7Existing budget lines \n\n\nIn order of multiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeading of multiannual financial framework\n\n\n\n\nBudget line\n\n\n\n\nType of \n\nexpenditure\n\n\n\n\nContribution \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiff./non-diff.\n\n(\n19\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom EFTA countries\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom candidate countries\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom third countries\n\n\n\n\nwithin the meaning of Article 21(2)(b) of the Financial Regulation \n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7New budget lines requested \n\n\n3.2.Estimated impact on expenditure \n\n\n\nThis legislative initiative will have the following impacts on expenditures:\n\n\nThe hiring of two new TA at ESMA (as from January 2016) - See in Annex for more information on its role and the way its cost was calculated.

ESMA's additional expenses generated by this legislative initiative - see Annex for more information on the calculation method\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex to the Legislative Financial Statement for a proposal for Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions\n\n\n\nThe costs related to the tasks to be carried out by ESMA have been estimated for staff expenditure in conformity with the cost classification in the ESMA draft budget for 2015. \n\n\nThe proposal of the Commission includes provisions for ESMA to develop three regulatory technical standards and four implementing technical standards that should ensure that provisions of a highly technical nature are consistently implemented across the EU. ESMA will have to supervise trade repositories for SFTs and to provide input into a Commission report on the implementation and effectiveness of the Regulation. ESMA will also provide the Commission with technical advice on the foreseen Commission delegated acts. In addition, ESMA may establish cooperation arrangements with relevant authorities of third countries as well as recognise trade repositories established in a third country.\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the timing, it has been assumed that the Regulation will enter into force in end-2015. The additional ESMA resources are therefore only required from 2016. As regards the nature of the positions, the successful and timely delivery of new technical standards will require, in particular, additional resources to be allocated to tasks on policy, legal drafting and impact assessment. The work requires bilateral and multilateral meetings with stakeholders, analysis and assessment of options and drafting of consultation documents, public consultation of stakeholders, setting up and management of standing expert groups composed of supervisors from Member States, setting up and management of ad hoc expert groups composed of market participants and representatives of investors, analysis of the responses to consultations, drafting of cost/benefit analysis and drafting of the legal text.\n\n\nThe required work is closely related to the existing technical standards under EMIR that regulate the framework for trade repositories for derivative contracts. So far, there have been 6 trade repositories registered under EMIR and it is expected that a similar number of trade repositories for SFTs will apply for registration. Once registered, those will have to be supervised by ESMA. Thus, taking account of the number of trade repositories for SFTs to be supervised, the number, type and complexity of tasks to be fulfilled by ESMA, the impact on the number of full time equivalents needed to develop technical standards and to carry out new additional tasks will be limited to 2 temporary agents.\n\n\nThis means that two additional temporary agents are needed from 2016. It is assumed that this increased will be maintained in 2017 and 2018 since ESMA will have new supervisory tasks for trade repositories for SFTs. These new tasks are set out in the proposed Regulation and further spelled out in the explanatory memorandum.
