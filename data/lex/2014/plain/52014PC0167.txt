Pension systems across the European\r\nUnion (EU) have to adapt in order to ensure adequate, safe and sustainable\r\npensions. This is not a simple matter. Effectively addressing these challenges\r\nrequires closely coordinated action by Member States. The proposed revision of Directive\r\n2003/41/EC on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational\r\nretirement provision (IORPs)[1]\r\nwill make those institutions better governed, more transparent and increasing\r\ntheir cross-border activity, thereby strengthening the internal market. \nIn a number of respects the Directive's review is long overdue. \nFirst, higher governance standards reflecting best practices at\r\nnational level following the economic and financial crisis are needed to\r\nprotect scheme members and beneficiaries, and facilitate safe cross-border\r\nprovisioning. Some IORPs are large financial institutions, and their failure\r\ncould impact on financial stability and have significant social consequences. This\r\nis particularly relevant as more and more occupational\r\npensions are defined-contribution (DC) schemes. The\r\npensions of the members of these schemes are at risk in case of possible\r\ninsufficient risk governance or mismanagement.[2]\r\n\u00a0\nSecond, regulatory divergences, overlapping requirements, and\r\nexcessively burdensome cross-border procedures must be reduced. Commission's\r\nconsultations have shown that these are one of the obstacles to develop\r\ncross-border occupational pensions markets, and reducing those obstacles would\r\nhelp companies, including SMEs and multinationals, to organise their pension\r\nprovision on a European scale more efficiently.[3]\r\nCross-border IORPs, such as the pan-European pension fund for mobile\r\nresearchers[4]\r\nor a planned cross-border scheme for Austrian employers[5] are limited today. But the\r\nincreasing pressure on the \u00a0occupational pensions sector is likely to grow\r\nsignificantly in view of increasingly limited public pensions systems, and\r\ncross-border IORPs have the potential to represent an increasing share in\r\noccupational pension provision. In fact, new legislation has been introduced in\r\nseveral Member States aimed at positioning them as locations of choice for\r\ncross-border IORPs.[6]\r\n\nThird, there is evidence of significant gaps in the level of information\r\nprovided to scheme members and beneficiaries across the EU. Many scheme members\r\nare not aware that their pension rights are not guaranteed or even if accrued\r\nthat they could be cut by IORPs, contrary to other financial contracts.[7] They are also often not\r\naware that charges have a significant impact on pension rights.\nThis proposal builds on a number of initiatives launched in recent\r\nyears such as the White Paper on pensions[8]\r\nand the Green Paper on long-term financing of the European economy.[9] Following on from this\r\nlast Paper, the revision of the Directive also aims to strengthen the capacity\r\nof IORPs to invest in assets with a long-term economic profile and support the\r\nfinancing of sustainable growth in the real economy.\nThe IORP sector is being developed in many Member States where\r\noccupational pensions so far play a limited role, including by setting up\r\nregulatory frameworks. \u00a0Failing to provide an up-to-date EU regulatory\r\nframework now entails the risk that Member States continue to develop diverging\r\nsolutions, thereby exacerbating regulatory fragmentation. Furthermore, improvements\r\nto the performance of occupational pensions require long periods of time to\r\nmaterialise. Failing to act now would lead to lost opportunities in terms of\r\ncost savings and investment returns, and inadequate financial planning by\r\nmillions of Europeans. It would also increase the burden disproportionately for\r\nyounger generations and undermine inter-generational solidarity. \nThis proposal does not consider the introduction of new solvency\r\nrules, which are in any event not relevant for DC schemes. Moreover, a quantitative\r\nimpact study[10]\r\nconducted by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)\r\nin 2013 indicated that more complete data on solvency aspects are necessary\r\nbefore a decision can be taken on those aspects.\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objectives of the proposal\nThe general objective of this proposal is to facilitate the\r\ndevelopment of occupational retirement savings. Safer, more efficient occupational\r\npensions will contribute to pension adequacy and sustainability by enhancing\r\nthe contribution of complementary retirement savings to retirement incomes. It\r\nwill also reinforce IORPs' role as institutional investors in the EU\u2019s real\r\neconomy and enhance the capacity of the European economy to channel long-term\r\nsavings to growth-enhancing investment.\nThis proposal has four specific objectives: (1) removing remaining\r\nprudential barriers for cross-border IORPs, notably by requiring that the rules\r\non investment and disclosure of information to members and beneficiaries are\r\nthose of the home Member State, as well as by clarifying procedures for\r\ncross-border activities and clearly defining the scope of action of home and\r\nhost Member State; (2) ensuring good governance and risk management; (3)\r\nproviding clear and relevant information to members and beneficiaries; and (4)\r\nensuring that supervisors have the necessary tools to effectively supervise\r\nIORPs.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with other\r\npolicies and objectives of the Union\nThe objectives of this proposal are consistent with the policies and\r\nobjectives pursued by the Union. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion (TFEU) provides for action to ensure the establishment and functioning of\r\nthe internal market with a high level of consumer protection, as well as the\r\nfreedom to provide services.\nThis proposal is in line with the White Paper on pensions. At the\r\nsame time it is consistent with the Europe 2020 strategy, which calls for\r\nfiscal consolidation and long-term financial sustainability to go hand in hand\r\nwith structural reform of pension systems in Member States.[11] Finally, this proposal is consistent with other initiatives in the\r\nfield of financial services, such as Solvency II[12], AIFMD[13] and MiFID II[14]. As such it falls well\r\nwithin the scope of the Commission's agenda towards a stronger financial sector\r\nto support growth.[15] \nThe proposal promotes human rights by protecting retirement\r\nprovision. It is in line with Article 25 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of\r\nthe EU which calls for recognition and respect for the rights of the elderly to\r\nlead a life of dignity and independence. The proposed actions would have a\r\npositive impact on consumer protection under Article 38 and freedom to conduct\r\nbusiness under Article 16, in particular by ensuring a higher level of\r\ntransparency of retirement provisioning, informed personal financial and\r\nretirement planning as well as facilitating cross-border business of IORPs and\r\ntheir sponsors. The general objective justifies certain limitations on the\r\nfreedom to conduct a business (Article 16) as the proposal aims at ensuring the\r\nmarket integrity and stability.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Results of consultation\r\nwith interested parties and impact assessment\nThis proposal builds on multiple public consultations regarding\r\nrequirements on quantitative aspects, governance and information disclosures.\r\nGiven the specific nature of the IORP activities, the consultations consistenly\r\nincluded the social partners (employers and trade unions). In July 2010, the\r\nCommission consulted on its Green Paper on pensions in which it outlined a number\r\nof its ideas regarding this review.[16] The consultation drew almost 1700 responses from across the EU,\r\nincluding 350 from Member States, national parliaments, business and trade union\r\norganisations, civil society and industry representatives.[17] \nTaking into account the feedback on the Green Paper on pensions, the\r\nCommission Services asked EIOPA in April 2011 to provide technical advice on\r\nhow to change the Directive. EIOPA recommended that - taking into account the\r\nprinciple of proportionality - the governance framework set out in the Solvency\r\nII Directive should apply to IORPs. The publication of the draft advice[18] was followed by an\r\nextensive consultation.[19] EIOPA delivered its final advice in February 2012, on the basis of\r\nwhich Directorate-General for Internal Market and Services organised an\r\nexchange of views amongst stakeholders during a public hearing on 1 March 2012.\r\nSubsequently, the Commission Services conducted a Quantitative Impact Study on the\r\nquantitative requirements, as well as a study on administrative burden for aspects\r\nrelating to governance and information disclosures. Both studies built on the\r\ncontributions from the industry and social partners.\nThis proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment report that\r\nconsiders a range of policy options and sub-options. The report was first\r\nsubmitted to the Impact Assessment Board on 4 September 2013. The Board asked\r\nfor resubmission with additional information on the views of the different\r\nstakeholder groups, problem definition, subsidiarity and proporionality aspects,\r\noptions and expected impacts. The report was revised accordingly and the main\r\nchanges were: (i) a more comprensive description of the views of the Member\r\nStates and different stakeholder categories; (ii) a more detailed explanation of\r\nthe problems being addressed by the proposed action; (iii) as regards\r\nsubsidiarity, a more detailed description of the case for EU action; (iv) a\r\nclarification that further harmonisation of supervisory reporting is not being\r\nproposed; (v) a new section on the impact of the initiative on small and\r\nmedium-sized enterprises; and (vi) a more detailed description of the\r\nassumptions used in the calculation of the expected benefits and costs of the\r\nvarious options. The impact assessment was resubmitted on 16 October 2013. On 6\r\nNovember the Board stated it could not issue a positive opinion and requested some\r\nfurther amendments. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal elements of the\r\nproposal \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThis proposal recasts Directive 2003/41/EC.\r\nIt simultaneously codifies its unchanged provisions and amends it. The legal\r\nbases of Directive 2003/41/EC are ex-Articles 47(2), 55 and 95 EC (currently\r\nArticles 53, 62 and 114(1) TFEU).\nThe proposal maintains the legal bases of the\r\nDirective. It seeks both to establish the internal market by means of freedom\r\nto provide services and freedom of establishment when regulating the taking-up\r\nand pursuit of activities as self-employed persons and when establishing a high\r\nlevel of protection for consumers.\nDirective 2003/41/EC regulates areas such\r\nas the conditions of operations of IORPs, including a common approach to\r\nregistration or authorisation, rules and procedures to be followed when IORPs\r\nwish to offer their services in other Member States, quantitative solvency\r\nrules, investment rules based on the prudent person principle, requirements on\r\nthe effective management, including fit and proper requirements, the use of\r\ninternal audit and actuarial services, risk management requirements, the use of\r\ndepositories, information to be disclosed to members and beneficiaries and\r\nsupervisory powers and reporting obligations. \nThis proposal further builds on these\r\nelements. As to the information to be disclosed by the IORP it, for example,\r\nintroduces an EU-wide pension benefit statement. With regard to effective\r\nmanagement of IORPs it lays down more detailed rules on fit and proper and key functions\r\nincluding risk management. The proposal also aims to facilitate cross-border\r\nactivity. \nThe two objectives of Directive 2003/41/EC\r\nare retained. Neither of the objectives is secondary or indirect in relation to\r\nthe other. For example, the professionalization of IORP management by defining\r\nthe tasks and responsibilities of key management staff and the introduction of\r\na forward-looking self-risk assessment strengthens consumer protection. Conversely,\r\nbetter information through the pension benefit statement empowers members and\r\nbeneficiaries to hold IORP management more accountable. A higher level of harmonisation\r\nof those requirements facilitates cross-border activity by reducing transaction\r\ncosts and stimulating market innovation.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality\nEU level action in this field adds value because action by Member\r\nStates alone will not: (i) remove obstacles to cross-border activities of\r\nIORPs; (ii) ensure a higher EU-wide minimum level of consumer protection; (iii)\r\nlead to scale economies, risk diversification and innovation inherent to\r\ncross-border activity; (iv) avoid regulatory arbitrage between financial\r\nservices sectors; (v) avoid regulatory arbitrage between Member States; and\r\n(vi) take into account the interests of cross-border workers.\nUnder the proposed action, Member States retain full responsibility\r\nfor the organisation of their pension systems. The revision does not call this\r\nprerogative into question. Neither does the revision cover issues of national\r\nsocial and labour, fiscal or contract legislation.\nThe proposal complies with the principle of proportionality, as\r\nenshrined in Article 5(4) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). The selected\r\npolicy options seek to strike a balance between public interest, the protection\r\nof members and beneficiaries, as well as the costs for institutions, sponsors\r\nand supervisors. The options have been carefully considered, crafted as minimum\r\nstandards and tailored taken into account different business models. This is\r\nwhy, overall, the proposal will stimulate occupational retirement provision. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 References to other\r\ndirectives\nThis proposal is a recast exercise and refers to Directives\r\n2003/41/EC, 2009/138/EC, 2010/78/EU[20],\r\n2011/61/EU and 2013/14/EU[21].\r\nDirective 2003/41/EC will be repealed by this Directive.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed explanation of\r\nthe proposal\nAs this is a recast of Directive 2003/41/EC, the detailed\r\nexplanation below focusses solely on new provisions or provisions that are to\r\nbe amended.\nTitle I \u2013 GENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 6 now includes new and/or clarified\r\ndefinitions of \"sponsoring undertaking\",\r\n\"home Member State\", \"host Member State\", \"transferring\"\r\nand \"receiving\" institutions, \"regulated market\",\r\n\"multilateral trading facility\", \"organised trading facility\",\r\n\"durable medium\" and \"key functions\".\nArticle 9, in conjunction with Article\r\n10, no longer list the conditions of operation separately but give\r\nresponsibility to Member States to ensure that every institution is registered\r\nor authorised and that they have properly constituted rules for the pension\r\nscheme. \nArticle 12 is amended in three ways.\r\nFirst, it specifies that an institution carries out cross-border activity when\r\nit operates a pension scheme that is subject to the social and labour law of\r\nanother Member State, including in situations where the institution and the\r\nsponsoring undertaking are located in the same Member State.[22] Second, paragraph 4\r\nrequires a reasoned decision by a competent authority of the home Member State, should the authority ban cross-border activity. Moreover, where a competent\r\nauthority of the home Member State does not notify a competent authority of the\r\nhost Member State, it shall give reasons for its refusal. Third, the host Member State may no longer impose additional information requirements on institutions\r\ncarrying out cross-border activities. This is because the proposal introduces a\r\nstandardised pension benefit statement (see Articles 40 to 54).\nArticle 13 lays down new rules for the\r\ncross-border transfer of pension schemes which must be subject to prior\r\nauthorisation by a competent authority of the home Member State of the\r\nreceiving institution. Unless national social and labour law on the\r\norganisation of pension systems provides otherwise, the transfer and its\r\nconditions shall be subject to prior approval by members and beneficiaries\r\nconcerned or, where applicable, their representatives. Article 13 also\r\nincludes rules on exchange of information concerning the applicable social and\r\nlabour law under which the pension scheme must be operated. Should, following\r\nthe transfer, the receiving institution carry out a cross-border activity, Article\r\n12(8) and (9) apply. The institution will operate the pension scheme\r\nin accordance with the social and labour law of the host Member State[23], thereby not changing\r\nthe level of protection of the members and beneficiaries concerned by the\r\ntransfer.\nTitle II \u2013 QUANTITATIVE REQUIREMENTS\nArticle 20 on investment rules is\r\nmodified in three ways. First, the host Member State may no longer impose\r\nadditional investment rules on institutions carrying out cross-border activities.\r\nThis facilitates the organisation of investment management, in particular for defined\r\ncontribution schemes. This does not undermine the protection of members and\r\nbeneficiaries because it is matched by strenthened governance and supervisory\r\nrules. Second, Article 20(6)(a) has been updated to reflect the terminology\r\nused in Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 [MiFIR]. Third, it replaces the ambiguous term\r\n'risk capital markets' (Article 20(6) (c)) with a terminology that\r\nbetter reflects the original meaning of this provision, namely that Member\r\nStates cannot restrict institutions from investing in long-term instruments\r\nthat are not traded on regulated markets. Moreover, investment rules should not\r\nrestrict investment in non-listed assets that finance low carbon and climate\r\nresilient infrastructure projects.\nA further harmonisation of rules relating to the financial solvency\r\nsituation of the institution is not being proposed.\nTitle III \u2013 CONDITIONS GOVERNING ACTIVITIES\nFor small IORPs, the proposal maintains the possibility for Member\r\nStates to exclude institutions managing schemes which together have less than\r\n100 members in total. For other IORPs, specific measures, for instance on the key\r\nfunctions and risk evaluation, ensure that governance requirements are\r\nproportionate.\nCHAPTER 1 \u2013 System of governance\nExcept for Articles 31 and 32 (ex Articles 10 and 12),\r\nthis Title is new to the Directive and lays down new detailed governance\r\nrequirements for IORPs.\nArticle 21 sets out that the\r\nadministrative, management or supervisory body of the IORP is ultimately\r\nresponsible for the IORP's compliance with the laws, regulations and\r\nadministrative provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. The rules on\r\ngovernance of IORPs are without prejudice to the role of social partners in\r\ntheir management.\nArticle 22 establishes that institutions\r\nneed to have in place an effective system of governance which provides for\r\nsound and prudent management of their activities. This system shall be\r\nproportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the activities of the IORPso\r\nas to ensure that the governance requirements will not be too burdensome for\r\nexample for small institutions.\nArticle 23 requires IORPs to ensure that\r\nall persons who effectively run the IORP or have key functions have\r\nprofessional qualifications, knowledge and experience which are adequate to\r\nenable sound and prudent management of the IORP or to properly perform their\r\nkey functions (fit) and that they are of good repute and integrity (proper).\nArticle 24 sets out that institutions must\r\nhave a sound remuneration policy and that this policy is disclosed publicly. The\r\narticle also proposes to empower the Commission to adopt a delegated act.\nArticle 25 sets out the general\r\nprinciples on key functions. IORPs may allow a single person or organisational\r\nunit to carry out more than one key function, but shall at all times allocate\r\nthe risk management function to a different person or organisational unit than\r\nthe internal audit function.\nArticle 26 states that IORPs need to\r\nhave in place an effective risk-management system which is necessary to\r\nidentify, monitor, manage and report on a continuous basis all risks, including\r\nthose related to outsourced or subsequently re-outsourced activities, to which\r\nthey are or could be exposed, and their interdependencies. The risk management\r\nshould be proportionate to the size, internal organisation and the nature,\r\nscope and complexity of the institution's activities.\nArticle 27 provides for an effective\r\ninternal audit function which evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the\r\ninternal control system and other elements of its system of governance,\r\nincluding outsourced or subsequently re-outsourced activities. The internal\r\naudit function is to be assumed by at least one independent person, inside or\r\noutside of the institution.\nArticle 28 requires an effective\r\nactuarial function to co-ordinate and oversee the calculation of technical\r\nprovisions as well as to assess the appropriateness of the methodologies and\r\nunderlying models, where members and beneficiaries do not bear all the risks.\nArticle 29 sets out that institutions\r\nneed to produce a risk evaluation for pensions regularly and without delay\r\nfollowing any significant change in the institution's risk profile. The evaluation\r\nneeds to demonstrate the compatibility of a number of elements in line with national\r\nrequirements. The evaluation should include new or emerging risks relating to\r\nclimate change, use of resources and the environment. The risk evaluation for\r\npensions should be proportionate to the size, internal organisation and the\r\nnature, scope and complexity of the institution's activities.\nArticle 30 proposes to empower the\r\nCommission to adopt a delegated act with regard to the risk evaluation for\r\npensions.\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 Outsourcing and investment\r\nmanagement\nArticle 33 lays\r\ndown the rules for contracting to third parties (outsourcing), including\r\nre-outsourced activities.\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 Depositary\nArticles 35 to 37 set out that IORPs\r\nneed to appoint a single depositary for safe-keeping of assets and oversight duties\r\nif members and beneficiaries fully bear the investment risk.\nTitle IV \u2013 INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN TO\r\nTHE PROSPECTIVE MEMBERS, MEMBERS AND BENEFICIARIES\nCHAPTER 1 \u2013 General provisions\nThis Chapter lays down the details of the information to be provided\r\nto members, prospective members, and after retirement, beneficiaries and\r\nbuilding on former Article 11. \nArticle 38 sets out the general\r\nprinciple for information disclosures.\nArticle 39 lays down the type of\r\ninformation that members (and beneficiaries) need to receive, such as the\r\nrights and obligations of the parties, the risks and investment options and\r\nwhether these are default or not. The conditions of the particular pension\r\nscheme must be published on a website by the institution concerned.\nArticle 40 places an obligation on IORPs\r\nto provide, every twelve months, a pension benefit statement (\u2018PBS\u2019) for the\r\nindividual in the clearest possible way, also as a basis to feed information into\r\na potential pension tracking service as described in the White Paper on\r\npensions.[24]\r\nWhere Member States already provide for comprehensive information to\r\nindividuals covering one or more pension pillars, they will maintain the\r\nflexibility to design their pension information systems, as long as they comply\r\nwith the requirements of this proposal.\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 Pension Benefit Statement \nArticles 40 to 44 lay down general\r\nprovisions for the PBS - which is intended for active members of the pension\r\nscheme. The idea of the PBS is based on EIOPA\u2019s Advice to the European\r\nCommission on the review of the IORP Directive, draws on national best\r\npractices in several Member States and international work developed by the OECD[25]. The PBS ensures\r\ncomparability with information required by legislation in other financial\r\nsectors such as the key investor document for open investment funds (UCITS),\r\nwhile taking into account the specificites of the occupational pensions sector.\r\nMoreover, the PBS leaves sufficient leeway for Member States to introduce more\r\nspecific requirements and integrated systems allowing for comparability between\r\ndifferent pillars of the pension system.\nThe standardisation of the PBS should enable automatisation of the\r\nregular production of the PBS and its potential outsourcing, thereby keeping\r\ncosts low in particular for smaller institutions. \nArticles 46 to 53 lay down the\r\ncomponents of the PBS which shall be read together with Article 45. The\r\ncompenents are as follows:\n\u00b7                        \r\npersonal details of the member;\n\u00b7                        \r\nidentification of the institution;\n\u00b7                        \r\nguarantees;\n\u00b7                        \r\nbalance, contributions and costs;\n\u00b7                        \r\npension projections;\n\u00b7                        \r\ninvestment profile;\n\u00b7                        \r\npast performance; and\n\u00b7                        \r\nsupplementary information.\nArticle 54 proposes to empower the\r\nCommission to adopt a delegated act with regard to the PBS.\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 Other information and documents\r\nto be provided\nThis Chapter relates to information that should be provided by IORPs\r\nto members and beneficiaries in different pension stages such as just before\r\nenrolment, just before retirement or during the pay-out phase.\nArticle 55 lays down specific rules for IORP\r\nto provide information to prospective members prior to joining the IORP 's\r\npension scheme.\nArticle 56 lays down the information to\r\nbe given to members before retirement. This should be provided in addition to\r\nthe PBS, at least two years before retirement, whether that is predefined or\r\nnot.\nArticle 57 details the information to be\r\ngiven to beneficiaries during the pay-out phase. This information to\r\nbeneficiaries should replace the PBS. \nArticle 58 lays down information to be\r\ngiven on request by members and beneficiaries.\nTitle V - PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION\nCHAPTER 1 \u2013 General\r\nrules on prudential supervision\nArticle 59 designates the protection of\r\nscheme members and beneficiaries as the main objective of prudential\r\nsupervision.\nArticle 60 defines which areas are to be\r\nunderstood as belonging to prudential supervision in the context of this\r\nDirective. This Article takes away the legal uncertainty for IORPs caused by\r\ndifferences in scope of Member States\u2019 prudential regulation.\nArticle 61 sets out the general\r\nprinciples of prudential supervision. It, for example, lays down that the\r\ncompetent authority of the home Member State has the sole responsibility for\r\nthe prudential supervision of all IORPs authorised or registered in its\r\njurisdiction. The article furthermore establishes the principle that\r\nsupervision of IORPs needs to be prospective and risk-based, as well as timely\r\nand proportionate.\nArticle 63 introduces the supervisory\r\nreview process which aims to identify IORPs with financial, organisational or other features susceptible to\r\nproducing a higher risk profile.\nArticle 64 ensures that all the new\r\nrequirements introduced by this prosposal are reflected\r\nin the power attributed to competent authorities with regard to the provision\r\nof information.\nArticle 65 sets out that competent\r\nauthorities need to conduct their tasks in a transparent and accountable\r\nmanner.\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013\r\nProfessional secrecy and exchange of information\nArticles 66 to 71 make provisions and lay down the conditions for\r\nthe exchanges of information between competent authorities and authorities and\r\nbodies which help to strengthen the stability of the financial system.\nTitle VI \u2013 FINAL PROVISIONS\nArticles 73 to 81 lay down cooperation\r\nand reporting obligations, conditions for the processing of the personal data.\r\nThey include evaluation and review of the Directive, amendment of the Solvency\r\nII Directive 2009/138/EC, the implementation deadline of the Directive, repeals\r\nand addressees.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary implications\nSpecific budgetary implications are assessed in the legislative financial\r\nstatement and relate to tasks allocated to EIOPA.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\n\n2014/0091 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the activities and supervision of\r\ninstitutions for occupational retirement provision\n(recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE\r\nEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, \nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Communityon the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion, and in particular Article 5347(2), Article 6255 and Article 114(1)95(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\u00f2 new\nAfter\r\ntransmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee,\n\u00f2 new\nAfter consulting\r\nthe European Data Protection Supervisor,\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure laid down in Article 251 of the\r\nTreaty(3),\nWhereas:\n\u00f2 new\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2003/41/EC of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council[26] has been\r\nsubstantially amended several times[27].

A genuine\r\ninternal market for occupational retirement provision remains crucial for\r\neconomic growth and job creation in the European Union and for tackling the\r\nchallenge of an ageing European society. The Directive, dating from 2003, has\r\nnot been substantially amended to introduce a modern risk-based governance\r\nsystem also for institutions for occupational retirement provision.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 5 (adapted)\n\u00f0 new\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00f0 Action is needed to further develop\r\ncomplementary private retirement savings such as occupational pensions. This is\r\nimportant since social-security systems are coming under increasing pressure,\r\nwhich means that citizens will increasingly rely on occupational retirement\r\npensions as a complement in the future. \u00ef Since social-security\r\nsystems are coming under increasing pressure, occupational retirement pensions\r\nwill increasingly be relied on as a complement in future. Occupational retirement pensions should therefore be\r\ndeveloped, without, however, calling into question the importance of\r\nsocial-security pension systems in terms of secure, durable and effective\r\nsocial protection, which should guarantee a decent standard of living in old\r\nage and should therefore be at the centre of the objective of strengthening the\r\nEuropean social model.\n\u00f2 new\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\r\nDirective respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles\r\nrecognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably,\r\nthe right to protection of personal data, the right to conduct a business and\r\nthe right to a high level of consumer protection, in particular by ensuring a\r\nhigher level of transparency of retirement provisioning, informed personal\r\nfinancial and retirement planning as well as facilitating cross-border business\r\nof insitutions for occupational retirement provision and businesses. This Directive\r\nmust be implemented in accordance with these rights and principles.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite\r\nthe entry into force of Directive 2003/41/EC important prudential barriers\r\nremain which make it more expensive for institutions to operate pension schemes\r\nacross borders. Moreover, the current minimum level of protection for members\r\nand beneficiaries needs to be increased. This is all the more important as the\r\nnumber of Europeans relying on schemes that shift longevity and market risks\r\nfrom the institution or the undertaking offering the occupational scheme\r\n(\"sponsoring undertaking\") to the individual has increased\r\nsignificantly. In addition, the current minimum level of information provision\r\nto members and beneficiaries needs to be increased. Those developments warrant\r\nan amendment of the Directive.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 7\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The prudential rules laid\r\ndown in this Directive are intended both to guarantee a high degree of security\r\nfor future pensioners through the imposition of stringent supervisory standards,\r\nand to clear the way for the efficient management of occupational pension\r\nschemes.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 8\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutions which are\r\ncompletely separated from any sponsoring undertaking and which operate on a\r\nfunded basis for the sole purpose of providing retirement benefits should have\r\nfreedom to provide services and freedom of investment, subject only to\r\ncoordinated prudential requirements, regardless of whether these institutions\r\nare considered as legal entities.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 9\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nprinciple of subsidiarity, Member States should retain full responsibility for\r\nthe organisation of their pension systems as well as for the decision on the\r\nrole of each of the three \"pillars\" of the retirement system in\r\nindividual Member States. In the context of the second pillar, they should also\r\nretain full responsibility for the role and functions of the various\r\ninstitutions providing occupational retirement benefits, such as industry-wide\r\npension funds, company pension funds and life-assurance companies. This\r\nDirective is not intended to call this prerogative into question.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 10\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 National rules concerning\r\nthe participation of self-employed persons in institutions for occupational\r\nretirement provision differ. In some Member States, institutions for\r\noccupational retirement provision can operate on the basis of agreements with\r\ntrade or trade groups whose members act in a self-employed capacity or directly\r\nwith self-employed and employed persons. In some Member States a self-employed\r\nperson can also become a member of an institution when the self-employed person\r\nacts as employer or provides his professional services to an\r\nundertaking. In some Member States self-employed persons cannot join an\r\ninstitution for occupational retirement provision unless certain requirements,\r\nincluding those imposed by social and labour law, are met.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 11 \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutions managing\r\nsocial-security schemes, which are already coordinated at CommunityUnion level,\r\nshould be excluded from the scope of this Directive. Account should\r\nnevertheless be taken of the specificity of institutions which, in a single Member State, manage both social-security schemes and occupational pension schemes.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 12 \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial institutions\r\nwhich already benefit from a CommunityUnion legislative framework should in\r\ngeneral be excluded from the scope of this Directive. However, as these\r\ninstitutions may also in some cases offer occupational pension services, it is\r\nimportant to ensure that this Directive does not lead to distortions of\r\ncompetition. Such distortions may be avoided by applying the prudential\r\nrequirements of this Directive to the occupational pension business of\r\nlife-assurance companies. The Commission should also carefully monitor the\r\nsituation in the occupational pensions market and assess the possibility of\r\nextending the optional application of this Directive to other regulated\r\nfinancial institutions.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 13\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When aiming at ensuring\r\nfinancial security in retirement, the benefits paid by institutions for\r\noccupational retirement provision should generally provide for the payment of a\r\nlifelong pension. Payments for a temporary period or a lump sum should also be\r\npossible.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 14\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important to ensure\r\nthat older and disabled people are not placed at risk of poverty and can enjoy\r\na decent standard of living. Appropriate cover for biometrical risks in\r\noccupational pension arrangements is an important aspect of the fight against\r\npoverty and insecurity among elderly people. When setting up a pension scheme,\r\nemployers and employees, or their respective representatives, should consider the\r\npossibility of the pension scheme including provisions for the coverage of the\r\nlongevity risk and occupational disability risks as well as provision for\r\nsurviving dependants.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 15\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Giving Member States the\r\npossibility to exclude from the scope of national implementing legislation\r\ninstitutions managing schemes which together have less than 100 members in\r\ntotal can facilitate supervision in some Member States, without undermining the\r\nproper functioning of the internal market in this field. However, this should\r\nnot undermine the right of such institutions to appoint for the management of\r\ntheir investment portfolio and the custody of their assets investment managers\r\nand custodians established in another Member State and duly authorised.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 16\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutions such as\r\n\"Unterst\u00fctzungskassen\" in Germany, where the members have no legal\r\nrights to benefits of a certain amount and where their interests are protected\r\nby a compulsory statutory insolvency insurance, should be excluded from the\r\nscope of the Directive.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 17\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to protect members\r\nand beneficiaries, institutions for occupational retirement provision should\r\nlimit their activities to the activities, and those arising therefrom, referred\r\nto in this Directive.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 18\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the event of the\r\nbankruptcy of a sponsoring undertaking, a member faces the risk of losing both\r\nhis/her job and his/her acquired pension rights. This makes it necessary to\r\nensure that there is a clear separation between that undertaking and the\r\ninstitution and that minimum prudential standards are laid down to protect\r\nmembers.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 19\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutions for occupational\r\nretirement provision operate and are supervised with significant differences in\r\nMember States. In some Member States, supervision can be exercised not only\r\nover the institution itself but also over the entities or companies which are\r\nauthorised to manage these institutions. Member States should be able to take\r\nsuch specificity into account as long as all the requirements laid down in this\r\nDirective are effectively met. Member States should also be able to allow\r\ninsurance entities and other financial entities to manage institutions for\r\noccupational retirement provision.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 20\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutions for\r\noccupational retirement provision are financial service providers which bear a\r\nheavy responsibility for the provision of occupational retirement benefits and\r\ntherefore should meet certain minimum prudential standards with respect to\r\ntheir activities and conditions of operation.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 21\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The huge number of institutions\r\nin certain Member States means a pragmatic solution is necessary as regards\r\nprior authorisation of institutions. However, if an institution wishes to\r\nmanage a scheme in another Member State, a prior authorisation granted by the\r\ncompetent authority of the home Member State should be required.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 36 (adapted)\n\u00f0 new\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without prejudice to\r\nnational social and labour legislation on the organisation of pension systems,\r\nincluding compulsory membership and the outcomes of collective bargaining\r\nagreements, institutions should have the possibility of providing their\r\nservices in other Member States \u00f0 upon receipt of the authorisation\r\nfrom the competent authority of the insitution's home Member State \u00ef. InstitutionsThey\r\nshould be allowed to accept sponsorship from undertakings located in \u00f0 any \u00ef other Member States and to operate pension schemes with members in more than one Member State. This would potentially lead to significant economies of scale for these\r\ninstitutions, improve the competitiveness of the UnionCommunity industry and facilitate\r\nlabour mobility. This requires\r\nmutual recognition of prudential standards. Proper enforcement of these\r\nprudential standards should be supervised by the competent authorities of the\r\nhome Member State, unless specified otherwise.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 37\n\u00f0 new\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exercise of the right\r\nof an institution in one Member State to manage an occupational pension scheme\r\ncontracted in another Member State should fully respect the provisions of the\r\nsocial and labour law in force in the host Member State insofar as it is\r\nrelevant to occupational pensions, for example the definition and payment of\r\nretirement benefits and the conditions for transferability of pension rights. \u00f0 The scope of prudential rules should\r\nbe clarified in order to ensure legal certainty for the cross-border activities\r\nof the insitutions. \u00ef\n\u00f2 new\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutions\r\nshould be able to transfer pension schemes to other institutions across borders\r\nwithin the Union in order to facilitate the organisation of occupational\r\nretirement provision on a Union scale, subject only to authorisation from the\r\ncompetent authority in the home Member State of the institution receiving the\r\npension scheme (the \"receiving insitution\"). Unless national social\r\nand labour law on pension systems provides otherwise, the transfer and its\r\nconditions should be subject to prior approval by members and beneficiaries\r\nconcerned or, where applicable, their representatives.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 26\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A prudent calculation of\r\ntechnical provisions is an essential condition to ensure that obligations to\r\npay retirement benefits can be met. Technical provisions should be calculated\r\non the basis of recognised actuarial methods and certified by qualified\r\npersons. The maximum interest rates should be chosen prudently according to any\r\nrelevant national rules. The minimum amount of technical provisions should both\r\nbe sufficient for benefits already in payment to beneficiaries to continue to\r\nbe paid and reflect the commitments that arise out of members' accrued pension\r\nrights.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 27\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risks covered by\r\ninstitutions vary significantly from one Member State to another. Home Member\r\nStates should therefore have the possibility of making the calculation of\r\ntechnical provisions subject to additional and more detailed rules than those\r\nlaid down in this Directive.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 28\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sufficient and appropriate\r\nassets to cover the technical provisions protect the interests of members and\r\nbeneficiaries of the pension scheme if the sponsoring undertaking becomes\r\ninsolvent. In particular in cases of cross-border activity, the mutual\r\nrecognition of supervisory principles applied in Member States requires that\r\nthe technical provisions be fully funded at all times.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 29\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the institution does not\r\nwork on a cross-border basis, Member States should be able to permit\r\nunderfunding provided that a proper plan is established to restore full funding\r\nand without prejudice to the requirements of Council Directive 80/987/EEC of 20\r\nOctober 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to\r\nthe protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.[28]\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 30\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In many cases, it could be\r\nthe sponsoring undertaking and not the institution itself that either covers\r\nany biometric risk or guarantees certain benefits or investment performance.\r\nHowever, in some cases, it is the institution itself which provides such cover\r\nor guarantees and the sponsor's obligations are generally exhausted by paying\r\nthe necessary contributions. In these circumstances, the products offered are\r\nsimilar to those of life-assurance companies and the institutions concerned\r\nshould hold at least the same additional own funds as life-assurance companies.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 31\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutions are very\r\nlong-term investors. Redemption of the assets held by these institutions\r\ncannot, in general, be made for any purpose other than providing retirement\r\nbenefits. Furthermore, in order to protect adequately the rights of members and\r\nbeneficiaries, institutions should be able to opt for an asset allocation that\r\nsuits the precise nature and duration of their liabilities. These aspects call\r\nfor efficient supervision and an approach towards investment rules allowing\r\ninstitutions sufficient flexibility to decide on the most secure and efficient\r\ninvestment policy and obliging them to act prudently. Compliance with the\r\n\"prudent person\" rule therefore requires an investment policy geared\r\nto the membership structure of the individual institution for occupational\r\nretirement provision.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 6 (adapted)\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive thus represents a first step on\r\nthe way to an internal market for occupational retirement provision organised\r\non a European scale. By setting the\r\n\"prudent person\" rule as the underlying principle for capital\r\ninvestment and making it possible for institutions to operate across borders,\r\nthe redirection of savings into the sector of occupational retirement provision\r\nis encouraged, thus contributing to economic and social progress.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 32 (adapted)\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Supervisory methods and\r\npractices vary among Member States. Therefore, Member States should be given\r\nsome discretion on the precise investment rules that they wish to impose on the\r\ninstitutions located in their territories. However, these rules must \u00d6 should \u00d5 not restrict\r\nthe free movement of capital, unless justified on prudential grounds.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 33 (adapted)\n\u00f0 new\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As very long-term investors\r\nwith low liquidity risks, institutions for occupational retirement provision\r\nare in a position to invest in non-liquid assets such as shares as well as in \u00f0 instruments that have a long-term\r\neconomic profile and are not traded on regulated markets, multilateral trading\r\nfacilities or organised trading facilities \u00ef risk capital markets within prudent limits.

These instruments are non-transferable securities and therefore do\r\nnot have access to the liquidity of secondary markets. They often require fixed\r\nterm commitments which restrict their marketability. These instruments should be\r\nunderstood to include participations, debt instruments in non-listed\r\nundertakings and loans provided to them. Non-listed undertakings include\r\ninfrastructure projects, unlisted companies seeking growth, real estate or\r\nother assets that could be suitable for long term investment purposes. Low\r\ncarbon and climate resilient infrastructure projects are often non-listed\r\nassets and rely on long term credits for project financing.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 34 (adapted)\nHowever, if the\r\ninstitution works on a cross-border basis, it may be asked by the competent\r\nauthorities of the host Member State to apply limits for investment in shares\r\nand similar assets not admitted to trading on a regulated market, in shares and\r\nother instruments issued by the same undertaking or in assets denominated in\r\nnon-matching currencies provided such rules also apply to institutions located\r\nin the host Member State.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 35 (adapted)\nRestrictions\r\nregarding the free choice by institutions of approved asset managers and\r\ncustodians limit competition in the internal market and should therefore be\r\neliminated.\n\u00f2 new\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutions\r\nshould be allowed to invest in other Member States in accordance with the rules\r\nof their home Member States in order to reduce the cost of cross-border\r\nactivity. Therefore the host Member States should not be allowed to impose\r\nadditional investment requirements on institutions located in other Member\r\nStates.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some\r\nrisks cannot be reduced through quantitative requirements reflected in the\r\ntechnical provisions and funding requirements but can only be properly\r\naddressed through governance requirements. Ensuring an effective system of\r\ngovernance is therefore essential for the adequate management of risk. Those systems\r\nshould be proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the activities.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Remuneration\r\npolicies which encourage excessive risk-taking behaviour can undermine sound\r\nand effective risk management of institutions. Principles and disclosure requirements\r\nfor remuneration policies applicable to other types of financial institutions\r\nin the Union should be made applicable also to institutions, bearing in mind,\r\nhowever, the particular governance structure of institutions in comparison to\r\nother types of financial institutions and the need to take account of the size,\r\nnature, scope and complexity of the activities of institutions.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\r\nkey function is an internal capacity to undertake particular governance tasks.\r\nInstitutions should have sufficient capacity to have a risk-management\r\nfunction, an internal audit function and, where applicable, an actuarial\r\nfunction. The identification\r\nof a particular key function does not prevent the institution from freely\r\ndeciding how to organise that key function in practice save where otherwise\r\nspecified in this Directive. This should not lead to unduly burdensome\r\nrequirements because account should be taken of the nature, scale and\r\ncomplexity of the activities of the institution. \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All\r\npersons that perform key functions should be fit and proper.

However, the person or unit performing\r\na key function should be different from the one performing a similar key function\r\nin the sponsoring undertaking; although the competent authority should be\r\nauthorised to grant an exemption taking into account the size, nature, scope\r\nand complexity of the activities of institutions.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis essential that institutions improve their risk management so that potential\r\nvulnerabilities in relation to the sustainability of the pension scheme can be\r\nproperly understood and discussed with the competent authorities. Institutions\r\nshould, as part of their risk management system, produce a risk evaluation for\r\ntheir activities relating to pensions. That risk evaluation \u00a0should also be\r\nmade available to the competent authorities. In that evaluation institutions\r\nshould provide among others a qualitative description of key elements\r\ndetermining their funding position in accordance with national law, the\r\neffectiveness of their risk-management system and the ability to comply with\r\nthe requirements regarding technical provisions. This risk evaluation should\r\ninclude new or emerging risks, such as risks related to climate change,\r\nresource use or the environment.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 22\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each Member State should\r\nrequire that every institution located in its territory draw up annual accounts\r\nand annual reports taking into account each pension scheme operated by the\r\ninstitution and, where applicable, annual accounts and annual reports for each\r\npension scheme. The annual accounts and annual reports, reflecting a true and\r\nfair view of the institution's assets, liabilities and financial position,\r\ntaking into account each pension scheme operated by an institution, and duly\r\napproved by an authorised person, are an essential source of information for\r\nmembers and beneficiaries of a scheme and the competent authorities. In\r\nparticular, they enable the competent authorities to monitor the financial\r\nsoundness of an institution and assess whether the institution is able to meet\r\nall its contractual obligations.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 24\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investment policy of an\r\ninstitution is a decisive factor for both security and affordability of\r\noccupational pensions. The institutions should therefore draw up and, at least\r\nevery three years, review a statement of investment principles. It should be\r\nmade available to the competent authorities and on request also to members and\r\nbeneficiaries of each pension scheme.\n\u00f2 new\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutions\r\nshould be allowed to entrust their management, in whole or in part, to other\r\nentities operating on their behalf. Institutions should remain fully\r\nresponsible for discharging all of their obligations under this Directive when\r\nthey outsource key functions or any other activities.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nsafe-keeping and oversight duties related to the assets of institutions should\r\nbe strengthened by clarifying the depositary\u2019s roles and duties. Only\r\ninstitutions operating schemes where members and beneficiaries bear all the\r\nrisks should be required to appoint a depositary.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 23 (adapted)\nProper information\r\nfor members and beneficiaries of a pension scheme is crucial. This is of\r\nparticular relevance for requests for information concerning the financial\r\nsoundness of the institution, the contractual rules, the benefits and the\r\nactual financing of accrued pension entitlements, the investment policy and the\r\nmanagement of risks and costs.\n\u00f2 new\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutions\r\nshould provide clear and adequate information to prospective members, members\r\nand beneficiaries to support their decision-making about their retirement and\r\nensure a high level of transparency throughout the various phases of a scheme\r\ncomprising pre-enrolment, membership (including pre-retirement) and\r\npost-retirement. In particular, \u00a0information concerning accrued pension\r\nentitlements, projected levels of retirement benefits, risks and guarantees,\r\nand costs should be given. Where members bear an investment risk, additional\r\ninformation on the investment profile, any available options and past\r\nperformance are also crucial. \n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before\r\njoining a scheme, prospective members should be given all the necessary\r\ninformation to make an informed choice such as possibilities to opt out,\r\ncontributions, costs and investment options, where applicable.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe institution's members that have not yet retired, institutions should draw\r\nup a standardised pension benefit statement containing key personal and generic\r\ninformation about the pension scheme. The pension benefit statement should have\r\na standard format in order to facilitate the understanding of pension\r\nentitlements over time and across schemes and serve labour mobility. \n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutions\r\nshould inform members sufficiently in advance before retirement about their\r\npay-out options. Where the retirement benefit is not paid out as a lifetime\r\nannuity, members that approach retirement should receive information about the\r\nbenefit payment products available, in order to faciliate financial planning\r\nfor retirement.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During\r\nthe phase when retirement benefits are paid, beneficiaries should continue to\r\nreceive\u00a0 information on their benefits and corresponding payment options. This\r\nis particularly important when a significant level of investment risk is borne\r\nby beneficiaries in the pay-out phase.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ncompetent authority should exercise its powers having as its prime objective the\r\nprotection of members and beneficiaries. \n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nscope of prudential supervision differs between Member States. This can cause\r\nproblems where \u00a0an institution needs to comply with the prudential regulation\r\nof its home Member State whilst simultaneously comply with the social and\r\nlabour law of its host Member State. Clarifying which areas are considered to\r\nbe part of prudential supervision for the purpose of this Directive reduces\r\nlegal uncertainty and the associated transaction costs.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An\r\ninternal market for institutions requires mutual recognition of prudential\r\nstandards. The institution's adherence to those standards should be supervised\r\nby the competent authorities of the institution\u2019s home Member State. Member States should attribute to competent authorities the necessary powers to use\r\npreventive or corrective measures if institutions breach any of the\r\nrequirements of this Directive. \n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 25 (adapted)\nTo fulfil their\r\nstatutory function, the competent authorities should be provided with adequate\r\nrights to information and powers of intervention with respect to institutions\r\nand the persons who effectively run them. Where an institution for occupational\r\nretirement provision has transferred functions of material importance such as\r\ninvestment management, information technology or accounting to other companies\r\n(outsourcing), it should be possible for the rights to information and powers\r\nof intervention to be enlarged so as to cover these outsourced functions in\r\norder to check whether those activities are carried out in accordance with the\r\nsupervisory rules.\n\u00f2 new\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure effective supervision of outsourced activities, including all\r\nsubsequent re-outsourcing activities, it is essential that the competent\r\nauthorities have access to all relevant data held by the service providers to\r\nwhom activities have been outsourced, regardless of whether the latter is a\r\nregulated or unregulated entity, and have the right to conduct on-site\r\ninspections. In order to take account of market developments and to ensure continuous\r\ncompliance with the conditions for outsourcing, institutions should inform competent\r\nauthorities prior to the outsourcing of critical or important activities.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision\r\nshould be made for exchanges of information between the competent authorities,\r\nother authorities and bodies tasked with strengthening of financial stability and\r\nthe termination of pension schemes. It is therefore necessary to specify the\r\nconditions under which those exchanges of information should be possible.\r\nMoreover, where information may be disclosed only with the express agreement of\r\nthe competent authorities, those authorities should be able, where appropriate,\r\nto make their agreement subject to compliance with strict conditions.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive\r\n95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[29] governs the processing of personal data\r\ncarried out in the Member States in the context of this Directive and under the\r\nsupervision of the competent authorities. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[30], governs the processing of personal data\r\ncarried out by the European Supervisory Authorities pursuant to this Directive\r\nand under the supervision of the European Data Protection Supervisor. Any\r\nprocessing of personal data carried out within the framework of this Directive,\r\nsuch as the exchange or transmission of personal data by the competent\r\nauthorities should be in accordance with national rules which implement\r\nDirective 95/46/EC, and any exchange or transmission of information by the\r\nEuropean Supervisory Authorities should be in accordance with Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 45/2001.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market for occupational\r\nretirement provision organised on a European scale, the Commission should,\r\nafter consulting EIOPA, review and report on the application of this Directive\r\nand should submit that report to the European Parliament and to the Council\r\nfour years after the entry into force of this Directive. That review should\r\nassess in particular the application of the rules regarding the calculation of\r\nthe technical provisions, the funding of technical provisions, regulatory own\r\nfunds, solvency margins, investment rules and any other aspect relating to the\r\nfinancial solvency situation of the insitution.\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure fair competition between institutions, the transitional period\r\nallowing insurance undertakings subject to Directive 2009/138/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[31] to operate their\r\noccupational-retirement-provision-business under the rules referred to in\r\nArticle 4 of Directive 2009/138/EC should be extended until 31 December 2022.\r\nDirective 2009/138/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to specify the requirements set out in this Directive, the power to adopt\r\nacts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission\r\nin respect of clarifying the remuneration policy, the risk evaluation for\r\npensions and the pension benefit statement. It is of particular importance that\r\nthe Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work,\r\nincluding at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up\r\ndelegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\r\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the\r\nCouncil.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 38 (adapted)\nWhen a scheme is\r\nring-fenced, the provisions of this Directive apply individually to that\r\nscheme.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 39 (adapted)\nIt is important to\r\nmake provision for cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member\r\nStates for supervisory purposes and between those authorities and the\r\nCommission for other purposes. For the purposes of carrying out their duties\r\nand of contributing to the consistent and timely implementation of this\r\nDirective, competent authorities should provide each other with the information\r\nnecessary to apply the provisions of the Directive. The Commission has\r\nindicated its intention to set up a committee of supervisors in order to\r\nencourage cooperation, coordination and exchanges of views between national\r\ncompetent authorities, and to promote the consistent implementation of this\r\nDirective.\n\u00ea 2003/41/EC\r\nrecital 40\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of the proposed action, namely to create a UnionCommunity legal framework covering institutions for occupational retirement\r\nprovision, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can\r\ntherefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved\r\nby the UnionCommunity, the UnionCommunity may adopt measures, in accordance\r\nwith the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.

These divergences discourage\r\ncross-border mobility of workers, hinder comparability of IORPs, and act as an\r\nobstacle to cross-border transfers and provision of services by IORPs.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nThe review of\r\nthe 2003 IORP Directive was announced in the White Paper of 16 February 2012\r\n\"An Agenda for Adequate, Safe and Sustainable Pensions\" and\r\nforms a cohesive package with the other initiatives and actions outlined in\r\nthat White Paper for improved pension provision in the EU.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial impact\nProposal/initiative\r\nof unlimited duration\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) planned[52] \nFrom the\r\n2014 budget\n\u00a8 Direct management by the Commission\n\u00a8 by its\r\ndepartments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\u00a8 by the\r\nexecutive agencies; \n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States\r\n\n\u00a8 Indirect management by delegating implementation\r\ntasks to:\n\u00a8 third\r\ncountries or the bodies they have designated;\n\u00a8\r\ninternational organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\u00a8 the EIB and\r\nthe European Investment Fund;\n\u00fc bodies\r\nreferred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\u00a8 public law\r\nbodies;\n\u00a8 bodies\r\ngoverned by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u00a8 bodies\r\ngoverned by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the\r\nimplementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate\r\nfinancial guarantees;\n\u00a8 persons\r\nentrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to\r\nTitle V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\nComments\nEIOPA is a regulatory agency acting under\r\nthe oversight of the Commission.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nIn line with\r\nalready existing arrangements EIOPA prepares regularly reports on its activity\r\n(including internal reporting to Senior Management, Management Board reporting,\r\nsix month activity reporting to the Board of Supervisors and the production of\r\nthe annual report), and undergoes audits by the Court of Auditors and the\r\nInternal Audit Service on its use of its resources.

In\r\naddition, EIOPA will have to monitor the application of the Directive and take\r\naction to ensure correct implementation, in accordance with article 17 of its\r\nfounding Regulation (Council and Parliament Regulation 1094/2010), and to\r\nresolve differences between national supervisors regarding matters of\r\napplication (article 19 of the EIOPA Regulation). In particular EIOPA may have\u00a0\r\nto resolve disagreements between home and host supervisors regarding the\r\ncross-border transfer of IORPs. It can also prepare guidelines and\r\nrecommendations, in accordance with article 16 of the EIOPA Regulation. In\r\naddition, given the focus of the proposal on governance and reporting issues,\r\nit is planned that an expert group of national supervisors will need to be\r\ncreated on governance and reporting and cordinated and administered by EIOPA.\nThe total staff requirements of all of these tasks is estimated at 7\r\nannual FTE staff. Four of these are for the preparation of the above-mentioned\r\nadvice to the Commission, one for administration and coordination of a new\r\nworking group on governance and transparency, and two on monitoring of\r\nimplementation and resolution of differences between national authorities.\r\nThese should all be establishment plan posts, given the difficult of recruiting\r\ncontractual agents for such specialised functions, and the increasing\r\ndifficulties of national authorities to provide seconded national experts.\n3.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimated impact on\r\nappropriations of an administrative nature\n3.2.3.1.\u00a0 Summary \n\u00fc\u00a0 The\r\nproposal/initiative does not require the use of appropriations of an\r\nadministrative nature \n3.2.3.2.\u00a0  Estimated requirements of\r\nhuman resources \n\u00fc\u00a0 The\r\nproposal/initiative does not require the use of human resources. \nComment:\nNo additional human and administrative\r\nresources will be needed in DG MARKT as a result of the proposal.

Until 2014, EIOPA is\r\ncategorised as a \"start-up phase\" agency in the Communication. Section\r\n5.1.2 of the Communication states that EIOPA's total number of posts is\r\nexpected to increase from 80 in 2013 to 112 in 2020. The settlement of the\r\nbudgetary authority for EIOPA in 2014 allows for 87 establishment plan posts.\r\nIt is expected that the present legislative proposal will enter into force in\r\n2015, and that the 7 establishment plan posts provided for in the present\r\nLegislative Financial Statement will be recruited at various points of time\r\nduring 2015, and will be included among the additional posts already envisaged\r\nfor the period 2014-2017. \n3.2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Third-party contributions \nThe proposal/initiative provides for the co-financing estimated\r\nbelow:\nAppropriations in EUR million (to 3 decimal places)\n   || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 || 2020 || Total \n National competent authorities in Member States || 0.277 || 0.554 || 0.554 || 0.554 || 0.554 || 0.554 || 3.049 \n TOTAL appropriations cofinanced || 0.277 || 0.554 || 0.554 || 0.554 || 0.554 || 0.554 || 3.049 \n\r\n* These estimates are based on an average cost of an AD official of \u20ac132,000\r\nper year.
