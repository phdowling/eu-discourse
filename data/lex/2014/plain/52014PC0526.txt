concerning an amendment to Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement, on cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms (Satellite Navigation) /* COM/2014/0526 final - 2014/0244 (NLE) */\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\nIn order to ensure the requisite legal\r\nsecurity and homogeneity of the Internal Market, the EEA Joint Committee is to\r\nintegrate all the relevant EU legislation into the EEA Agreement as soon as\r\npossible after its adoption. \nArticle 78 of the EEA Agreement provides\r\nthat the Contracting Parties shall strengthen and broaden cooperation in the\r\nframework of the Union\u2019s activities in the fields of, inter alia, information\r\nservices, and\u00a0 research and technological development. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe draft Decision of the EEA Joint\r\nCommittee (annexed to the proposed Council Decision) aims to amend Protocol 31\r\nto the EEA Agreement on cooperation in specific fields outside the four\r\nfreedoms in order to extend the cooperation of the Contracting Parties in the\r\narea of information services, and research and technological development.\nIn order to extend the cooperation of the\r\nContracting Parties to the EEA Agreement in this area (to take place from 1\r\nJanuary 2014), Regulation (EU) No 1285/2013 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council of 11 December 2013 on the implementation and exploitation of\r\nEuropean satellite navigation systems and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n876/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[1]\r\nneeds to be incorporated to the EEA Agreement through the above mentioned\r\namendment.\nIt should be noted that Norway has already participated and contributed financially to the activities resulting\r\nfrom the Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[2]\r\nthrough the inclusion of that Regulation in Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement.\nDue to Iceland's economic constraints, the\r\nparticipation of Iceland in this area should be temporarily suspended. \nThe related Cooperation Agreement on\r\nSatellite Navigation between the European Union and its Member States and the Kingdom of Norway[3],\r\nwhich was signed on 22 September 2010, applies provisionally as of 1 May 2011.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n2894/94 concerning arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement provides\r\nthat the Council establishes the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf on such Decisions, on a proposal from the Commission. \nThe Commission submits the Draft Decision\r\nof the EEA Joint Committee for adoption by the Council as the Union\u2019s position.\r\nThe Commission would hope to be able to present it in the EEA Joint Committee\r\nat the earliest possible opportunity.\nThe Decision of the EEA Joint Committee\r\nshould serve also as the agreement of the Parties, pursuant to Article 1(8) of\r\nProtocol 32 to the EEA Agreement, to commence the cooperation under Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1285/2013 from 1 January 2014 even if this EEA Joint Committee Decision\r\nis adopted, or if the fulfilment of constitutional requirements for this EEA\r\nJoint Committee Decision, if any, is notified after 10 July 2014.\n2014/0244 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf\r\nof the European Union,\r\nin

which start before\r\nthe entry into force of the EEA Joint Committee Decision annexed to this Decision.\r\nThe costs incurred for such activities, the implementation of which starts after\r\n1 January 2014, may be considered eligible under the same conditions as those\r\napplicable to costs incurred by entities established in the EU Member States\r\nprovided that the EEA Joint Committee Decision enters into force before the end\r\nof the action concerned.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Protocol 31 should\r\ntherefore be amended accordingly.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position of the Union within the EEA Joint Committee should therefore be based on the attached draft\r\nDecision.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
