In\r\nresponse to requests from several Member States, the Commission, together with\r\nthe government experts concerned, considered whether to open autonomous tariff\r\nquotas for certain agricultural and industrial products.\nOn 17 December 2013 the Council\r\nadopted Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013 opening and providing for the\r\nmanagement of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural\r\nand industrial products so that Union demand for the products in question could\r\nbe met under the most favourable conditions.\nTariff quotas of the Union should be opened\r\nat zero or reduced duty rates for appropriate volumes, without disturbing the\r\nmarkets for such products. Discussions at meetings of the Economic Tariff\r\nQuestions Group showed that the Member States were ready to open quotas for the\r\nproducts listed in Annex I to this proposal for a Regulation, without\r\ndisturbing the markets for such products. \nFurthermore, it became necessary to adapt\r\nthe quotas listed in Annex II to this proposal:\nfor order nos 09.2631 and 09.2806 the description\r\nhad to be changed,\nfor order no 09.2629 a TARIC code had to be\r\ndeleted and\nfor order nos 09.2818, 09.2668 and 09.2669\r\nthe volumes were increased.\nThe autonomous tariff quota with order no\r\n09.2930 is been deleted from the Annex of Council Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013,\r\nas it is not in the interest of the Union to continue granting such quota.\nThe proposal is in line with agricultural,\r\ntrade, entreprise, development and external relations policies. Especially this\r\nproposal is not at the expense of countries enjoying a preferential trading\r\nagreement with the EU (e.g. GSP, ACP regime, candidate countries and potential\r\ncandidates).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nOF THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Economic Tariff Questions Group, in\r\nwhich the competent authorities of all Member State are represented, was\r\nconsulted. All listed quotas correspond to agreements or compromises reached in\r\nthe discussions of the group.\nThere was no mention of potentially serious\r\nrisks with irreversible consequences.\nThis proposal will follow an inter service\r\nconsultation procedure and will be published after its adoption by the Council.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis of this regulation proposal\r\nis Article 31 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\nBy virtue of Article 31 of the TFEU\r\nautonomous tariff suspensions and quotas are fixed by the Council acting on\r\nqualified majority on the basis of a Commission proposal, therefore a\r\nregulation is the appropriate instrument.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiary principle therefore does not apply.\nThe proposal complies with the principle of\r\nproportionality as this set of measures is in line with the principles set out\r\nto simplify the procedures for the operators engaged in foreign trade and in\r\naccordance with the Commission communication concerning autonomous tariff\r\nsuspensions and quotas (C 363, 13.12.2011 p.6).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nUncollected customs duties of a total\r\namount of approximately 5,9 Mio \u20ac/year. The effect on the traditional own\r\nresources of the budget is - 4,4 Mio \u20ac/year (75% x 5,9 Mio \u20ac/year).\n2014/0137 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013\r\nopening and providing for the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the\r\nUnion for certain agricultural and industrial products \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\r\nsufficient and uninterrupted supplies of certain goods insufficiently produced\r\nin the Union and to avoid any disturbances on the market for certain\r\nagricultural and industrial products, autonomous tariff quotas have been opened\r\nby Council Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013[1]. Products within those\r\ntariff quotas can be imported into the Union at reduced or zero duty rates. For\r\nthe reasons indicated, it is necessary to open, with effect from 1 July 2014,\r\ntariff quotas at zero duty rates for an appropriate volume concerning six new products.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, in certain\r\ncases, the existing autonomous tariff quotas of the Union should be adapted. In\r\ntwo cases the product description needs to be modified for clarification\r\npurposes and in order to take into account the newest product developments. In\r\nanother case one of the TARIC codes needs to be deleted as the double\r\nclassification has become obsolete and in three other cases, the quota volumes need\r\nto be increased as it is in the interest of economic operators and the Union.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, in two cases, the\r\nautonomous tariff quotas of the Union should be closed with effect from 1 July\r\n2014 and 1 January 2015, respectively, as it is not in the interest of the\r\nUnion to continue granting such quotas as of those dates. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As some of the changes to the\r\ntariff quotas provided for in this Regulation have to take effect on 1 July 2014,\r\nthis Regulation should apply from that date and enter into force on the day of\r\nits publication in the Official Journal of the Europan Union,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThe Annex to Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1388/2013 is amended as follows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the rows for the tariff\r\nquotas with order numbers 09.2830, 09.2831, 09.2832, 09.2834, 09.2835, and\r\n09.2836 set out in Annex I to this Regulation are inserted following the order\r\nof the CN codes indicated in the second column of the table in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the rows for the tariff\r\nquotas with order numbers 09.2629, 09.2631, 09.2639, 09.2668, 09.2669, 09.2806,\r\nand 09.2818 are replaced by the rows set out in Annex II to this Regulation;\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the row for the tariff\r\nquota with order number 09.2930 is deleted;\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the row for the tariff\r\nquota with order number 09.2639 is deleted .\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2014. \nHowever, point (4) of Article 1 shall apply\r\nfrom 1 January 2015. \nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:\nCouncil Regulation amending Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 1388/2013 opening and providing for the management of autonomous tariff\r\nquotas of the Union for certain agricultural and industrial products\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGET LINES\nChapter and Article: Chapter 12, Article\r\n120\nAmount budgeted for the year 2014: \u20ac 16 185 600 000\u00a0 \u20ac (B 2014)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FINANCIAL IMPACT\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial implications\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial impact on\r\nexpenditure but has a financial impact on revenue.
