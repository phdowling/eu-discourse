The Agreement established, on the basis of reciprocity, legally\r\nbinding rights and obligations for the purpose of simplifying the visa issuing\r\nprocedures for Ukrainian citizens. Article 12 of this Agreement set up a Joint\r\nCommittee tasked to monitor the implementation of the Agreement. \nThe Joint Committee noted the need for\r\ncommon guidelines in order to ensure a fully harmonised implementation of the\r\nVisa Facilitation Agreement amongst the consulates of the Member States, and\r\nfor clarifying the relationship between the provisions of that Agreement and\r\nthe provisions of the contracting parties that continue to apply to visa issues\r\nnot covered by the Agreement.\nThe Joint Committee adopted such guidelines by its Decision No 1/2009 of\r\n25.11.2009. These Guidelines are not part of the\r\nAgreement and therefore they are not legally binding. However, it is highly\r\nrecommended that diplomatic and consular staff consistently follow them when\r\nimplementing the provisions of the Agreement.\nFollowing the entry into force, on\r\n1.07.2013, of the amended Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine on the facilitation of the issuance of visas, the Guidelines needed to be adapted\r\naccordingly.\nThe Guidelines have been adapted in line\r\nwith the amended Agreement which contains new provisions on further facilitations\r\nin the procedures for issuing visas for an intended stay of no more than 90\r\ndays per period of 180 days in the Schengen area for the citizens of Ukraine,\r\nas well as with new EU legislation in the area of common visa policy, such as\r\nthe Visa Code. Therefore they reflect the applicable EU visa acquis in\r\nforce at present.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Guidelines as annexed to the Annex of\r\nthis proposal for a Council Decision are the outcome of consultations with the\r\nMember States in the context of the Visa Working Party on 12.12.2013, 10.01.,\r\n20.02., and 15.04.2014. Commission consulted these Guidelines with responsible\r\nauthorities in Ukraine on several occasions, including in the Joint Committee\r\nmeeting on 14.05.2014.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe Guidelines, which are to be adopted on\r\nthe basis of the empowerment given to the representative of the Commission in\r\nthe Joint Committee on the basis of this proposal, will not be legally binding\r\nupon the Member States. These Guidelines are to provide guidance and explain in\r\ndetail the provisions of the Agreement to persons who implement the amended\r\nVisa Facilitation Agreement between the EU and Ukraine. \nThe Guidelines take into consideration the\r\nprovisions of the Visa Code and other legislative acts in the field of EU visa\r\npolicy in order to ensure that consular representatives of the Member States\r\nact in accordance with the entire EU visa acquis when implementing the\r\nprovisions of the Visa Facilitation Agreement. \nThe provisions of the Agreement have\r\nprecedence over the provisions of the Visa Code on matters which they both\r\nregulate. \n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FINANCIAL AND BUDGET\r\nIMPACT\nThis proposal has no impact on the EU\r\nbudget.\n2014/0315 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\ndetermining the Union position for a\r\nDecision of the Joint Committee set up under the Agreement between the European\r\nUnion and Ukraine on the facilitation of the issuance of visas, with regard to\r\nthe adoption of Common Guidelines for the implementation of the Agreement\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 218(9)\r\nthereof;\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 12 of the Agreement between the European Union and\r\nUkraine on the facilitation\r\nof the issuance of visas[1] (\"Visa Facilitation Agreement\") sets up a Joint\r\nCommittee.

the\r\nAgreement\nDRAFT\nDECISION\r\nN\u00b0 \u2026./2014 OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE\nSET\r\nUP BY \r\nTHE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND \r\n  UKRAINE ON THE FACILITATION OF ISSUANCE OF VISAS\nof\r\n\u2026\u2026.2014\nwith\r\nregard to the adoption of common guidelines on its implementation\n(\u2026/\u2026/\u2026)\nTHE COMMITTEE,\nHaving regard to the Agreement between the\r\nEuropean Union and Ukraine on the facilitation of the issuance of visas\r\n(hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Agreement\u201d), and in particular Article 12\r\nthereof,\nWhereas that Agreement entered into force\r\non 1 January 2008,\nHAS DECIDED THE FOLLOWING:\nArticle 1\nThe common guidelines on the implementation\r\nof the Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine on the facilitation of\r\nthe issuance of visas are established in the annex to this Decision.\nArticle\r\n2\nDecision No 1/2009 of the Joint Committee is\r\nrepealed. \nANNEX\nCOMMON GUIDELINES \nFOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE \nAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION \nAND UKRAINE \nON THE FACILITATION OF THE ISSUANCE OF\r\nVISAS \nThe purpose of the\r\nAgreement between the European Union and Ukraine on the facilitation of the\r\nissuance of visas, which entered into force on 1 January 2008, as amended by\r\nthe Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine of 23.07.2012., which\r\nentered into force on 1.07.2013 (in the following \u2018the Agreement\u2019), is to\r\nfacilitate, on the basis of reciprocity, the procedures for issuing visas for\r\nan intended stay of no more than 90 days per period of 180 days to the citizens\r\nof Ukraine.\nThe Agreement establishes,\r\non the basis of reciprocity, legally binding rights and obligations for the\r\npurpose of simplifying the visa issuing procedures for Ukrainian citizens.\nThese Guidelines,\r\nadopted by the Joint Committee established by the Agreement, aim at ensuring a\r\ncorrect and harmonised implementation of the provisions of the Agreement by the\r\ndiplomatic missions and consular posts of the Member States.\u00a0 These Guidelines\r\nare not part of the Agreement and therefore they are not legally binding.\r\nHowever, it is highly recommended that diplomatic and consular staff\r\nconsistently follow them when implementing the provisions of the Agreement.\nThe Guidelines are\r\nconceived as a living document, to be updated in light of the experiences of\r\nthe implementation of the Agreement under the responsibility of the Joint\r\nCommittee set up by Article 12 of the Agreement. The Guidelines, adopted by the\r\nJoint Committee on 25 November 2009 have been adapted in line with the\r\nAgreement between the European Union and Ukraine amending the Agreement between\r\nthe European Community and Ukraine on the facilitation of the issuance of\r\nvisas, and with new EU legislation such as the Visa Code.\nI. GENERAL ISSUES. \n1.1. Purpose and\r\nscope of application.\nArticle 1 of the\r\nAgreement stipulates that: \"The purpose of this Agreement is to facilitate\r\nthe issuance of visas for an intended stay of no more than 90 days per period\r\nof 180 days to the citizens of Ukraine.\"\nThe Agreement\r\napplies to all Ukrainian citizens who apply for a short-stay visa, whatever the\r\ncountry in which they reside.\nArticle 1(2) of the\r\nAgreement stipulates that: \"Ukraine may only reintroduce the visa\r\nrequirement for citizens or certain categories of citizens of all Member States\r\nand not for citizens or certain categories of citizens of individual Member\r\nStates. If Ukraine would reintroduce the visa requirement for EU citizens or\r\ncertain categories of EU citizens, the same facilitations granted under this\r\nagreement to the Ukrainian citizens would automatically, on the basis of\r\nreciprocity, apply to EU citizens concerned.\"\nAccording to the\r\ndecisions taken by the Ukrainian government, as from 1 May 2005 or 1 January\r\n2008 respectively, EU citizens are exempted from the visa requirement when\r\ntravelling to Ukraine for a period of time not exceeding 90 days or transiting\r\nthrough the territory of Ukraine. This provision does not affect the right of\r\nthe Ukrainian government to amend these decisions.\n1.2. Scope of the\r\nAgreement.\nArticle 2 of the\r\nAgreement stipulates that:\n\"1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nvisa facilitations provided in this Agreement shall apply to citizens of Ukraine only insofar as they are not exempted from the visa requirement by the laws and regulations\r\nof the European Union or the Member States, the present agreement or other\r\ninternational agreements.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nnational law of Ukraine, or of the Member States or European Union law shall\r\napply to issues not covered by the provisions of this Agreement, such as the\r\nrefusal to issue a visa, recognition of travel documents, proof of sufficient\r\nmeans of subsistence and the refusal of entry and expulsion measures.\"\nWithout prejudice to\r\nArticle 10 (which provides for the exemption from the visa requirement for\r\nholders of diplomatic passports and biometric service passports of Ukraine), the Agreement does not affect the existing rules on visa obligations and visa\r\nexemptions.\u00a0 For instance, Article 4 of Council Regulation N\u00b0539/2001\u00a0 allows\r\nMember States to exempt from the visa requirement civilian air and sea crews\r\namong other categories.\nSchengen rules and,\r\nwhere appropriate, national law continue to apply to all issues not covered by\r\nthe Agreement such as the refusal to issue a visa, recognition of travel\r\ndocuments, proof of sufficient means of subsistence, the refusal of entry, and\r\nexpulsion measures. This also applies to the Schengen rules determining the Schengen Member State responsible for processing a visa application. Therefore, a Ukrainian\r\ncitizen should continue to apply for a visa to the consulate of the Member\r\nState of the main destination of his/her travelling; if there is no main\r\ndestination, (s)he should apply to the consulate of the Member State of first\r\nentry into the Schengen area.\nEven if the\r\nconditions foreseen in the Agreement are met, for example, proof of documentary\r\nevidence regarding the purpose of the journey for the categories foreseen in\r\nArticle 4 is provided by the visa applicant, the issuance of the visa still can\r\nbe refused if the conditions laid down in Article 5 of the Schengen Borders\r\nCode\u00a0 are not fulfilled, i.e. the person is not in possession of a valid travel\r\ndocument, an alert in the SIS has been issued, the person is considered a\r\nthreat for public policy, internal security, etc. \nOther possibilities\r\nfor flexibility in the issuing of visas allowed in the Visa Code\u00a0 for issuing\r\nvisas continue to apply. For instance, multiple-entry visas for a long period\r\nof validity- up to five years- can be issued to categories of persons other\r\nthan those mentioned in Article 5, if the conditions foreseen in the Visa Code\r\nare met (cfr. Article 24 (2) of the Visa Code). In the same way, the provisions\r\ncontained in the Visa Code allowing waiver or reduction of the visa fee will\r\ncontinue to apply (cfr. infra II.2.1.1.).\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Types of\r\nvisas falling within the scope of the Agreement.\nArticle 3 (d) of the\r\nAgreement defines \"visa\" as \"an authorisation issued by a Member State or a decision taken by such State which is required with a view to:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 entry for\r\nan intended stay in that Member State or in several Member States of no more\r\nthan 90 days in total,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 entry for\r\ntransit through the territory of that Member State or several Member States,\"\nThe following types\r\nof visas are covered by the Agreement:\n- \"C\"\r\nvisas (short-stay visas).\nThe facilitations\r\nprovided by the Agreement apply both to uniform visas valid for the entire\r\nterritory of the Member States and to visas with limited territorial validity\r\n(LTV).\u00a0 \n1.4. Calculation of\r\nthe length of stay authorised by a visa and in particular the question on how\r\nto determine the six month period\nThe recent\r\nmodification of the Schengen Borders Code has re-defined the notion of short\r\nstay. The current definition reads as follows: \"90 days in any 180\r\nday-period, which entails considering the 180-day period preceding each day of\r\nstay\". \nThe day of entry\r\nshall be calculated as the first day of stay in the territory of the Member\r\nStates and the day of exit shall be calculated as the last day of stay in the\r\nterritory of the Member States. The notion of \"any\" implies the\r\napplication of a \"moving\" 180-day reference period, looking at each\r\nday of the stay back to the last 180 days period, in order to verify if the\r\n90/180 day requirement continues to be fulfilled. This means that an absence\r\nfor an uninterrupted period of 90 days allows for a new stay of up to 90 days.\nThe definition entered\r\ninto force on 18 October 2013. The calculator may be found on-line at the\r\nfollowing address:\r\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/border-crossing/index_en.htm\nExample of\r\ncalculation of stay on the basis of the new definition:\nA person holding a\r\nmultiple entry visa for 1 year (18.4.2014 \u2013 18.4.2015) enters for the first\r\ntime on 19.4.2014 and stays for 3 days. Then he enters again on 18.6.2014 and\r\nstays for 86 days. What is the situation on specific dates? When will this\r\nperson be allowed to enter again? \nOn 11.9.2014: Over\r\nthe last 180 days (16.3.2014 \u2013 11.9.2014) the person had stayed for 3 days (19.\r\n\u2013 21.4.2014) plus 86 days (18.6.2014 \u2013 11.9.2014) = 89 days = No overstay. The\r\nperson may still stay for up to 1 day.\nAs of 16.10.2014:\r\nThe person might enter for a stay of 3 additional days (on 16.10.2014the stay\r\non 19.4.2014 becomes irrelevant (outside the 180 days period); on 17.10.2014\r\nthe stay on 20.4.2014 becomes irrelevant (outside the 180 days period; etc.).\nAs of 15.12.2014:\r\nThe person might enter for 86 additional days (on 15.12.2014, the stay on\r\n18.6.2014 becomes irrelevant (outside the 180 days period); on 16.12.2014, the\r\nstay on 19.6.2014 becomes irrelevant, etc.).\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Situation\r\nregarding the Member States that do not yet fully apply the Schengen acquis,\u00a0\r\nthe Member States that do not participate in the EU Common Visa Policy and\r\nassociated countries.\nMember States that\r\njoined the EU in 2004 (Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic), 2007 (Bulgaria and Romania), and 2013 (Croatia) are bound by the Agreement as from its entry into force.\nOnly Cyprus, Romania, Bulgaria, and Croatia, do not yet fully implement the Schengen acquis. They will\r\ncontinue issuing national visas with a validity limited to their own national\r\nterritory. Once these Member States fully implement the Schengen acquis, they\r\nwill continue to apply the Agreement.\nNational law\r\ncontinues to apply to all issues not covered by the Agreement until the date of\r\nfull implementation of the Schengen acquis by these Member States. As from that\r\ndate, Schengen rules/national law shall apply to issues not regulated by the\r\nAgreement.\nBulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are authorised to recognise residence\r\npermits, D visas and short stay visas issued by Schengen States and associated\r\ncountries for short stays on their territory. \nAccording to Article\r\n21 of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement, all Schengen States\r\nmust recognise the long-stay visas and residence permits issued by each other\r\nas valid for short stays on each other\u2019s territories. Schengen Member States\r\naccept residence permits, D visas and short stay visas of associated countries\r\nfor entry and short stay and vice versa. \nThe Agreement does\r\nnot apply to the UK, Ireland and Denmark but comprises joint declarations about\r\nthe desirability of those Member States to conclude bilateral agreements on\r\nvisa facilitation with Ukraine.\nA bilateral\r\nagreement on visa facilitation between Denmark and Ukraine entered into force\r\non 1 March 2009. No negotiations on visa facilitation have taken place between Ukraine and, respectively, the United Kingdom and Ireland.\nAlthough associated\r\nto Schengen, the Agreement does not apply to Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Iceland but comprises joint declarations about the desirability of those Schengen\r\ncountries to conclude bilateral agreements on visa facilitation with Ukraine.\nNorway has signed a bilateral visa facilitation agreement on 13 February\r\n2008. This agreement entered into force on 1 September 2011.\nSwitzerland finalised the negotiations on a bilateral visa facilitation\r\nagreement in November 2011. Iceland has indicated that negotiations with Ukraine have begun.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European\r\nUnion Agreement/Bilateral agreements.\nArticle 13 (1) of\r\nthe Agreement stipulates that \n\"1. As from its\r\nentry into force, this Agreement shall take precedence over provisions of any\r\nbilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements concluded between\r\nindividual Member States and Ukraine, insofar as the provisions of the latter\r\nagreements or arrangements cover issues dealt with by the present Agreement.\"\nAs from the date of\r\nentry into force of the Agreement, provisions in the bilateral agreements in\r\nforce between Member States and Ukraine on issues dealt with by the visa\r\nfacilitation agreement ceased to apply. In accordance with European Union law,\r\nMember States have to take the necessary measures to eliminate the\r\nincompatibilities between their bilateral agreements and the European Union\r\nAgreement.\nHowever, Art. 13(2)\r\nof the Agreement stipulates that\n\"2. The\r\nprovisions of bilateral Agreements or arrangements between individual Member\r\nStates and Ukraine concluded before the entry into force of this Agreement\r\nproviding for the exemption of the holders of non-biometric service passports\r\nfrom the visa requirement shall continue to apply without prejudice to the\r\nright of the Member States concerned or Ukraine to denounce or suspend these\r\nbilateral agreements or arrangements.\"\nThe following Member\r\nStates have a bilateral agreement with Ukraine providing for the exemption from\r\nthe visa obligation for holders of service passports: Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.\nIn accordance with\r\nArticle 13(1), in so far as these agreements cover biometric service passport\r\nholders, Article 10(2) of the amended Agreement takes precedence over these\r\nAgreements. In accordance with Article 13(2), these agreements, which were\r\nconcluded before the entry into force of the amending Agreement, shall continue\r\nto apply in so far as they cover non-biometric service passport holders,\r\nwithout prejudice to the right of the Member States concerned or Ukraine to denounce or suspend these bilateral agreements or arrangements. The visa\r\nexemption for the holders of non-biometric service passport granted by a Member State only applies for travelling on the territory of this Member State and not for\r\ntravelling to the other Schengen Member States.\nShould a Member State have concluded a bilateral agreement or arrangement with Ukraine on issues not covered by the European Union Agreement, this exemption would\r\ncontinue to apply after the entry into force of the European Union visa\r\nfacilitation Agreement.\n1.7. European Community\r\nDeclaration on access of visa applicants and harmonisation of information on\r\nprocedures for issuing short-stay visas and documents to be submitted when\r\napplying for short-stay visas.\nIn accordance with\r\nthis European Community Declaration annexed to the initial Agreement, common\r\nbasic information on access of visa applicants to diplomatic missions and\r\nconsular posts of the Member States and on the procedures and conditions for\r\nissuing visas and on the validity of visas issued has been drafted to ensure\r\nthat applicants are given coherent and uniform information.\u00a0 This information\r\nis available at website of the EU Delegation to Ukraine:\r\nhttp://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/ukraine/index_en.htm\nDiplomatic missions\r\nand consular posts are requested to disseminate widely this information (on the\r\ninformation boards, in leaflets, on websites, etc) and to disseminate also\r\nprecise information on the conditions for issuing visas, representation of\r\nMember States in Ukraine and the harmonised EU list of required supporting\r\ndocumentation.\n\u00a0\nII. GUIDELINES ON\r\nSPECIFIC PROVISIONS.\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rules that\r\napply to all visa applicants\nImportant: It is\r\nrecalled that the facilitations mentioned below regarding the visa handling\r\nfee, the length of procedures for processing visa applications, departure in\r\ncase of lost or stolen documents, and the extension of visa in exceptional\r\ncircumstances apply to all Ukrainian visa applicants and visa holders.\n2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0 Visa\r\nhandling fee.\nArticle 6(1) of the\r\nAgreement stipulates that:\n\"The fee for processing\r\nvisa applications of Ukrainian citizens shall amount to EUR 35. The\r\naforementioned amount may be reviewed in accordance with the procedure provided\r\nfor in Article 14(4).\"\nIn accordance with\r\nArticle 6(1), the fee for processing a visa application is 35 EUR. This fee\r\nwill apply to all Ukrainian visa applicants (including tourists) and concerns\r\nshort-stay visas, irrespective of the number of entries. It also applies to\r\nvisa applications lodged at the external borders.\nArticle 6(2) of the\r\nAgreement stipulates that:\n\"If Ukraine would reintroduce the visa requirement for EU citizens, the visa fee to be charged by Ukraine shall not be higher than EUR 35 or the amount agreed if the fee is reviewed in\r\naccordance with the procedure provided for in Article 14(4).\"\nArticle 6(3) of the\r\nAgreement stipulates that:\n\"The Member\r\nStates shall charge a fee of EUR 70 for processing visas in cases where, based\r\non the distance between the applicant's place of residence and the place where\r\nthe application has been submitted, the applicant has requested that a decision\r\non the application be taken within three days of its submission, and the\r\nconsulate has accepted to take a decision within three days.\"\nA \u20ac70 fee shall be\r\ncharged for processing visa applications in cases where the visa application\r\nand the supporting documents have been submitted by the visa applicant whose\r\nplace of residence is known to be in the oblast in which the Member State to\r\nwhich the applicant wishes to travel has no consular representation (if in that\r\noblast there is no consulate, nor visa centre, nor consulates of the Member\r\nStates that have concluded representation agreements with the Member State to\r\nwhich the applicant wishes to travel), and when the diplomatic mission or\r\nconsular post has agreed to take a decision on the visa application within\r\nthree days. Evidence regarding the place of residence of visa applicant is\r\nprovided in the visa application form. \nIn principle, Article\r\n6(3) aims at facilitating applying for a visa by the applicants living at a\r\nlarge distance from the consulate. Should\u00a0 a long trip be needed in order to\r\napply for the visa, the aim is to issue it quickly, so that the applicant can\r\nreceive the visa without having the need of undertaking the same lengthy travel\r\nfor a second time.\nFor the above\r\nmentioned reasons, in cases where the \"standard\" processing time for\r\na visa application by a given diplomatic mission or consular post takes 3 days\r\nor less, the standard \u20ac35 visa fee shall be charged. \nFor diplomatic\r\nmissions and consular posts that have an appointment system, the period of time\r\nto get an appointment is not counted as part of the processing time (see also\r\npoint 2.1.2).\nArticle 6(4) of the\r\nAgreement stipulates that:\n\"4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without\r\nprejudice to paragraph 5 fees for processing the visa application are waived\r\nfor the following categories of persons:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for close\r\nrelatives \u2013 spouses, children (including adopted) parents (including\r\ncustodians), grandparents and grandchildren \u2013 of citizens of Ukraine legally\r\nresiding in the territory of the Member States or citizens of the European\r\nUnion residing in the territory of the Member State of which they are\r\nnationals;\"\nThis paragraph\r\nregulates the situation of Ukrainian close relatives travelling to the Member\r\nStates to visit Ukrainian citizens legally residing in the Member States or\r\ncitizens of the European Union residing in the territory of the Member State of\r\nwhich they are nationals. Ukrainian visa applicants who are family members of a\r\nUnion citizen, in the sense of Article 5(2) of Directive 2004/38/EC of 29 April\r\n2004 , shall be issued visas free of charge, as soon as possible and on the\r\nbasis of an accelerated procedure.\n\"(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for\r\nmembers of official delegations who, following an official invitation addressed\r\nto Ukraine, shall participate in meetings, consultations, negotiations or\r\nexchange programmes, as well as in events held in the territory of one of the\r\nMember States by intergovernmental organisations;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 members\r\nof national and regional Governments and Parliaments, Constitutional Courts and\r\nSupreme Courts, in case they are not exempted from the visa requirement by the\r\npresent Agreement;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 pupils,\r\nstudents, post-graduate students and accompanying teachers who undertake trips\r\nfor the purpose of study or educational training;\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 disabled\r\npersons and the person accompanying them, if necessary;\" (N.B.

Moreover, according to\r\nArticle 16 (6) of the Visa Code \"in individual cases, the amount of the\r\nfee to be charged may be waived or reduced when to do so serves to promote\r\ncultural or sporting interests as well as interests in the field of foreign\r\npolicy, development policy, other areas of vital public interest or for\r\nhumanitarian reasons.\"\u00a0 \nHowever, this rule\r\ncannot be applied to waive the \u20ac70 visa fee for processing visas in individual\r\ncases where the visa application and the supporting documents have been\r\nsubmitted by the visa applicant whose place of residence is known to be based\r\nfar away from the diplomatic mission or consular post of the Member State and\r\nwho belongs to one of the visa fee exempted categories listed in Article 6(4)\r\nof the Agreement. \nIt should also be\r\nrecalled that the visa fee exempted categories of persons could still be\r\nsubject to a service fee in case a Member State cooperates with an external\r\nservice provider.\nArticle 6(5) of the\r\nAgreement stipulates that:\n\u201c5. If a Member State cooperates with an external service provider in view of issuing a visa the\r\nexternal service provider may charge a service fee. This fee shall be\r\nproportionate to the costs incurred by the external service provider while\r\nperforming its tasks and shall not exceed EUR 30. The Member States shall\r\nmaintain the possibility for all applicants to lodge their applications\r\ndirectly at their consulates. If applicants are required to obtain an\r\nappointment for the lodging of an application the appointment shall, as a rule,\r\ntake place within a period of two weeks from the date when the appointment was\r\nrequested.\"\n\u00a0\nMaintaining the\r\npossibility for all categories of visa applicants to lodge their applications\r\ndirectly at the consulate instead of via an external service provider implies\r\nthat there should be a genuine choice between these two possibilities. Even if\r\ndirect access does not have to be organised under identical or similar\r\nconditions to those for access to the service provider, the conditions should\r\nnot make direct access impossible in practice. Even if it is acceptable to have\r\na different waiting time for obtaining an appointment in the case of direct\r\naccess, the waiting time should not be so long that it would render direct\r\naccess impossible in practice.\n2.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0 Length of\r\nprocedures for processing visa applications. \nArticle 7 of the\r\nAgreement stipulates that:\n\"1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diplomatic\r\nmissions and consular posts of the Member States shall take a decision on the\r\nrequest to issue a visa within 10 calendar days of the date of the receipt of\r\nthe application and documents required for issuing the visa.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nperiod of time for taking a decision on a visa application may be extended up\r\nto 30 calendar days in individual cases, notably when further scrutiny of the\r\napplication is needed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nperiod of time for taking a decision on a visa application may be reduced to 2 working\r\ndays or less in urgent cases.\"\nA decision on the\r\nvisa application shall be taken, in principle, within 10 calendar days of the\r\ndate of the receipt of the complete visa application and supporting documents.\nThis period may be\r\nextended up to 30 days when further scrutiny is needed- for example, for\r\nconsultation of central authorities. \nAll these deadlines\r\nstart running only when the application file is complete, i.e. as from the date\r\nof reception of the visa application and the supporting documents. \nFor diplomatic\r\nmissions and consular posts that have an appointment system, the period of time\r\nto get an appointment is not counted as part of the processing time.\u00a0 When\r\nsetting the appointment, it should be taken into account the eventual urgency\r\nclaimed by the visa applicant in view of the implementation of Article 7(3).\u00a0\r\nAs a rule, appointments should take place within a period of two weeks from the\r\ndate when the appointment was requested (cfr. Article 6(5)).\u00a0 A longer period\r\nshould be an exception also in peak periods. The Joint Committee will monitor\r\nthis issue carefully. The Member States will endeavour to ensure that\r\nappointments at the request of the members of official delegations of Ukraine to lodge applications at diplomatic missions and consular posts should take place\r\nas soon as possible, preferably within a period of two working days, in urgent\r\ncases when the invitation has been sent out late. \nThe decision about\r\nthe reduced time for taking a decision on a visa application as defined in\r\nArticle 7(3) is taken by the consular officer.\n2.1.3. Extension of\r\nvisa in exceptional circumstances.\nArticle 9 of the\r\nAgreement stipulates that:\n\"The citizens\r\nof Ukraine who do not have the possibility to leave the territory of the Member\r\nStates by the time stated in their visas for reasons of force majeure shall\r\nhave the term of their visas extended free of charge in accordance with the\r\nlegislation applied by the receiving State for the period required for their\r\nreturn to the State of their residence.\"\nRegarding the\r\npossibility of extending the validity of the visa in cases of force majeure\r\n-for instance, stay in a hospital due to unforeseen reasons/sudden\r\ndesease/accident - where the holder of the visa does not have the possibility\r\nto leave the territory of the Member State by the date stated in the visa, the\r\nprovisions of the Article 33(1) of the Visa Code shall apply as long as they\r\nare compatible with the Agreement (for example, the extended visa shall remain\r\na uniform visa, entitling entry to the territory of all the Schengen Member\r\nStates for which the visa was valid at the time of issue).\u00a0 However, under the\r\nAgreement the extension of the visa is done for free in case of force majeure.\n2.2. Rules that\r\napply to certain categories of visa applicants.\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0 Documentary\r\nevidence regarding the purpose of the journey.\nFor all the\r\ncategories of persons listed in Article 4(1) including drivers conducting\r\ninternational cargo and passenger transportation services only the indicated\r\ndocumentary evidence will be required regarding the purpose of the journey. For\r\nthose categories of applicants no other documents regarding the purpose of stay\r\nmust be asked for. As stated in Article 4(3), no other justification,\r\ninvitation or validation regarding the purpose of the journey will be\r\nrequired.\u00a0 \nIf in individual\r\ncases doubts remain regarding the real purpose of the journey, the visa\r\napplicant shall be called for an (additional) in depth interview to the\r\nembassy/consulate where (s)he can be questioned regarding the actual purpose of\r\nthe visit or the applicant's intention to return- cfr Article 21(8) of the Visa\r\nCode. In such individual cases, additional documents can be provided by the\r\nvisa applicant or exceptionally requested by the consular officer.\u00a0 The Joint\r\nCommittee will closely monitor the issue.\nFor the categories\r\nof persons not mentioned in Article 4, the current rules shall continue to\r\napply regarding documentation proving the purpose of the journey.\u00a0 The same\r\napplies to documents regarding parents' consent for travel of children under 18\r\nyears old.\nSchengen rules or\r\nnational law shall apply to issues not covered by the provisions of this\r\nAgreement, such as recognition of travel documents, travel medical insurance\r\nand guarantees regarding return and sufficient means of subsistence (cfr supra\r\nI.1.2.).\u00a0 \nIn line with the\r\n\"European Union Declaration \u201con documents to be submitted when applying\r\nfor short-stay visas\" attached to the Agreement, \"the European Union\r\nwill establish a harmonised list of supporting documents, in accordance with\r\nArticle 48(1)(a) of the Visa Code, in order to ensure that applicants from\r\nUkraine are required to submit, in principle, the same supporting\r\ndocuments\"; Member States' Consulates, acting in Local Schengen\r\nCooperation, are asked to ensure that Ukrainian visa applicants are given\r\ncoherent and uniform basic information and are required to submit, in\r\nprinciple, the same supporting documents irrespectively of the Consulate of the\r\nMember State where they apply. \nIn principle, the\r\noriginal request or certificate of the document required by Article 4(1) shall\r\nbe submitted with the visa application.
