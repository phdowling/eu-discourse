The\nAgreement was initialled on 30 June 2014 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. \nAs soon as the Agreement enters into force,\nit will replace the two existing interim EPAs in the region, namely the\nStepping Stone Agreement with C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, which was initialled on\n7 December 2007, signed on 26 November 2008 and approved by the\nEuropean Parliament on 25 March 2009, and the Stepping Stone Agreement\nwith Ghana, which was initialled on 13 December 2007. \nCape Verde\ncurrently benefits from the special incentive arrangement for sustainable\ndevelopment and good governance in the scheme of generalised tariff preferences\n(GSP+), and Nigeria currently benefits from the scheme of generalised tariff\npreferences (GSP). The Agreement will take over from these schemes as soon as\nit enters into force. The other countries of the region currently benefit from\nthe 'Everything But Arms' initiative, since they are classified among the Least\nDeveloped Countries (LDCs). \nThe entry into force of the Agreement will\nensure a harmonised trade regime between the European Union and the West\nAfrican region, thereby supporting regional integration and the implementation\nof the ECOWAS Common External Tariff.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE\nAGREEMENT\nThe EPA contains provisions on trade in\ngoods, customs and trade facilitation, technical barriers to trade, sanitary\nand phytosanitary measures, and agriculture and fisheries. \nThe provisions concerning cooperation for\nthe implementation of the development dimension lay down the priority areas of\naction for the implementation of the EPA, which are set out in an EPA\nDevelopment Programme (PAPED), the financing arrangements for which are\nspecified in the Agreement. The Council declarations of 10 May 2010 and\n17 March 2014 confirm the commitment of the European Union and its Member States to provide financial support for the development of West Africa. \nThe Agreement contains commitments relating\nto regional integration, with the West African States undertaking to apply to\neach other the preferential treatment granted to the European Union under this\nAgreement. \nThe Agreement also provides for\nnegotiations to be continued at regional level on investment, services,\nintellectual property and innovation, current payments and capital movements,\nprotection of personal data, competition, consumer protection, sustainable\ndevelopment and public procurement.\nThe institutional provisions include the\nestablishment of a Joint Council of the West Africa-European Union EPA, which\nis to be responsible for supervising the implementation of the EPA. This\nCouncil will comprise members of the Ministerial Monitoring Committee of the\nWest Africa-European Union EPA and members of the Council of the European Union\nand of the Commission. It will be assisted by a Joint Implementation Committee\nof the EPA. A West Africa-European Union parliamentary committee will act as a\nforum for members of the European Parliament and of the regional parliaments of\nECOWAS and the UEMOA. A Joint West Africa-European Union Consultative Committee\nwill also assist the Joint Council of the EPA with a view to promoting dialogue\nand cooperation between representatives of civil society and the private\nsector. The EPA makes provision for its impact to be monitored comprehensively\nand to be examined every five years.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURES\nPending its entry into force, the EPA makes\nprovision for a provisional application mechanism.

The first column gives the heading\nnumber or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column\ngives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter.\nFor each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3\nor 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by\nan \u2018ex\u2019, this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply\nonly to the part of that heading described in column 2.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where several heading\nnumbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and\nthe description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general\nterms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which,\nunder the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in\nany of the headings grouped together in column 1.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where there are different\nrules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent\ncontains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent\nrules in column 3 or 4.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where, for an entry in the\nfirst two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter\nmay opt to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column\n4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to\nbe applied.\nNote 3\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of Article\n4 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired originating status which\nare used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this\nstatus has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in\nanother factory in the European Union or in the West African States.\nExample:\nAn engine of heading 8407, for which the rule\nstates that the value of the non-originating materials which may be\nincorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is made from\n\u2018other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\u2019 of heading ex 7224.\nIf this forging has been forged in the European\nUnion from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status\nby virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging\ncan then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine,\nregardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory\nin the European Union. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken\ninto account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rule in the list\nrepresents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the\ncarrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status;\nconversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer\noriginating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at\na certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an\nearlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a\nlater stage is not.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without prejudice to Note\n3.2 where a rule states that \u2018materials of any heading\u2019 may be used, materials\nof the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any\nspecific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the\nexpression \u2018manufacture from materials of any heading, including other\nmaterials of heading ...\u2019 means that only materials classified in the same\nheading as the product of a description other than that of the product as given\nin column 2 of the list may be used.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When a rule in the list\nspecifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this\nmeans that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be\nused.\nExample:\nThe rule for fabrics of headings 5208\nto 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical\nmaterials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that\nboth have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a rule in the list\nspecifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the\ncondition does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their\ninherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.3 below in relation\nto textiles).\nExample:\nThe rule for prepared foods of heading 1904,\nwhich specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not\nprevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not\nproduced from cereals.\nHowever, this does not apply to products which,\nalthough they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in\nthe list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier\nstage of manufacture.\nExample:\nIn the case of an article of apparel of\nex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only\nnon-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible\nto start from non-woven cloth \u2013 even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be\nmade from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the\nstage before yarn \u2013 that is, the fibre stage.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where, in a rule in the\nlist, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating\nmaterials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together.\nIn other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may\nnever exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual\npercentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to\nwhich they apply.\nNote 4\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The term \u2018natural fibres\u2019\nis used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic\nfibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including\nwaste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded,\ncombed or otherwise processed, but not spun.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The term \u2018natural fibres\u2019\nincludes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002\nand 5003, as well as wool fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of\nheadings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201\nto 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The terms \u2018textile pulp\u2019,\n\u2018chemical materials\u2019 and \u2018paper-making materials\u2019 are used in the list to\ndescribe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used\nto manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The term \u2018man-made staple\nfibres\u2019 is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow,\nstaple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.\nNote 5\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where, for a given product\nin the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3\nshall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of\nthis product and which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the\ntotal weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and\n5.4 below.)\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the tolerance\nmentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have\nbeen made from two or more basic textile materials.\nThe following are the basic textile materials:\n\u2013              \nsilk,\n\u2013              \nwool,\n\u2013              \ncoarse animal hair,\n\u2013              \nfine animal hair,\n\u2013              \nhorsehair,\n\u2013              \ncotton,\n\u2013              \npaper-making materials and paper,\n\u2013              \nflax,\n\u2013              \ntrue hemp,\n\u2013              \njute and other textile bast fibres,\n\u2013              \nsisal and other textile fibres of the genus\nAgave,\n\u2013              \ncoconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable\ntextile fibres,\n\u2013              \nsynthetic man-made filaments,\n\u2013              \nartificial man-made filaments,\n\u2013              \ncurrent-conducting filaments,\n\u2013              \nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of\npolypropylene,\n\u2013              \nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,\n\u2013              \nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,\n\u2013              \nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of\npolyacrylonitrile,\n\u2013              \nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,\n\u2013              \nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of\npolytetrafluoroethylene,\n\u2013              \nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of\npolyphenylene sulphide,\n\u2013              \nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl\nchloride,\n\u2013              \nother synthetic man-made staple fibres,\n\u2013              \nartificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,\n\u2013              \nother artificial man-made staple fibres,\n\u2013              \nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with\nflexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,\n\u2013              \nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with\nflexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,\n\u2013              \nproducts of heading 5605 (metallised yarn)\nincorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of\nplastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not\nexceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive\nbetween two layers of plastic film,\n\u2013              \nother products of heading 5605.\nExample:\nA yarn of heading 5205 made from cotton\nfibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506 is\na mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not\nsatisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or\ntextile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.\nExample:\nA woollen fabric of heading 5112 made from\nwoollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading\n5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the\norigin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile\npulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require\nmanufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for\nspinning) or a combination of the two may be used, provided that their total\nweight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.\nExample:\nTufted textile fabric of heading 5802 made from\ncotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210 is only a mixed\nproduct if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns\nclassified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves\nmixtures.\nExample:\nIf the tufted textile fabric concerned had been\nmade from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407,\nthen, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and\nthe tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of products\nincorporating \u2018yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of\npolyether, whether or not gimped\u2019 this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of\nthe yarn.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of products\nincorporating a \u2018strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of\nplastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not\nexceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of\nplastic film\u2019, this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.\nNote 6\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of those\ntextile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this\nIntroductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the\nrule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up products concerned may be used\nprovided that their weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the total weight of\nall the textile materials incorporated.\nTextile trimmings and accessories are those\nclassified in Chapters 50 to 63.
