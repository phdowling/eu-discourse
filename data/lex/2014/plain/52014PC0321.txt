Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the Commission\r\ndecided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more\r\nthan ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that\r\ndepartments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for\r\nwhich they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and\r\nreadily understandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law\r\napplicable to a given matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament,\r\nthe Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the\r\nfast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 260/2009 of 26 February 2009 on the common rules for imports[3]. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in\r\nit[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by\r\nthe codification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was drawn up on the\r\nbasis of a preliminary consolidation, in 22 official languages, of Regulation (EC) No 260/2009 and the\r\ninstrument amending it, carried out by the Publications Office of the European\r\nUnion, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have been\r\ngiven new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown\r\nin a table set out in Annex III to the codified Regulation.\n\u00ea 260/2009\r\n(adapted)\n2014/0166 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non common rules for imports (codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article  \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No  \u00d6 260/2009[6] \u00d5 has been\r\nsubstantially amended[7]. In the interests of clarity and rationality, \u00d6 that \u00d5 Regulation\r\nshould be codified.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ncommon commercial policy should be based on uniform principles.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\n\u00d6 European \u00d5 Community concluded\r\nthe Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018WTO\u2019). Annex 1A to that\r\nAgreement contains inter alia the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (\u00d6 hereinafter\r\nreferred to as \u00d5 \u2018GATT 1994\u2019)\r\nand an Agreement on Safeguards.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nAgreement on Safeguards meets the need to clarify and reinforce the disciplines\r\nof GATT 1994, and specifically those of Article XIX. That Agreement requires\r\nthe elimination of safeguard measures which escape those rules, such as\r\nvoluntary export restraints, orderly marketing arrangements and any other\r\nsimilar import or export arrangements.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nAgreement on Safeguards also covers coal and steel products. The common rules\r\nfor imports, especially as regards safeguard measures, therefore also apply to\r\nthose products without prejudice to any possible measures to apply an agreement\r\nspecifically concerning coal and steel products.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ntextile products covered by Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94[8] are subject to special treatment at \u00d6 Union \u00d5 and\r\ninternational level. They should therefore be excluded from the scope of this\r\nRegulation.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission should be informed by the Member States of any danger created by\r\ntrends in imports which might call for \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nor the application of safeguard measures.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nsuch instances the Commission should examine the terms and conditions under\r\nwhich imports occur, the trend in imports, the various aspects of the economic\r\nand trade situations and, where appropriate, the measures to be applied.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If\r\nprior \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nis applied, release for free circulation of the products concerned should be\r\nmade subject to presentation of a surveillance document meeting uniform\r\ncriteria. That document should, on simple application by the importer, be\r\nissued by the authorities of the Member States within a certain period but\r\nwithout the importer thereby acquiring any right to import. The surveillance\r\ndocument should therefore be valid only during such period as the import rules\r\nremain unchanged.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\n  Member States and the Commission should exchange the information resulting\r\nfrom \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nas fully as possible.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It falls to the Commission to adopt the\r\nsafeguard measures required by the interests of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 . Those\r\ninterests should be considered as a whole and should in particular encompass\r\nthe interests of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers,\r\nusers and consumers.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Safeguard\r\nmeasures against a member of the WTO may be considered only if the product in\r\nquestion is imported into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 in such\r\ngreatly increased quantities and on such terms or conditions as to cause, or\r\nthreaten to cause, serious injury to \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers of\r\nlike or directly competing products, unless international obligations permit\r\nderogation from this rule.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nterms \u2018serious injury\u2019, \u2018threat of serious injury\u2019 and \u2018 \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\u2019\r\nshould be defined and precise criteria for determining injury should be \u00d6 laid down \u00d5 .\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An\r\ninvestigation should precede the application of any safeguard measure, subject\r\nto the reservation that the Commission be allowed in urgent cases to apply\r\nprovisional measures.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There\r\nshould be detailed provisions on the opening of investigations, the checks and\r\ninspections required, access by exporter countries and interested parties to\r\nthe information gathered, hearings for the parties involved and the\r\nopportunities for those parties to submit their views.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nprovisions on investigations \u00d6 laid down\r\nin \u00d5 this\r\nRegulation are without prejudice to \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or national\r\nrules concerning professional secrecy.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis also necessary to set time limits for the initiation of investigations and\r\nfor determinations as to whether or not measures are appropriate, with a view\r\nto ensuring that such determinations are made quickly, in order to increase\r\nlegal certainty for the economic operators concerned.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\ncases in which safeguard measures take the form of a quota the level of the\r\nlatter should be set in principle no lower than the average level of imports\r\nover a representative period of at least three years.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\ncases in which a quota is allocated among supplier countries each country\u2019s\r\nquota may be determined by agreement with the countries themselves or by taking\r\nas a reference the level of imports over a representative period. Derogations\r\nfrom these rules should nevertheless be possible where there is serious injury\r\nand a disproportionate increase in imports, provided that due consultation\r\nunder the auspices of the WTO Committee on Safeguards takes place.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nmaximum duration of safeguard measures should be determined and specific\r\nprovisions regarding extension, progressive liberalisation and reviews of such\r\nmeasures be laid down.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ncircumstances in which products originating in a developing country which is a\r\nmember of the WTO are to be exempt from safeguard measures should be\r\nestablished.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Surveillance\r\nor safeguard measures confined to one or more regions of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 may prove more\r\nsuitable than measures applying to the whole \u00d6 Union \u00d5 . However,\r\nsuch measures should be authorised only exceptionally and where no alternative\r\nexists. It is necessary to ensure that such measures are temporary and cause\r\nthe minimum of disruption to the operation of the internal market.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe \u00d6 interests \u00d5 of uniformity\r\nin rules for imports, the formalities to be carried out by importers should be \u00d6 simple \u00d5 and identical\r\nregardless of the place where the goods clear customs. It is therefore\r\ndesirable to provide that any formalities should be carried out using forms\r\ncorresponding to the specimen annexed to \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Surveillance\r\ndocuments issued in connection with \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nmeasures should be valid throughout the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 irrespective\r\nof the Member State of issue.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19 (adapted)\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00d6 The \u00d5 implementation \u00d6 of this\r\nRegulation \u00d5 requires uniform conditions for adopting provisional and definitive\r\nsafeguard measures, and for the imposition of prior surveillance measures. Those\r\nmeasures should be adopted by the Commission in accordance with\r\nRegulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[9].\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nadvisory procedure should be used for the adoption of surveillance and\r\nprovisional measures given the effects of such measures and their sequential\r\nlogic in relation to the adoption of definitive safeguard measures. Where a\r\ndelay in the imposition of measures would cause damage which would be difficult\r\nto repair, it is necessary to allow the Commission to adopt immediately\r\napplicable provisional measures,\n\u00ea 260/2009\r\n(adapted)\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGeneral principles\nArticle 1\n1. This Regulation applies to imports of\r\nproducts originating in third countries, except for:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 textile products subject to\r\nspecific import rules under Regulation (EC) No 517/94;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the products originating in\r\ncertain third countries listed in Council Regulation (EC) No  625/2009[10].\n2. The products referred to in paragraph 1\r\nshall be freely imported into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 and\r\naccordingly, without prejudice to the safeguard measures which may be taken\r\nunder Chapter V, shall not be subject to any quantitative restrictions.\nCHAPTER II\n\u00a0\u00d6 Union \u00d5 information and consultation procedure\nArticle 2\nMember States shall inform the Commission\r\nif trends in imports appear to call for surveillance or safeguard measures.\r\nThis information shall contain the evidence available, as determined on the\r\nbasis of the criteria laid down in Article 9. The Commission shall immediately\r\npass this information on to all the Member States.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19(2)\nArticle 3\n1. The Commission shall be assisted by a\r\nCommittee on Safeguards. That Committee shall be a committee within the meaning\r\nof Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n2. Where reference is made to this\r\nparagraph, Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\n3. Where reference is made to this\r\nparagraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\n4. Where reference is made to this\r\nparagraph, Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, in conjunction with\r\nArticle 5 thereof, shall apply.\n5. Pursuant to Article 3(5) of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 182/2011, where recourse is made to the written procedure for\r\nadopting definitive measures pursuant to Article 16 of this Regulation, such\r\nprocedure shall be terminated without result where, within the time-limit set\r\ndown by the chair, the chair so decides or a majority of committee members as\r\ndefined in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 so request. Where\r\nrecourse is made to the written procedure in other instances where there has\r\nbeen a discussion of the draft measure in the committee, that procedure shall\r\nbe terminated without result where, within the time-limit set down by the\r\nchair, the chair so decides or a simple majority of committee members so\r\nrequest. Where recourse is made to the written procedure in other instances\r\nwhere there has not been a discussion of the draft measure in the committee, that\r\nprocedure shall be terminated without result where, within the time-limit set\r\ndown by the chair, the chair so decides or at least a quarter of committee\r\nmembers so request.\n\u00ea 260/2009\r\n(adapted)\nCHAPTER III\n\u00a0\u00d6 Union \u00d5 investigation procedure\nArticle 4\n1. Without prejudice to Article 7, the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 investigation\r\nprocedure shall be implemented before any safeguard measure is applied.\n2. Using as a basis the factors referred to\r\nin Article 9, the investigation shall seek to determine whether imports of the\r\nproduct in question are causing or threatening to cause serious injury to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\nconcerned.\n3. The following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018serious injury\u2019 means a\r\nsignificant overall impairment in the position of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018threat of serious injury\u2019 means\r\nserious injury that is clearly imminent;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018 \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\u2019 means\r\nthe producers as a whole of the like or directly competing products operating\r\nwithin the territory of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , or those\r\nwhose collective output of the like or directly competing products constitutes\r\na major proportion of the total \u00d6 Union \u00d5 production of\r\nthose products.\nArticle 5\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19(3)\n1. Where it is apparent to the Commission\r\nthat there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of an investigation,\r\nthe Commission shall initiate an investigation within one month of the date of\r\nreceipt of information from a Member State and publish a notice in the Official\r\nJournal of the European Union. That notice shall:\n\u00ea 260/2009\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 give a summary of the information\r\nreceived, and require that all relevant information is to be communicated to\r\nthe Commission;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 state the period within which\r\ninterested parties may make known their views in writing and submit\r\ninformation, if such views and information are to be taken into account during\r\nthe investigation;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 state the period within which\r\ninterested parties may apply to be heard orally by the Commission in accordance\r\nwith paragraph 4.\nThe Commission shall commence the\r\ninvestigation, acting in cooperation with the Member States.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19(3)\nThe Commission shall provide information to\r\nthe Member States concerning its analysis of the information normally within 21\r\ndays of the date on which the information is provided to the Commission.\n2. The Commission shall seek all\r\ninformation it deems necessary and, where it considers it appropriate, after\r\nhaving informed the Member States, endeavour to check that information with\r\nimporters, traders, agents, producers, trade associations and organisations.\n\u00ea 260/2009\r\n(adapted)\nThe Commission shall be assisted in this\r\ntask by staff of the Member State on whose territory these checks are being\r\ncarried out, provided that \u00d6 this \u00d5 Member State so wishes. \n3. The Member States shall supply the\r\nCommission, at its request and following procedures laid down by it, with the\r\ninformation at their disposal on developments in the market of the product\r\nbeing investigated.\n4. Interested parties which have come\r\nforward pursuant to the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and\r\nrepresentatives of the exporting country may, upon written request, inspect all\r\ninformation made available to the Commission in connection with the\r\ninvestigation other than internal documents prepared by the authorities of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or its Member\r\nStates, provided that that information is relevant to the presentation of their\r\ncase and not confidential within the meaning of Article 8 and that it is used\r\nby the Commission in the investigation.\nInterested parties which have come forward\r\nmay communicate their views on the information in question to the Commission.\r\nThose views may be taken into consideration where they are backed by sufficient\r\nevidence.\n5. The Commission may hear the interested\r\nparties. Such parties must be heard where they have made a written application\r\nwithin the period laid down in the notice published in the Official Journal\r\nof the European Union, showing that they are actually likely to be affected\r\nby the outcome of the investigation and that there are special reasons for them\r\nto be heard orally.\n6. When information is not supplied within\r\nthe time limits set by this Regulation or by the Commission pursuant to this\r\nRegulation, or the investigation is significantly impeded, findings may be made\r\non the basis of the facts available. Where the Commission finds that any\r\ninterested party or third party has supplied it with false or misleading\r\ninformation, it shall disregard the information and may make use of facts\r\navailable.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19(3)\n7. Where it appears to the Commission that\r\nthere is insufficient evidence to justify an investigation, it shall inform the\r\nMember States of its decision within one month of the date of receipt of the\r\ninformation from the Member States.\n\u00ea 260/2009\nArticle 6\n1. At the end of the investigation, the\r\nCommission shall submit a report on the results to the Committee.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19(4)\n2. Where the Commission considers, within\r\nnine months of the initiation of the investigation, that no Union surveillance\r\nor safeguard measures are necessary, the investigation shall be terminated\r\nwithin a month. The Commission shall terminate the investigation in accordance\r\nwith the advisory procedure referred to in Article 3(2).\n\u00ea 260/2009\r\n(adapted)\n3. If the Commission considers that \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nor safeguard measures are necessary, it shall take the necessary decisions in\r\naccordance with Chapters IV and V, no later than nine months from the\r\ninitiation of the investigation. In exceptional circumstances, this time limit\r\nmay be extended by a further maximum period of two months; the Commission\r\nshall then publish a notice in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union setting forth the duration of the extension and a\r\nsummary of the reasons therefore.\nArticle 7\n1. The provisions of this Chapter shall not\r\npreclude the use, at any time, of surveillance measures in accordance with\r\nArticles 10 to 14 or provisional safeguard measures in accordance with Articles\r\n15, 16 and 17.\nProvisional safeguard measures shall be\r\napplied:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in critical circumstances where\r\ndelay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, making immediate\r\naction necessary; and\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where a preliminary determination\r\nprovides clear evidence that increased imports have caused or are threatening\r\nto cause serious injury.\nThe duration of such measures shall not\r\nexceed 200 days.\n2. Provisional safeguard measures shall\r\ntake the form of an increase in the existing level of customs duty, whether the\r\nlatter is zero or higher, if such action is likely to prevent or repair the\r\nserious injury.\n3. The Commission shall immediately conduct\r\nwhatever investigation measures are still necessary.\n4. Should the provisional safeguard\r\nmeasures be repealed because no serious injury or threat of serious injury\r\nexists, the customs duties collected as a result of the provisional measures\r\nshall be automatically refunded as soon as possible. The procedure laid down in\r\nArticle  79 et seq. of Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council[11] shall apply.\nArticle 8\n1. Information received pursuant to this\r\nRegulation shall be used only for the purpose for which it was requested.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19(5)\n2. The Commission and the Member States, including the officials of either, shall not reveal any information of a\r\nconfidential nature received pursuant to this Regulation, or any information\r\nprovided on a confidential basis, without specific permission from the supplier\r\nof such information.\n\u00ea 260/2009\r\n(adapted)\n3. Each request for confidentiality shall\r\nstate the reasons why the information is confidential.\nHowever, if it appears that a request for\r\nconfidentiality is unjustified and if the supplier of the information wishes\r\nneither to make it public nor to authorise its disclosure in general terms or\r\nin the form of a summary, the information concerned may be disregarded.\n4. Information shall in any case be\r\nconsidered to be confidential if its disclosure is likely to have a\r\nsignificantly adverse effect upon the supplier or the source of such\r\ninformation.\n5. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not preclude\r\nreference by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 authorities to\r\ngeneral information and in particular to reasons on which decisions taken\r\npursuant to this Regulation are based. Those authorities shall, however, take\r\ninto account the legitimate interest of legal and natural persons concerned\r\nthat their business secrets should not be divulged.\nArticle 9\n1.

Where a threat of serious injury is\r\nalleged, the Commission shall also examine whether it is clearly foreseeable\r\nthat a particular situation is likely to develop into actual injury.\nIn this regard account may be taken of\r\nfactors such as:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the rate of increase of the\r\nexports to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 ;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00d6 the \u00d5 export\r\ncapacity in the country of origin or export, as it stands or is likely to be in\r\nthe foreseeable future, and the likelihood that that capacity will be used to\r\nexport to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\nCHAPTER IV\nSurveillance\nArticle 10\n1. Where the trend in imports of a product\r\noriginating in a third country covered by this Regulation threatens to cause\r\ninjury to \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers, and\r\nwhere the interests of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 so require,\r\nimport of that product may be subject, as appropriate, to:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 retrospective \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\ncarried out in accordance with the provisions laid down in the decision\r\nreferred to in paragraph 2;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 prior \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\ncarried out in accordance with Article  11.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19(6)\n2. The decision to impose surveillance\r\nshall be taken by the Commission by means of implementing acts in accordance\r\nwith the advisory procedure referred to in Article 3(2).\n\u00ea 260/2009\r\n(adapted)\n3. The surveillance measures shall have a\r\nlimited period of validity. Unless otherwise provided, they shall cease to be\r\nvalid at the end of the second six-month period following the six months in\r\nwhich the measures were introduced.\nArticle 11\n1. Products under prior \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nmay be put into free circulation only on production of a surveillance document.\r\nSuch document shall be issued by the competent authority designated by Member\r\nStates, free of charge, for any quantity requested and within a maximum of\r\nfive working days of receipt by the national competent authority of an application\r\nby any \u00d6 Union \u00d5 importer,\r\nregardless of his place of business in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 . This\r\napplication shall be deemed to have been received by the national competent\r\nauthority no later than three working days after submission, unless it is\r\nproved otherwise.\n2. The surveillance document shall be made\r\nout on a form corresponding to the model in Annex I.\nExcept where the decision to impose\r\nsurveillance provides otherwise, the importer\u2019s application for surveillance\r\ndocuments shall contain only the following:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the full name and address of the\r\napplicant (including telephone and fax numbers and any number identifying the\r\napplicant to the competent national authority), plus the applicant\u2019s VAT registration\r\nnumber if he is liable for VAT;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where appropriate, the full name\r\nand address of the declarant or of any representative appointed by the\r\napplicant (including telephone and fax numbers);\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a description of the goods giving\r\n\u00d6 their \u00d5 :\n\u2013              \r\n\u00a0trade name,\n\u2013              \r\n\u00a0combined nomenclature code,\n\u2013              \r\n\u00a0place of origin and place of consignment;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the quantity declared, in\r\nkilograms and, where appropriate, any other additional unit (pairs, items,\r\netc.);\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the value of the goods, CIF at \u00d6 Union \u00d5 frontier, in\r\neuro;\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the following statement, dated\r\nand signed by the applicant, with the applicant\u2019s name spelt out in capital\r\nletters:\n\u2018I, the undersigned, certify that the\r\ninformation provided in this application is true and given in good faith, and\r\nthat I am established in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\u2019\n3. The surveillance document shall be valid\r\nthroughout the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , regardless\r\nof the Member State of issue.\n4. A finding that the unit price at which\r\nthe transaction is effected exceeds that indicated in the surveillance document\r\nby less than 5 % or that the total value or quantity of the products\r\npresented for import exceeds the value or quantity given in the surveillance document\r\nby less than 5 % shall not preclude the release for free circulation of\r\nthe product in question. The Commission, having heard the opinions expressed in\r\nthe Committee and taking account of the nature of the products and other\r\nspecial features of the transactions concerned, may fix a different percentage,\r\nwhich, however, should not normally exceed 10 %.\n5. Surveillance documents may be used only\r\nfor such time as arrangements for liberalisation of imports remain in force in\r\nrespect of the transactions concerned. Such surveillance documents may not in\r\nany event be used beyond the expiry of a period which shall be laid down at the\r\nsame time and by means of the same procedure as the imposition of surveillance,\r\nand shall take account of the nature of the products and other special features\r\nof the transactions.\n6. Where the decision taken pursuant to\r\nArticle 10 so requires, the origin of products under \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nmust be proved by a certificate of origin. This paragraph shall not affect\r\nother provisions concerning the production of any such certificate.\n7. Where the product under prior \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nis subject to regional safeguard measures in a Member State, the import\r\nauthorisation granted by that Member State may replace the surveillance\r\ndocument.\n8. Surveillance document forms and extracts\r\nthereof shall be drawn up in duplicate, one copy, marked \u2018Holder\u2019s copy\u2019 and\r\nbearing the number 1, to be issued to the applicant, and the other, marked\r\n\u2018Copy for the competent authority\u2019 and bearing the number 2, to be kept by the\r\nauthority issuing the document. For administrative purposes the competent\r\nauthority may add supplementary copies to form 2.\n9.

Their size shall be\r\n210 mm \u00d7 297 mm; the type space between the lines shall be\r\n4,24 mm (one sixth of an inch); the layout of the forms shall be followed\r\nprecisely. Both sides of copy No 1, which is the surveillance document itself,\r\nshall in addition have a yellow printed guilloche pattern background so as to\r\nreveal any falsification by mechanical or chemical means.\n10. Member States shall be responsible for\r\nhaving the forms printed. The forms may also be printed by printers appointed\r\nby the Member State in which they are established. In the latter case,\r\nreference to the appointment by the Member State must appear on each form. Each\r\nform shall bear an indication of the printer\u2019s name and address or a mark\r\nenabling the printer to be identified.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19(7)\nArticle 12\nWhere the import of a product has not been\r\nmade subject to prior Union surveillance, the Commission, in accordance with\r\nArticle 17, may introduce surveillance confined to imports into one or more\r\nregions of the Union. The Commission shall provide information to the Member\r\nStates once it decides to introduce surveillance.\n\u00ea 260/2009\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 13\n1. Products under regional surveillance may\r\nbe put into free circulation in the region concerned only on production of a\r\nsurveillance document. Such document shall be issued by the competent authority\r\ndesignated by the Member State(s) concerned, free of charge, for any quantity\r\nrequested and within a maximum of five working days of receipt by the national\r\ncompetent authority of an application by any \u00d6 Union \u00d5 importer,\r\nregardless of his place of business in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 . This\r\napplication shall be deemed to have been received by the national competent\r\nauthority no later than three working days after submission, unless it is\r\nproved otherwise. Surveillance documents may be used only for such time as\r\narrangements for imports remain liberalised in respect of the transactions\r\nconcerned.\n2. Article 11(2) shall apply.\nArticle 14\n1. Member States shall communicate to the\r\nCommission within the first ten days of each month in the case of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or regional\r\nsurveillance:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in the case of prior\r\nsurveillance, details of the sums of money (calculated on the basis of CIF\r\nprices) and quantities of goods in respect of which surveillance documents were\r\nissued during the preceding period;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in every case, details of imports\r\nduring the period preceding the period referred to in point (a).\nThe information supplied by Member States\r\nshall be broken down by product and by country.\nDifferent provisions may be laid down at\r\nthe same time and by the same procedure as the surveillance arrangements.\n2. Where the nature of the products or\r\nspecial circumstances so require, the Commission may, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, amend the timetables for submitting this\r\ninformation.\n3. The Commission shall inform the Member\r\nStates accordingly.\nCHAPTER V\nSafeguard measures\nArticle 15\n1. Where a product is imported into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 in such\r\ngreatly increased quantities and/or on such terms or conditions as to cause, or\r\nthreaten to cause, serious injury to \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers, the\r\nCommission, in order to safeguard the interests of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , may, acting\r\nat the request of a Member State or on its own initiative:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 limit the period of validity of\r\nsurveillance documents within the meaning of Article  11 to be issued\r\nafter the entry into force of this measure;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 alter the import rules for the\r\nproduct in question by making its release for free circulation conditional on\r\nproduction of an import authorisation, the granting of which shall be governed\r\nby such provisions and subject to such limits as the Commission shall lay down.\nThe measures referred to in (a) and (b)\r\nshall take effect immediately.\n2. As regards members of the WTO, the\r\nmeasures referred to in paragraph 1 shall be taken only when the two conditions\r\nindicated in the first subparagraph of that paragraph are met.\n3. If establishing a quota, account shall\r\nbe taken in particular of:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the desirability of maintaining,\r\nas far as possible, traditional trade flows;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the volume of goods exported\r\nunder contracts concluded on normal terms and conditions before the entry into\r\nforce of a safeguard measure within the meaning of this Chapter, where such contracts\r\nhave been notified to the Commission by the Member State concerned;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the need to avoid jeopardising the achievement of\r\nthe aim pursued in establishing the quota.\nAny quota shall not be set lower than the\r\naverage level of imports over the last three representative years for\r\nwhich statistics are available unless a different level is necessary to prevent\r\nor remedy serious injury.\n4. In cases in which a quota is allocated\r\namong supplier countries, allocation may be agreed with those of them having a substantial\r\ninterest in supplying the product concerned for import into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\nFailing this, the quota shall be allocated\r\namong the supplier countries in proportion to their share of imports into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 of the product\r\nconcerned during a previous representative period, due account being taken of\r\nany specific factors which may have affected or may be affecting the trade in\r\nthe product.\nProvided that its obligation to see that\r\nconsultations are conducted under the auspices of the WTO Committee on\r\nSafeguards is not disregarded, the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 may\r\nnevertheless depart from this method of allocation in the case of serious\r\ninjury if imports originating in one or more supplier countries have increased\r\nin disproportionate percentage in relation to the total increase of imports of\r\nthe product concerned over a previous representative period.\n5. The measures referred to in this Article\r\nshall apply to every product which is put into free circulation after their\r\nentry into force. In accordance with Article 17 they may be confined to one or\r\nmore regions of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\nHowever, such measures shall not prevent\r\nthe release for free circulation of products already on their way to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 provided that\r\nthe destination of such products cannot be changed and that those products\r\nwhich, pursuant to Articles 10 and 11, may be put into free circulation only on\r\nproduction of a surveillance document are in fact accompanied by such a\r\ndocument.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19(8)\n6. Where intervention by the Commission has\r\nbeen requested by a Member State, the Commission, acting in accordance with the\r\nexamination procedure referred to in Article 3(3), or, in cases of\r\nurgency, in accordance with Article 3(4), shall take a decision within a\r\nmaximum of five working days of the date of receipt of such a request.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19(9)\nArticle 16\nWhere the interests of the Union so\r\nrequire, the Commission, acting in accordance with the examination procedure\r\nreferred to in Article 3(3) and the terms of Chapter III, may adopt appropriate\r\nmeasures to prevent a product being imported into the Union in such greatly\r\nincreased quantities and/or on such terms or conditions as to cause, or\r\nthreaten to cause, serious injury to Union producers of like or directly\r\ncompeting products.\nArticle 15(2) to (5) shall apply.\n\u00ea 260/2009\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 17\nWhere it emerges, primarily on the basis of\r\nthe factors referred to in Article 9, that the conditions laid down for the\r\nadoption of measures pursuant to Articles 10 and 15 are met in one or more\r\nregions of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , the Commission,\r\nafter having examined alternative solutions, may exceptionally authorise the\r\napplication of surveillance or safeguard measures limited to the region(s)\r\nconcerned if it considers that such measures applied at that level are more\r\nappropriate than measures applied throughout the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\nThese measures must be temporary and must\r\ndisrupt the operation of the internal market as little as possible.\nThe measures shall be adopted in accordance\r\nwith the provisions laid down in Articles 10 and 15.\nArticle 18\nNo safeguard measure may be applied to a\r\nproduct originating in a developing country member of the WTO as long as that\r\ncountry\u2019s share of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 imports of the\r\nproduct concerned does not exceed 3 %, provided that developing country\r\nmembers of the WTO with less than a 3 % import share collectively account\r\nfor not more than 9 % of total \u00d6 Union \u00d5 imports of the\r\nproduct concerned.\nArticle 19\n1. The duration of safeguard measures must\r\nbe limited to the period of time necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury\r\nand to facilitate adjustment on the part of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers. The\r\nperiod must not exceed four years, including the duration of any provisional\r\nmeasure.\n2. Such\r\ninitial period may be extended, except in the case of the measures referred to\r\nin the third subparagraph of Article 15(4) provided it is determined that:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the\r\nsafeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious\r\ninjury;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 there is evidence that \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers are\r\nadjusting.\n3. Extensions shall be adopted in\r\naccordance with the terms of Chapter III and using the same procedures as the\r\ninitial measures. A measure so extended shall not be more restrictive than it\r\nwas at the end of the initial period.\n4. If the duration of the measure exceeds\r\none year, the measure must be progressively liberalised at regular intervals\r\nduring the period of application, including the period of extension.\n5. The total period of application of a\r\nsafeguard measure, including the period of application of any provisional\r\nmeasures, the initial period of application and any prorogation thereof, may\r\nnot exceed eight years.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19(10)\nArticle 20\n1. While any surveillance or safeguard\r\nmeasure applied in accordance with Chapters IV and V is in operation the\r\nCommission may, either at the request of a Member State or on its own\r\ninitiative, and no later than the mid-point of the period of application of\r\nmeasures of a duration exceeding three years:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 examine the effects of the\r\nmeasure;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 determine whether and in what\r\nmanner it is appropriate to accelerate the pace of liberalisation;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ascertain whether application of\r\nthe measure is still necessary.\nWhere the Commission considers that the\r\napplication of the measure is still necessary, it shall inform the Member\r\nStates accordingly.\n2. Where the Commission considers that any\r\nsurveillance or safeguard measure referred to in Articles 10, 12, 15, 16 and 17\r\nshould be revoked or amended, it shall, acting in accordance with the\r\nexamination procedure referred to in Article 3(3), revoke or amend the measure.\nWhere the decision relates to regional\r\nsurveillance measures, it shall apply from the sixth day following that of its\r\npublication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\u00ea 260/2009\nArticle 21\n1. Where imports of a product have already\r\nbeen subject to a safeguard measure, no further measure shall be applied to\r\nthat product until a period equal to the duration of the previous measure has\r\nelapsed. Such period shall not be less than two years.\n2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a safeguard\r\nmeasure of 180 days or less may be re-imposed for a product if:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 at least one year has elapsed\r\nsince the date of introduction of a safeguard measure on the import of that\r\nproduct; and\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 such a safeguard measure has not\r\nbeen applied to the same product more than twice in the five-year period\r\nimmediately preceding the date of introduction of the measure.\nCHAPTER VI\nFinal provisions\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19(11)\nArticle 22\nWhere the interests of the Union so\r\nrequire, the Commission, acting in accordance with the examination procedure\r\nreferred to in Article 3(3), may adopt appropriate measures implementing\r\nlegislative acts to allow the rights and obligations of the Union or of all the\r\nMember States, in particular those relating to trade in commodities, to be\r\nexercised and fulfilled at international level.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .19(12)\nArticle 23\nThe Commission shall include information on\r\nthe implementation of this Regulation in its annual report on the application\r\nand implementation of trade defence measures presented to the European Parliament\r\nand to the Council pursuant to Article 22a of Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1225/2009[12].\n\u00ea 260/2009\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 24\n1.
