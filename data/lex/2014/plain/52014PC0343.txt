Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the\r\nCommission decided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more\r\nthan ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that\r\ndepartments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for\r\nwhich they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and\r\nreadily understandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law\r\napplicable to a given matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament,\r\nthe Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for\r\nthe fast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\npurpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 of 25 April 2005 establishing additional\r\ncustoms duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America[3]. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in\r\nit[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by\r\nthe codification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was drawn up on the\r\nbasis of a preliminary consolidation, in 22 official languages, of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 and the\r\ninstruments amending it, carried out by the Publications Office of the European\r\nUnion, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have\r\nbeen given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is\r\nshown in a table set out in Annex IV to the codified Regulation.\n\u00ea 673/2005\r\n(adapted)\n2014/0175 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\n\u00a0\u00d6 on \u00d5 additional\r\ncustoms duties on imports of certain products originating in the United   States of America (codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00ea \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 673/2005[6] has been substantially amended several times[7]. In the interests of clarity and rationality, that Regulation\r\nshould be codified.\n\u00ea 673/2005 recital\r\n1\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\n27 January 2003, the Dispute Settlement Body (\u2018DSB\u2019) of the World Trade\r\nOrganisation (\u2018WTO\u2019) adopted the Appellate Body report[8]\r\nand the Panel report[9], as upheld by the Appellate Body report, finding that the Continued\r\nDumping and Subsidy Offset Act (\u2018CDSOA\u2019) was incompatible with the United States' obligations under the \u2018WTO\u2019 agreements. \n\u00ea 673/2005\r\nrecital 2 (adapted)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\r\nthe United States failed to bring its legislation \u00d6 into \u00d5 conformity with the covered agreements, the Community requested \u00d6 authorisation from \u00d5 the DSB to suspend the application of its tariff concessions and\r\nrelated obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (\u2018GATT\u2019)\r\n1994 to the United States[10]. The United States objected to the level of suspension of tariff\r\nconcessions and related obligations and the matter was referred to arbitration.\n\u00ea 673/2005\r\nrecital 3 (adapted)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\n31 August 2004, the Arbitrator determined that the level of nullification\r\nor impairment caused every year to the Community was equal to 72 % of the\r\namount of CDSOA disbursements relating to anti-dumping or countervailing duties\r\npaid on imports from the Community for the most recent year for which data \u00d6 were \u00d5 available at\r\nthat time, as published by the United States' authorities. The Arbitrator\r\nconcluded that the suspension by the Community of concessions or other\r\nobligations, in the form of the imposition of an additional import duty above\r\nbound custom duties, on a list of products originating in the United States\r\ncovering, on a yearly basis, a total value of trade not exceeding the amount of\r\nnullification or impairment would be consistent with WTO rules. On 26 November\r\n2004, the DSB granted the authorisation to suspend the application to the United States of tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 in\r\naccordance with the decision of the Arbitrator.\n\u00ea 673/2005\r\nrecital 4 (adapted)\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCDSOA disbursements for the most recent year for which data \u00d6 were \u00d5 available \u00d6 at that\r\ntime \u00d5 relate to the\r\ndistribution of anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the\r\nFiscal Year 2004 (1 October 2003 to 30 September 2004). On the\r\nbasis of the data published by the United States' Customs and Border\r\nProtection, the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community \u00d6 was \u00d5 calculated at\r\nUSD 27,81 million. The Community \u00d6 was \u00d5, therefore, \u00d6 authorised\r\nto \u00d5 suspend the\r\napplication of its tariff concessions to the United States at an equivalent\r\namount. The effect of a 15 % ad valorem additional\r\nimport duty on imports of the products in Annex I originating in the\r\nUnited States \u00d6 represented \u00d5, over one\r\nyear, a value of trade that \u00d6 did \u00d5 not exceed USD\r\n27,81 million. In respect of \u00d6 those \u00d5 products, the Community \u00d6 suspended \u00d5 the\r\napplication of its tariff concessions to the United States from 1 May\r\n2005.\n\u00ea 673/2005 recital\r\n5 (adapted)\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If\r\nthe non-implementation of the DSB ruling and recommendation persists, the\r\nCommission should adjust annually the level of suspension to the level of\r\nnullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 at that time.\r\nThe Commission should amend the list in Annex I or the rate of the additional\r\nimport duty so that the effect of the additional duty on imports from the United States of the selected products represents, over one year, a value of trade that\r\ndoes not exceed the amount of nullification or impairment.\n\u00ea 673/2005\r\nrecital 6 (adapted)\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission should respect the following criteria:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Commission should amend the rate\r\nof the additional import duty when adding or removing products from the list in Annex I does not allow to adjust the\r\nlevel of suspension to the level of nullification or impairment; otherwise, the\r\nCommission should add products to the list in Annex I if the level of\r\nsuspension increases or withdraw products from \u00d6 that \u00d5 list if the level of suspension decreases;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if products are added, the Commission\r\nshould select the products from the list in Annex II in an automatic\r\nfashion following the order in which the products are listed; as a consequence,\r\nthe Commission should also amend the list in Annex II by removing from it the\r\nproducts added to the list in Annex I;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if products are withdrawn, the\r\nCommission should, first, remove products that were added to the list in Annex I \u00d6 after 1 May\r\n2005 \u00d5; the\r\nCommission should then remove products \u00d6 that\r\nwere \u00d5 in the list in\r\nAnnex I \u00d6 on 1 May\r\n2005 \u00d5 following the\r\norder of that list.\n\u00ea 38/2014 Art.\r\n1 and Annex .4 (adapted)\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  In order to make the necessary adjustments to the measures provided\r\nfor in \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation,\r\nthe power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty\r\nshould be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the rate of the\r\nadditional duty or the lists in Annexes I and II under the conditions laid\r\ndown in \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry\r\nout appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert\r\nlevel. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should\r\nensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\r\ndocuments to the European Parliament and to the Council,\n\u00ea 673/2005\r\n(adapted)\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThe tariff concessions and related\r\nobligations under GATT 1994 of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 are suspended\r\nin respect of products originating in the United States listed in Annex I\r\nto this Regulation.\n\u00ea 303/2014 Art.\r\n1(1) (adapted)\nArticle 2\nAn ad valorem duty of 0,35 %\r\nadditional to the customs duty applicable under Council Regulation (EEC)\r\nNo 2913/92[11]\r\nshall be imposed on the products originating in the United States listed in\r\nAnnex I to this Regulation.\n\u00ea 673/2005\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 3\n1.
