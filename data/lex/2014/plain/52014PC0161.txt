The ILO Governing Body established the Committee at its 318th Session\r\nin June 2013. At its 319th Session in October 2013, it further decided to\r\nconvene the first meeting of the Committee in Geneva from 7 to 11 April 2014\r\nand adopted its agenda, which includes the \u201cconsideration of proposals for\r\namendments to the Code of the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (MLC,\r\n2006)\".\nTwo matters for future amendments to the Code had\r\nbeen identified at the joint ILO/IMO[3]\r\nAd Hoc Expert Working Group on Liability and Compensation held in 2009[4] as a follow-up to a\r\nresolution adopted by the 94th (Maritime) Session of the\r\nInternational Labour Conference when it adopted the MLC[5]: the liability of\r\nshipowners with respect to compensation for claims for death, personal injury\r\nand to abandonment of seafarers. These two matters were further identified by\r\nthe Preparatory Committee established in 2010 by the Governing Body of the ILO as\r\nurgent matters for consideration at the first meeting of the Committee. \nTwo sets of Proposals for amendments to the\r\nCode of the MLC in this respect were jointly submitted by the group of\r\nshipowners and the group of seafarers at the Committee in October 2013, in\r\naccordance with paragraph 2 of Article XV of the MLC[6]. \nUnder the simplified procedure for amending the\r\nCode of the MLC provided for as per paragraph 3 of Article XV of the MLC, the\r\nDirector General of the ILO communicated the proposal for amendments to all ILO\r\nMember States with an invitation to transmit their observations and suggestions\r\nin October 2013[7]. The proposals for amendments were further made available to the\r\nEuropean Union in December 2013[8].\nThe Committee meeting in April 2014 is to\r\nconsider these two sets of proposals for amendments. The adoption of these\r\namendments by the Committee will require that half of the Members having\r\nratified the MLC are represented in the meeting and a majority of two-thirds of\r\nthe Committee members, comprising the votes of half of each of the government,\r\nshipowners and seafarers voting powers. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Possible approval of\r\namendments to the Code of the Maritime Labour Convention at the 103rd\r\nsession of the International Labour Conference on 28 May-12 June 2014 and entry\r\ninto force\nOnce adopted by the\r\nCommittee, amendments to the Code of the MLC are to be approved by the International\r\nLabour Conference with a two-thirds of the votes cast by delegates present and\r\nare submitted for consideration to the ILO members that have ratified the MLC. It\r\nis expected that the 103rd session of the International Labour\r\nConference, to be held on 28\r\nMay-12 June 2014, will be entrusted with that task.\nAmendments approved under this procedure enter\r\ninto force within a period which is normally two years, unless a substantial\r\nproportion of ratifying members[9]\r\nhave formally expressed their disagreement with these amendments.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Content of the proposed\r\namendments to the Code of the Maritime Labour Convention subject to 2014\r\nmeetings of the International Labour Organisation\nThe two sets of Proposals for amendments to the\r\nCode of the MLC subject to ILO 2014 meetings concern Standards (part A) and\r\nGuidelines (part B) of the Code of the MLC relating to Regulation 2.5 on\r\nRepatriation in title 2 on conditions of employment and to Regulation 4.2 on\r\nShipowners\u2019 liability in Title 4 on health protection, medical care, welfare\r\nand social security protection[10]. \nThe proposal under Regulation 2.5\r\n\u201cRepatriation\u201d (see Annex) deals with the abandonment of seafarers. Abandonment\r\noccurs when the shipowner fails to cover the cost of the seafarer\u2019s\r\nrepatriation or has left the seafarer without the necessary maintenance and\r\nsupport or has otherwise unilaterally severed his ties with the seafarer\r\nincluding failure to pay contractual wages for a period of at least two months.\r\nThe proposed amendments establish requirements to a rapid and effective\r\nfinancial security system to assist seafarers employed or engaged or working in\r\nany capacity on a ship flying the flag of the Member in the event of\r\nabandonment. This system shall cover outstanding wages and other entitlements\r\nup to four months, the cost of repatriation, necessary maintenance including\r\nadequate food, clothing, accommodation, necessary medical care and other\r\nreasonable costs or charges arising from the abandonment. Under the proposal, each\r\nMember shall further require that ships that fly its\r\nflag provide documentary evidence of financial security issued by the financial\r\nsecurity provider. The proposed guidelines deal with immediate assistance in\r\ncase time is needed to check the validity of certain aspects of the seafarer\u2019s\r\nrequest and with details of the evidence of financial security. \nThe proposal under 4.2 \u201cShipowners\u2019 liability\u201d\r\n(see Annex) deals with compensation in the event of death or long-term\r\ndisability due to an occupational injury, illness or hazard. It establishes\r\nminimum requirements for the financial security system providing such\r\ncompensation as regards contractual claims, defined as claims which relate to\r\nsickness, injury or death occurring while the seafarer is serving under a\r\nseafarers\u2019 employment agreement or arising from employment under such an\r\nagreement. Effective arrangements are to be in place to receive, deal with and\r\nimpartially settle contractual claims relating to compensation through rapid\r\nand fair procedures. There shall be no delay, no pressure to accept payment falling\r\nshort of the contractual amount and interim payment in cases in which the final\r\ncompensation is difficult to assess. Furthermore, there shall be no prejudice\r\nto other legal rights; however, benefits shall be offset against damages. Under\r\nthe proposal, each Member shall further require that ships that fly its flag\r\nprovide documentary evidence of financial security or that the shipowner\r\nnotifies the flagstate and the seafarers if the security is cancelled. The proposed\r\nguidelines deal with details of the evidence of financial security and contain model\r\nreceipt and release forms for the payment of contractual claims. \n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union law in the field of\r\nthe amendments to the Code of the Maritime Labour Convention subject to 2014\r\nmeetings of the International Labour Organisation\nThe proposed amendments to the Code of the MLC are\r\nto a large extent covered by competences conferred upon the Union by the\r\nTreaties. In addition, many parts of the amendments address areas of Union law in\r\nwhich the degree of regulation on the level of the EU has already reached an\r\nadvanced stage. Moreover, Council Decision 2007/431/EC of 7 June 2007\r\nauthorised Member States to ratify the MLC in the interests of the Union.\nThe proposed amendments to the MLC focus on\r\nissues dealt with in Directive 2009/13/EC implementing the Agreement concluded\r\nby the European Community Shipowners\u2019 Associations (ECSA) and the European\r\nTransport Workers\u2019 Federation (ETF) on the Maritime Labour Convention and\r\namending Directive 1999/63/EC. This Directive incorporates relevant provisions\r\nof the MLC into EU law by setting minimum requirements in the relevant fields\r\non the basis of an agreement between European social partners of the sector\r\npursuant to the provisions of the Treaty in the social policy area[11].\nWhile not dealt with as such under Directive\r\n2009/13/EC, the \u201cabandonment\u201d of seafarers falls however under its Standard A 2.5\r\nproviding that \u201cEach Member State shall ensure that the seafarers in ships that\r\nfly its flag are entitled to repatriation (...) when the seafarers are no\r\nlonger able to carry out their duties under their employment agreement or\r\ncannot be expected to carry them out in the specific circumstances\u201d. Similarly,\r\nas regards shipowners\u2019 liability, Standard A 4.2 provides that \u201cEach Member\r\nState shall adopt laws and regulations requiring that shipowners of ships that\r\nfly its flag are responsible for health protection and medical care of all\r\nseafarers working on board the ships in accordance with the following minimum\r\nstandards: (...) shipowners shall provide financial security to assure\r\ncompensation in the event of the death or long-term disability of seafarers due\r\nto an occupational injury, illness or hazard, as set out in national law, the\r\nseafarers\u2019 employment agreement or collective agreement\u201d. In both cases, the\r\namendments to the MLC would introduce specific requirements for financial\r\nsecurity systems and for the production of documentary evidence in these\r\nfields. \nIt has also to be noted that the final\r\nprovisions of the Agreement concluded by the European Community Shipowners\u2019\r\nAssociations (ECSA) and the European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ETF) on the\r\nMaritime Labour Convention, implemented by Directive 2009/13/EC, state that\r\nsubsequent to any amendments to any of the provisions of the MLC and if\r\nrequested by either one of the Parties to the Agreement, a review of the\r\napplication of this Agreement shall be carried out. \nThe enforcement of the proposed amendments to\r\nthe MLC involves the transport area[12]:\r\nthe \u201cPort State Control\u201d Directive 2009/16/EC, as amended by Directive\r\n2013/38/EU of 12 August 2013 to include the MLC among the Conventions such as\r\nSOLAS[13],\r\nMARPOL[14]\r\nand the STCW[15],\r\nas well as the \u201cFlag State\u201d Directive 2013/54/EU of 20\r\nNovember 2013 enforcing the Annex to Directive\r\n2009/13/EC. Directive 2009/16/EC applies to all ships calling at EU ports,\r\nregardless of the nationality of seafarers, and Directive 2013/54/EU aims to\r\nensure that EU Member States fulfil their responsibilities as flag States with\r\nregard to Directive 2009/13/EC as well as its Annex and applies to all\r\nseafarers on EU flagged ships. The provision of documentary evidence\r\nincluded in the proposals for amendments is in particular covered by Directive\r\n2009/16/EC as amended.\nThe proposed amendments further involve aspects of the social policy area[16], where minimum\r\nrequirements are set in particular on occupational health and safety by\r\nDirective 89/391/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements\r\nin the safety and health of workers at work.\nMoreover, the envisaged amendments concern the\r\ncoordination of social security dealt with in Regulation\r\n(EC) No 883/2004 and Implementing\r\nRegulation (EC) No 987/2009 as far as EU\r\nnationals are concerned, Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1231/2010[17] as far as third-country nationals legally resident in the EU, their\r\nfamily members and their survivors are concerned in a cross-border situation.\r\nThese regulations were adopted in the areas of free movement of workers and\r\nimmigration[18].\nThe proposed amendments may involve EU\r\nlegislation in the areas of judicial cooperation in civil matters, in\r\nparticular Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 on jurisdiction as well as the\r\nrecognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters [19].\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot applicable. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe 103rd session of the\r\nInternational Labour Conference is likely to be entrusted to approve the said\r\nproposals for amendments to the Code of the Maritime Labour Convention. In\r\naccordance with Article XV of the MLC, such amendments enter into force for all\r\nParties not formally expressing their dissent within a period of two years[20], six months after the\r\nend of that period, unless more than 40% of the Parties which, at the same\r\ntime, represent not less than 40% of the Parties' gross tonnage have expressed\r\ndisagreement with the amendments approved at the International Labour\r\nConference.\nIt follows that the envisaged amendments to\r\nthe Code of the Maritime Labour Convention will constitute an act of a body set\r\nup by an international agreement which will produce legal effects.\nOnly States are members of the ILO and can\r\nvote on the approval of the amendments to the Code of the MLC at the\r\nInternational Labour Conference, to which the Union is invited with an observer\r\nstatus.\nGiven the above, in accordance with Article\r\n218(9) TFEU, it is necessary that the Council adopts a decision to establish the\r\nposition to be adopted on the Union's behalf, authorising at the same time\r\nMember States to act jointly in the interest of the Union.\nIt is proposed to support the approval of\r\nthe envisaged amendments to the Code of the MLC.\nIndeed, based, at this stage, on the proposal\r\njointly submitted by the group of ship-owners and the group of seafarers at the\r\nCommittee, it appears that there is no contradiction between the general\r\nprinciples pursued by the proposed amendments and Union law, and there is no incompatibility between the proposed\r\namendments and the Union acquis. In particular, there is\r\nno inconsistency of approach between the proposed amendments to the Code of the\r\nMLC and the minimum requirements under the Union acquis in the social\r\narea. This means that Union measures can be more stringent than the ILO\r\nstandards and vice versa[21],\r\nas it follows from Article 19(8) of the ILO Constitution that ILO Conventions\r\nsuch as the MLC contain minimum standards. Neither is there inconsistency\r\nbetween the proposed amendments to the Code of the MLC and Union acquis concerning\r\nthe coordination of social security or the regulations under the Union acquis\r\nin the transport area.\nBased on past experience, it can be\r\nexpected that the text of the envisaged amendments to the Code of the MLC will\r\nnot change substantially between the draft agreed by the group of ship-owners\r\nand the group of seafarers and its approval by the International Labour\r\nConference. Nevertheless, in order to allow Member States to act within the\r\nbodies of the ILO jointly in the interest of the Union in an effective and\r\nefficient way, it is necessary to provide that Member States may agree to a\r\ntext of the amendments to the Code with non-essential changes as compared to\r\nthe text agreed between the group of ship-owners and the group of seafarers. \n2014/0088 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted on behalf of\r\nthe European Union at the 103rd session of the International Labour Conference\r\nconcerning amendments to the Code of the Maritime Labour Convention\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union and, in particular, Articles 153 and 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Maritime Labour\r\nConvention, 2006, of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), hereinafter \u2018the\r\nConvention\u2019, establishes minimum working and living\r\nstandards for all seafarers working on ships flying the flags of ratifying\r\ncountries. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposals for amendments\r\nto the Code of the Convention are on the agenda of the first meeting of the\r\n\u201cSpecial Tripartite Committee\u201d established under the Convention, hereinafter \u2018the\r\nCommittee\u2019, taking place on 7-11 April 2014 for consideration and, possibly,\r\nadoption. Adopted amendments are to be submitted for approval to the 103rd\r\nsession of the International Labour Conference on 28 May - 12 June 2014.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proposals for\r\namendments concern the liability of shipowners with respect to compensation for\r\nclaims due to death, personal injury and abandonment of seafarers. They were\r\njointly submitted by the group of shipowners and the group of seafarers at the\r\nCommittee in October 2013, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article XV of the Convention\r\n(hereinafter \"draft amendments\").\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rules under the Convention\r\nand the draft amendments are covered to a large extent by competences conferred\r\nupon the Union by the Treaties. In addition, the draft amendments will affect\r\nexisting acquis in the areas of social policy[22], transport and coordination\r\nof social security[23].\r\nIn particular, most of the provisions of the Convention have been the subject\r\nof Directive 2009/13/EC implementing the Agreement concluded by the European\r\nCommunity Shipowners\u2019 Associations (ECSA) and the European Transport Workers\u2019\r\nFederation (ETF) on the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, and amending\r\nDirective 1999/63/EC. The implementation of the Convention in the Union is further ensured by Directive 2009/16/EC of 23 April\r\n2009 on \u201cPort State Control\u201d, as amended by Directive 2013/38/EU of 12 August\r\n2013 and the \"Flag State Directive\" 2013/54/EU of 20 November 2013\r\nenforcing the Annex of Directive 2009/13/EC of 16 February 2009. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\nXV of the Convention, the amendments to the Code approved by the International\r\nLabour Conference will enter into force for all Parties not formally expressing\r\ntheir dissent within a period that is normally two years, six months after the\r\nend of that period, unless more than 40% of the Parties which, at the same\r\ntime, represent not less than 40% of the Parties' gross tonnage have expressed\r\ndisagreement with these amendments. It follows that the envisaged amendments to\r\nthe Code of the Maritime Labour Convention will constitute an act of a body set\r\nup by an international agreement which will produce legal effects.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the above, in\r\naccordance with Article 218(9) TFEU, it is necessary that the Council adopts a\r\ndecision to establish the position to be adopted on the Union's behalf,\r\nauthorising at the same time Member States to act jointly in the interest of\r\nthe Union, which is not a member of the ILO[24].\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that, at this stage,\r\nthe draft amendments have not yet received the agreement of all stakeholders\r\nand that certain changes may still be made to it before their approval by the International\r\nLabour Conference, it is necessary to provide that Member States, acting\r\njointly in the interest of the Union, may agree to a text of the amendments\r\nwith non-essential changes as compared to the text agreed between the group of\r\nship-owners and the group of seafarers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position of the Union at the 103rd session of the International Labour Conference shall be to support\r\nthe approval of the envisaged amendments to the Code of the Convention, such as\r\ncurrently jointly submitted by the group of shipowners and the group of\r\nseafarers at the Committee (referred to as the \"draft amendments\").\r\nThe text of the draft amendments is attached to this decision. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position of the Union as\r\nset out in paragraph 1 shall be taken by the Member States, acting jointly in\r\nthe interest of the Union when approving the amendments to the Code of the\r\nConvention at the 103rd session of the International Labour\r\nConference.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non substantial changes to\r\nthis position may be agreed to within the bodies of the ILO by the Member\r\nStates acting jointly in the interest of the Union, without further decision of\r\nthe Council.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member\r\nStates.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/maritime-labour-convention/lang--en/index.htm. \n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The MLC is organized into three main parts: the Articles,\r\ncoming first, set out the broad principles and obligations. The Articles are\r\nfollowed by the Regulations and the Code, which relate to the areas of\r\nseafarers\u2018 working and living conditions covered by the Convention and to\r\ninspection and compliance. The Regulations, which are written in very general\r\nterms, are complemented by the more detailed Code. The Code has two parts: Part\r\nA contains Standards and Part B Guidelines. Countries that ratify the MLC must\r\nadopt national laws or take other measures to ensure that the principles and\r\nrights set out in the Regulations are implemented in the manner set out by the\r\nStandards in Part A of the Code (or in a substantially equivalent manner). When\r\ndeciding on the details of their laws or other implementing measures, the\r\nratifying countries must give due consideration to following the Guidelines set\r\nout in Part B of the Code.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 International Maritime Organisation.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ILO\u2013IMO\u2013WGPS/9/2009/10, Final report, Joint\r\nIMO/ILO Ad Hoc Expert Working Group on Liability and Compensation regarding\r\nClaims for Death, Personal Injury and Abandonment of Seafarers, Ninth Session. \n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Resolution concerning the Joint IMO/ILO Ad Hoc Expert\r\nWorking Group on Liability and Compensation regarding Claims for Death,\r\nPersonal Injury and Abandonment of Seafarers, International Labour Conference, Provisional\r\nRecord No. 3-1(Rev.), 94th Session (Maritime), Geneva, 2006, p. 3-1/16.\r\nSee: http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/maritime-labour-convention/WCMS_088130/lang--en/index.htm.\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/documents/genericdocument/wcms_229695.pdf, see the Annex to the recommended Decision. \n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/documents/genericdocument/wcms_229694.pdf. \n[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The invitation to attend the Committee included a\r\nreference to the webpage http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/maritime-labour-convention/WCMS_228789/lang--en/index.htm\r\nwhich was updated in November 2013.\n[9]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 40% of the Members having\r\nratified the MLC and which represent 40% of the gross tonnage of the ships of\r\nthe Members having ratified the MLC.\n[10]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/documents/genericdocument/wcms_229695.pdf.\r\n\n[11]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Art.153 and 155 TFEU.\n[12]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Art.100 TFEU.\n[13]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea.\n[14]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 International Convention for the Prevention of\r\nPollution from Ships.\n[15]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 International Convention on Standards of Training,\r\nCertification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers.\n[16]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Art.153 and 155 TFEU.\n[17]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Or Regulation\r\n(EC) No 859/2003 in the cases of Denmark or the United Kingdom.\n[18]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 48 TFEU, 79.2b TFEU. \n[19]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 67(4) and points (a),\r\n(c) and (e) of Article 81(2) TFEU.\n[20]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Or another period set by the Conference, after they\r\nhave been notified by the ILO DG to Members having ratified the Convention \n[21]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Opinion 2/91 of the ECJ, para. 18.\n[22]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Including the health and safety framework Directive\r\n89/391/EEC.\n[23]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Including Regulation\r\n(EC) No 883/2004 and Implementing\r\nRegulation (EC) No 987/2009 for EU\r\nnationals, Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1231/2010 or Regulation\r\n(EC) No 859/2003 for third-country nationals\r\nlegally resident in the EU and in a cross-border situation and their family\r\nmembers and survivors.\n[24]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Opinion 2/91 of the European Court of Justice of 19\r\nMarch 1993, ECR 1993-I, page 1061, para. 26.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
