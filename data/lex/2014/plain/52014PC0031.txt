It also contributes to greater credibility of the schemes in\r\nMember States and improvement of the EU image and awareness. An EU framework\r\nhas an added value in facilitating continuous knowledge, transparency,\r\nexperience transfer and exchange.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThere are currently two EU-funded school distribution programmes\r\nunder the remit of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that specifically\r\ntarget children in school settings, namely the School Milk Scheme (SMS) and the\r\nSchool Fruit Scheme (SFS). Both schemes share a mutual aim to increase, on a\r\nlasting basis, the share of these products in children's diets at an early\r\nstage when their eating habits are being formed, thus contributing to the CAP\r\nobjectives, in particular stabilising markets and ensuring the demand in the\r\nlong run. Additionally, the schemes are in line with the wider public health\r\nobjectives as they contribute in shaping the sustainable healthy eating habits.\r\n\nHowever, despite this positive embedding in schools and recognition\r\nof their potential, conclusions drawn from different reports - in particular\r\nthe external evaluations of the SFS and the SMS, initiated by the Commission,\r\nand the special report No 10/2011 of the European Court of Auditors - and\r\nexperience after years of implementation, have identified the need to make\r\nfurther improvements to both schemes to increase their management efficiency\r\nand effectiveness. The recent agreement on the reform of the CAP already\r\naddressed also some of the problems identified.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nTaking into due account sectorial specificities the proposal is\r\ncompatible with the promotion of agricultural products.

Furthermore, the accompanying\r\nmeasures will be also monitored as concerns the methods used and their cost,\r\nfrequency, participating school/children, involvement of stakeholders, products\r\ndistributed.\nThe evaluation process will consist of MS evaluation reports after 5\r\nyears of implementation of the scheme to measure medium-term impacts, followed\r\nby an external EU wide evaluation one year after the MS evaluations, to assess\r\nthe implementation of the scheme at MS and EU level and assess overall\r\neffectiveness, efficiency, coherence and relevance in accordance with Commission\r\nevaluation standards and guidelines. Moreover, an external study on long-term\r\nimpact indicators could be envisaged.\nThe external evaluations of the SFS and SMS and the Court of\r\nAuditors Special report No 10/2011 on these schemes have been clearly taken into\r\ndue consideration for the design of the monitoring and evaluation processes\r\nrelating to the new scheme. \n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\r\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThe general risk that can be identified relates to the effectiveness\r\nof the scheme, i.e. that the EU aid reaches the final beneficiaries of the\r\nscheme and effectively contribute towards reaching the scheme's objectives.\nBased on the current experience from the SFS, particular attention\r\nshould be given to the selection of aid applicants and to procurement\r\nprocedures used for awarding contracts for distribution, publicity, monitoring\r\nand evaluation. Control provisions shall also cover the implementation of the\r\nsaid contracts. Public procurement is a potential issue for the School Scheme.\nFor other risks, as the possible deadweight effect and excessive\r\ncost of products distributed or margin for suppliers, provisions can be\r\nforeseen (e.g. on the level of EU-aid per portion).\nAs concerns the accompanying measures, there could be a risk of\r\noverlapping with educational measures provided in schools and with promotion of\r\nagricultural products. To avoid this, the definition of these measures will\r\ninvolve an EU scientific expert group and their link with the objectives of the\r\nnew scheme will be clearly stated. Control provisions related to accompanying\r\nmeasures shall address the genuineness of expenditure in general, providing\r\nassurance also where those measures are outsourced.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information concerning the\r\ninternal control system set up\nPaying agencies and delegated control bodies at Member State level form the control system.\nMS annual reports on controls and checks, based on those already in\r\nuse for the current SFS and SMS, will be necessary, to provide details on the\r\nadministrative management and on-the-spot checks implemented. \nMoreover, the internal management and control system will make use\r\nof the monitoring and evaluation reports from Member States and of the EU-wide\r\nevaluation. Finally, an EU scientific expert group will provide MS and the Commission\r\nwith advice on implementation, monitoring and evaluation. \n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimate of the costs and\r\nbenefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \nThe school scheme will be covered by the existing system of\r\nmanagement and control for EAGF expenditure.\nIt is considered that the proposal will not lead to an increase in\r\nthe error rate for the EAGF.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\r\nand irregularities \nThe Horizontal Regulation on the financing, management, and\r\nmonitoring of the CAP will apply.\nIn general, control systems provide for exhaustive administrative\r\ncontrols of 100% of aid requests, cross-checks with other databases where this\r\nis considered appropriate, as well as on-the-spot checks before payment for a\r\nminimum number of transactions, depending on the risk associated to the regime\r\nin question. If these checks reveal a high number of irregularities, additional\r\nchecks must be carried out.\nThe legislative package to reform the CAP further provides that\r\nMember States shall prevent, detect and correct irregularities and fraud,\r\nimpose effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties, in accordance with\r\nUnion legislation or national law and recover any irregular payments plus\r\ninterests. It includes an automatic clearance mechanism for irregularity cases,\r\nwhich provides that where the recovery has not taken place within four years\r\nfrom the date of the recovery request, or within eight years if legal\r\nproceedings are initiated, the amounts not recovered shall be borne by the Member State concerned. This mechanism strongly encourages Member States to recover\r\nirregular payments as quickly as possible. \nAt the initial stage of the new scheme and although a formal EU\r\napproval is not foreseen for the MS strategies, provisions on their content\r\n(and possibly a template) will allow for possible early fraud risk\r\nidentification and prevention.\nDuring the implementation, requests for legal interpretation or\r\nadvice from the Commission and/or the EU scientific expert group will also help\r\nMS to avoid fraud. \nIn addition, ex post checks and a robust follow-up of any\r\nallegations of fraudulent abuse of the scheme will be performed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL\r\nIMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      Existing budget lines \nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n   || Diff./non-diff.
