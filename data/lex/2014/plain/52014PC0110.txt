Article 2(2) of the Convention provides that, for the\npurposes of the Convention, \u2018third party\u2019 means any neighbouring country or\nterritory which is not a Contracting Party.\nThe Republic of Moldova submitted its\nwritten request for accession to the Convention to the depositary of the\nConvention (the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU) on 17 July 2013.\nIn its request, the Republic of Moldova indicated that it is a member of the Central European Free Trade Agreement between Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Republic of Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo[2]. As a consequence, the Republic of Moldova has a free trade\nagreement in force with six Contracting Parties to the Convention and complies\nwith the condition set out in Article 5(1) of the Convention to become a\nContracting Party. In its request, the Republic of Moldova also indicated that joining the PEM Convention was a\ncommitment made in the framework of negotiations of the deep and comprehensive\nfree trade agreement (DCFTA) with the EU[3]\nand that it had recently concluded negotiations of a free trade agreement with Turkey.\nThe request should therefore be submitted to\nthe Joint Committee of the Convention in application of its Article 4(3)(b) for\nadoption of a Decision inviting the Republic of Moldova to accede to the\nConvention. The position to be taken by the EU within the Joint Committee\nshould be established by the Council.\nAccording to the Commission, the accession of the Republic of Moldova does not require any\ntransitional measures as referred to in Article 4(3)(c) of the Convention.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Contracting Parties to the Convention\nwere informed of the request at the meeting of the Joint Committee of the\nConvention of 29 October 2013.\nNo recourse to external expertise has been\nnecessary. Furthermore, it has not been necessary to conduct an impact\nassessment, since the accession of a third party to the Convention is only\nsubject to the condition that it has a free trade agreement in force with at\nleast one of the Contracting Parties to the Convention.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the Council Decision is\nthe first subparagraph of Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article\n218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the Union.
