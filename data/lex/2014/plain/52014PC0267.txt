The Convention on the conservation of\r\nmigratory species of wild animals (also known as the CMS or Bonn Convention)\r\naims to conserve terrestrial, marine and avian migratory species throughout\r\ntheir range. It is an intergovernmental treaty, concluded under the aegis of\r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme, concerned with the conservation of\r\nwildlife and habitats on a global scale. The European Union has been a Party to\r\nthe CMS since 1 November 1983[1].\n2. The migratory species to be conserved\r\nare listed in Appendices I (endangered species) and II (species to be the\r\nsubjects of agreements) to the Convention.\n3. The Conference of the Parties is the\r\ndecision-making body of the Convention with powers to assess the conservation\r\nstatus of migratory species and, subsequently, to amend Appendices I and II to\r\nthe Convention.\n4. In accordance with Article XI of the\r\nConvention, proposals for amendment may be made by any Party. An amendment to\r\nthe Appendices enters into force for all Parties ninety days after the meeting\r\nof the Conference of the Parties at which it is adopted, except for those\r\nParties which make a reservation.\n5. The eleventh meeting of the Conference\r\nof the Parties to the Convention will take place in Quito (Ecuador) from 4 to 9 November 2014. For this meeting, it is proposed that the Union makes a\r\nproposal to amend Appendix I to the Convention to increase the protection of a\r\nspecies of whales, namely the Mediterranean\r\nsubpopulation of Ziphius cavirostris, and the bird species Coracias\r\ngarrulus, throughout their distribution range, including outside the Union,\r\non the basis of the following considerations: (1) the inclusion of such species\r\nis scientifically sound; (2) such an inclusion is consistent with the EU\r\nlegislation; and (3) the Union is committed to international cooperation for\r\nthe protection of biodiversity. This proposal would not require any change in\r\nUnion law, as it concerns a species which already benefits from appropriate\r\nprotection under Union law, notably the Birds[2]\r\nand Habitats Directives. [3]\n6. For this meeting, it is furthermore\r\nproposed that the Union makes a proposal to amend Appendix II to the Convention\r\nto increase the protection of three species of thresher sharks, namely Alopias\r\nsuperciliosus, Alopias vulpinus and Alopias pelagicus, throughout\r\ntheir distribution range, including outside the Union, on the basis of the\r\nfollowing considerations: (1) the inclusion of such species is scientifically\r\nsound; (2) such an inclusion is consistent with the EU legislation and (3) the\r\nUnion is committed to international cooperation for the protection of\r\nbiodiversity. Without requiring any change in Union law, the proposal would provide\r\nadditional support for introducing collaborative management of these species\r\nthrough the CMS itself and through possible inclusion of the species in the CMS\r\nglobal Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the conservation of migratory\r\nsharks, to which the Union is a Party. It would also complement and encourage\r\nimproved fisheries management efforts within the Regional Fisheries Management\r\nOrganisations.\n7. It is therefore necessary for the\r\nCouncil to take a decision for the purpose of establishing the position to be\r\nadopted on behalf of the Union with a view to the eleventh meeting of the Conference\r\nof the Parties with regard to proposals for amendment.\n8. The deadline for submitting proposals\r\nfor amendment has been fixed by the Secretariat of the Convention, in line with\r\nArticle XI (3), to be 6 June 2014.\n9. Before the eleventh meeting of the Conference\r\nof the Parties, the Secretariat of the Convention may communicate proposals\r\nmade by other Parties to amend Appendices I and II to the Convention, which may\r\nalso require a decision establishing the position to be adopted on behalf of\r\nthe Union with regard to those proposals.\n2014/0139 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be adopted on\r\nbehalf of the European Union with regard to proposals for amendment of the\r\nAppendices of the Convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild\r\nanimals with a view to the eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1), in conjunction with Article 218(9),\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a Party to the\r\nConvention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals (\"the\r\nConvention\") as approved by Council Decision 82/461/EEC[4], the Union may propose\r\namendments of the Appendices to the Convention which list the species to be\r\nconserved.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conference of the\r\nParties is the decision-making body of the Convention and the powers conferred\r\nupon it include the capacity to assess the conservation status of migratory\r\nspecies and subsequently amend Appendices I and II to the Convention.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It appears that the\r\ninclusion of the species Coracias garrulus and the Mediterranean\r\nsubpopulation of the species Ziphius cavirostris in Appendix I would be scientifically sound, in line with the Union\r\nlegislation and with the Union's commitment to international cooperation for\r\nthe protection of biodiversity.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It appears that the\r\ninclusion of the species Alopias superciliosus,\r\nAlopias vulpinus and Alopias pelagicus in Appendix II would be scientifically sound, in line with the\r\nUnion legislation and with the Union's commitment to international cooperation\r\nfor the protection of biodiversity.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to the eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties which will take\r\nplace in Quito (Ecuador) from 4 to 9 November 2014, the\r\nUnion should propose an amendment to Appendix I to include the species Coracias\r\ngarrulus and the Mediterranean subpopulation of the species Ziphius cavirostris and an amendment to\r\nAppendix II to include the species Alopias superciliosus, Alopias vulpinus and\r\nAlopias pelagicus.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those proposals should be\r\ncommunicated to the Secretariat of the Convention,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nSole Article\nWith a view to the eleventh meeting of the\r\nConference of the Parties to the Convention on the conservation of migratory\r\nspecies of wild animals, the Commission is hereby authorised to submit, on\r\nbehalf of the Union, a proposal for an amendment to Appendix I to the\r\nConvention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals to include the\r\nspecies Coracias garrulus and the Mediterranean subpopulation of the species\r\nZiphius cavirostris and a\r\nproposal for an amendment to Appendix II to the Convention to include the\r\nspecies Alopias superciliosus, Alopias vulpinus and\r\nAlopias pelagicus. \nThe Commission shall communicate those\r\nproposals to the Secretariat of the Convention.\nDone at
