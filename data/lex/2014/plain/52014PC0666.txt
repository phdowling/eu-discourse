The French\r\noutermost regions, however, are excluded from the territorial scope of the VAT\r\nand excise duty directives.\nThe TFEU, in particular Article 110,\r\ndoes not in principle authorise any difference in the French outermost regions\r\nbetween the taxation of local products and the taxation of products from\r\nmetropolitan France, the other Member States or non-member countries. Article\r\n349 of the TFEU (former Article 229(2) of the EC Treaty), however, provides for\r\nthe possibility of introducing specific measures for those regions because of\r\nthe permanent handicaps which affect the economic and social conditions of the\r\noutermost regions. Such measures concern various policies, including taxation.\nThe 'dock dues' tax is an indirect tax\r\napplied to deliveries and exports of goods in the French outermost regions. In\r\nprinciple, it is applied in the same way to products produced locally and those\r\nthat are not (products of metropolitan France, other Member States or non-member countries).\nHowever, Council Decision 2004/162/EC\r\nof 10 February 2004 (as amended by\r\nCouncil Decisions 2008/439/EC of 9 June 2008 and 448/2011/EU\r\nof 19 July 2011), adopted on the basis of Article 299(2) of the\r\nEC Treaty, authorised France, until 1 July 2014, to apply exemptions\r\nor reductions to the dock dues tax for certain products produced in the French\r\noutermost regions (excluding Saint Martin). The Annex to that Decision contains\r\nthe list of products to which tax exemptions and reductions may be applied. The\r\ndifference between the taxation of locally manufactured products and the\r\ntaxation of other products may not exceed 10, 20 or 30 percentage points,\r\ndepending on the product.\nThe purpose of these tax differentials is\r\nto offset the handicaps affecting the outermost regions, which increase\r\nproduction costs and therefore the cost price of products produced locally.\r\nWithout specific measures, local products would be less competitive than those\r\nproduced elsewhere, even taking into account the cost of transporting such\r\ngoods. This would make it harder to maintain local production with higher\r\nproduction costs.\nCouncil Decision 2014/162/EU of 11 March\r\n2014 extended the application of Council Decision 2004/162/EC to Mayotte from\r\n1 January 2014, the date on which Mayotte became an outermost region, and\r\nlisted the products to which differentiated dock dues may be applied\u00a0 and the\r\napplicable limits.\nLastly, to enable the Commission to\r\nfinalise examination of the French request, Council Decision 378/2014/EU\r\nof 12 June 2014 extended the period of application of Council Decision\r\n2004/162/EC by 6 months until 31 December 2014 instead of 1 July\r\n2014.\nThe purpose of this proposal is to\r\nestablish the legal framework for the dock dues from 1 January 2015 to\r\n31 December 2020. It extends Decision 2004/162/EC by a further six months\r\nto give France time to transpose the provisions of the new Council Decision\r\ninto its national law, and establishes the new legal framework applicable\r\nbetween 1 July 2015 and 31 December 2020.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nCouncil Decision 2004/162/EC of\r\n10 February 2004 (as amended by Council Decisions 2008/439/EC\r\nof 9 June 2008, 448/2011/EU of 19 July 2011, 2014/162/EU of\r\n11 March 2014 and 378/2014/EU of 12 June 2014), authorises France,\r\nuntil 31 December 2014, to apply exemptions or reductions to the\r\n\u2018dock dues\u2019 tax for certain products produced in the French outermost regions\r\n(excluding Saint Martin). The Annex to the Decision contains a list of the\r\nproducts to which tax exemptions and reductions may be applied. The difference\r\nbetween the taxation of locally manufactured products and the taxation of other\r\nproducts may not exceed 10, 20 or 30 percentage points, depending on the\r\nproduct.\nDecision 2004/162/EC sets out the\r\nreasons for adopting specific measures: remoteness, raw\u2011material and\r\nenergy dependence, the obligation to build up larger stocks, the small size of\r\nthe local market combined with a low level of export activity, etc. The\r\ncombination of these handicaps increases production costs and therefore the\r\ncost price of goods produced locally, so that without specific measures they\r\nwould be less competitive than those produced elsewhere, even taking into\r\naccount the cost of transporting such goods to the French overseas departments.\r\nThis would make it harder to maintain local production. The specific measures\r\ncontained in Decision 2004/162/EC were thus designed to strengthen local industry\r\nby making it more competitive.\nThe French authorities believe that the\r\nhandicaps suffered by the French outermost regions persist and between\r\n25 January and 7 June 2013 they sent several letters to the European\r\nCommission requesting that a system of differentiated taxation similar to the\r\ncurrent system be maintained after 1 July 2014 until 31 December\r\n2020. The French authorities point out that these handicaps are permanent, that\r\nthe taxation arrangements established by Council Decision 2004/162/EC has\r\nmade it possible to maintain and in some cases develop local production, and\r\nthat these arrangements have not constituted an advantage for the beneficiary\r\ncompanies since, overall, imports of products subject to differentiated\r\ntaxation have continued to increase.\nAnalysing the lists of the products to\r\nwhich the French authorities wish to apply differentiated taxation is a lengthy\r\nprocess requiring verification, for each product, of the reasons for\r\ndifferentiated taxation and the proportionality of the tax, so as to ensure\r\nthat such differentiated taxation does not undermine the integrity and the\r\ncoherence of the Union legal order, including the internal market and common\r\npolicies.\nThis work has not been completed because of\r\nthe large number of products involved (several hundred) and the quantity\r\nof information to be collected on the structure of the relevant product\r\nmarkets: existence of local production, existence of substantial 'imports'\r\n(including those from metropolitan France and other Member States) that might\r\njeopardise the continuation of local production, the absence of any monopoly or\r\nquasi-monopoly in local production, justification of the higher production\r\ncosts that handicap local products as compared with \u2018imported\u2019 products, and\r\nchecks to ensure that a differentiated tax would not be incompatible with other\r\npolicies of the Union.\nThus, the absence of local production\r\nsubject to dock dues makes inclusion in the list of products that may be\r\nsubject to differentiated taxation unnecessary. As regards the definition of\r\nproducts that are produced locally, in general the combined customs\r\nnomenclature headings adopted are as precise as possible. However, in some\r\ncases, for the products in the current lists of products to which\r\ndifferentiated taxation may be applied, four-digit customs nomenclature\r\nheadings have been adopted where it was not possible to obtain more precise\r\nheadings of more than four digits. In this case, the four-digit customs\r\nheadings adopted may marginally cover products for which there is no local\r\nproduction.\nConcerning the evaluation of the higher\r\nproduction costs that the differential taxation is designed to offset, the\r\nFrench authorities have supplied, for each product or each group of products in\r\ncases where several products have similar production costs, an evaluation of\r\nthe higher production costs borne by local enterprises. These comprise supply\r\ncosts, salaries, higher energy cost, financial cost resulting from larger\r\nstocks, higher maintenance costs, under-utilisation of production equipment,\r\nand higher financial costs, depending on the case in question. The checks made\r\nfound that the additional costs calculated were not lower than the taxation\r\ndifferential requested by the French authorities.\nThe proposal for a Council Decision\r\nprovides, like Council Decision 2004/162/EC, for authorising France, until 31 December 2020, to apply exemptions or reductions to the dock dues for\r\ncertain products produced in the French outermost regions (excluding Saint Martin). The Annex to the Decision contains a list of the products to which tax\r\nexemptions and reductions may be applied. The difference between the taxation\r\nof locally manufactured products and the taxation of other products may not\r\nexceed 10, 20 or 30 percentage points, depending on the product. Part A of\r\nthe Annex lists the products for which the difference in taxation may not\r\nexceed 10 percentage points, Part B those for which it may not exceed 20\r\npercentage points and Part C those for which it may not exceed 30 percentage\r\npoints.\nMost of the products listed in the Annex\r\nare the same as those in the Annex to Council Decision 2004/162/EC.\r\nHowever, following a full review of the lists, a number of products for which\r\nthere was no local production or no longer any local production were withdrawn.\r\nConversely, products that were not listed in Decision 2004/162/EC but for which\r\nnew production has started up, or for which production has been developed, were\r\nadded to the lists of products. Lastly, certain products have been kept on the\r\nlists but the authorised taxation differential for these products has been\r\nincreased (e.g. moved from Part A to Part B of the Annex) or decreased (e.g.\r\nmoved from Part C to Part B) to take account of modifications in the additional\r\ncosts. Under the current arrangements, small local producers with an annual\r\nturnover of less than EUR 550 000 may be exempted from payment of\r\ndock dues. France has stated that it wishes to lower this exemption\r\nthreshold to EUR 300 000. However, to accompany this lowering of the\r\nthreshold of the dock dues tax, France also wished to simplify the exemption\r\nconditions for enterprises with an annual turnover of less than\r\nEUR 300 000. Under the proposed arrangements, operators whose annual\r\nturnover is under that threshold would not be subject to dock dues. However,\r\nthey would not be able to deduct the amount of this tax borne upstream. This\r\nsystem is therefore similar to the special VAT system for small enterprises\r\nlaid down in Articles 282 et seq. of VAT Directive 2006/112/EC of\r\n28 November 2006. Such a system therefore appears to be acceptable. In the\r\ncase in point, France would apply the tax exemptions or reductions referred to\r\nin Article 1 of the proposal to all operators with an annual turnover of at\r\nleast EUR 300 000.\nCoherence with the rules of agricultural\r\npolicy has meant ruling out the application of a tax differential for all the\r\nfood products which benefit from aid under Chapter III of Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 March\r\n2013 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of\r\nthe Union, and in particular the specific supply arrangements. This measure\r\nprevents the effect of the financial aid to agriculture granted under the specific\r\nsupply arrangements from being cancelled out or reduced by higher taxation of\r\nthe subsidised products by means of the dock dues. To this end, the French\r\nauthorities have agreed to the withdrawal of all the products for which\r\napplication of the specific supply arrangements will be requested for 2015 from\r\nthe lists of products that may be subject to differentiated taxation.\nThe objectives of supporting the social and\r\neconomic development of the French overseas departments, already provided for\r\nin Decision 2004/162/EEC, are confirmed by the requirements regarding the\r\npurpose of the tax. It is a legal obligation that the revenues from this tax\r\nare to be incorporated into the resources of the French overseas departments'\r\neconomic and tax regime and allocated to an economic and social development\r\nstrategy involving aid for promoting local activities.\nThe proposal envisages extending the period\r\nof application of Decision 2004/162/EC for a further six months to 30 June\r\n2015. This measure will give France the necessary time to transpose the\r\nprovisions of the new Council Decision into its national law.\nThe new arrangement will apply for five\r\nyears and six months. It will nevertheless be necessary to evaluate its\r\nresults. The French authorities must therefore present a report to the\r\nCommission by 31 December 2017 on the application of the tax arrangements\r\nintroduced, in order to assess the impact of the measures taken and their\r\ncontribution to promoting or maintaining local economic activities, in the light\r\nof the handicaps affecting the outermost regions, and ascertain whether the tax\r\nbenefits granted by France to products produced locally are still necessary and\r\nproportional. On the basis of this report, the Commission will submit a report\r\nto the Council and, if necessary, a proposal for adapting the provisions of\r\nthis Decision in the light of any findings made.\nTo avoid any kind of legal vacuum, this\r\ndecision will apply from 1 July 2015.\nThe Council Decision is without prejudice\r\nto the possible application of Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU,\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of\r\nthe proposed measures\nTo authorise\r\nFrance to apply exemptions or reductions to the \u2018dock dues\u2019 tax for\r\ncertain products produced locally in the French outermost regions of\r\nGuadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte and R\u00e9union.\nLegal basis \nArticle 349\r\nTFEU.\nPrinciple of\r\nsubsidiarity\nOnly the\r\nCouncil is authorised, on the basis of Article 349 TFEU, to adopt specific\r\nmeasures in favour of the outermost regions to adjust the application of the\r\nTreaties to those regions, including the common policies, because of the\r\npermanent handicaps which affect the economic and social conditions of these\r\noutermost regions.\nThe proposal\r\ntherefore complies with the principle of subsidiarity. \nPrinciple of\r\nproportionality\nThe proposal\r\ncomplies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons.\nIt concerns\r\nonly products for which evidence of the additional costs affecting locally\r\nproduced products has been provided.\nSimilarly, the\r\nmaximum differential proposed for each product covered by this proposal is\r\nlimited to what is necessary in view of the additional costs affecting the\r\nlocal production concerned in each case. Thus, the tax burden on products\r\nimported into the French outermost regions does not exceed what is necessary to\r\noffset the lower competitiveness of products produced locally.\nChoice of\r\ninstrument\nProposed\r\ninstrument: Council decision.\nOther\r\ninstruments would not have been appropriate for the following reason:\nthe derogations granted under\r\nArticle 349 TFEU take the form of Council decisions. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPACT\nThe proposal has no impact on the budget of\r\nthe Union.\n2014/0308 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nconcerning the dock dues in the French\r\noutermost regions\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 349 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[1],\nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In principle, the\r\nprovisions of the Treaty, which apply to the outermost regions of the Union, of\r\nwhich the French overseas departments (DOM) form part, do not authorise any\r\ndifference in taxation between local products and those from metropolitan\r\nFrance or the other Member States. However, Article 349 of the treaty envisages\r\nthe possibility of introducing special measures for those regions because of\r\nthe existence of permanent handicaps affecting the economic and social\r\nsituation of the outermost regions.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific measures should\r\ntherefore be adopted in order to establish the conditions for applying the Treaty\r\nto those regions. These measures must take account of the special\r\ncharacteristics and constraints of these regions, without undermining the\r\nintegrity and coherence of the Union's legal order, including the internal\r\nmarket and common policies. The handicaps suffered by the Union's outermost\r\nregions are referred to in Article 349 of the Treaty: remoteness, raw-material\r\nand energy dependence, the obligation to build up larger stocks, the small size\r\nof the local market combined with a low level of export activity, etc. The\r\ncombination of these handicaps increases production costs and therefore the\r\ncost price of goods produced locally, so that without specific measures they\r\nwould be less competitive than those produced elsewhere, even taking into\r\naccount the cost of transporting such goods to the French overseas departments.\r\nThis would make it harder to maintain local production. For this reason,\r\nspecific measures need to be taken in order to strengthen local industry by\r\nmaking it more competitive. Until 31 December 2014, Council Decision\r\n2004/162/EC authorises France, in order to restore the competitiveness of\r\nproducts produced locally, to apply exemptions or reductions to the dock dues\r\nfor certain products produced in the outermost regions of Guadeloupe, French\r\nGuiana, Martinique, R\u00e9union and, from 1 January 2014, Mayotte. The Annex\r\nto the Decision contains the list of products to which the tax exemptions or\r\nreductions may be applied. The difference between the taxation of products\r\nproduced locally and that of other products may not exceed 10, 20 or 30\r\npercentage points, depending on the product. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 France has requested that\r\na system similar to that contained in Decision 2004/162/EC be maintained until\r\n1 January 2015. France points out that the handicaps listed above are\r\npermanent, that the taxation arrangements established by Decision 2004/162/EC\r\nhas made it possible to maintain and in some cases develop local production,\r\nand that these arrangements have not constituted an advantage for the\r\nbeneficiary companies since, overall, imports of products subject to\r\ndifferentiated taxation have continued to increase.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this connection, for\r\neach of the outermost regions concerned (Guadeloupe, French Guiana,\r\nMartinique, Mayotte and R\u00e9union), France has sent the Commission five series of\r\nlists of products for which they propose applying differentiated taxation of\r\n10, 20 or 30 percentage points, depending on whether or not the products are\r\nproduced locally. The French outermost region of Saint Martin is not affected.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Decision implements\r\nthe provisions of Article 349 of the Treaty and authorises France to apply\r\ndifferentiated taxation to the products for which it has been proven: firstly,\r\nthat local production exists; secondly, that significant importation of goods\r\n(including from metropolitan France and other Member States) exists which could\r\njeopardise the continuation of local production; and thirdly, that additional\r\ncosts exist which increase the cost price of local production in comparison\r\nwith products produced elsewhere, compromising the competitiveness of products\r\nproduced locally. The authorised tax differential should not exceed the proven\r\nadditional costs. Applying these principles will allow the provisions of\r\nArticle 349 of the Treaty to be implemented without going beyond what is\r\nnecessary and without creating an unjustified advantage for local production so\r\nas not to undermine the integrity and the coherence of the Union's legal order,\r\nincluding safeguarding undistorted competition in the internal market and State\r\naid policies.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to simplify the\r\nobligations of small enterprises, tax exemptions or reductions will affect all\r\noperators with an annual turnover of at least EUR 300 000. Operators\r\nwhose annual turnover is under that threshold are not subject to dock dues;\r\nhowever, to balance this, they cannot deduct the amount of this tax borne\r\nupstream.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly, coherence with\r\nCommunity law means ruling out the application of a tax differential for food\r\nproducts benefiting from aid under Chapter III of Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[2]. This provision\r\nprevents the effect of the financial aid to agriculture granted under the\r\nspecific supply arrangements from being cancelled out or reduced by higher\r\ntaxation of subsidised products by means of dock dues.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objectives of\r\nsupporting the social and economic development of the French overseas\r\ndepartments, already provided for in Decision 2004/162/EC, are confirmed by the\r\nrequirements regarding the purpose of the tax. It is a legal obligation that\r\nthe revenues from this tax are to be incorporated into the resources of the\r\nFrench overseas departments' economic and tax regime and allocated to an\r\neconomic and social development strategy involving aid for promoting local\r\nactivities.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to extend\r\nthe period of application of Decision 2004/162/EC\u00a0 by a further six months to\r\n30 June 2015. This period will enable France to transpose this Decision\r\ninto its national law.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The arrangements are to apply\r\nfor five years and six months, until 31 December 2020, when the current\r\nguidelines on regional State aid will also cease to apply. However, the results\r\nof applying these arrangements will first have to be assessed. France will therefore present, by 31 December 2017, a report on the application of the\r\ntaxation arrangements introduced, in order to check the impact of the measures\r\ntaken and their contribution to the maintenance, promotion and development of\r\nlocal economic activities, in the light of the handicaps affecting the\r\noutermost regions. The report will check that the tax benefits granted by France to products produced locally do not go beyond what is strictly necessary and that\r\nthese benefits are still necessary and proportional.
