The reason\r\nfor this imbalance is primarily a mismatch between the auction supply of\r\nemission allowances, which is fixed in a very rigid manner, and demand for\r\nthem, which is flexible and impacted by economic cycles, fossil fuel prices as\r\nwell as other drivers. Weakened demand usually goes together with decreasing\r\nsupply. However, in the EU carbon market this is not the case for auction\r\nsupply in the current regulatory regime.\nThe EU ETS was set up to deliver EU\r\nemissions reduction goals in a harmonised and cost-effective manner. While the\r\nenvironmental objective is guaranteed by the cap, the presence\r\nof a large surplus reduces the incentives for low-carbon investment and thereby\r\nnegatively affects the cost-efficiency of the system. Where economic actors take\r\ninvestment decisions against the background of an oversupply of allowances in\r\nthe market and the corresponding price signal, overall costs relevant for the\r\nclimate change challenge are bound to increase when considered over the mid-\r\nand long-term. In short, if not addressed, these imbalances will profoundly\r\naffect the ability of the EU ETS to meet the ETS target in future phases in a\r\ncost-effective manner, when significantly more demanding domestic emission\r\nobjectives than today would have to be reached[1].\nIt is expected that the 2030 greenhouse gas\r\ntarget decided as part of the climate and energy policy framework will result\r\nin a more ambitious linear reduction factor applied as of the start of phase 4\r\nin 2021. This would relieve the market imbalance over time and in a gradual\r\nmanner. However, the impact assessment accompanying the 2030 framework\r\nillustrates that a more ambitious linear factor is insufficient to address the\r\nnegative implications of the severe market imbalance. At the same time it would\r\nalso leave the EU ETS unprotected against future unexpected and sudden demand\r\nshocks.\nFor these reasons, the provisions of the Directive\r\nshould be derogated from to establish a market stability reserve.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 context of the proposal\nAs a short term measure to mitigate the\r\neffects of the surplus it was decided to postpone (\u201cback-load\u201d) the auctioning\r\nof 900 million allowances in the early years of phase 3. In this context the\r\nCommission also reaffirmed its commitment to present options for action with a\r\nview to adopting further appropriate structural measures to strengthen the ETS\r\nduring phase 3[2].\nConsidering that the surplus is of a\r\nstructural, long-lasting nature further action to strengthen the EU ETS is\r\nnecessary to ensure a cost-efficient transition to a low-carbon economy. The\r\nCommission set out a non-exhaustive list of six options for structural reform\r\nof the EU ETS in its Report on the State of the European Carbon Market in 2012\r\n(Carbon Market Report)[3]\r\nin November 2012. During the public consultation that followed this report, the\r\nestablishment of a market stability reserve that could render the auction\r\nsupply of emission allowances more flexible and increase shock resilience emerged\r\nfrom the discussion as an additional option. \nAn impact assessment report and an\r\nexecutive summary are published together with the present proposal. The impact\r\nassessment has shown that the establishment of a market stability reserve could\r\nhelp address the current imbalances and also would make the ETS more resilient\r\nto any potential future large-scale event that may severely disturb the\r\nsupply-demand balance. With regard to the different design elements, it has\r\nshown that operating the market stability reserve in relation to the total\r\nnumber of allowances in circulation has the advantage to capture changes in\r\ndemand not only due to macroeconomic changes, but also impacts of other factors\r\nsuch as complementary policies, as well as changes on the supply side like the\r\ninflow of international credits.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal aspects of the\r\nproposal \nTo ensure predictability, the market\r\nstability reserve is designed as an objective and rule-based mechanism on the\r\nbasis of which the auction volumes are adjusted in an \"automatic\r\nmanner\" under pre-defined conditions applied as of phase 4 of the EU ETS\r\nstarting in 2021. While the impact assessment has shown that establishing a\r\nmarket stability reserve already in phase 3 would deliver benefits for the\r\nstrengthening and the efficiency of the carbon market, back-loading is expected\r\nto provide some temporary relief in the coming years. It is therefore proposed\r\nto establish the market stability reserve at the start of phase 4 so as to\r\nprovide market participants with lead-time to adapt to the introduction of the\r\nreserve and sufficient regulatory certainty during phase 3 of the EU ETS.\nThe market stability reserve set out in\r\nthis proposal functions by triggering adjustments to annual auction volumes in\r\nsituations where the total number of allowances in circulation is outside a\r\ncertain predefined range:\n(a)                   \r\nAdding allowances to the reserve by deducting\r\nthem from future auction volumes with the aim of mitigating market instability\r\ndue to a large temporary surplus in the EU ETS if the total surplus is higher\r\nthan 833 million allowances;\n(b)                   \r\nReleasing allowances from the reserve and adding\r\nthem to future auction volumes with the aim of mitigating market instability\r\ndue to a large temporary deficit in the EU ETS provided the total surplus is\r\nbelow 400 million allowances..\nAllowances are thus placed in and released\r\nfrom the market stability reserve in relation to the total number of allowances\r\nin circulation. This indicator is a direct measure for the actual imbalance\r\nbetween supply and demand and is thus preferred over more indirect and\r\nuncertain measures for important market drivers such as GDP, fuel prices,\r\nweather and precipitation, etc. The upper and lower boundaries of the range\r\nwere determined following consultations with stakeholders and reflect a range\r\nwhere experience shows that the market was able to operate in an orderly\r\nmanner.\nTo ensure predictability and more gradual\r\nchanges to the market stability reserve, a pre-defined volume of 100 million allowances\r\nper year would be released from the reserve where the conditions are met. This\r\nquantity represents roughly 5% of the current annual emissions in the EU ETS which\r\nbased on historical experience should be sufficient to cater for even very\r\nsudden and strong increases in demand. \nThe introduction of a market stability\r\nreserve represents potentially a significant change to the design and operation\r\nof the EU ETS. Early lessons from operating the reserve rules may prove\r\nvaluable and allow for improvements in the design of the reserve rules. At the\r\nsame time predictability and stability are important for a successful carbon\r\nmarket. In order to strike the right balance the proposal foresees a review with\r\nparticular focus on certain reserve parameters by 2026.\nThe proposal also contains provisions aimed\r\nat smoothening auctioning supply in the years around transitions between trading\r\nphases in cases where the default would otherwise have resulted in sharp\r\nchanges. This effect is volume neutral over the three-year period and consists\r\nof a simple averaging of annual volumes that mitigates potential transitional\r\nand temporary impacts on the auction supply from the modalities set by\r\nDirective 2003/87/EC and Commission Regulation No 1031/2010 for the end of the\r\nperiod with regard to e.g. allowances remaining in the new entrants' reserve at\r\nthe end of the period, allowances not allocated due to closures or under the\r\nderogation for the modernisation of the electricity sector. If the volume of\r\nallowances that should be auctioned in the last year of the period exceeds the average\r\namount to be auctioned in the two following years by more than 30%, this difference\r\nwill be evenly distributed over these years. This provision builds on the\r\nexperience gained in the transition from phase 2 to phase 3 of the EU ETS and\r\navoids a repeat of the negative implications of transitional modalities.\nThe proposal takes the same legal basis as\r\nDirective 2003/87/EC. Given its background and temporal\r\nscope, it is submitted as a part of the 2030 framework for climate and energy\r\npolicies.\nThe EU's right to act stems from the fact\r\nthat the ETS operates as a Union-wide system in a fully harmonised manner. It\r\nis in conformity with the subsidiarity and proportionality principle set out in\r\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on the European Union.\n2014/0011 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nconcerning the establishment and operation\r\nof a market stability reserve for the Union greenhouse gas emission trading\r\nscheme and amending Directive 2003/87/EC \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[5],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 10(5) of Directive\r\n2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[6] provides that an annual report on the functioning of the European carbon\r\nmarket should be submitted each year to the European Parliament and the Council.\r\n\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The report from the\r\nCommission to the European Parliament and the Council on the state of the\r\nEuropean carbon market in 2102[7]\r\nidentified the need for measures in order to tackle structural supply-demand\r\nimbalances. The impact assessment on the 2030 climate and energy policy\r\nframework[8]\r\nindicates that this imbalance is expected to continue, and would not be sufficiently\r\naddressed by adapting the linear trajectory to a more stringent target within\r\nthis framework. A change in the linear factor only changes gradually the cap.\r\nAccordingly, the surplus would also only gradually decline, such that the\r\nmarket would have to continue to operate for more than a decade with a surplus\r\nof around 2 billion allowances or more. In order to address this problem and to\r\nmake the European Emission Trading System more resilient to imbalances, a market stability reserve should be established. To ensure\r\nregulatory certainty as regards auction supply in phase 3 and allow for some lead-time\r\nadjusting to the introduction of the design change, the market stability\r\nreserve should be established as of phase 4 starting in 2021. In order to\r\npreserve a maximum degree of predictability, clear rules should be set for\r\nplacing allowances into the reserve and releasing them from the reserve. Where\r\nthe conditions are met, beginning in 2021, allowances corresponding to 12% of the\r\nnumber of allowances in circulation in year x-2 should be put into the reserve.\r\nA corresponding number of allowances should be released from the reserve when\r\nthe total number of allowances in circulation is lower than 400 million.\u00a0\r\n\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\r\nin addition to the establishment of the market stability reserve, a few\r\nconsequential amendments should be made to Directive 2003/87/EC to ensure consistency\r\nand smooth operation of the ETS. In particular, the operation of Directive\r\n2003/87/EC may lead to large volumes of allowances to be auctioned at the end\r\nof each trading period which can undermine market stability. Accordingly, in\r\norder to avoid an imbalanced market situation of supply\r\nof allowances at the end of one trading period and the beginning of the next with\r\npossibly disruptive effects for the market, provision should be made for the\r\nauctioning of part of any large increase of supply at the end of one trading\r\nperiod in the first two years of the next period. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\r\nreview the functioning of the market stability reserve in relation to its\r\noperation in the light of experience of its application. The review of the\r\nfunctioning of the market stability reserve should in particular consider whether\r\nthe rules on placing allowances in the reserve are\r\nappropriate with regard to the aim pursued to tackle structural\r\nsupply-demand imbalances.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Articles 10 and 13(2) of\r\nDirective 2003/87/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\r\nMarket stability reserve\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A market stability reserve\r\nis established, and shall operate from 1 January 2021.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall\r\npublish the total number of allowances in circulation each year, by 15 May of\r\nthe subsequent year.
