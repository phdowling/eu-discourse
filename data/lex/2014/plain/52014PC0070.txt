Negotiations with Singapore were launched in October 2005 and were finalised at the end May 2013. The two\nsides initialled the PCA in Singapore on 14 October 2013. \nThe PCA with Singapore is the fourth of the\n'second generation' agreements with individual ASEAN countries that has been\ninitialled, following the agreements with Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. It will supersede the current legal framework of the 1980 Cooperation\nAgreement between the European Economic Community and member countries of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations. \nThis Agreement with Singapore constitutes another stepping stone towards enhanced political and economic involvement of\nthe EU in South-East Asia. The PCA will also provide the basis for more\neffective bilateral engagement by the EU and its Member States with Singapore by strengthening political dialogue and enhancing\ncooperation in a broad range of areas. \nThe PCA covers the EU\u2019s standard political\nclauses on human rights, International Criminal Court (ICC), Weapons of Mass Destructions\n(WMD), Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) and counter-terrorism. It also\nencompasses cooperation in areas such as health, environment, climate change,\nenergy, tax, education and culture, labour, employment and social affairs,\nscience and technology, and transport. The Agreement further addresses legal\ncooperation, money laundering and terrorist financing, organised crime and\ncorruption. \nThe PCA contains a Side Letter, which forms\nan integral part of the Agreement. The Side Letter confirms the parties'\nunderstanding that, at the time of signature of the Agreement, they are not\naware, based on objectively available information, of any of each other\u2019s\ndomestic laws, or their application, which could lead to the invocation of the\nnon-execution mechanism. \nThe PCA also contains provisions on cooperation\nin the tax area. In view of the developments at the international level on a\nnew global standard of automatic exchange of information for tax purposes, it\nis deemed appropriate that, at the time of signature of the PCA, both sides\nsign a Joint Declaration on this issue. While not an integral part of the PCA,\nthe Joint Declaration shall express a firm political commitment on the\nintention of both sides to adhere to the new standard in their bilateral\nrelations. \nThe PCA is complemented by the Free Trade Agreement which was initialled by the EU\nand Singapore on 20 September 2013. The two agreements give the EU and Singapore a platform to bring their relations to a higher level. \nThe Commission notes that Council Decision\nNo 2012/272/EU on the signing of the PCA Philippines is the subject of Court\nCase C-377/12: the Commission asked the Court to annul this Decision insofar as\nthe Council had added legal bases relating to transport (Articles 91 and 100\nTFEU), readmission (Article 79(3) TFEU) and the environment (Article 191(4)\nTFEU). Court Case C-377/12 is of relevance to the proposal for a Council\nDecision on the signing of the PCA with Singapore, too. Subject to the Court\nruling in Case-377/12, the proposal for a Council Decision on the signing of\nthe PCA Singapore is based on Articles 207, 212 and 218(5). \nThe Commission draws the attention of the\nCouncil to the recital in the Agreement relating to the specific position of\nthe UK, Ireland and Denmark based on Protocols 21 and 22 of the Treaties. The\naddition of this recital is due to the genesis of this text only. Depending on\nthe outcome of case C-377/12, currently pending before the Court of Justice,\nthis recital may have to be dropped or reworded at a later stage. The\nCommission takes the view that, as long as this case is pending, the procedure\nfor conclusion of this Agreement cannot be finalised.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n2014/0036 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the Union, of\nthe Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and its\nMember States, of the one part, and the Republic of Singapore, of the other\npart\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 207 and 212 in\nconjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission[1],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 25 November 2004, the\nCouncil authorised the Commission to negotiate a Partnership and Cooperation\nAgreement with the Republic of Singapore, hereinafter referred to as \u2018the\nAgreement\u2019.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The negotiations were\nconcluded and the Agreement was initialled on 14 October 2013.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement should be\nsigned, subject to its conclusion at a later date.
