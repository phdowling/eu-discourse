Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the Commission\r\ndecided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten\r\namendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments\r\nshould endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they\r\nare responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily\r\nunderstandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a\r\ngiven matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament, the\r\nCouncil and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the\r\nfast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of\r\n11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not\r\nmembers of the European Community[3].\r\nThe new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the\r\ncodification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of\r\na preliminary consolidation, in 22 official languages, of Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 and the\r\ninstrument amending it, carried out by the Publications Office of the European\r\nUnion, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have been given\r\nnew numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a\r\ntable set out in Annex VI to the codified Regulation.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\n2014/0305 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non protection against subsidised imports\r\nfrom countries not members of the European \u00d6 Union \u00d5 (codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the Functioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 1 (adapted)\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n\u00d6 597/2009[6] \u00d5 has been\r\nsubstantially amended[7].\r\nIn the interests of clarity and rationality, \u00d6 that \u00d5 Regulation\r\nshould be codified.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 3 (adapted)\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex 1A to the Agreement\r\nestablishing the \u00d6 World\r\nTrade Organisation \u00d5 (\u2018the WTO\r\nAgreement\u2019) contains, inter alia, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\r\n1994 (\u2018the GATT 1994\u2019), an Agreement on Agriculture (\u2018the Agreement on\r\nAgriculture\u2019), an Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the \u00d6 General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade \u00d5 1994 and an\r\nAgreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (\u2018the Subsidies Agreement\u2019).\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 5 (adapted)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a \u00d6 proper \u00d5 and\r\ntransparent \u00d6 application \u00d5 of the rules\r\nprovided for in \u00d6 the\r\nSubsidies Agreement \u00d5, the language \u00d6 of that\r\nagreement should be reflected \u00d5 in \u00d6 Union \u00d5 legislation to\r\nthe best extent possible.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 6\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, it seems\r\nadvisable to explain, in adequate detail, when a subsidy shall be deemed to\r\nexist, according to which principles it shall be countervailable (in particular\r\nwhether the subsidy has been granted specifically), and according to which\r\ncriteria the amount of the countervailable subsidy is to be calculated.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 7 (adapted)\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In determining the\r\nexistence of a subsidy, it is necessary to demonstrate that there has been a\r\nfinancial contribution by a government or \u00d6 a \u00d5 public body\r\nwithin the territory of a country, or that there has been some form of income\r\nor price support within the meaning of Article XVI of the GATT 1994, and that a\r\nbenefit has thereby been conferred on the recipient enterprise.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 8\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the calculation of the\r\nbenefit to the recipient, in cases where a market benchmark does not exist in\r\nthe country concerned the benchmark should be determined by adjusting the terms\r\nand conditions prevailing in the country concerned on the basis of actual\r\nfactors available in that country. If this is not practicable because, inter\r\nalia, such prices or costs do no exist or are unreliable, then the appropriate\r\nbenchmark should be determined by resorting to terms and conditions in other\r\nmarkets.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 9 (adapted)\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is desirable to \u00d6 set\r\nout \u00d5 clear and\r\ndetailed guidance as to the factors which may be relevant for the determination\r\nof whether the subsidised imports have caused material injury or are\r\nthreatening to cause injury. In demonstrating that the volume and price levels\r\nof the imports concerned are responsible for injury sustained by a \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry,\r\nattention should be given to the effect of other factors and in particular\r\nprevailing market conditions in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 10 (adapted)\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is advisable to define\r\nthe term \u2018 \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\u2019 and\r\nto provide that parties related to exporters may be excluded from such\r\nindustry, and to define the term \u2018related\u2019. It is also necessary to provide for\r\ncountervailing duty action to be taken on behalf of producers in a region of\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 and to \u00d6 set\r\nout \u00d5 guidelines on\r\nthe definition of such region.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 11 (adapted)\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to \u00d6 specify \u00d5 who may lodge\r\na countervailing duty complaint, including the extent to which it should be\r\nsupported by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, and\r\nthe information on countervailable subsidies, injury and causation which such\r\ncomplaint should contain. It is also expedient to specify the procedures for\r\nthe rejection of complaints or the initiation of proceedings.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 12 (adapted)\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to \u00d6 specify \u00d5 the manner in\r\nwhich interested parties should be given notice of the information which the\r\nauthorities require. \u00d6 Interested\r\nparties \u00d5 should have\r\nample opportunity to present all relevant evidence and to defend their\r\ninterests. It is also desirable to set out clearly the rules and procedures to\r\nbe followed during the investigation, in particular the rules whereby\r\ninterested parties are to make themselves known, present their views and submit\r\ninformation within specified time limits, if such views and information are to\r\nbe taken into account. It is also appropriate to set out the conditions under\r\nwhich an interested party may have access to, and comment on, information\r\npresented by other interested parties. There should also be cooperation between\r\nthe Member States and the Commission in the collection of information.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 13 (adapted)\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to \u00d6 set\r\nout \u00d5 the conditions\r\nunder which provisional duties may be imposed, including conditions whereby \u00d6 provisional\r\nduties \u00d5 may be imposed\r\nno earlier than 60 days from initiation and no later than nine months\r\nthereafter.

It is also appropriate to \u00d6 specify \u00d5 the\r\nconsequences of \u00d6 a \u00d5 breach or\r\nwithdrawal of undertakings and that provisional duties may be imposed in cases\r\nof suspected violation or where further investigation is necessary to\r\nsupplement the findings. In accepting undertakings, care should be taken that\r\nthe proposed undertakings, and their enforcement, do not lead to\r\nanti-competitive behaviour.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 15\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is considered\r\nappropriate to allow withdrawal of an undertaking and application of the duty\r\nby one single legal act. It is also necessary to ensure that the withdrawal\r\nprocedure is terminated within a time limit of normally six months and in no\r\ncase more than nine months in order to ensure a proper enforcement of the\r\nmeasure in force.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 16\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to provide\r\nthat the termination of cases should, irrespective of whether definitive\r\nmeasures are adopted or not, normally take place within 12 months, and in no\r\ncase later than 13 months, from the initiation of the investigation.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 17 (adapted)\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00d6 Investigations \u00d5 or proceedings\r\nshould be terminated \u00d6 where \u00d5 the amount of\r\nthe subsidy is de minimis or , particularly in the case of imports\r\noriginating in developing countries, the volume of subsidised imports or the\r\ninjury is negligible, and it is appropriate to define those \u00d6 situations \u00d5. Where\r\nmeasures are to be imposed, it is necessary to provide for the termination of\r\ninvestigations and to \u00d6 specify \u00d5 that measures\r\nshould be less than the amount of countervailable subsidies if such lesser\r\namount would remove the injury, and also to specify the method of calculating\r\nthe level of measures in cases of sampling.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 18 (adapted)\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to provide\r\nfor retroactive collection of provisional duties if that is deemed appropriate\r\nand to define the circumstances which may trigger the retroactive application\r\nof duties to avoid the undermining of the definitive measures to be applied. It\r\nis also necessary to provide that duties may be applied retroactively in cases\r\nof breach or withdrawal of undertakings.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 19\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to provide\r\nthat measures are to lapse after five years unless a review indicates that they\r\nshould be maintained. It is also necessary to provide, in cases where\r\nsufficient evidence is submitted of changed circumstances, for interim reviews\r\nor for investigations to determine whether refunds of countervailing duties are\r\nwarranted.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 20 (adapted)\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even though the Subsidies\r\nAgreement does not contain provisions concerning circumvention of\r\ncountervailing measures, the possibility of such circumvention exists, in terms\r\nsimilar, albeit not identical, to the circumvention of anti-dumping measures.\r\nIt appears therefore appropriate to \u00d6 provide\r\nfor \u00d5 an\r\nanti-circumvention provision in this Regulation.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 21\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is desirable to clarify\r\nwhich parties have the right to request the initiation of anti\u2011circumvention\r\ninvestigations.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 22 (adapted)\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also desirable to\r\nclarify which practices constitute circumvention of the measures in place.\r\nCircumvention practices may take place either inside or outside the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 . It is\r\nconsequently necessary to provide that exemptions from the extended duties\r\nwhich may be granted to importers may also be granted to exporters when duties\r\nare being \u00d6 applied \u00d5 to address\r\ncircumvention taking place outside the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 23\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is expedient to permit\r\nthe suspension of countervailing measures where there is a temporary change in\r\nmarket conditions which makes the continued imposition of such measures\r\ntemporarily inappropriate.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 24\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to provide\r\nthat imports under investigation may be made subject to registration upon\r\nimportation in order to enable measures to be subsequently applied against such\r\nimports.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\nrecital 25 (adapted)\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure proper\r\nenforcement of measures, it is necessary that Member States monitor, and report\r\nto the Commission, the import trade \u00d6 of \u00d5 products\r\nsubject to investigation or subject to measures, and also the amount of duties\r\ncollected under this Regulation.

Subsidies shall be subject to\r\ncountervailing measures only if they are specific, as defined in paragraphs 2,\r\n3 and 4.\n2. In order to determine whether a subsidy\r\nis specific to an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries\r\n(\u2018certain enterprises\u2019) within the jurisdiction of the granting authority, the\r\nfollowing principles shall apply:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where the granting authority, or\r\nthe legislation pursuant to which the granting authority operates, explicitly\r\nlimits access to a subsidy to certain enterprises, such subsidy shall be\r\nspecific;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where the granting authority, or\r\nthe legislation pursuant to which the granting authority operates, establishes\r\nobjective criteria or conditions governing the eligibility for, and the amount\r\nof, a subsidy, specificity shall not exist, provided that the eligibility is\r\nautomatic and that such criteria and conditions are strictly adhered to;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if, notwithstanding any\r\nappearance of non-specificity resulting from the application of the principles\r\nlaid down in points (a) and (b), there are reasons to believe that the subsidy\r\nmay in fact be specific, other factors may be considered. Such factors are: use\r\nof a subsidy programme by a limited number of certain enterprises; predominant\r\nuse by certain enterprises; the granting of disproportionately large amounts of\r\nsubsidy to certain enterprises; the manner in which discretion has been\r\nexercised by the granting authority in the decision to grant a subsidy. In this\r\nregard, information on the frequency with which applications for a subsidy are\r\nrefused or approved and the reasons for such decisions shall, in particular, be\r\nconsidered.\nFor the purpose of point (b), \u2018objective\r\ncriteria or conditions\u2019 means criteria or conditions which are neutral, which\r\ndo not favour certain enterprises over others, and which are economic in nature\r\nand horizontal in application, such as number of employees or size of\r\nenterprise.\nThe criteria or conditions must be clearly\r\nset out by law, regulation, or other official document, so as to be capable of\r\nverification.\nIn applying point (c) of the first\r\nsubparagraph, account shall be taken of the extent of diversification of\r\neconomic activities within the jurisdiction of the granting authority, as well\r\nas of the length of time during which the subsidy programme has been in\r\noperation.\n3. A subsidy which is limited to certain\r\nenterprises located within a designated geographical region within the\r\njurisdiction of the granting authority shall be specific. The setting or\r\nchanging of generally applicable tax rates by all levels of government entitled\r\nto do so shall not be deemed to be a specific subsidy for the purposes of this\r\nRegulation.\n4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3, the\r\nfollowing subsidies shall be deemed to be specific:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 subsidies contingent, in law or\r\nin fact, whether solely or as one of several other conditions, upon export\r\nperformance, including those illustrated in Annex I;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 subsidies contingent, whether\r\nsolely or as one of several other conditions, upon the use of domestic over\r\nimported goods.\nFor the purposes of point (a), subsidies\r\nshall be considered to be contingent in fact upon export performance when the\r\nfacts demonstrate that the granting of a subsidy, without having been made\r\nlegally contingent upon export performance, is in fact tied to actual or\r\nanticipated exportation or export earnings. The mere fact that a subsidy is\r\naccorded to enterprises which export shall not, for that reason alone, be\r\nconsidered to be an export subsidy within the meaning of this provision.\n5. Any determination of specificity under\r\nthe provisions of this Article shall be clearly substantiated on the basis of\r\npositive evidence.\nArticle 5\nCalculation of the amount of the\r\ncountervailable subsidy\nThe amount of countervailable subsidies\r\nshall be calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the recipient which is\r\nfound to exist during the investigation period for subsidisation. Normally this\r\nperiod shall be the most recent accounting year of the beneficiary, but may be\r\nany other period of at least six months prior to the initiation of the\r\ninvestigation for which reliable financial and other relevant data are\r\navailable.\nArticle 6\nCalculation of benefit to the\r\nrecipient\nAs regards the calculation of benefit to\r\nthe recipient, the following rules shall apply:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 government provision of equity\r\ncapital shall not be considered to confer a benefit, unless the investment can\r\nbe regarded as inconsistent with the usual investment practice, including for\r\nthe provision of risk capital, of private investors in the territory of the\r\ncountry of origin and/or export;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a loan by a government shall not\r\nbe considered to confer a benefit, unless there is a difference between the\r\namount that the firm receiving the loan pays on the government loan and the\r\namount that the firm would pay for a comparable commercial loan which the firm\r\ncould actually obtain on the market. In that event the benefit shall be the\r\ndifference between \u00d6 those \u00d5 two amounts;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a loan guarantee by a government\r\nshall not be considered to confer a benefit, unless there is a difference\r\nbetween the amount that the firm receiving the guarantee pays on a loan\r\nguaranteed by the government and the amount that the firm would pay for a\r\ncomparable commercial loan in the absence of the government guarantee. In \u00d6 that \u00d5 case the\r\nbenefit shall be the difference between \u00d6 those \u00d5 two amounts,\r\nadjusted for any differences in fees;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the provision of goods or\r\nservices or purchase of goods by a government shall not be considered to confer\r\na benefit, unless the provision is made for less than adequate remuneration or\r\nthe purchase is made for more than adequate remuneration. The adequacy of\r\nremuneration shall be determined in relation to prevailing market conditions\r\nfor the product or service in question in the country of provision or purchase,\r\nincluding price, quality, availability, marketability, transportation and other\r\nconditions of purchase or sale.\nIf there are no such prevailing market terms\r\nand conditions for the product or service in question in the country of\r\nprovision or purchase which can be used as appropriate benchmarks, the\r\nfollowing rules shall apply:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the terms and conditions prevailing\r\nin the country concerned shall be adjusted, on the basis of actual costs,\r\nprices and other factors available in that country, by an appropriate amount\r\nwhich reflects normal market terms and conditions; or\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when appropriate, the terms and\r\nconditions prevailing in the market of another country or on the world market\r\nwhich are available to the recipient shall be used.\nArticle 7\nGeneral provisions on calculation\n1. The amount of the countervailable\r\nsubsidies shall be determined per unit of the subsidised product exported to\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\nIn establishing \u00d6 that \u00d5 amount the\r\nfollowing elements may be deducted from the total subsidy:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 any application fee, or other costs\r\nnecessarily incurred in order to qualify for, or to obtain, the subsidy;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 export taxes, duties or other\r\ncharges levied on the export of the product to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 specifically\r\nintended to offset the subsidy.\nWhere an interested party claims a\r\ndeduction, it must prove that the claim is justified.\n2. Where the subsidy is not granted by\r\nreference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported,\r\nthe amount of countervailable subsidy shall be determined by allocating the\r\nvalue of the total subsidy, as appropriate, over the level of production, sales\r\nor exports of the products concerned during the investigation period for\r\nsubsidisation.\n3. Where the subsidy can be linked to the\r\nacquisition or future acquisition of fixed assets, the amount of the\r\ncountervailable subsidy shall be calculated by spreading the subsidy across a\r\nperiod which reflects the normal depreciation of such assets in the industry\r\nconcerned.\nThe amount so calculated which is\r\nattributable to the investigation period, including that which derives from\r\nfixed assets acquired before \u00d6 that \u00d5 period, shall\r\nbe allocated as described in paragraph 2.\nWhere the assets are non-depreciating, the\r\nsubsidy shall be valued as an interest-free loan, and be treated in accordance\r\nwith Article 6(b).\n4. Where a subsidy cannot be linked to the\r\nacquisition of fixed assets, the amount of the benefit received during the\r\ninvestigation period shall in principle be attributed to \u00d6 that \u00d5 period, and\r\nallocated as described in paragraph 2, unless special circumstances arise\r\njustifying attribution over a different period.\nArticle 8\nDetermination of injury\n1. A determination of injury shall be based\r\non positive evidence and shall involve an objective examination of:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the volume of the subsidised\r\nimports and the effect of the subsidised imports on prices in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 market for\r\nlike products; and\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the consequent impact of those\r\nimports on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\n2. With regard to the volume of the\r\nsubsidised imports, consideration shall be given to whether there has been a\r\nsignificant increase in subsidised imports, either in absolute terms or\r\nrelative to production or consumption in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 . With regard\r\nto the effect of the subsidised imports on prices, consideration shall be given\r\nto whether there has been significant price undercutting by the subsidised\r\nimports as compared with the price of a like product of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, or\r\nwhether the effect of such imports is otherwise to depress prices to a\r\nsignificant degree or prevent price increases, which would otherwise have\r\noccurred, to a significant degree. No one or more of \u00d6 those \u00d5 factors can\r\nnecessarily give decisive guidance.\n3. Where imports of a product from more\r\nthan one country are simultaneously subject to countervailing duty\r\ninvestigations, the effects of such imports shall be cumulatively assessed only\r\nif it is determined that:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the amount of countervailable\r\nsubsidies established in relation to the imports from each country is more than\r\nde minimis as defined in Article 14(5) and the volume of imports from\r\neach country is not negligible; and\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a cumulative assessment of the\r\neffects of the imports is appropriate in \u00d6 the \u00d5 light of the\r\nconditions of competition between imported products and the conditions of\r\ncompetition between the imported products and the like \u00d6 Union \u00d5 product.\n4. The examination of the impact of the\r\nsubsidised imports on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\r\nconcerned shall include an evaluation of all relevant economic factors and\r\nindices having a bearing on the state of the industry, including the fact that\r\nan industry is still in the process of recovering from the effects of past\r\nsubsidisation or dumping, the magnitude of the amount of countervailable\r\nsubsidies, actual and potential decline in sales, profits, output, market\r\nshare, productivity, return on investments, utilisation of capacity, factors\r\naffecting \u00d6 Union \u00d5 prices, actual\r\nand potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages,\r\ngrowth, ability to raise capital or investments and, in the case of\r\nagriculture, whether there has been an increased burden on government support\r\nprogrammes. This list is not exhaustive, nor can any one or more of these\r\nfactors necessarily give decisive guidance.\n5. It must be demonstrated, from all the\r\nrelevant evidence presented in relation to paragraph 1, that the subsidised\r\nimports are causing injury. Specifically, \u00d6 that \u00d5 shall entail a\r\ndemonstration that the volume and/or price levels identified pursuant to\r\nparagraph 2 are responsible for an impact on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry as\r\nprovided for in paragraph 4, and that \u00d6 that \u00d5 impact exists\r\nto a degree which enables it to be classified as material.\n6. Known factors other than the subsidised\r\nimports which are injuring the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry at\r\nthe same time shall also be examined to ensure that injury caused by \u00d6 those \u00d5 other factors\r\nis not attributed to the subsidised imports pursuant to paragraph 5.\r\nFactors which may be considered in \u00d6 that \u00d5 respect \u00d6 shall \u00d5 include the\r\nvolume and prices of non-subsidised imports, contraction in demand or changes\r\nin the patterns of consumption, restrictive trade practices of, and competition\r\nbetween, third country and \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers,\r\ndevelopments in technology and the export performance and productivity of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\n7. The effect of the subsidised imports\r\nshall be assessed in relation to the production of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry of\r\nthe like product when available data permit the separate identification of that\r\nproduction on the basis of such criteria as the production process, producers\u2019\r\nsales and profits. If such separate identification of that production is not\r\npossible, the effects of the subsidised imports shall be assessed by\r\nexamination of the production of the narrowest group or range of products,\r\nincluding the like product, for which the necessary information can be\r\nprovided.\n8. A determination of a threat of material\r\ninjury shall be based on facts and not merely on allegations, conjecture or\r\nremote possibility. The change in circumstances which would create a situation\r\nin which the subsidy would cause injury must be clearly foreseen and imminent.\nIn making a determination regarding the\r\nexistence of a threat of material injury, consideration should be given to such\r\nfactors as:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the nature of the subsidy or\r\nsubsidies in question and the trade effects likely to arise therefrom;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a significant rate of increase of\r\nsubsidised imports into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 market\r\nindicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sufficient freely disposable\r\ncapacity of the exporter or an imminent \u00d6 and \u00d5 substantial\r\nincrease in such capacity indicating the likelihood of substantially increased\r\nsubsidised exports to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , account\r\nbeing taken of the availability of other export markets to absorb any\r\nadditional exports;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether imports are entering at\r\nprices that would, to a significant degree, depress prices or prevent price\r\nincreases which otherwise would have occurred, and would probably increase\r\ndemand for further imports; \n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 inventories of the product being\r\ninvestigated.\nNo one of the factors listed above by itself\r\ncan necessarily give decisive guidance, but the totality of the factors\r\nconsidered must lead to the conclusion that further subsidised exports are\r\nimminent and that, unless protective action is taken, material injury will\r\noccur.\nArticle 9\nDefinition of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\n1. For the purposes of this Regulation, the\r\nterm \u2018 \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\u2019\r\nshall be interpreted as referring to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers as a\r\nwhole of the like products or to those of them whose collective output of the\r\nproducts constitutes a major proportion, as defined in Article 10(6), of the\r\ntotal \u00d6 Union \u00d5 production of\r\nthose products, except that:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when producers are related to the\r\nexporters or importers, or are themselves importers of the allegedly subsidised\r\nproduct, the term \u2018 \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\u2019 may\r\nbe interpreted as referring to the rest of the producers;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in exceptional circumstances the\r\nterritory of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 may, for the\r\nproduction in question, be divided into two or more competitive markets and the\r\nproducers within each market may be regarded as a separate industry if:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the producers within such a market\r\nsell all or almost all of their production of the product in question in that\r\nmarket; and\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the demand in that market is not to\r\nany substantial degree met by producers of the product in question located\r\nelsewhere in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\nIn such circumstances, injury may be found to\r\nexist even where a major portion of the total \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry is\r\nnot injured, provided that there is a concentration of subsidised imports into\r\nsuch an isolated market and provided further that the subsidised imports are\r\ncausing injury to the producers of all or almost all of the production within\r\nsuch a market.\n2. For the purpose of paragraph 1,\r\nproducers shall be considered to be related to exporters or importers only if:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 one of them directly or\r\nindirectly controls the other; or\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 both of them are directly or\r\nindirectly controlled by a third person; or\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 together they directly or\r\nindirectly control a third person, provided that there are grounds for\r\nbelieving or suspecting that the effect of the relationship is such as to cause\r\nthe producer concerned to behave differently from non-related producers.\nFor the purpose of this paragraph, one\r\nshall be deemed to control another when the former is legally or operationally\r\nin a position to exercise restraint or direction over the latter.\n3. Where the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry has\r\nbeen interpreted as referring to the producers in a certain region, the\r\nexporters or the government granting countervailable subsidies shall be given\r\nan opportunity to offer undertakings pursuant to Article 13 in respect of the\r\nregion concerned. In such cases, when evaluating the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 interest of\r\nthe measures, special account shall be taken of the interest of the region. If\r\nan adequate undertaking is not offered promptly or if the situations set out in\r\nArticle 13(9) and (10) apply, a provisional or definitive countervailing duty\r\nmay be imposed in respect of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 as a whole. In\r\nsuch cases the duties may, if practicable, be limited to specific producers or\r\nexporters.\n4. The provisions of Article 8(7) shall \u00d6 be\r\napplicable \u00d5 to this\r\nArticle.\nArticle 10\nInitiation\r\nof proceedings\n1. Except as provided for in paragraph 8,\r\nan investigation to determine the existence, degree and effect of any alleged\r\nsubsidy shall be initiated upon a written complaint by any natural or legal\r\nperson, or any association not having legal personality, acting on behalf of\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\nThe complaint may be submitted to the\r\nCommission or to a Member State, which shall forward it to the Commission. The\r\nCommission shall send Member States a copy of any complaint it receives. The complaint\r\nshall be deemed to have been lodged on the first working day following its\r\ndelivery to the Commission by registered mail or the issuing of an\r\nacknowledgement of receipt by the Commission.\nWhere, in the absence of any complaint, a\r\nMember State is in possession of sufficient evidence of subsidisation and of\r\nresultant injury to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, it\r\nshall immediately communicate such evidence to the Commission.\n2. A complaint, \u00d6 under \u00d5 paragraph 1,\r\nshall include sufficient evidence of the existence of countervailable subsidies\r\n(including, if possible, of their amount), injury and a causal link between the\r\nallegedly subsidised imports and the alleged injury. The complaint shall\r\ncontain such information as is reasonably available to the complainant on the\r\nfollowing:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the identity of the complainant\r\nand a description of the volume and value of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 production of\r\nthe like product by the complainant. Where a written complaint is made on\r\nbehalf of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, the\r\ncomplaint shall identify the industry on behalf of which the complaint is made\r\nby a list of all known \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers of\r\nthe like product (or associations of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers of\r\nthe like product) and, to the extent possible, a description of the volume and\r\nvalue of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 production of\r\nthe like product accounted for by such producers;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a complete description of the\r\nallegedly subsidised product, the names of the country or countries of origin\r\nor export in question, the identity of each known exporter or foreign producer\r\nand a list of known persons importing the product in question;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 evidence with regard to the\r\nexistence, amount, nature and countervailability of the subsidies in question;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00d6 the \u00d5 changes in the\r\nvolume of the allegedly subsidised imports, the effect of those imports on prices\r\nof the like product in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 market and the\r\nconsequent impact of the imports on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, as\r\ndemonstrated by relevant factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the\r\n\u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, such\r\nas those listed in Article 8(2) and (4).\n3. The Commission shall, as far as\r\npossible, examine the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the\r\ncomplaint, to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the\r\ninitiation of an investigation.\n4. An investigation may be initiated in\r\norder to determine whether or not the alleged subsidies are \u2018specific\u2019 within\r\nthe meaning of Article 4(2) and (3).\n5. An investigation may also be initiated\r\nin respect of measures of the type listed in Annex IV, to the extent that they\r\ncontain an element of subsidy as defined by Article 3, in order to determine\r\nwhether the measures in question fully conform to the provisions of that Annex.\n6. An investigation shall not be initiated\r\npursuant to paragraph 1 unless it has been determined, on the basis of an\r\nexamination as to the degree of support for, or opposition to, the complaint\r\nexpressed by \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers of\r\nthe like product, that the complaint has been made by or on behalf of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry. The\r\ncomplaint shall be considered to have been made by or on behalf of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry if it\r\nis supported by those \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\nwhose collective output constitutes more than 50 % of the total production\r\nof the like product produced by that portion of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry\r\nexpressing either support for or opposition to the complaint. However, no\r\ninvestigation shall be initiated when \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\nexpressly supporting the complaint account for less than 25 % of total\r\nproduction of the like product produced by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\n7. The authorities shall \u00d6 avoid \u00d5 , unless a\r\ndecision has been made to initiate an investigation, any publicising of the\r\ncomplaint seeking the initiation of an investigation. However, as soon as\r\npossible after receipt of a properly documented complaint pursuant to this\r\nArticle, and in any event before the initiation of an investigation, the\r\nCommission shall notify the country of origin and/or export concerned, which\r\nshall be invited for consultations with the aim of clarifying the situation as\r\nto matters referred to in paragraph 2 and arriving at a mutually agreed\r\nsolution.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(1) \n8. If, in special circumstances, the\r\nCommission decides to initiate an investigation without having received a\r\nwritten complaint by or on behalf of the Union industry for the initiation of\r\nsuch an investigation, this shall be done on the basis of sufficient evidence\r\nof the existence of countervailable subsidies, injury and causal link, as\r\ndescribed in paragraph 2, to justify such initiation. The Commission shall\r\nprovide information to the Member States once it has determined the need to\r\ninitiate such an investigation.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\n9. The evidence \u00d6 of \u00d5 both subsidies\r\nand injury shall be considered simultaneously in the decision on whether or not\r\nto initiate an investigation. A complaint shall be rejected where there is\r\ninsufficient evidence of either countervailable subsidies or of injury to\r\njustify proceeding with the case. Proceedings shall not be initiated against\r\ncountries whose imports represent a market share of below 1 %, unless such\r\ncountries collectively account for 3 % or more of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 consumption.\n10. The complaint may be withdrawn prior to\r\ninitiation, in which case it shall be considered not to have been lodged.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(2) (adapted)\n11. Where it is apparent that there is\r\nsufficient evidence to justify initiating proceedings, the Commission shall do\r\nso within 45 days of the date \u00d6 on\r\nwhich \u00d5 the complaint \u00d6 was\r\nlodged \u00d5 and shall\r\npublish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. Where\r\ninsufficient evidence has been presented, the complainant shall be so informed\r\nwithin 45 days of the date on which the complaint is lodged with the\r\nCommission. The Commission shall provide information to the Member States\r\nconcerning its analysis of the complaint normally within 21 days of the date on\r\nwhich the complaint is lodged with the Commission.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\n12. The notice of initiation of the\r\nproceedings shall announce the initiation of an investigation, indicate the\r\nproduct and countries concerned, give a summary of the information received,\r\nand provide that all relevant information is to be communicated to the\r\nCommission.\nIt shall state the periods within which\r\ninterested parties may make themselves known, present their views in writing\r\nand submit information, if such views and information are to be taken into\r\naccount during the investigation. It shall also state the period within which\r\ninterested parties may apply to be heard by the Commission in accordance with\r\nArticle 11(5).\n13. The Commission shall advise the\r\nexporters, importers and representative associations of importers or exporters\r\nknown to it to be concerned, as well as the country of origin and/or export and\r\nthe complainants, of the initiation of the proceedings and, with due regard to\r\nthe protection of confidential information, provide the full text of the\r\nwritten complaint referred to in paragraph 1 to the known exporters and to the\r\nauthorities of the country of origin and/or export, and make it available upon\r\nrequest to other interested parties involved. Where the number of exporters\r\ninvolved is particularly high, the full text of the written complaint may\r\ninstead be provided only to the authorities of the country of origin and/or\r\nexport or to the relevant trade association.\n14. A countervailing duty investigation\r\nshall not hinder the procedures of customs clearance.\nArticle 11\nThe investigation\n1. Following the initiation of proceedings,\r\nthe Commission, acting in cooperation with the Member States, shall commence an\r\ninvestigation at \u00d6 Union \u00d5 level. Such\r\ninvestigation shall cover both subsidisation and injury, and these shall be\r\ninvestigated simultaneously.\nFor the purpose of a representative\r\nfinding, an investigation period shall be selected which in the case of\r\nsubsidisation shall, normally, cover the investigation period provided for in\r\nArticle 5.\nInformation relating to a period subsequent\r\nto the investigation period shall not, normally, be taken into account.\n2. Parties receiving questionnaires used in\r\na countervailing duty investigation shall be given at least 30 days to reply.\r\nThe time limit for exporters shall be counted from the date of receipt of the\r\nquestionnaire, which for this purpose shall be deemed to have been received one\r\nweek from the day on which it was sent to the respondent or transmitted to the\r\nappropriate diplomatic representative of the country of origin and/or export.\r\nAn extension to the 30-day period may be granted, due account being taken of\r\nthe time limits of the investigation, provided that the party shows due cause\r\nfor such extension, in terms of its particular circumstances.\n3. The Commission may request Member States\r\nto supply information, and Member States shall take whatever steps are\r\nnecessary in order to give effect to such requests.\nThey shall send to the Commission the\r\ninformation requested together with the results of all inspections, checks or\r\ninvestigations carried out.\nWhere \u00d6 that \u00d5 information is\r\nof general interest or where its transmission has been requested by a Member State, the Commission shall forward it to the Member States, provided it is not\r\nconfidential, in which case a non-confidential summary shall be forwarded.\n4. The Commission may request Member States\r\nto carry out all necessary checks and inspections, particularly amongst\r\nimporters, traders and \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers, and\r\nto carry out investigations in third countries, provided that the firms\r\nconcerned give their consent and that the government of the country in question\r\nhas been officially notified and raises no objection.\nMember States shall take whatever steps are\r\nnecessary in order to give effect to such requests from the Commission.\nOfficials of the Commission shall be\r\nauthorised, if the Commission or a Member State so requests, to assist the\r\nofficials of Member States in carrying out their duties.\n5. The interested parties which have made\r\nthemselves known in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 10(12),\r\nshall be heard if they have, within the period prescribed in the notice\r\npublished in the Official Journal of the European Union, made a written\r\nrequest for a hearing showing that they are an interested party likely to be\r\naffected by the result of the proceedings and that there are particular reasons\r\nwhy they should be heard.\n6. Opportunities shall, on request, be\r\nprovided for the importers, exporters and the complainants, which have made\r\nthemselves known in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 10(12),\r\nand the government of the country of origin and/or export, to meet those\r\nparties having adverse interests, so that opposing views may be presented and\r\nrebuttal arguments offered.\nProvision of such opportunities must take\r\naccount of the need to preserve confidentiality and of the convenience to the\r\nparties.\nThere shall be no obligation on any party\r\nto attend a meeting, and failure to do so shall not be prejudicial to that\r\nparty\u2019s case.\nOral information provided under this\r\nparagraph shall be taken into account by the Commission in so far as it is\r\nsubsequently confirmed in writing.\n7. The complainants, the government of the\r\ncountry of origin and/or export, importers and exporters and their\r\nrepresentative associations, users and consumer organisations, which have made\r\nthemselves known in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 10(12),\r\nmay, upon written request, inspect all information made available to the\r\nCommission by any party to an investigation, as distinct from internal\r\ndocuments prepared by the authorities of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or its Member\r\nStates, which is relevant to the presentation of their cases and is not\r\nconfidential within the meaning of Article 29, and is used in the\r\ninvestigation.\nSuch parties may respond to such information\r\nand their comments shall be taken into consideration wherever they are\r\nsufficiently substantiated in the response.\n8. Except in circumstances provided for in\r\nArticle 28, the information which is supplied by interested parties and upon\r\nwhich findings are based shall be examined for accuracy as far as possible.\n9. For proceedings initiated pursuant to\r\nArticle 10(11), an investigation shall, whenever possible, be concluded within\r\none year. In any event, such investigations shall in all cases be concluded\r\nwithin 13 months of their initiation, in accordance with the findings made\r\npursuant to Article 13 for undertakings or the findings made pursuant to\r\nArticle 15 for definitive action.\n10. Throughout the investigation, the\r\nCommission shall afford the country of origin and/or export a reasonable\r\nopportunity to continue consultations with a view to clarifying the factual\r\nsituation and arriving at a mutually agreed solution.\nArticle 12\nProvisional measures\n1. Provisional duties may be imposed if:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 proceedings have been initiated\r\nin accordance with Article 10;\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(3)\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a notice has been given to that\r\neffect and interested parties have been given an adequate opportunity to submit\r\ninformation and make comments in accordance with the second subparagraph of\r\nArticle 10(12);\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a provisional affirmative\r\ndetermination has been made that the imported product benefits from\r\ncountervailable subsidies and of consequent injury to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry; and\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 interest calls\r\nfor intervention to prevent such injury.\nThe provisional duties shall be imposed no\r\nearlier than 60 days from the initiation of the proceedings but no later than\r\nnine months from the initiation of the proceedings.\nThe amount of the provisional\r\ncountervailing duty shall not exceed the total amount of countervailable\r\nsubsidies as provisionally established but it should be less than this amount,\r\nif such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\n2. Provisional duties shall be secured by a\r\nguarantee and the release of the products concerned for free circulation in the\r\n\u00d6 Union \u00d5 shall be\r\nconditional upon the provision of such guarantee.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(3)\n3. The Commission shall adopt provisional\r\nmeasures in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 25(4).\n\u00ea 597/2009\n4. Where a Member State requests immediate\r\nintervention by the Commission and where the conditions of the first and second\r\nsubparagraphs of paragraph 1 are met, the Commission shall, within a maximum of\r\nfive working days from receipt of the request, decide whether a provisional\r\ncountervailing duty shall be imposed.\n5. Provisional countervailing duties shall\r\nbe imposed for a maximum period of four months.\nArticle 13\nUndertakings\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(4) (adapted)\n1. On the condition that a provisional\r\naffirmative determination of subsidisation and injury has been made, the\r\nCommission may in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article\r\n25(2) accept satisfactory voluntary undertakings offers under which:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the country of origin and/or\r\nexport agrees to eliminate or limit the subsidy or take other measures\r\nconcerning its effects; or\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 any exporter undertakes to revise\r\nits prices or to cease exports to the area in question as long as such exports\r\nbenefit from countervailable subsidies, so that the Commission is satisfied\r\nthat the injurious effect of the subsidies is thereby eliminated.\nIn such a case and as long as such\r\nundertakings are in force, the provisional duties imposed by the Commission in\r\naccordance with Article 12(3) and the definitive duties imposed in accordance\r\nwith Article 15(1) shall not apply to the relevant imports of the product\r\nconcerned manufactured by the companies referred to in the Commission decision\r\naccepting undertakings, \u00d6 as subsequently\r\namended \u00d5.\nPrice increases under such undertakings\r\nshall not be higher than necessary to offset the amount of countervailable\r\nsubsidies, and should be less than the amount of countervailable subsidies if\r\nsuch increases would be adequate to remove the injury to the Union industry.\n\u00ea 597/2009\n2. Undertakings may be suggested by the\r\nCommission, but no country or exporter shall be obliged to enter into such an\r\nundertaking. The fact that countries or exporters do not offer such\r\nundertakings, or do not accept an invitation to do so, shall in no way\r\nprejudice consideration of the case.\nHowever, it may be determined that a threat\r\nof injury is more likely to be realised if the subsidised imports continue.\r\nUndertakings shall not be sought or accepted from countries or exporters unless\r\na provisional affirmative determination of subsidisation and injury caused by\r\nsuch subsidisation has been made.\nSave in exceptional circumstances,\r\nundertakings may not be offered later than the end of the period during which\r\nrepresentations may be made pursuant to Article 30(5).\n3. Undertakings offered need not be\r\naccepted if their acceptance is considered impractical, such as where the\r\nnumber of actual or potential exporters is too great, or for other reasons,\r\nincluding reasons of general policy. The exporter and/or the country of origin\r\nand/or export concerned may be provided with the reasons for which it is\r\nproposed to reject the offer of an undertaking and may be given an opportunity\r\nto make comments thereon. The reasons for rejection shall be set out in the\r\ndefinitive decision.\n4. Parties which offer an undertaking shall\r\nbe required to provide a non-confidential version of such undertaking, so that\r\nit may be made available to interested parties to the investigation.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(4)\n5. Where undertakings are accepted the\r\ninvestigation shall be terminated. The Commission shall terminate the\r\ninvestigation in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in\r\nArticle 25(3).\n\u00ea 597/2009\n\u00e81 37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .18(4)\n6. If the undertakings are accepted, the\r\ninvestigation of subsidisation and injury shall normally be completed. In such\r\na case, if a negative determination of subsidisation or injury is made, the\r\nundertaking shall automatically lapse, except in cases where such a\r\ndetermination is due in large part to the existence of an undertaking. In such\r\ncases, it may be required that an undertaking be maintained for a reasonable\r\nperiod.\nIn the event that an affirmative\r\ndetermination of subsidisation and injury is made, the undertaking shall\r\ncontinue consistent with its terms and the provisions of this Regulation.\n7. The Commission shall require any country\r\nor exporter from whom undertakings have been accepted to provide, periodically,\r\ninformation relevant to the fulfilment of such undertaking, and to permit\r\nverification of pertinent data. Non-compliance with such requirements shall be\r\nconstrued as a breach of the undertaking.\n8. Where undertakings are accepted from\r\ncertain exporters during the course of an investigation, they shall, for the\r\npurpose of Articles 18, 19, 20 and 22, be deemed to take effect from the date\r\non which the investigation is concluded for the country of origin and/or export.\n\u00e81 9. In the case of breach or withdrawal of\r\nundertakings by any party to the undertaking, or in the case of withdrawal of\r\nacceptance of the undertaking by the Commission, the acceptance of the\r\nundertaking shall be withdrawn by the Commission, as appropriate, and the\r\nprovisional duty which has been imposed by the Commission in accordance with\r\nArticle 12 or the definitive duty which has been imposed in accordance with\r\nArticle 15(1) shall apply, provided that the exporter concerned, or the country\r\nof origin and/or export has, except in the case of withdrawal of the\r\nundertaking by the exporter or such country, been given an opportunity to\r\ncomment. The Commission shall provide information to the Member States when it\r\ndecides to withdraw an undertaking. \u00e7\nAny interested party or Member State may submit information, showing prima facie evidence of a breach of an\r\nundertaking. The subsequent assessment of whether or not a breach of an\r\nundertaking has occurred shall normally be concluded within six months, but in\r\nno case later than nine months following a duly substantiated request.\nThe Commission may request the assistance\r\nof the competent authorities of the Member States in the monitoring of\r\nundertakings.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(4)\n10. A provisional duty may be imposed in\r\naccordance with Article 12 on the basis of the best information available,\r\nwhere there is reason to believe that an undertaking is being breached, or in\r\nthe case of breach or withdrawal of an undertaking, where the investigation\r\nwhich led to the undertaking has not been concluded.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 14\nTermination without measures\n1. Where the complaint is withdrawn,\r\nproceedings may be terminated unless such termination would not be in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 interest.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(5)\n2. Where protective measures are\r\nunnecessary the investigation or proceedings shall be terminated. The\r\nCommission shall terminate the investigation in accordance with the examination\r\nprocedure referred to in Article 25(3).\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\n\u00e81 37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .18(6)\n3. There shall be immediate termination of\r\nthe proceedings where it is determined that the amount of countervailable\r\nsubsidies is de minimis, in accordance with paragraph 5, or where the\r\nvolume of subsidised imports, actual or potential, or the injury, is\r\nnegligible.\n4. For proceedings initiated pursuant to\r\nArticle 10(11), injury shall normally be regarded as negligible where the\r\nmarket share of the imports is less than the amounts set out in Article 10(9).\r\nWith regard to investigations concerning imports from developing countries, the\r\nvolume of subsidised imports shall also be considered negligible if it\r\nrepresents less than 4 % of the total imports of the like product in\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , unless\r\nimports from developing countries whose individual shares of total imports\r\nrepresent less than 4 % collectively account for more than 9 %\r\nof the total imports of the like product in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\n5. The amount of the countervailable\r\nsubsidies shall be considered to be de minimis if such amount is less\r\nthan 1 % ad valorem, except where, as regards investigations\r\nconcerning imports from developing countries, the de minimis threshold\r\nshall be 2 % ad valorem, provided that it is only the investigation\r\nthat shall be terminated where the amount of the countervailable subsidies is\r\nbelow the relevant de minimis level for individual exporters, which\r\nshall remain subject to the proceedings and may be reinvestigated in any\r\nsubsequent review carried out for the country concerned pursuant to Articles 18\r\nand 19.\nArticle 15\nImposition of definitive duties\n\u00e81 1. Where the facts as finally established show the\r\nexistence of countervailable subsidies and injury caused thereby, and the Union\r\ninterest calls for intervention in accordance with Article 31, a definitive\r\ncountervailing duty shall be imposed by the Commission acting in accordance\r\nwith the examination procedure referred to in Article 25(3). Where provisional\r\nduties are in force, the Commission shall initiate \u00d6 that \u00d5 procedure no\r\nlater than one month before the expiry of such duties. \u00e7\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\n\u00e81 37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .18(7)\nNo measures shall be imposed if the subsidy\r\nor subsidies are withdrawn or it has been demonstrated that the subsidies no\r\nlonger confer any benefit on the exporters involved.\nThe amount of the countervailing duty shall\r\nnot exceed the amount of countervailable subsidies established but it should be\r\nless than the total amount of countervailable subsidies if such lesser duty\r\nwould be adequate to remove the injury to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry.\n2. A countervailing duty shall be imposed\r\nin the appropriate amounts in each case, on a non-discriminatory basis, on\r\nimports of a product from all sources found to benefit from countervailable\r\nsubsidies and causing injury, except for imports from those sources from which\r\nundertakings under the terms of this Regulation have been accepted.\nThe Regulation imposing the duty shall\r\nspecify the duty for each supplier, or, if that is impracticable, the supplying\r\ncountry concerned.\n3. When the Commission has limited its \u00d6 investigation \u00d5 in accordance\r\nwith Article 27, any countervailing duty applied to imports from exporters or\r\nproducers which have made themselves known in accordance with Article 27 but\r\nwere not included in the \u00d6 investigation \u00d5 shall not\r\nexceed the weighted average amount of countervailable subsidies established for\r\nthe parties in the sample.\nFor the purpose of this paragraph, the\r\nCommission shall disregard any zero and de minimis amounts of\r\ncountervailable subsidies and amounts of countervailable subsidies established\r\nin the circumstances referred to in Article 28.\nIndividual duties shall be applied to\r\nimports from any exporter or producer for which an individual amount of\r\nsubsidisation has been calculated as provided for in Article 27.\nArticle 16\nRetroactivity\n1. Provisional measures and definitive\r\ncountervailing duties shall only be applied to products which enter free circulation\r\nafter the time when the measure taken pursuant to Article 12(1) or Article\r\n15(1), as the case may be, enters into force, subject to the exceptions set out\r\nin this Regulation.\n\u00e81 2. Where a provisional duty has been applied and\r\nthe facts as finally established show the existence of countervailable\r\nsubsidies and injury, the Commission shall decide, irrespective of whether a\r\ndefinitive countervailing duty is to be imposed, what proportion of the\r\nprovisional duty is to be definitively collected. \u00e7\nFor \u00d6 that \u00d5 purpose,\r\n\u2018injury\u2019 shall not include material delay of the establishment of a \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry, nor\r\nthreat of material injury, except where it is found that this would, in the\r\nabsence of provisional measures, have developed into material injury. In all\r\nother cases involving such threat or delay, any provisional amounts shall be\r\nreleased and definitive duties can only be imposed from the date on which a\r\nfinal determination of threat or material delay is made.\n3. If the definitive countervailing duty is\r\nhigher than the provisional duty, the difference shall not be collected. If the\r\ndefinitive duty is lower than the provisional duty, the duty shall be\r\nrecalculated. Where a final determination is negative, the provisional duty\r\nshall not be confirmed.\n4. A definitive countervailing duty may be\r\nlevied on products which were entered for consumption no more than 90 days\r\nprior to the date of application of provisional measures but not prior to the\r\ninitiation of the investigation, provided that:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the imports have been registered\r\nin accordance with Article 24(5);\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the importers concerned have been\r\ngiven an opportunity to comment by the Commission;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 there are critical circumstances\r\nwhere for the subsidised product in question injury which is difficult to\r\nrepair is caused by massive imports in a relatively short period of a product\r\nbenefiting from countervailable subsidies under the terms of this Regulation;\r\nand\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it is deemed necessary, in order\r\nto preclude the recurrence of such injury, to assess countervailing duties\r\nretroactively on those imports.\n5. In cases of breach or withdrawal of\r\nundertakings, definitive duties may be levied on goods entered for free\r\ncirculation no more than 90 days before the application of provisional\r\nmeasures, provided that the imports have been registered in accordance with\r\nArticle 24(5) and that any such retroactive assessment shall not apply to\r\nimports entered before the breach or withdrawal of the undertaking.\nArticle 17\nDuration\nA countervailing measure shall remain in\r\nforce only as long as, and to the extent that, it is necessary to counteract\r\nthe countervailable subsidies which are causing injury.\nArticle 18\nExpiry reviews\n1. A definitive countervailing measure\r\nshall expire five years from its imposition or five years from the date of the\r\nmost recent review which has covered both subsidisation and injury, unless it\r\nis determined in a review that the expiry would be likely to lead to a continuation\r\nor recurrence of subsidisation and injury. Such an expiry review shall be\r\ninitiated on the initiative of the Commission, or upon a request made by or on\r\nbehalf of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers, and\r\nthe measure shall remain in force pending the outcome of such review.\n2. An expiry review shall be initiated\r\nwhere the request contains sufficient evidence that the expiry of the measures\r\nwould be likely to result in a continuation or recurrence of subsidisation and\r\ninjury. Such a likelihood may, for example, be indicated by evidence of\r\ncontinued subsidisation and injury or evidence that the removal of injury is\r\npartly or solely due to the existence of measures or evidence that the\r\ncircumstances of the exporters, or market conditions, are such that they would\r\nindicate the likelihood of further injurious subsidisation.\n3. In carrying out investigations under\r\nthis Article, the exporters, importers, the country of origin and/or export and\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers shall\r\nbe provided with the opportunity to amplify, rebut or comment on the matters\r\nset out in the review request, and conclusions shall be reached with due\r\naccount taken of all relevant and duly documented evidence presented in\r\nrelation to the question as to whether the expiry of measures would be likely,\r\nor unlikely, to lead to the continuation or recurrence of subsidisation and\r\ninjury.\n4. A notice of impending expiry shall be\r\npublished in the Official Journal of the European Union at an\r\nappropriate time in the final year of the period of application of the measures\r\nas defined in this Article. Thereafter, the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\nshall, no later than three months before the end of the five-year period, be\r\nentitled to lodge a review request in accordance with paragraph 2. A notice\r\nannouncing the actual expiry of measures under this Article shall also be\r\npublished.\nArticle 19\nInterim reviews\n1. The need for the continued imposition of\r\nmeasures may also be reviewed, where warranted, on the initiative of the\r\nCommission or at the request of a Member State or, provided that a reasonable\r\nperiod of time of at least one year has elapsed since the imposition of the\r\ndefinitive measure, upon a request by any exporter, importer or by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers or\r\nthe country of origin and/or export which contains sufficient evidence\r\nsubstantiating the need for such an interim review.\n2. An interim review shall be initiated\r\nwhere the request contains sufficient evidence that the continued imposition of\r\nthe measure is no longer necessary to offset the countervailable subsidy and/or\r\nthat the injury would be unlikely to continue or recur if the measure were\r\nremoved or varied, or that the existing measure is not, or is no longer,\r\nsufficient to counteract the countervailable subsidy which is causing injury.\n3. Where the countervailing duties imposed\r\nare less than the amount of countervailable subsidies found, an interim review\r\nmay be initiated if the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers or\r\nany other interested party submit, normally within two years from the entry\r\ninto force of the measures, sufficient evidence that, after the original\r\ninvestigation period and prior to or following the imposition of measures,\r\nexport prices have decreased or that there has been no movement, or\r\ninsufficient movement of resale prices of the imported product in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 . If the\r\ninvestigation proves the allegations to be correct, countervailing duties may\r\nbe increased to achieve the price increase required to remove injury. However,\r\nthe increased duty level shall not exceed the amount of the countervailable\r\nsubsidies.\nThe interim review may also be initiated,\r\nunder the conditions set out above, at the initiative of the Commission or at\r\nthe request of a Member State.\n4. In carrying out investigations pursuant\r\nto this Article, the Commission may, inter alia, consider whether the\r\ncircumstances with regard to subsidisation and injury have changed\r\nsignificantly, or whether existing measures are achieving the intended results\r\nin removing the injury previously determined under Article 8. In \u00d6 those \u00d5 respects,\r\naccount shall be taken in the final determination of all relevant and duly\r\ndocumented evidence.\nArticle 20\nAccelerated reviews\nAny exporter whose exports are subject to a\r\ndefinitive countervailing duty but which was not individually investigated\r\nduring the original investigation for reasons other than a refusal to cooperate\r\nwith the Commission, shall be entitled, upon request, to an accelerated review\r\nin order that the Commission may promptly establish an individual\r\ncountervailing duty rate for that exporter.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(8)\nSuch a review shall be initiated after\r\nUnion producers have been given an opportunity to comment.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\n\u00e81 37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .18(9)\nArticle 21\nRefunds\n1. Notwithstanding Article 18, an importer\r\nmay request reimbursement of duties collected where it is shown that the amount\r\nof countervailable subsidies, on the basis of which duties were paid, has been\r\neither eliminated or reduced to a level which is below the level of the duty in\r\nforce.\n2. In requesting a refund of countervailing\r\nduties, the importer shall submit an application to the Commission. The\r\napplication shall be submitted via the Member State in the territory of which\r\nthe products were released for free circulation, within six months of the date\r\non which the amount of the definitive duties to be levied was duly determined\r\nby the competent authorities or of the date on which a decision was made\r\ndefinitively to collect the amounts secured by way of provisional duty. Member\r\nStates shall forward the request to the Commission forthwith.\n3. An application for refund shall be\r\nconsidered to be duly supported by evidence only where it contains precise\r\ninformation on the amount of refund of countervailing duties claimed and all\r\ncustoms documentation relating to the calculation and payment of such amount.\r\nIt shall also include evidence, for a representative period, of the amount of\r\ncountervailable subsidies for the exporter or producer to which the duty\r\napplies. In cases where the importer is not associated with the exporter or\r\nproducer concerned and such information is not immediately available, or where\r\nthe exporter or producer is unwilling to release it to the importer, the\r\napplication shall contain a statement from the exporter or producer that the\r\namount of countervailable subsidies has been reduced or eliminated, as\r\nspecified in this Article, and that the relevant supporting evidence will be\r\nprovided to the Commission. Where such evidence is not forthcoming from the\r\nexporter or producer within a reasonable period of time the application shall\r\nbe rejected.\n\u00e81 4. The Commission shall decide whether and to what\r\nextent the application should be granted, or it may decide at any time to\r\ninitiate an interim review, whereupon the information and findings from such\r\nreview, carried out in accordance with the provisions applicable for such\r\nreviews, shall be used to determine whether and to what extent a refund is\r\njustified. \u00e7\nRefunds of duties shall normally take place\r\nwithin 12 months and in no circumstances more than 18 months after the date on\r\nwhich a request for a refund, duly supported by evidence, has been made by an\r\nimporter of the product subject to the countervailing duty.\nThe payment of any refund authorised should\r\nnormally be made by Member States within 90 days of the decision referred\r\nto in the first subparagraph.\nArticle 22\nGeneral provisions on reviews and\r\nrefunds\n1. The relevant provisions of this\r\nRegulation with regard to procedures and the conduct of investigations,\r\nexcluding those relating to time limits, shall apply to any review carried out\r\npursuant to Articles 18, 19 and 20.\nReviews carried out pursuant to Articles 18\r\nand 19 shall be carried out expeditiously and shall normally be concluded\r\nwithin 12 months of the date of initiation of the review. In any event, reviews\r\npursuant to Articles 18 and 19 shall in all cases be concluded within 15 months\r\nof initiation.\nReviews pursuant to Article 20 shall in all\r\ncases be concluded within nine months of the date of initiation.\nIf a review carried out pursuant to Article\r\n18 is initiated while a review under Article 19 is ongoing in the same\r\nproceedings, the review pursuant to Article 19 shall be concluded at the same\r\ntime as foreseen above for the review pursuant to Article 18.\nIf the investigation is not completed within\r\nthe deadlines \u00d6 specified\r\nin the second, third and fourth subpargaraphs \u00d5, the measures\r\nshall:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 expire in investigations pursuant\r\nto Article 18;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 expire in the case of\r\ninvestigations carried out pursuant to Articles 18 and 19 in parallel, where\r\neither the investigation pursuant to Article 18 was initiated while a review\r\nunder Article 19 was ongoing in the same proceedings or where such reviews were\r\ninitiated at the same time; or\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 remain unchanged in\r\ninvestigations pursuant to Articles 19 and 20.\nA notice announcing the actual expiry or\r\nmaintenance of the measures pursuant to this paragraph shall be published in\r\nthe Official Journal of the European Union.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(10)\n2. Reviews pursuant to Articles 18, 19 and\r\n20 shall be initiated by the Commission. The Commission shall decide whether or\r\nnot to initiate reviews pursuant to Article 18 in accordance with the advisory\r\nprocedure referred to in Article 25(2). The Commission shall also provide\r\ninformation to the Member States once an operator or a Member State has submitted a request justifying the initiation of a review pursuant to Articles 19 and\r\n20 and the Commission has completed its analysis thereof, or once the\r\nCommission has itself determined that the need for the continued imposition of\r\nmeasures should be reviewed.\n3. Where warranted by reviews, measures\r\nshall, in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\r\n25(3), be repealed or maintained pursuant to Article 18, or repealed,\r\nmaintained or amended pursuant to Articles 19 and 20.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\n4. Where measures are repealed for\r\nindividual exporters, but not for the country as a whole, such exporters shall\r\nremain subject to the proceedings and may be reinvestigated in any subsequent\r\nreview carried out for that country pursuant to this Article.\n5. Where a review of measures pursuant to\r\nArticle 19 is in progress at the end of the period of application of measures\r\nas defined in Article 18, the measures shall also be investigated under the\r\nprovisions of Article 18.\n6. In all review or refund investigations\r\ncarried out pursuant to Articles 18 to 21, the Commission shall, provided that\r\ncircumstances have not changed, apply the same methodology as in the\r\ninvestigation which led to the duty, with due account being taken of Articles\r\n5, 6, 7 and 27.\nArticle 23\nCircumvention\n1. Countervailing duties imposed pursuant\r\nto this Regulation may be extended to imports from third countries of the like\r\nproduct, whether slightly modified or not, or to imports of the slightly\r\nmodified like product from the country subject to measures, or parts thereof,\r\nwhen circumvention of the measures in force is taking place.\n2. Countervailing duties not exceeding the\r\nresidual countervailing duty imposed in accordance with Article 15(2) may be\r\nextended to imports from companies benefiting from individual duties in the\r\ncountries subject to measures when circumvention of the measures in force is\r\ntaking place.\n3. Circumvention shall be defined as a\r\nchange in the pattern of trade between third countries and the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or between\r\nindividual companies in the country subject to measures and the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , which stems\r\nfrom a practice, process or work for which there is insufficient due cause or\r\neconomic justification other than the imposition of the duty, and where there\r\nis evidence of injury or that the remedial effects of the duty are being\r\nundermined in terms of the prices and/or quantities of the like product and\r\nthat the imported like product and/or parts thereof still benefit from the\r\nsubsidy.\nThe practice, process or work referred to\r\nin the first subparagraph includes, inter alia:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the slight modification of the\r\nproduct concerned to make it fall under customs codes which are normally not\r\nsubject to the measures, provided that the modification does not alter its\r\nessential characteristics;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the consignment of the product\r\nsubject to measures via third countries; \n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the reorganisation by exporters\r\nor producers of their patterns and channels of sales in the country subject to\r\nmeasures in order to eventually have their products exported to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 through\r\nproducers benefiting from an individual duty rate lower than that applicable to\r\nthe products of the manufacturers.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(11) (adapted)\n4. Investigations shall be initiated\r\npursuant to this Article on the initiative of the Commission or at the request\r\nof a Member State or of any interested party on the basis of sufficient\r\nevidence regarding the factors set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. Initiations\r\nshall be made by Commission Regulation which may also instruct customs\r\nauthorities to \u00d6 subject \u00d5 imports to\r\nregistration in accordance with Article 24(5) or to request guarantees. The\r\nCommission shall provide information to the Member States once an interested\r\nparty or a Member State has submitted a request justifying the initiation of an\r\ninvestigation and the Commission has completed its analysis thereof, or where\r\nthe Commission has itself determined that there is a need to initiate an\r\ninvestigation.\nInvestigations shall be carried out by the\r\nCommission. The Commission may be assisted by customs authorities and the\r\ninvestigations shall be concluded within nine months.\n\u00d6 Where \u00d5 the facts as\r\nfinally ascertained justify the extension of measures, this shall be done by\r\nthe Commission acting in accordance with the examination procedure referred to\r\nin Article 25(3).\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\nThe extension shall take effect from the\r\ndate on which registration was imposed pursuant to Article 24(5) or on which\r\nguarantees were requested. The relevant procedural provisions of this\r\nRegulation with regard to \u00d6 the \u00d5 initiation and\r\nthe conduct of investigations shall apply pursuant to this Article.\n5. Imports shall not be subject to\r\nregistration pursuant to Article 24(5) or measures where they are traded by\r\ncompanies which benefit from exemptions.\n6. Requests for exemptions duly supported\r\nby evidence shall be submitted within the time limits established in the\r\nCommission Regulation initiating the investigation.\nWhere the circumventing practice, process\r\nor work takes place outside the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , exemptions\r\nmay be granted to producers of the product concerned that can show that they\r\nare not related to any producer subject to the measures and that are found not\r\nto be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in paragraph 3.\nWhere the circumventing practice, process\r\nor work takes place inside the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , exemptions\r\nmay be granted to importers that can show that they are not related to\r\nproducers subject to the measures.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(11) (adapted)\n\u00d6 Those \u00d5 exemptions \u00d6 shall\r\nbe \u00d5 granted by\r\ndecision of the Commission and shall remain valid for the period and under the\r\nconditions set down therein. The Commission shall provide information to the\r\nMember States once it has concluded its analysis.\n\u00ea 597/2009\nProvided that the conditions set in Article\r\n20 are met, exemptions may also be granted after the conclusion of the\r\ninvestigation leading to the extension of the measures.\n7. Provided that at least one year has\r\nlapsed from the extension of the measures, and in case the number of parties\r\nrequesting or potentially requesting an exemption is significant, the\r\nCommission may decide to initiate a review of the extension of the measures.\r\nAny such review shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Article\r\n22(1) as applicable to reviews under Article 19.\n8. Nothing in this Article shall preclude\r\nthe normal application of the provisions in force concerning customs duties.\nArticle 24\nGeneral provisions\n1. Provisional or definitive countervailing\r\nduties shall be imposed by Regulation, and collected by Member States in the\r\nform, at the rate specified and according to the other criteria laid down in\r\nthe Regulation imposing such duties. Such duties shall also be collected\r\nindependently of the customs duties, taxes and other charges normally imposed\r\non imports.\nNo product shall be subject to both\r\nanti-dumping and countervailing duties for the purpose of dealing with one and\r\nthe same situation arising from dumping or from export subsidisation.\n2. Regulations imposing provisional or\r\ndefinitive countervailing duties, and Regulations or Decisions accepting\r\nundertakings or terminating investigations or proceedings, shall be published\r\nin the Official Journal of the European Union.\nSuch Regulations or Decisions shall contain\r\nin particular, and with due regard to the protection of confidential information,\r\nthe names of the exporters, if possible, or of the countries involved, a\r\ndescription of the product and a summary of the facts and considerations\r\nrelevant to the subsidy and injury determinations. In each case, a copy of the\r\nRegulation or Decision shall be sent to known interested parties. The\r\nprovisions of this paragraph shall apply mutatis mutandis to reviews.\n3. Special provisions, in particular with\r\nregard to the common definition of the concept of origin, as contained in\r\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92[9],\r\nmay be adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(12)\n4. In the Union interest, measures imposed\r\npursuant to this Regulation may be suspended by a decision of the Commission in\r\naccordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 25(2) for a\r\nperiod of nine months. The suspension may be extended for a further period, not\r\nexceeding one year, by the Commission acting in accordance with the advisory\r\nprocedure referred to in Article 25(2).\nMeasures may only be suspended where market\r\nconditions have temporarily changed to an extent that injury would be unlikely\r\nto resume as a result of the suspension, and provided that the Union industry\r\nhas been given an opportunity to comment and those comments have been taken\r\ninto account. Measures may at any time be reinstated in accordance with the\r\nadvisory procedure referred to in Article 25(2) if the reason for suspension is\r\nno longer applicable.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\n\u00e81 37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .18(12)\n\u00e81 5. The Commission may, after having informed the\r\nMember States in due time, direct the customs authorities to take the\r\nappropriate steps to register imports, so that measures may subsequently be\r\napplied against those imports from the date of such registration. \u00e7\nImports may be made subject to registration\r\nfollowing a request from the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry which\r\ncontains sufficient evidence to justify such action.\nRegistration shall be introduced by\r\nRegulation which shall specify the purpose of the action and, if appropriate,\r\nthe estimated amount of possible future liability. Imports shall not be made\r\nsubject to registration for a period longer than nine months.\n6. Member States shall report to the\r\nCommission every month on the import trade of products subject to investigation\r\nand to measures, and on the amount of duties collected pursuant to this\r\nRegulation.\n7. Without prejudice to paragraph 6, the\r\nCommission may request Member States, on a case-by-case basis, to supply\r\ninformation necessary to monitor efficiently the application of measures. In\r\nthis respect, the provisions of Articles 11(3) and (4) shall apply. Any data\r\nsubmitted by Member States pursuant to this Article shall be covered by the\r\nprovisions of Article 29(6).\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(13) (adapted)\nArticle 25\nCommittee\r\nprocedure\n1. The Commission shall be assisted by the\r\nCommittee established by [Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009[10]]. That Committee shall\r\nbe a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n2. Where reference is made to this\r\nparagraph, Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\n3. Where reference is made to this\r\nparagraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\n4. Where reference is made to this\r\nparagraph, Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, in conjunction with\r\nArticle 4 thereof, shall apply.\n5. Pursuant to Article 3(5) of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 182/2011, where the written procedure \u00d6 is used\r\nto \u00d5 adopt\r\ndefinitive measures pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article, or \u00d6 to\r\ndecide \u00d5 on the\r\ninitiation or non-initiation of expiry reviews pursuant to Article 18 of this\r\nRegulation, such procedure shall be terminated without result where, within the\r\ntime limit set down by the chair, the chair so decides or a majority of\r\ncommittee members as defined in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 182/2011 so request. Where the written procedure \u00d6 is used \u00d5 in other\r\ninstances where there has been a discussion of the draft measure in the\r\ncommittee, that procedure shall be terminated without result where, within the\r\ntime limit set down by the chair, the chair so decides or a simple majority of\r\ncommittee members so request. Where the written procedure \u00d6 is\r\nused \u00d5 in other\r\ninstances where there has not been a discussion of the draft measure in the\r\ncommittee, that procedure shall be terminated without result where, within the\r\ntime limit set down by the chair, the chair so decides or at least a quarter of\r\ncommittee members so request.\n6. The committee may consider any matter\r\nrelating to the application of this Regulation, raised by the Commission or at\r\nthe request of a Member State. Member States may request information and may\r\nexchange views in the committee or directly with the Commission.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 26\nVerification visits\n1. The Commission shall, where it considers\r\nit appropriate, carry out visits to examine the records of importers,\r\nexporters, traders, agents, producers, trade associations and organisations, to\r\nverify information provided on subsidisation and injury. In the absence of a\r\nproper and timely reply a verification visit may not be carried out.\n2. The Commission may carry out\r\ninvestigations in third countries as required, provided that it obtains the\r\nagreement of the firms concerned, that it notifies the country in question and\r\nthat the latter does not object to the investigation. As soon as the agreement\r\nof the firms concerned has been obtained the Commission \u00d6 shall \u00d5 notify the\r\ncountry of origin and/or export of the names and addresses of the firms to be\r\nvisited and the dates agreed.\n3. The firms concerned shall be advised of\r\nthe nature of the information to be verified during verification visits and of\r\nany further information which needs to be provided during such visits, though\r\nthis should not preclude requests made during the verification for further\r\ndetails to be provided in the light of information obtained.\n4. In investigations carried out pursuant\r\nto paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the Commission shall be assisted by officials of\r\nthose Member States which so request.\nArticle 27\nSampling\n1. In cases where the number of\r\ncomplainants, exporters or importers, types of product or transactions is\r\nlarge, the investigation may be limited to:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a reasonable number of parties,\r\nproducts or transactions by using samples which are statistically valid on the\r\nbasis of information available at the time of the selection; or\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the largest representative volume\r\nof the production, sales or exports which can reasonably be investigated within\r\nthe time available.\n2. The \u00d6 final \u00d5 selection of parties,\r\ntypes of products or transactions made under this Article shall rest with the\r\nCommission, though preference shall be given to choosing a sample in\r\nconsultation with, and with the consent of, the parties concerned, provided\r\nthat such parties make themselves known and make sufficient information\r\navailable, within three weeks of initiation of the investigation, to enable a\r\nrepresentative sample to be chosen.\n3. In cases where the \u00d6 investigation \u00d5 has been\r\nlimited in accordance with this Article, an individual amount of\r\ncountervailable subsidisation shall be calculated for any exporter or producer\r\nnot initially selected who submits the necessary information within the time\r\nlimits provided for in this Regulation, except where the number of exporters or\r\nproducers is so large that individual examinations would be unduly burdensome\r\nand would prevent completion of the \u00d6 investigation \u00d5 in good time.\n4. Where it is decided to sample and there\r\nis a degree of non-cooperation by some or all of the parties selected which is\r\nlikely to materially affect the outcome of the investigation, a new sample may\r\nbe selected.\nHowever, if a material degree of\r\nnon-cooperation persists or there is insufficient time to select a new sample,\r\nthe relevant provisions of Article 28 shall apply.\nArticle 28\nNon-cooperation\n1. In cases in which any interested party\r\nrefuses access to, or otherwise does not provide necessary information within\r\nthe time limits provided in this Regulation, or significantly impedes the\r\ninvestigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be\r\nmade on the basis of the facts available.\nWhere it is found that any interested party\r\nhas supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be\r\ndisregarded and use may be made of the facts available.\nInterested parties should be made aware of\r\nthe consequences of non-cooperation.\n2. Failure to give a computerised response\r\nshall not be deemed to constitute non-cooperation, provided that the interested\r\nparty shows that presenting the response as requested would result in an\r\nunreasonable extra burden or unreasonable additional cost.\n3. Where the information submitted by an\r\ninterested party is not ideal in all respects it should nevertheless not be\r\ndisregarded, provided that any deficiencies are not such as to cause undue\r\ndifficulty in arriving at a reasonably accurate finding and that the\r\ninformation is appropriately submitted in good time and is verifiable, and that\r\nthe party has acted to the best of its ability.\n4. If evidence or information is not\r\naccepted, the supplying party shall be informed forthwith of the reasons\r\ntherefor and shall be granted an opportunity to provide further explanations\r\nwithin the time limit specified. If the explanations are considered\r\nunsatisfactory, the reasons for rejection of such evidence or information shall\r\nbe disclosed and given in published findings.\n5. If determinations, including those\r\nregarding the amount of countervailable subsidies, are based on the provisions\r\nof paragraph 1, including the information supplied in the complaint, it shall,\r\nwhere practicable and with due regard to the time limits of the investigation,\r\nbe checked by reference to information from other independent sources which may\r\nbe available, such as published price lists, official import statistics and\r\ncustoms returns, or information obtained from other interested parties during\r\nthe investigation.\nSuch information may include relevant data\r\npertaining to the world market or other representative markets, where\r\nappropriate.\n6. If an interested party does not\r\ncooperate, or cooperates only partially, so that relevant information is\r\nthereby withheld, the result may be less favourable to the party than if it had\r\ncooperated.\nArticle 29\nConfidentiality\n1. Any information which is by nature\r\nconfidential (for example, because its disclosure would be of significant\r\ncompetitive advantage to a competitor or would have a significantly adverse\r\neffect upon a person supplying the information or upon a person from whom he\r\nhas acquired the information), or which is provided on a confidential basis by\r\nparties to an investigation shall, if good cause is shown, be treated as such\r\nby the authorities.\n2. Interested parties providing\r\nconfidential information shall be required to \u00d6 provide \u00d5\r\nnon-confidential summaries thereof. Those summaries shall be in sufficient\r\ndetail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information\r\nsubmitted in confidence. In exceptional circumstances, such parties may\r\nindicate that such information is not susceptible of summary. In such\r\nexceptional circumstances, a statement of the reasons why summarisation is not\r\npossible must be provided.\n3. If it is considered that a request for\r\nconfidentiality is not warranted and if the supplier of the information is\r\neither unwilling to make the information available or to authorise its\r\ndisclosure in generalised or summary form, such information may be disregarded\r\nunless it can be satisfactorily demonstrated from appropriate sources that the\r\ninformation is correct. Requests for confidentiality shall not be arbitrarily\r\nrejected.\n4. This Article shall not preclude the\r\ndisclosure of general information by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 authorities,\r\nand in particular of the reasons on which decisions taken pursuant to this\r\nRegulation are based, or disclosure of the evidence relied on by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 authorities in\r\nso far as is necessary to explain those reasons in court proceedings. Such\r\ndisclosure must take into account the legitimate interests of the parties\r\nconcerned that their business or governmental secrets should not be divulged.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(14)\n5. The Commission and the Member States, including the officials of either, shall not reveal any information received\r\npursuant to this Regulation for which confidential treatment has been requested\r\nby its supplier, without specific permission from that supplier. Exchanges of\r\ninformation between the Commission and Member States, or any internal documents\r\nprepared by the authorities of the Union or the Member States, shall not be\r\ndivulged except as specifically provided for in this Regulation.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\n6. Information received pursuant to this\r\nRegulation shall be used only for the purpose for which it was requested.\nThis provision shall not preclude the use\r\nof information received in the context of one investigation for the purpose of\r\ninitiating other investigations within the same proceedings concerning the same\r\nlike product.\nArticle 30\nDisclosure\n1. The complainants, importers and\r\nexporters and their representative associations, and the country of origin\r\nand/or export, may request disclosure of the details underlying the essential\r\nfacts and considerations on the basis of which provisional measures have been\r\nimposed. Requests for such disclosure shall be made in writing immediately\r\nfollowing the imposition of provisional measures, and the disclosure shall be\r\nmade in writing as soon as possible thereafter.\n2. The parties mentioned in paragraph 1 may\r\nrequest final disclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis\r\nof which it is intended to recommend the imposition of definitive measures, or\r\nthe termination of an investigation or proceedings without the imposition of\r\nmeasures, particular attention being paid to the disclosure of any facts or\r\nconsiderations which are different from those used for any provisional\r\nmeasures.\n3. Requests for final disclosure shall be\r\naddressed to the Commission in writing and be received, in cases where a\r\nprovisional duty has been \u00d6 imposed \u00d5 , no later\r\nthan one month after publication of the imposition of that duty. Where a\r\nprovisional duty has not been imposed, parties shall be provided with an\r\nopportunity to request final disclosure within time limits set by the\r\nCommission.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(15)\n4. Final disclosure shall be given in\r\nwriting. It shall be made, due regard being had to the protection of\r\nconfidential information, as soon as possible and, normally, no later than one\r\nmonth prior to the initiation of the procedures set out in Article 14 or\r\nArticle 15. Where the Commission is not in a position to disclose certain facts\r\nor considerations at that time, they shall be disclosed as soon as possible\r\nthereafter.\nDisclosure shall not prejudice any\r\nsubsequent decision which may be taken by the Commission, but where such a\r\ndecision is based on any different facts and considerations they shall be\r\ndisclosed as soon as possible.\n5. Representations made after final\r\ndisclosure is given shall be taken into consideration only if received within a\r\nperiod to be set by the Commission in each case, which shall be at least\r\n10 days, due consideration being given to the urgency of the matter. A\r\nshorter period may be set whenever an additional final disclosure has to be\r\nmade.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 31\n\u00a0\u00d6 Union \u00d5 interest\n1. A determination as to whether the \u00d6 Union\u2019s \u00d5 interest calls\r\nfor intervention should be based on an appraisal of all the various interests\r\ntaken as a whole, including the interests of the domestic industry and users\r\nand consumers. A determination pursuant to this Article shall be made only\r\nwhere all parties have been given the opportunity to make their views known\r\npursuant to paragraph 2. In such an examination, the need to eliminate the\r\ntrade-distorting effects of injurious subsidisation and to restore effective\r\ncompetition shall be given special consideration. Measures, as determined on\r\nthe basis of subsidisation and injury found, may not be applied where the\r\nauthorities, on the basis of all the information submitted, can clearly\r\nconclude that it is not in the \u00d6 Union\u2019s \u00d5 interest to\r\napply such measures.\n2. In order to provide a sound basis on\r\nwhich the authorities can take account of all views and information in the\r\ndecision as to whether or not the imposition of measures is in the \u00d6 Union\u2019s \u00d5 interest, the\r\ncomplainants, importers and their representative associations, representative\r\nusers and representative consumer organisations may, within the time limits\r\nspecified in the notice of initiation of the countervailing duty investigation,\r\nmake themselves known and provide information to the Commission. Such\r\ninformation, or appropriate summaries thereof, shall be made available to the\r\nother parties specified in this paragraph, and they shall be entitled to respond\r\nto such information.\n3. The parties which have acted in \u00d6 accordance \u00d5 with paragraph\r\n2 may request a hearing. Such requests shall be granted when they are submitted\r\nwithin the time limits set in paragraph 2, and when they set out the\r\nreasons, in terms of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 interest, why\r\nthe parties should be heard.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .18(16) (adapted)\n4. The parties which have acted in \u00d6 accordance \u00d5 with paragraph\r\n2 may provide comments on the application of any provisional duties. Such\r\ncomments shall be received within 25 days of the date of application of such\r\nmeasures if they are to be taken into account and they, or appropriate\r\nsummaries thereof, shall be made available to other parties who shall be\r\nentitled to respond to such comments.\n5. The Commission shall examine the\r\ninformation which is properly submitted and the extent to which it is\r\nrepresentative, and the results of such analysis, together with an opinion on\r\nits merits, shall be transmitted to the committee as part of the draft measure\r\nsubmitted pursuant to Articles 14 and 15. The views expressed in the committee\r\nshould be taken into account by the Commission under the conditions provided\r\nfor in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n\u00ea 597/2009\r\n(adapted)\n\u00e81 37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .18(16)\n6. The parties which have acted in\r\nconformity with paragraph 2 may request that the facts and considerations on\r\nwhich final decisions are likely to be taken be made available to them. \u00e81 Such information shall be made available to the\r\nextent possible and without prejudice to any subsequent decision taken by the\r\nCommission. \u00e7\n7. Information shall be taken into account\r\nonly where it is supported by actual evidence which substantiates its validity.\nArticle 32\nRelationships between\r\ncountervailing duty measures and multilateral remedies\nIf an imported product is made subject to\r\nany countermeasures imposed following recourse to the dispute settlement\r\nprocedures of the Subsidies Agreement, and such measures are appropriate to\r\nremove the injury caused by the countervailable subsidies, any countervailing\r\nduty imposed with regard to that product shall immediately be suspended, or\r\nrepealed, as appropriate.\nArticle 33\nFinal provisions\nThis Regulation shall not preclude the\r\napplication of:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 any special rules laid down in\r\nagreements concluded between the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 and third\r\ncountries;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 Regulations in\r\nthe agricultural sector and Council Regulations (EC) No 1667/2006[11], (EC) No 614/2009[12] and (EC) No 1216/2009[13].

Pursuant to\r\npoint (h), indirect tax rebate schemes can constitute an export subsidy to the\r\nextent that they result in exemption, remission or deferral of prior-stage\r\ncumulative indirect taxes in excess of the amount of such taxes actually levied\r\non inputs that are consumed in the production of the exported product. Pursuant\r\nto point (i), drawback schemes can constitute an export subsidy to the\r\nextent that they result in a remission or drawback of import charges in excess\r\nof those actually levied on inputs that are consumed in the production of the\r\nexported product. Both points stipulate that normal allowance for waste must be\r\nmade in findings regarding consumption of inputs in the production of the\r\nexported product. Point (i) also provides for substitution, where appropriate.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In examining whether inputs are\r\nconsumed in the production of the exported product, as part of a countervailing\r\nduty investigation pursuant to this Regulation, the Commission must normally\r\nproceed on the following basis.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where it is alleged that an\r\nindirect tax rebate scheme, or a drawback scheme, conveys a subsidy by reason\r\nof over-rebate or excess drawback of indirect taxes or import charges on inputs\r\nconsumed in the production of the exported product, the Commission must\r\nnormally first determine whether the government of the exporting country has in\r\nplace and applies a system or procedure to confirm which inputs are consumed in\r\nthe production of the exported product and in what amounts. Where such a system\r\nor procedure is determined to be applied, the Commission must normally then\r\nexamine the system or procedure to see whether it is reasonable, effective for\r\nthe purpose intended, and based on generally accepted commercial practices in\r\nthe country of export. The Commission may deem it necessary to carry out, in\r\naccordance with Article 26(2), certain practical tests in order to verify\r\ninformation or to satisfy itself that the system or procedure is being\r\neffectively applied.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where there is no such system or\r\nprocedure, where it is not reasonable, or where it is instituted and considered\r\nreasonable but is found not to be applied or not to be applied effectively, a\r\nfurther examination by the exporting country based on the actual inputs\r\ninvolved will normally need to be carried out in the context of determining\r\nwhether an excess payment occurred. If the Commission deems it necessary, a\r\nfurther examination may be carried out in accordance with point 4.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission must normally treat inputs as physically\r\nincorporated if such inputs are used in the production process and are\r\nphysically present in the product exported. An input need not be present in the\r\nfinal product in the same form in which it entered the production process.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In determining the amount of a\r\nparticular input that is consumed in the production of the exported product, a\r\n\u2018normal allowance for waste\u2019 must normally be taken into account, and such\r\nwaste must normally be treated as consumed in the production of the exported\r\nproduct. The term \u2018waste\u2019 refers to that portion of a given input which does\r\nnot serve an independent function in the production process, is not consumed in\r\nthe production of the exported product (for reasons such as inefficiencies) and\r\nis not recovered, used or sold by the same manufacturer.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission\u2019s determination of\r\nwhether the claimed allowance for waste is \u2018normal\u2019 must normally take into\r\naccount the production process, the average experience of the industry in the\r\ncountry of export, and other technical factors, as appropriate. The Commission\r\nmust bear in mind that an important question is whether the authorities in the\r\nexporting country have reasonably calculated the amount of waste, when such an\r\namount is intended to be included in the tax or duty rebate or remission.\n_____________\nANNEX III\nGUIDELINES IN THE DETERMINATION\r\nOF SUBSTITUTION DRAWBACK SYSTEMS AS EXPORT SUBSIDIES\nI\nDrawback systems can allow for the refund\r\nor drawback of import charges on inputs which are consumed in the production\r\nprocess of another product and where the export of this latter product contains\r\ndomestic inputs having the same quality and characteristics as those submitted\r\nfor the imported inputs. Pursuant to point (i) of Annex I, substitution\r\ndrawback systems can constitute an export subsidy to the extent that they\r\nresult in an excess drawback of the import charges levied initially on the\r\nimported inputs for which drawback is being claimed.\nII\nIn examining any substitution drawback\r\nsystem as part of a countervailing duty investigation pursuant to this\r\nRegulation, the Commission must normally proceed on the following basis:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 point (i) of Annex I stipulates\r\nthat home market inputs may be substituted for imported inputs in the\r\nproduction of a product for export provided such inputs are equal in quantity\r\nto, and have the same quality and characteristics as, the imported inputs being\r\nsubstituted. The existence of a verification system or procedure is important\r\nbecause it enables the government of the exporting country to ensure and\r\ndemonstrate that the quantity of inputs for which drawback is claimed does not\r\nexceed the quantity of similar products exported, in whatever form, and that\r\nthere is no drawback of import charges in excess of those originally levied on\r\nthe imported inputs in question;\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where it is alleged that a\r\nsubstitution drawback system conveys a subsidy, the Commission must normally\r\nfirst proceed to determine whether the government of the exporting country has\r\nin place and applies a verification system or procedure. Where such a system or\r\nprocedure is determined to be applied, the Commission shall normally then\r\nexamine the verification procedures to see whether they are reasonable,\r\neffective for the purpose intended, and based on generally accepted commercial\r\npractices in the country of export. To the extent that the procedures are\r\ndetermined to meet this test and are effectively applied, no subsidy will be\r\npresumed to exist. It may be deemed necessary by the Commission to carry out,\r\nin accordance with Article 26(2), certain practical tests in order to verify\r\ninformation or to satisfy itself that the verification procedures are being\r\neffectively applied;\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where there are no verification\r\nprocedures, where they are not reasonable, or where such procedures are\r\ninstituted and considered reasonable but are found not to be actually applied\r\nor not to be applied effectively, there may be a subsidy. In such cases,\r\nfurther examination by the exporting country based on the actual transactions\r\ninvolved would need to be carried out to determine whether an excess payment\r\noccurred. If the Commission deems it necessary, a further examination may be\r\ncarried out in accordance with point 2;\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the existence of a substitution\r\ndrawback provision under which exporters are allowed to select particular\r\nimport shipments on which drawback is claimed should not of itself be\r\nconsidered to convey a subsidy;\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 an excess drawback of import\r\ncharges within the meaning of point (i) of Annex I would be deemed to exist\r\nwhere governments paid interest on any monies refunded under their drawback\r\nschemes, to the extent of the interest actually paid or payable.\n_____________\nANNEX IV\n(This Annex reproduces Annex 2 to the\r\nAgreement on Agriculture.
