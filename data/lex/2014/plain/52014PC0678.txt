The established provisions of Global Technical Regulation\r\nNo 13 on Hydrogen Safety, as adopted through Council Decision 10157/13[3], are effectively transposed\r\ninto the draft new UNECE Regulation.\nThe present proposal aims at defining the\r\nUnion's position with regard to the draft UNECE Regulation on Hydrogen Safety\r\nconsequently to provide for the Union, represented by the Commission, to vote\r\nin favour of this draft.\nAt EU level, Item 62 of Part I to Annex IV\r\nto Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[4] provides for the\r\napplication of Regulation (EC) No 79/2009 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[5]\r\nconcerning hydrogen safety. At a later stage, measures shall be taken to enable\r\nthe draft UNECE regulation on Hydrogen Safety to be applied within the European\r\nUnion for the type-approval of vehicles equipped with such systems as\r\nequivalent to the current EU Regulation.\n\u00b7                        \r\nGeneral context\nRegulation (EC) No 79/2009 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council lays down detailed rules for the type-approval of\r\nhydrogen fuelled vehicles and their components. It is now envisaged for the\r\nUnion to vote in favour of the related draft new UNECE Regulation on Hydrogen\r\nSafety in order to have common harmonised requirements at international level\r\nwhich will facilitate international trade. This will enable the European vehicle\r\nmanufacturer and supplier industry to follow one set of requirements recognised\r\nworldwide, i.e. in the respective territories of the Contracting Parties to the\r\n\u2018Revised 1958 Agreement\u2019, in order to promote the world-wide application of\r\nthis environmentally friendly technology, by reducing the industry\u2019s burden of\r\ndouble testing and certification according to diverging national or regional\r\nlegislation related to hydrogen fuelled vehicles.\n\u00b7                        \r\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nRegulation (EC) No 79/2009 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council on type-approval of hydrogen-powered motor\r\nvehicles.\nCommission Regulation (EU) No 406/2010 of\r\n26 April 2010 implementing Regulation (EC) No 79/2009 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council on type-approval of hydrogen-powered motor\r\nvehicles[6].\n\u00b7                        \r\nConsistency with the other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThe proposal is in line with the objectives\r\nof the Framework Directive on the approval of motor vehicles and their\r\ntrailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for\r\nsuch vehicles, as well as the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 79/2009 on\r\ntype-approval of hydrogen-powered motor vehicles. The proposal is therefore\r\nconsistent with the EU objective to provide for a high level of road safety concerning\r\nmotor vehicles.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH\r\nTHE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n \u00b7                         Consultation of interested parties \n In developing the proposal the European Commission has consulted stakeholders. There has been general consultation through the UNECE informal working group on Hydrogen Safety under the Working Party on Passive Safety (GRSP) as well as dissemination of information and subsequent discussions in the Technical Committee \u2013 Motor Vehicles during the development of the Global Technical Regulation on Hydrogen Safety and the subsequent draft new UNECE Regulation based on the Global Technical Regulation. \u00b7                         Impact assessment The European Commission had an impact assessment carried out for Regulation (EC) No 79/2009 which encompasses Hydrogen Safety. The provisions as proposed under UNECE are complementary, but have also been analysed through the European Commission\u2019s study on Hydrogen-Powered Vehicles: A Comparison of the European Legislation and the Draft UNECE Global Technical Regulation (Specific Contract No SI2.575155) under Multiple framework contracts for the provision of consultancy services in the automotive sector (ENTR/2009/030). \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \r\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal defines the Union's position\r\nin the voting of the draft new UNECE Regulation concerning the approval of\r\nmotor vehicles and their components with regard to the safety-related\r\nperformance of hydrogen-fuelled vehicles.\n\u00b7                        \r\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis for this proposal is\r\nArticle 114, in conjuntion with Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union.\n\u00b7                        \r\nSubsidiarity principle\nRequirements for motor vehicle hydrogen\r\nsafety are already harmonised at Union level. The new provisions will be complementary\r\nin nature. The vote in favour of international instruments like draft UNECE regulations\r\nand their incorporation into the Union system for the type-approval of systems\r\nused in motor vehicles can only be done by the Union. This does not only\r\nprevent fragmentation of the Internal Market, but also ensures an equal level\r\nof safety standards across the Union. It also offers advantages of economies of\r\nscale: products can be made for the whole European market and even the\r\ninternational market, instead of being customised to obtain national\r\ntype-approval for every single Member State.\nThe proposal therefore complies with the\r\nsubsidiarity principle.\n\u00b7                        \r\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle as it does not go beyond what is necessary in order\r\nto achieve the objectives of ensuring the proper functioning of the Internal\r\nMarket while at the same time providing for a high level of public safety and\r\nprotection.\n\u00b7                        \r\nChoice of instruments\nThe use of a Council Decision is required\r\nby Article 218(9) TFEU in order to establish the position to be adopted on the\r\nUnion's behalf in a body set up by an international agreement.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nUnion budget.\n2014/0313 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be adopted on\r\nthe Union's behalf in the Administrative Committee of the United Nations\r\nEconomic Commission for Europe on the draft new Regulation on hydrogen and fuel\r\ncell vehicles\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114, in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean

reciprocal recognition of approvals\r\ngranted on the basis of these prescriptions (\u2018Revised 1958 Agreement\u2019).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The standardised\r\nrequirements of the draft new UNECE Regulation on uniform provisions concerning\r\nthe approval of motor vehicles and their components with regard to the\r\nsafety-related performance of hydrogen-fuelled vehicles[8] are intended to remove\r\ntechnical barriers to the trade in motor vehicles and their components between\r\nthe Contracting Parties to the \u2018Revised 1958 Agreement\u2019 and to ensure that such\r\nvehicles and components offer a high level of safety and protection.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to establish\r\nthe position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s
