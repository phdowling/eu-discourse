In order to extend the scope of this\r\nRegulation to the Lithuanian litas, a reference to this currency needs to be\r\nadded to this Regulation. This is the object of this proposal.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Results of Consultations\r\nwith the interested parties and impact assessement\nThe formal procedure following the Commission\r\nproposal for a Council Regulation involves consultation of the ECB. Discussions\r\nwith Member States on economic policy challenges in Member States are held\r\nunder various headings on a regular basis in the Economic and Financial\r\nCommittee, ECOFIN and Eurogroup. These include informal discussions on issues\r\nspecifically relevant to the preparation of eventual euro area entry (incl.\r\nexchange rate policies). Dialogue with academics and other interested groups\r\ntakes place in the context of conferences/seminars and on an ad-hoc basis.\nEconomic developments in the euro area and the\r\nMember States are assessed in the framework of the various procedures of\r\neconomic policy co-ordination and surveillance (notably under Article 121 of\r\nthe Treaty), as well as in the context of the Commission\u2019s regular monitoring\r\nand analysis of country-specific and area-wide developments (incl. forecasts,\r\nregular publication series, input to EFC,\u00a0 ECOFIN and Eurogroup). In accordance\r\nwith the proportionality principle and in line with past practice, no formal\r\nimpact assessment is considered necessary.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal elements of the\r\nproposal\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nLegal basis for the present proposal is Article\r\n140(3) of the Treaty, according to which the Council shall adopt the conversion\r\nrate at which the euro shall be substituted for the currency of the Member\r\nState the derogation of which has been abrogated under Article 140(2) of the\r\nTreaty.\nThe Council shall act with the unanimity of the\r\nMember States whose currency is the euro and the Member State concerned on a\r\nproposal from the Commission and after consulting the ECB.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\nThe present initiative does not go beyond what\r\nis necessary to achieve its objective and, therefore, complies with the\r\nproportionality principle.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of the legal\r\ninstrument\nThe Regulation instrument is the only\r\nappropriate legal instrument to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 2866/98 on the\r\nconversion rates between the euro and the currencies of the Member States\r\nadopting the euro.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary implications\nThe proposal has no implications for the budget\r\nof the Union.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commentary on individual\r\narticles\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 1\nThe proposed rate is the present central rate\r\nof the Lithuanian litas in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II). \nAs for the other currencies and in accordance\r\nwith Council Regulation (EC) No 1103/97[2]\r\non certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro, the rate is\r\ndetermined with six significant figures.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 2\nThis Article sets the date of entry into force\r\nof the Regulation at 1 January 2015, ensuring that it will be applicable\r\nin conformity with the timing of the other Council acts relating to the\r\nadoption of the euro by Lithuania, i.e. the date of the abrogation of the\r\nderogation and the date of entry into force of the other measures necessary for\r\nthe introduction of the euro in Lithuania.\n2014/208 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EC) No 2866/98 as\r\nregards the conversion rate to the euro for Lithuania\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 140(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\r\nCommission[3],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Central Bank[4],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n2866/98[5]\r\ndetermines the conversion rates to the euro as from 1 January 1999.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article 4 of\r\nthe 2003 Act of Accession, Lithuania is a Member State with a derogation as\r\ndefined in Article 139(1) of the Treaty. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Council\r\nDecision 2014/.../EU of \u2026[6],\r\nLithuania fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro and the\r\nderogation of Lithuania is abrogated with effect from 1 January 2015.\n\u00a0(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The introduction of the\r\neuro in Lithuania requires the adoption of the conversion rate between the euro\r\nand the Lithuanian litas.
