Political context\nThe European Police College (CEPOL), established as an EU agency in\r\n2005 by Council Decision 2005/681/JHA[1],\r\nis entrusted with activities related to the training of senior law enforcement\r\nofficers. It aims to facilitate cooperation between national police forces by\r\norganising courses with a European policing dimension. It also defines common\r\ncurricula on specific topics, disseminates relevant research and best practice,\r\ncoordinates an exchange programme for senior police officers and trainers, and,\r\nfor specific projects, may act as a partner of the beneficiaries of EU grants.\r\nIts seat was transferred from Bramshill, United Kingdom to Budapest, Hungary, by Regulation (EU) No 543/2014 of 15 May 2014 amending Council Decision 2005/681/JHA, which\r\nhas entered into force on 29 May 2014.\nOn 27 March 2013 the Commission made a proposal for a Regulation\r\nupdating the legal framework of the European Police Office (Europol)[2]. As regards CEPOL and training of law enforcement officers, that\r\nproposal pursued three aims. First, it proposed to merge CEPOL with Europol to\r\ncreate synergies between operational law enforcement work and training\r\nactivities, and to make administrative savings which would be invested in\r\ntraining. Second, it sought to strengthen the merged agency\u2019s ability to\r\nsupport law enforcement training in the EU by giving it the necessary powers to\r\nimplement the European Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS) published by the\r\nCommission at the same time as the proposal for a new Europol regulation[3]. Third, it sought to align the rules on governance of Europol with\r\nthe Common Approach on EU decentralised Agencies, endorsed by the European\r\nParliament, Council and Commission in July 2012.\nThe\r\nEuropean Parliament and the Council did not agree to the proposed merger of\r\nCEPOL with Europol. Instead, a regulation (proposed by Member States pursuant\r\nto Article 76 TFEU and based on Article 87(2)(b) TFEU) moving the seat of CEPOL\r\nas an independent agency to Budapest, Hungary, was adopted on 6 May 2014[4]. Due to the opposition to the proposed merger, other parts of the\r\nEuropol proposal relating to training were not discussed by the European\r\nParliament and the Council in detail.\nThe\r\nRegulation relocating CEPOL to Budapest, Hungary, invites the Commission to submit\r\na report on the effectiveness of the Decision, if appropriate accompanied by a\r\nlegislative proposal for the Agency. This proposal for a regulation responds to\r\nthat invitation. It also reflects the call in the Stockholm Programme[5] to step up training on EU-related issues and to make them\r\nsystematically accessible for all relevant law enforcement professionals, and\r\nthe request of the European Parliament for a European training policy for law\r\nenforcement officers to address the increasingly complex and international\r\nnature of serious crime[6]. It is in line with the priorities set out in the Internal Security\r\nStrategy in Action[7], and with the Common Approach on EU decentralised Agencies. The\r\nneed to develop EU level training of law enforcement personnel to support\r\npractical cooperation and implementing fully the LETS was also pinpointed as\r\none of the key priorities for the future in the Communication of the Commission\r\non \"An open and secure Europe: making it happen\"[8].\nThis\r\nproposal for a Regulation draws \u2013 except as regards the question of merging\r\nCEPOL with Europol which has since been decided by the co-legislators \u2013 on\r\npreparatory work carried out in 2011 and 2012 by the Commission on the\r\nmodernisation of CEPOL's legal basis. It therefore provides for a legal\r\nframework for a new CEPOL with broader objectives and modernised governance,\r\nwhich repeals and replaces CEPOL as established by Council Decision\r\n2005/681/JHA.\n1.2. General objective\nOver the last decade, the EU has seen an increase in serious and\r\norganised crime as well as\nmore diverse patterns in crime.[9]\r\nEuropol\u2019s EU Serious and organised crime threat assessment\n2013 (SOCTA 2013) found that \u201cserious and organised crime is an\r\nincreasingly dynamic and\ncomplex phenomenon, and remains a significant threat to the safety\r\nand prosperity of the\nEU.\u201d[10] Transnational crime can only be countered by cross-border\r\ncooperation, with police, customs, border guards and other authorities working\r\ntogether. Unless those authorities are properly trained, and unless there is\r\nsufficient mutual trust, such cooperation will not be effective. Against this\r\nbackground, the strategic and operational goals in the fight against organised\r\nand serious cross-border crime and terrorism need to be underpinned by\r\ncoherent, recognised and high quality training in specialized and centrally\r\nprioritised areas for EU law enforcement officers involved in transnational\r\ncooperation. \nThe general objective of this proposal for a Regulation is therefore\r\nto improve EU security through the implementation, by CEPOL, of a new training\r\napproach for EU law enforcement officers, consistent with evolving priorities\r\nfor operational law enforcement cooperation. \nThe new training approach \u2013 or learning system \u2013 is set out in the\r\nEuropean Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS), which aims to equip law\r\nenforcement officials of all ranks (from police officers to border guards and\r\ncustoms officers, as well as, where appropriate, other state officials, such as\r\nprosecutors) with the knowledge and skills they need to prevent and combat\r\ncross-border crime effectively through efficient cooperation with their\r\ncolleagues in other Member States, EU agencies, third countries and\r\ninternational organisations. \nIn order to achieve the general objective, this proposal for a\r\nRegulation confers on CEPOL two main tasks: 1) delivering relevant\r\nEU-level training and exchanges and 2) coordinating the implementation\r\nof the Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS) by conducting \u00a0strategic training needs assessments and ensuring a common quality\r\nframework for law enforcement learning.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nDialogues on the preparation of the reform of Europol, CEPOL and of\r\nEU law enforcement training took place in 2010 and 2011 between the Commission\r\nand representatives of the European Parliament, the Council of the European\r\nUnion and the Management Board of Europol and Governing Body of CEPOL, as well\r\nas with representatives of national Parliaments.\n2.1 External Studies\nAn external five-year evaluation of CEPOL\r\nwas carried out in 2010-2011 in line with Article 21 of the CEPOL Decision[11]. The final report was submitted to the\r\nGoverning Board of CEPOL on 31 January 2011[12]. An independent external\r\nstudy, commissioned to support the preparation of the Impact Assessment,\r\nassessed the functioning of CEPOL and the legislation governing CEPOL in the\r\nlight of the objectives in the Stockholm Programme and analysed impacts of\r\npossible future actions. A wide variety of stakeholders were consulted, namely\r\nrepresentatives from CEPOL national stakeholders, users of CEPOL's activities\r\nand experts in the field of police cooperation and training. The study was\r\nsubmitted to the Commission on 23 April 2012[13].\n2.2 External consultations\nIn addition, the Commission involved all Member States in the\r\nassessment of the functioning of the CEPOL Decision and its revision. The\r\nfuture role of CEPOL was also discussed in the context of several workshops to\r\ngather ideas on the European Training Scheme organised by the Commission in the\r\nsecond half of 2011 and the first part of 2012. The\r\nCommission organised on 7 February 2012 a consultative workshop with 20\r\nparticipants, mainly from UK, FR, DE, ES, DK, BE, SK, PL, CEPOL, to assess\r\nproblems identified in the study as well as recommendations and to consider the\r\nalternatives. On 3 May 2012 the Commission organised a consultative conference\r\nwith 60 participants from all Member States.\n2.3 Internal consultations\nDG HOME carried out an internal consultation by\r\nsetting up a specific Inter-Service Group (ISSG), with the participation of\r\nrepresentatives of the SG, SJ, DG HR, BUDG, JUST, IAS, OLAF and EEAS. ISSG meetings were held on 15 March, 21 May, and 5 June 2012.\n2.4 Impact\r\nAssessment \nIn line with its \u201cBetter Regulation\u201d policy, the Commission\r\nconducted two impact assessments of policy alternatives concerning Europol and\r\nCEPOL.\nThe impact assessment on CEPOL was based on the two policy\r\nobjectives of (i) ensuring better quality, more joined-up and more consistent\r\ntraining for a wider range of law enforcement officers in cross-border crime\r\nissues and (ii) establishing a framework to achieve this in line with the\r\nCommon Approach on EU decentralised agencies. When presenting a Law Enforcement\r\nTraining Scheme, the implementation of which will require additional resources,\r\nthe Commission examined different options including strengthening and\r\nstreamlining CEPOL as a separate agency and merging, partially or fully, the\r\nfunctions of CEPOL and Europol into a new Europol agency.\nAccording to the Commission\u2019s established methodology, each policy\r\noption was assessed, with the help of an inter-service steering group, against\r\nits impact on security, on the costs (including on the budget of the EU\r\ninstitutions) and against its impact on fundamental rights.\nThe\r\nanalysis of the overall impact led, in the context of the Europol Regulation\r\nproposal, to a preferred policy option which was the merger of CEPOL into\r\nEuropol. However, the European Parliament and the Council did not agree to the\r\nproposed merger, nor to the alternative option of co-locating the two agencies\r\nin The Hague, the Netherlands,[14] and decided to move CEPOL, as an independent Agency, to Budapest.\nThis proposal for a regulation accordingly maintains CEPOL as an\r\nindependent agency, with its seat in Budapest. Any other option would, at this\r\npoint in time, generate additional costs and create uncertainty for the\r\nAgency's future and its staff which would adversely affect its ability to\r\ndeliver on its objectives.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 87(2)(b) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union is the legal basis for this proposal.\nObjective and content of the legislative\r\nproposal\nThis proposal aims to:\nGive CEPOL the\r\nappropriate legal mandate and the necessary resources to implement the training\r\neffort set out in the Commission Communication on LETS published in March 2013.\nImprove the governance of\r\nCEPOL by seeking increased efficiency and aligning it with the principles laid\r\ndown in the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies.\nImplementation of a European approach to\r\ntraining\nThe Commission Communication on LETS aims to make the EU\u2019s response\r\nto common security challenges more effective, to raise the standard of policing\r\nacross the EU and to stimulate the development of a common law enforcement\r\nculture as a means of enhancing mutual trust and cooperation. It seeks to\r\nidentify and address gaps in existing law enforcement training on cross-border\r\nmatters by supporting and, where appropriate, by coordinating the delivery of\r\ntraining by European and national centres of excellence[15]. To implement the training effort envisaged in the Communication,\r\nthis proposal for a Regulation aims at giving CEPOL the appropriate legal\r\nmandate and the necessary resources.\nThe scope of CEPOL\u2019s mandate is\r\nbroadened so that it can support, develop, deliver and coordinate learning\r\nactivities for law enforcement officials of all ranks (not only police officers\r\nof senior rank as is the case under\r\nthe current CEPOL Decision ) as well as to officers of customs and of other\r\nrelevant services dealing with cross-border issues. \nThe proposal envisages that the Agency will\r\nremain network-based, bringing together the network of training institutes of\r\nthe Member States for the law enforcement officials and liaising with a single\r\nNational unit in each Member State.\nThe objectives of CEPOL are updated and\r\nclarified so that the Agency may improve awareness and knowledge of\r\ninternational and Union instruments, the institutions, agencies and bodies of\r\nthe European Union; encourage the development of the regional or bilateral\r\ncooperation among the Member States; address specific criminal or policing\r\nthematic areas where training at EU level can add value in addition to the\r\nnational level; and provide appropriate and preliminary training sessions for\r\nthe participation in civilian missions in third Countries.\nCEPOL\u2019s tasks are defined in this Regulation on\r\nthe basis of a strategic training needs assessment to address EU priorities in\r\nthe area of internal security and its external aspects, in line with the\r\nrelevant policy cycles and by introducing an accredited certification system.\nImproved governance\nThe proposal improves the governance of CEPOL by\r\nstreamlining procedures, notably with respect to the Management Board and the\r\nExecutive Director, and by aligning CEPOL with the principles laid down in the\r\nCommon Approach on EU decentralised agencies, keeping in mind that CEPOL, as a\r\ncentre of EU learning activities, should continue to rely on the network of the\r\ntraining institutes of the Member States and liaise with a single National unit\r\nin each Member State.\nThe Commission and the Member States are represented on the Management Board of CEPOL. In line with the mandate of the\r\nAgency, the members of the Management Board are appointed on the basis of their\r\nknowledge of training for law enforcement officers, taking into account\r\nrelevant managerial, administrative and budgetary skills. The Management Board\r\nwill be advised by a scientific committee on technical training issues\r\n(Scientific Committee for Training).\nThe Management Board is given the necessary\r\npowers, in particular to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt the\r\nappropriate financial rules and planning documents, establish transparent\r\nworking procedures for decision-making by the Executive Director of CEPOL,\r\nadopt the annual activity report, and appoint an Executive Director.\nIn order to ensure efficient day-to-day\r\nfunctioning of CEPOL, the Executive Director is its legal representative and\r\nmanager. The Executive Director is completely independent in the performance of\r\nhis/her tasks and ensures that CEPOL carries out the tasks foreseen in this\r\nRegulation. In particular, the Executive Director is responsible for preparing\r\nbudgetary and planning documents submitted for the decision of the Management\r\nBoard, implementing the annual and multiannual work programmes of CEPOL\r\nand other planning documents.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe\r\nadoption of this Regulation will have no additional financial implication as\r\ndescribed in the annexed legislative financial statement. Figures included in\r\nthe financial statement combine the foreseen total amount for CEPOL as it is\r\nplanned for the 2016-2020 financial period (Communication COM(2013)519) including\r\nthe financial needs of \u20ac 3.710 million which are necessary to implement the\r\nmandate related to the Law Enforcement Training Scheme. \nAn\r\nadditional 4 FTE will be needed to implement the new tasks related to training\r\nof law enforcement officials, i.e. the activities required to implement the\r\nEuropean Law Enforcement Training Scheme. The specific task of the additional\r\nstaff will be to coordinate the 4 Strands of the Scheme and to ensure that\r\ntraining activities are built on the regular training needs analysis and\r\nsatisfy the high quality of delivery. In addition, 1 FTE will be recruited for\r\nthe post of Legal Advisor in accordance with the advice from the European\r\nOmbudsman. Taking into account the additional posts already foreseen in the\r\nCommunication COM(2013)519, only 1 additional FTE is to be recruited in 2016\r\nand 1 additional FTE is be recruited in 2017, and the additional post foreseen\r\nin 2018 in the Communication COM(2013)519 should be frontloaded in 2017. In\r\norder to comply with the 5% reduction, these modifications to the Communication\r\nwill require exact compensation and are therefore subject to the availability\r\nof resources in the pool of Agencies through the annual budget procedures, resulting\r\nin an estimated \u20ac1.305 million in staffing costs over the period 2016-2020. \nAn\r\nestimated \u20ac6.092 million of staff costs (excl. schooling fees) will be saved\r\nover the period 2016-2020 as a result of the relocation from Bramshill to Budapest and the difference in the correction coefficient between the United Kingdom and Hungary. Schooling fees for children of CEPOL\u2019s staff will constitute an\r\nadditional cost of \u20ac 1.868 million over the same period.\nAn\r\nestimated \u20ac0.658 million will be saved as a result of lower costs of building,\r\nequipment and management board expenses over the same period.\nThe\r\nrelocation of around 40 staff from CEPOL\u2019s current site in Bramshill, United Kingdom, to the new site in Budapest, Hungary, will have taken place before this proposal for\r\na Regulation enters into force.\nIn total, therefore, the budgetary impact of the legislative\r\nproposal amounts to \u20ac 45.383 million for CEPOL, as an independent Agency\r\nestablished in Budapest, over the period 2016-2020.\n2014/0217 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND\r\nOF THE COUNCIL\nestablishing a European Union agency for\r\nlaw enforcement training (Cepol), repealing and replacing the Council Decision\r\n2005/681/JHA\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union, and in particular Article 87(2)(b)\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Police College was set up by Council Decision 2005/681/JHA[16]\r\nas an entity of the Union to train senior police officers of the Member States\r\nand facilitate cooperation between national police forces by organising and\r\ncoordinating training activities with a European policing dimension. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The 'Stockholm Programme -\r\nAn open and secure Europe serving and protecting citizens\u2019 sets the aim of\r\ncreating a genuine European law enforcement culture by setting up European training\r\nschemes and exchange programmes for all relevant law enforcement professionals\r\nat national and Union level. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Law\r\nEnforcement Training Scheme (LETS)[17]\r\nresponds to the European Council\u2019s call, in the Stockholm Programme, to step up\r\ntraining on Union related issues and to make it systematically accessible for\r\nall relevant law enforcement professionals, and to request from the European\r\nParliament for a stronger Union framework for judicial and police training. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The development of Union level\r\ntraining for law enforcement personnel to support practical cooperation and full\r\nimplementation of the LETS represents a key priority for the future years in\r\nthat context. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simplification and\r\nimprovement of CEPOL's functioning, in light of the LETS, widens the\r\npossibilities for CEPOL to support, develop, deliver and coordinate training\r\nactivities for the competent law enforcement authorities of the Member States,\r\nwithout prejudice to the national initiatives taken by the Member States in the\r\nfield of training for law enforcement personnel. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure that Union level\r\ntraining for law enforcement personnel is of high quality, coherent and\r\nconsistent, CEPOL should strive to structure it in line with the principles of\r\nthe Law Enforcement Training Scheme. Union-level training should be available\r\nto law enforcement officers of all ranks. CEPOL should ensure that training is\r\nevaluated and that conclusions from training needs assessments are part of\r\nplanning to enhance effectiveness of future actions. CEPOL should promote the\r\nrecognition in Member States of training provided at Union level. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To avoid duplication in\r\nthe training activities for the competent law enforcement personnel, which are carried\r\nout by existing European Union Agencies and other relevant bodies, CEPOL should\r\nassess strategic training needs and address Union priorities in the area of\r\ninternal security and its external aspects, in line with the relevant policy\r\ncycles. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To achieve its objectives,\r\nCEPOL, as a centre of Union learning activities, should maintain and encourage\r\ncooperation with the network of the training institutes of the Member States.\r\nIt should further be supported by a \"National Unit\" in each Member State. The activities of the National Units should be coordinated at the Union level\r\nby CEPOL. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission and the Member States should be represented within the Management Board of CEPOL in order to supervise\r\neffectively the exercise of its functions. The Board should consist of members\r\nappointed on the basis of their experience in the management of public or\r\nprivate sector organisations and of their knowledge in the national policy on\r\ntraining for law enforcement officers. The Board should be entrusted with the\r\nnecessary powers to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt\r\nappropriate financial rules and CEPOL's strategy, establish transparent working\r\nprocedures for decision making by CEPOL, appoint the Director, establish\r\nperformance indicators and exercise appointing authority powers, in accordance\r\nwith the Staff Regulations and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure the efficient\r\nday-to-day functioning of CEPOL, the Executive Director should be its legal\r\nrepresentative and manager, acting in complete independence in the performance\r\nof his/her duties and ensuring that CEPOL carries out the tasks provided for by\r\nthis Regulation. In particular, the Executive Director should be responsible\r\nfor preparing budgetary and planning documents submitted for the decision of\r\nthe Management Board, implementing the annual and multiannual programming and\r\nannual work programmes of CEPOL. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure the scientific\r\nquality of CEPOL's work, a Scientific Committee, composed of independent\r\npersons of the highest academic or professional standing in the subjects\r\ncovered by this Regulation, should be set up as an independent advisory body. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CEPOL should ensure that\r\nits training integrates relevant developments in research and encourage the\r\ncreation of stronger partnerships between universities and law enforcement\r\ntraining institutes in the Member States.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to guarantee the\r\nfull autonomy and the independence of CEPOL, it should be granted an autonomous\r\nbudget with revenue stemming essentially from a contribution from the budget of\r\nthe Union. The Union budgetary procedure should be applicable as far as the\r\nUnion contribution and any other subsidies chargeable to the general budget of\r\nthe European Union are concerned. The auditing of accounts should be undertaken\r\nby the Court of Auditors.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of\r\nperforming its tasks, CEPOL should also be able to award grants to the training\r\nand research institutes of the Member States for implementing CEPOL's courses,\r\nseminars and conferences. Grants awarded to Member States should further contribute\r\nto fostering the cooperation of the training institutes of the Member States\r\nwithin the network and promoting the mutual recognition of law enforcement.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of\r\nfulfilling its mission and to the extent required for the performance of its\r\ntasks, CEPOL should be able to cooperate with other European Union Agencies and\r\nrelevant bodies, the competent authorities of third countries and the\r\ninternational organisations competent in matters covered by this Regulation in\r\nthe framework

CEPOL brings together senior\r\npolice officers across Europe with the aim to encourage cross-border\r\ncooperation in the fight against crime and maintenance of public security and\r\nlaw and order.\nThe\r\nStockholm Programme states that it is essential to step up training on\r\nUnion-related issues in order to foster a genuine European judicial and law enforcement\r\nculture, and that the objective of systematic European Training Schemes should\r\nbe pursued. The Commission accordingly proposed, prior to this proposal for new\r\nRegulation, a European Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS) which would build\r\non the activities currently carried out by CEPOL \u2013 considering that under its\r\ncurrent legal basis, CEPOL could only partially implement the LETS because its\r\ncompetence is restricted to senior officers. \n1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific objective(s) and\r\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \nSpecific\r\nobjective No\nSpecific\r\nobjective No.1: To coordinate relevant EU-level\r\ntraining and exchanges for law enforcement officers \nSpecific\r\nobjective No.2: To coordinate the implementation of\r\nthe Law Enforcement training Scheme (LETS)\nABM/ABB\r\nactivity(ies) concerned\n18.02 \u2013\r\nInternal Security \n1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected result(s) and\r\nimpact\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative\r\nshould have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\nTraining of\r\nlaw enforcement officials, thereby raising the standard of policing across the\r\nEU, enhancing trust between law enforcement agencies, contributing to a common\r\nlaw enforcement culture and thereby making more effective the EU\u2019s response to\r\ncommon security challenges.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\r\nimpact \nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation\r\nof the proposal/initiative.\n- Number of\r\nneeds analyses;\n- Number of\r\nquality assurance products;\n- Number of\r\ncommon curricula;\n- Number of\r\ntraining (and e-training) modules;\n- Number of\r\ncourse delivered;\n- Number of\r\nexchanges organised;\n- User\r\nsatisfaction.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nThe law\r\nenforcement training that will be brought about by the agency will raise the\r\nstandard of policing across the EU, contribute to enhance trust between law\r\nenforcement agencies, contribute to a common law enforcement culture, and\r\nthereby make more effective the EU\u2019s response to common security challenges.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nThe added\r\nvalue of EU involvement in law enforcement training is to ensure a coordinated\r\napproach developing and implementing such training. Much is already done in\r\nthis field, whether nationally by Member States or at EU-level by CEPOL.\r\nHowever, as explained in the Commission Communication on the European Law\r\nEnforcement Training Scheme (LETS), more needs to be done e.g. to ensure that\r\ntraining responds to needs relating to crime topics prioritised at EU level and\r\nto ensure a coherent approach to deliver training at EU level according to the\r\nhighest quality standards.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe\r\nCommission Communication on a European Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS)\r\ndraws on a mapping exercise undertaken by CEPOL in 2012 as well as extensive\r\nconsultations with experts from Member States and from JHA agencies. The\r\nresults indicated a need for a more coordinated approach, including a strong\r\nrole for an EU agency as driving force and coordinator for implementing the\r\nScheme, in close cooperation with other agencies and national training\r\nacademies. CEPOL has been the subject of a five-year evaluation completed in\r\n2011 and an external study commissioned by the Commission to support\r\npreparation of an impact assessment for the forthcoming legislative proposal.\r\nThe results indicated needs for increasing training on EU dimensions of\r\npolicing, for better coordination between CEPOL, Member States and other\r\nagencies, and for improvements in CEPOL\u2019s current governance and structure.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nCEPOL\r\ncooperates with other EU agencies in the field of justice and home affairs\r\n(including Europol, Frontex, Fundamental Rights Agency). CEPOL will ensure a\r\ncoherent development of and avoid duplication in the training activities for\r\nthe competent law enforcement authorities, which are performed by the existing\r\nEuropean Agencies and other relevant bodies, by preparing strategic training\r\nneeds assessment and addressing EU priorities in the area of internal security\r\nand its external aspects, in line with the relevant policy cycles.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative\r\nin effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u00a8 Financial\r\nimpact from YYYY to YYYY\n\u00fe Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\nImplementation with a start-up period from 01/01/2016 to 31/03/2016,\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) planned[31] \nFrom 2014\r\nbudget\n\u00a8 Direct management by the Commission\r\nthrough\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a8 Shared\r\nmanagement with the Member States \n\u00fe Indirect management by entrusting budget\r\nimplementation tasks to:\n\u00a8 international\r\norganisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\u00a8the EIB and the European\r\nInvestment Fund;\n\u00fe bodies referred to in\r\nArticles 208 and 209;\n\u00a8 public law bodies;\n\u00a8 bodies governed by\r\nprivate law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide\r\nadequate financial guarantees;\n\u00a8 bodies governed by the\r\nprivate law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a\r\npublic-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u00a8 persons entrusted with\r\nthe implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the\r\nTEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\nComments \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nSpecify frequency and conditions.\nUnder the\r\nproposal for a Regulation, CEPOL is required to elaborate each year a\r\nprogramming document containing Cepol's multiannual programming and the annual\r\nwork programme.
