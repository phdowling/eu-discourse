Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the\r\nCommission decided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more\r\nthan ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that\r\ndepartments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for\r\nwhich they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and\r\nreadily understandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law\r\napplicable to a given matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament,\r\nthe Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for\r\nthe fast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 153/2002 of 21 January 2002 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and\r\nAssociation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States,\r\nof the one part, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other\r\npart, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the European Community and\r\nthe Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia[3].\r\nThe new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by\r\nthe codification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was drawn up on the\r\nbasis of a preliminary consolidation, in 22 official languages, of Regulation (EC) No 153/2002 and the instruments amending it,\r\ncarried out by the Publications Office of the European Union, by means of a data-processing\r\nsystem. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation\r\nbetween the old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex II\r\nto the codified Regulation.\n\u00ea 153/2002\r\n(adapted)\n2014/0199 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non certain procedures for applying the\r\nStabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and\r\ntheir Member States, of the one part, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,\r\nof the other part (codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00ea\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 153/2002[6] has been substantially amended several times[7].
