INTRODUCTION\nMembers of the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) and Afghanistan have reached the concluding stage of an agreement on the\r\nterms for the accession of Afghanistan to the organization. This comes after 10\r\nyears of negotiations, which began when Afghanistan submitted its application\r\nto join the WTO in 2004. Afghanistan\u2019s request for accession has been examined\r\nin accordance with the guidelines set out by the WTO General Council on the\r\naccession of least-developed countries (LDC) and now a Council Decision\r\napproving the terms of Afghanistan\u2019s accession is required by the TFEU, before\r\nthe EU can formally support that approval in the WTO.\nA summary of the terms of the accession is\r\nset out below.\nII. SUMMARY OF TERMS OF AFGHANISTAN\u2019S WTO ACCESSION BY SECTOR\nSchedules of commitments\nGoods (overall)\nThe average final bound rate (FBR) in the\r\naccession schedule of Afghanistan is 15.1%.\nThe average FBR is higher at 29.6% for\r\nagriculture products than the 8.8% observed for industrial goods. Tariff peaks\r\nare also higher in agriculture (60-70% maximum in some agriculture products\r\nversus 50% maximum observed in industrial goods).\nAfghanistan will\r\nimplement the FBRs as from the date of accession, with the exception of imports\r\nof a handful of Information Technology products \u2013 such as electronic circuits,\r\nvideo cameras - (which will be fully liberalised by 2019 anyway).\nThese average\r\nlevels for tariffs are very reasonable considering the LDC status of Afghanistan as well as the small size and vulnerability of its economy. Past EU practice in\r\nrelation to LDCs has been to accept higher tariff levels than these as\r\nreasonable for economies of comparable size. Against this background, the\r\nschedule leaves unbound:\n\u2013              \r\n41 tariff lines on agriculture products whose\r\ntrade is considered as prohibited in Afghanistan (pork and pork products, beer,\r\nwine and spirits); and\n\u2013              \r\n183 tariff lines of industrial goods, corresponding\r\nto 4.4% of the number of industrial TLs in the schedule (in compliance with the\r\nrecently approved \u201cGuidelines for negotiation of LDCs accession to the WTO\u201d\r\nwhich allow up to a 5% of unbound industrial tariff lines).\nIndustrial Goods \n\u2013              \r\nThe average FBR for non-agriculture products is\r\n8.8%.\n\u2013              \r\nThe highest averages of 30% are observed in\r\nceramics, and then averages of 15-20% in furniture, glass and textiles.\n\u2013              \r\nThe lowest, 0%, is offered in Information\r\nTechnology (ITA) products that will be implemented by 2019.\n\u2013              \r\nThe highest industrial tariff peaks are 50%\r\n(passenger vehicles) followed by peaks of 30% in ceramics and diverse textile\r\nproducts.\n\u2013              \r\nThe 183 unbound tariff lines on industrial goods\r\ncorrespond to raw materials, carpets, footwear and furniture.\nAgricultural goods \n\u2013              \r\nThe average FBR for agriculture products is\r\n29.6%.\n\u2013              \r\nThe highest tariff peaks in agriculture are of\r\n70% for some fruit juices, and 60% in a wide variety of agriculture products\r\nsuch as lamb and beef meat, vegetables, fruits, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes,\r\ntobacco and mineral waters.\n\u2013              \r\nThe 41 unbound tariff lines on agriculture\r\nproducts concern products whose trade is considered as prohibited in Afghanistan (pork and pork products, beer, wine and spirits).\nExport duties\nAfghanistan has\r\nundertaken standstill and reduction commitments on export duties. It will not\r\nintroduce export duties on products which are not currently subject to such\r\nduties. As regards existing duties, the maximum rates bound for critical raw\r\nmaterials will be reduced within five years as from the date of accession.\nServices \nAfghanistan's schedule\r\nof specific commitments in services is satisfactory considering its LDC status.\r\nAfghanistan will undertake market access and national treatment commitments in\r\na broad range of services sectors, including professional, computer and other\r\nbusiness services, communication services (courier services and\r\ntelecommunications), construction services, distribution services, private\r\neducational services, environmental services, financial (insurance and banking)\r\nservices, hospital services, hotel and restaurant services and transport\r\nservices (maritime and air transport services and auxiliary services).\nProtocol commitments\nIn the final, multilateral stage of the\r\naccession process, WTO Members collectively sought to ensure the basic\r\ncompatibility of Afghanistan\u2019s trade laws and institutions with WTO rules and\r\nagreements, setting these out in the Protocol of accession and Working Party\r\nReport. \nTransitional periods were requested in a\r\nnumber of fields; the following are of particular interest to the EU:\nApplication of internal taxes to imports: a fixed tax and a business receipts tax currently applied will\r\nonly be in full conformity with WTO obligations in 2020; for the rest of\r\ninternal taxes and charges levied on imports, WTO alignment will take place as\r\nform the date of accession.\nTechnical Barriers to Trade (TBT): Afghanistan will fully implement the Agreement on\r\nTechnical Barriers to Trade by 1 January 2016. An action plan is set out in the\r\nWorking Party Report.\nSanitary and phytosanitary measures\r\n(SPS): Afghanistan will benefit from a transition period till 1\r\nJanuary 2018 for full implementation of the SPS Agreement, as set out in\r\nan action plan included in the Working Party Report.\nTrade-related investment measures (TRIMS): The full implementation of the TRIMS Agreement\r\nwill be effective by 31 December 2020, date at which local content requirements\r\nfor goods in the Hydrocarbon Law and the Mining Law would have to be\r\neliminated.\nTrade-related intellectual property\r\nrights (TRIPS): The full implementation of the\r\nTRIPS Agreement will be effective by 1 January 2016, as set out in an action\r\nplan included in the Working Party Report.\nIII.
