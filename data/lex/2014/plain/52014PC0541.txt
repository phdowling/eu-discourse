On 25\r\nApril 2013 the Council decided (Council Decision 2013/236/EU) that Cyprus shall rigorously implement a macroeconomic adjustment programme, which shall address the\r\nspecific risks emanating from Cyprus for the financial stability of the euro\r\narea and shall aim to rapidly re-establish a sound and sustainable economic and\r\nfinancial situation in Cyprus. \nOn 24 April 2013 the ESM Board of Governors\r\ndecided to grant, in principle, stability support to Cyprus and approved the\r\nMemorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality\r\n(hereinafter referred to as the \"MoU\") and its signing by the\r\nCommission on behalf of the ESM. On 8 May 2013 the ESM Board of Directors\r\napproved the financial assistance facility agreement.\nThe macroeconomic adjustment programme aims\r\nat restoring financial market confidence, re-establishing sound macroeconomic\r\nbalances and enabling the economy to return to sustainable growth. To achieve\r\nthese goals, the programme builds on three pillars. The first pillar is a\r\nfinancial sector strategy based on restructuring and downsizing of its\r\nfinancial institutions and strengthening its supervision, with efforts to\r\naddress capital and liquidity shortfalls. The second pillar is an ambitious\r\nfiscal consolidation strategy, building on the consolidation efforts initiated\r\nin 2012, in particular through measures to reduce current primary expenditure,\r\nenhance government revenues, improve the functioning of the public sector and\r\nmaintain fiscal consolidation in the medium-term. The aim is to correct the\r\nexcessive general government deficit and put the gross public debt-to-GDP ratio\r\non a firm downward path in the medium term. The authorities are committed to\r\nreducing the deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2016. The good implementation of\r\nStructural and other EU Funds, as well as EU policy initiatives aimed at\r\nenhancing jobs and growth should be preserved. This will contribute to the\r\nlong-term growth path for Cyprus. The third pillar consists of an ambitious\r\nstructural reform agenda, with a view to supporting competitiveness and\r\nsustainable and balanced growth, in line with country-specific recommendations\r\naddressed to Cyprus in 2012, and allowing for the unwinding of macroeconomic\r\nimbalances. Recalling the Council Recommendation of 22 April 2013 on\r\nestablishing a Youth Guarantee[1],\r\nopportunities for young people and their employability prospects should be enhanced.\r\n\nThe 3-year programme covers the period from\r\nmid-2013 to mid-2016.\nIn line with\r\nArticle 1(2) of Decision 2013/236/EU, the Commission, in liaison with the ECB,\r\nand, where appropriate, with the IMF, has conducted the fifth review to assess\r\nthe progress on the implementation of the agreed measures as well as their\r\neffectiveness and economic and social impact. As a result the MoU has been\r\nupdated in the areas of financial sector reform, fiscal policy and structural\r\nreforms. For the financial sector, the revised MoU provides that the\r\nauthorities will consider further liberalisation of the external restrictive\r\nmeasures only after the successful completion of the Comprehensive Assessement\r\nand a smooth transition to the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). This liberalisation,\r\nin timely consultation with the Commission, ECB and IMF and informing the ESM, will\r\nbe consistent with financial stability and comfortable liquidity buffers. The\r\nrevised MoU also provides for an updated plan for the gradual relaxation of\r\nthese restrictive measures. In addition, it requires further measures to\r\nstrenghten the banks' management of non-performing loans. It also includes a\r\nprovision aimed at concluding the follow-up on the 2013 audit regarding\r\nindividual financial institutions, imposing sanctions if applicable, and making\r\nthe final decision public. The revised MoU requires further measures to improve\r\nthe Cooperative Group's operational capacity. It also includes two prior\r\nactions, namely the adoption by the Council of Ministers of the new\r\ncomprehensive framework establishing appropriate corporate and personal\r\ninsolvency procedures, as well as the adoption by the House of Representatives\r\nof the amendments to the legal framework in relation to foreclosures of\r\nmortgaged properties, while its specifies details on the required elements of\r\nthese two new frameworks. With regard to fiscal policy, the primary deficit\r\ntarget for 2014 was revised down to no more than EUR 210 million (1.3% of GDP)\r\nto reflect the fiscal performance in the first half of 2014. In addition, the revised\r\nMoU requires the submission of a proposal ensuring the fiscal neutrality of the\r\nwelfare system reform and the achievement of the 2015 fiscal deficit target, while\r\nthe primary surplus target for 2017 has been revised down in order to smooth\r\nthe fiscal adjustment over 2017-2018. In the area of fiscal-structural and structural\r\nreforms, the revised MoU sets further steps to operationalize the privatisation\r\nprocess in the Cyprus Ports Authority (CPA) and the Electricity Authority of\r\nCyprus (EAC). On revenue administration and tax compliance, it requires the\r\nappointment of the new Commissioner and the two Assistant Commissioners of the\r\nnew tax department, the establishment of a common taxpayer database, and the\r\nadoption of necessary secondary legislation to make the enhanced collection\r\npowers operational. The revised MoU also stipulates that the reform of the\r\nimmovable property taxation will be implemented in 2015. On the social welfare\r\nreform, the revised MoU provides for the creation of a national registry of\r\nbenefits, on which basis the monitoring unit will produce an assessment report\r\nof the welfare system reform to ensure its budget neutrality. On housing market\r\nregulation, further requirements are included to fasten the issuance of title\r\ndeeds. In the area of tourism, articles of the current law on the Cyprus\r\nTourism Organisation potentially hampering competition will be assessed, while\r\nin the area of energy, a preliminary assessment of the technical and economic\r\npotential for further increasing electricity production by renewable energy\r\nsources and of the cost price of different sources of\r\nrenewables compared to conventional primary energy sources will be carried out. The revised MoU also requires the authorities to\r\nenvisage measures to improve the capacity and independence of the Energy Regulatory\r\nAuthority (CERA).\nFollowing the\r\nentry into force of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, the macroeconomic adjustment\r\nprogramme is now to be adopted in the form of a Council implementing decision.\r\nFor reasons of legal clarity and certainty, the Commission therefore proposes\r\nto readopt the programme on the basis of Article 7 (2) of Regulation 472/2013.\r\nThe substance of the programme is in essence identical to the one approved by\r\nCouncil Decision 2013/236, but also incorporates the results of the review\r\ncarried out in accordance with Article 1 (2) of Decision 2013/236. At the same\r\ntime, it is proposed to repeal Council Decision 2013/236/EU.\nThe proposed decision will ensure full\r\nconsistency between the Union multilateral surveillance framework established\r\nby the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the policy\r\nconditionality underpinning the economic adjustment programme. Notably, Article\r\n10 of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 provides for consistency in reporting and\r\nmonitoring obligations. \n2014/0248 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\namending Implementing Decision 2013/463/EU\r\non approving the macroeconomic adjustment programme for Cyprus \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Regulation (EU) No\r\n472/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on the\r\nstrengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the\r\neuro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to\r\ntheir financial stability[2],\r\nand in particular Article 7 (2) and (5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n472/2013 applies to Member States already in receipt of financial assistance,\r\nincluding those from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), at the time of its\r\nentry into force.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n472/2013 sets the rules for the approval of macroeconomic adjustment programme\r\nfor Member States in receipt of financial assistance, which need to be consistent\r\nwith the provisions of the Treaty of Establishing the European Stability Mechanism\r\n(ESM). \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon a request of 25 June\r\n2012 by Cyprus for financial assistance from the ESM, the Council decided on 25\r\nApril 2013 by Decision 2013/236/EU[3]that\r\n  Cyprus was to rigorously implement a macroeconomic adjustment programme.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 24 April 2013 the ESM\r\nBoard of Governors decided to grant, in principle, stability support to Cyprus and approved the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy\r\nConditionality and its signing by the Commission on behalf of the ESM.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n1(2) of Council Decision 2013/236/EU, the Commission, in liaison with the European\r\nCentral Bank (ECB), and, where appropriate, with the International Monetary\r\nFund (IMF), has conducted the fifth review to assess the progress with the\r\nimplementation of the agreed measures as well as their effectiveness and\r\neconomic and social impact. As a consequence of this review, an update was made\r\nto the existing macro-economic adjustment programme, reflecting the steps taken\r\nby the Cypriot authorities by the second quarter of 2014.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the entry into\r\nforce of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, the macroeconomic adjustment programme was\r\nadopted in the form of a Council Implementing Decision[4]. For reasons of legal\r\nclarity and certainty, the programme was readopted on the basis of Article 7\r\n(2) of Regulation 472/2013. The substance of the programme remained identical\r\nto the one approved by Council Decision 2013/236/EU, but also incorporated the\r\nresults of the review carried out in accordance with Article 1 (2) of Decision\r\n2013/236/EU. At the same time, Council Decision 2013/236/EU was repealed.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Implementing\r\nDecision 2013/463/EU was already amended by Decision 2014/169/EU.\r\nIn light of the latest developments, it should be\r\namended again.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, in liaison\r\nwith the ECB and the IMF, has conducted the fifth review to assess the progress\r\non the implementation of the agreed measures as well as their effectiveness and\r\neconomic and social impact. As a result, changes should be made in the areas of\r\nfinancial sector reform, fiscal policy and structural reforms, in particular with\r\nregard to: (i) providing an updated plan for the gradual relaxation of external\r\nrestrictions, which the authorities commit to only start after the successful\r\ncompletion of the Comprehensive Assessement and a smooth transition to the Single\r\nSupervisory Mechanism (SSM); (ii) further measures to strenghten the banks'\r\nmanagement of non-performing loans; (iii) a requirement to conclude the\r\nfollow-up on the 2013 audit regarding individual financial institutions, impose\r\nsanctions if applicable, and make the final decision public; (iv) the provision\r\nof further measures to improve the Cooperative Group's operational capacity; (v)\r\nthe adoption by the Council of Ministers of the new comprehensive framework\r\nestablishing appropriate corporate and personal insolvency procedures, as well\r\nas the adoption by the House of Representatives of the amendments to the legal\r\nframework in relation to foreclosures of mortgaged properties (these are two\r\nprior actions), with details on the required elements of these two new\r\nframeworks; (vi) a revision of the 2014 primary deficit target to no more than EUR\r\n210 million (1.3% of GDP) to reflect the fiscal performance in the first half\r\nof 2014, the submission of a proposal ensuring the fiscal neutrality of the\r\nwelfare system reform and the achievement of the 2015 fiscal deficit target,\r\nwhile the primary surplus target for 2017 has been revised down to 2.5% of GDP in\r\norder to smooth the fiscal adjustment over 2017-2018; (vii) the setting of\r\nfurther steps to operationalize the privatisation process in the Cyprus Ports Authority\r\nand the Electricity Authority of Cyprus; (viii) the appointment of the new\r\nCommissioners and the two Assistant Commissioners of the new tax department,\r\nthe establishment of a common taxpayer database, and the adoption of necessary\r\nregulations to make the enhanced collection powers operational; (ix) the reform\r\nof the immovable property taxation to be implemented in 2015; (x) the inclusion\r\nof further requirements to fasten the issuance of title deeds on housing market\r\nregulation; (xi) providing a draft action plan for the elimination of court\r\nbacklogs, detailed statistics on backlogs and duration of proceedings, as well\r\nas establishing an administrative Court; (xii) the assessment of articles in\r\nthe current law of the Cyprus Tourism Organisation that may hamper competition;\r\nand (xiii) a preliminary assessment of the technical and economic potential for\r\nfurther increasing electricity production by renewable energy sources and of\r\nthe cost price of different sources of renewables\r\ncompared to conventional primary energy sources,\r\ntogether with the inclusion of measures to improve the capacity and\r\nindependence of CERA.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout the\r\nimplementation of Cyprus' comprehensive policy package, the Commission should\r\nprovide additional policy advice and technical assistance in specific areas. A Member State subject to a macroeconomic adjustment programme experiencing insufficient\r\nadministrative capacity is to seek technical assistance from the Commission,\r\nwhich may constitute, for that purpose, groups of experts.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Cypriot authorities should\r\nseek the view, in accordance with current national rules and practises, of social\r\npartners and civil society organisations in the preparation, implementation,\r\nmonitoring and evaluation of the macroeconomic adjustment programme,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nArticle 2 of Implementing Decision\r\n2013/463/EU is amended as follows: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Paragraph 5 is replaced by the\r\nfollowing:\n'5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to restoring the soundness\r\nof its financial sector, Cyprus shall (i) continue to implement the\r\nrestructuring of the banking and cooperative credit institution sectors, (ii)\r\ncontinue to strengthen the supervision and regulation in the context of the\r\nongoing transition to the SSM, (iii) undertake a reform of the debt\r\nrestructuring framework, and (iv) gradually remove restrictive measures in line\r\nwith its roadmap, while safeguarding financial stability. The programme shall\r\nprovide for the following measures and outcomes:\n(a)         \r\nensuring that the liquidity situation of the\r\nbanking sector shall be closely monitored. The temporary restrictions on the\r\nfree movement of capital (inter alia, limits on cash\r\nwithdrawals, payments and transfers) shall be closely\r\nmonitored. The gradual\r\nrelaxation of the external restrictive measures shall be consistent with\r\nfinancial sector stability and preserves comfortable liquidity buffers. The\r\nCyprus Central Bank (CBC) will conduct on-site inspections of the\r\nimplementation of the restrictions, and take appropriate supervisory actions,\r\nas needed. Further liberalisation of external restrictive measures will only be\r\nconsidered by the authorities after the successful completion of the\r\nComprehensive Assessment and a smooth transition to the SSM. The goal is that controls shall remain in place only for as long as\r\nis strictly necessary to mitigate serious risks for the stability of the\r\nfinancial system. After the result of the Comprehensive Assessment, the roadmap\r\nfor the gradual relaxation of restrictive measures will be updated and published.\r\nThe funding and capital plans of domestic banks relying on central bank funding or receiving state aid shall realistically\r\nreflect the anticipated deleveraging in the banking sector, and reduce\r\ndependency on borrowing from the central banks, while avoiding asset fire sales\r\nand a credit crunch;\n(b)         \r\nadapting the minimum capital requirements,\r\ntaking into account the parameters of the balance sheet assessment and the\r\nEU-wide stress test; \n(c)         \r\nensuring that any restructuring plans shall be\r\nformally approved under State aid rules, before any State aid is provided.

Banks with restructuring plans shall report the progress\r\nin their implementation of the plans;\n(d)        \r\n ensuring that the credit register is created\r\nand operational; \n(e)         \r\ntaking into account the transition to the SSM,\r\nensuring the full implementation of the regulatory framework with respect to\r\nloan origination, asset impairment and provisioning; \u00a0\n(f)          \r\nintroducing mandatory disclosure requirements to\r\nensure that banks regularly communicate to authorities and markets progress in\r\nrestructuring their operations; \n(g)         \r\nensuring the revision of the governance\r\ndirective, which will specify, among others, the interaction between banks'\r\ninternal audit units and bank supervisors; \n(h)         \r\nstrengthening the banks' governance, including\r\nby prohibiting lending to independent board members or their connected parties;\n(i)           \r\nensuring the necessary staff and amendments in\r\nlight of the new responsibility taken on by the CBC, including by ensuring a\r\nseparation between resolution and supervisory functions, the transposition into\r\nnational law of the Single Rulebook, including the Bank Recovery and Resolution\r\nDirective and the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive;\n(j)           \r\nstrengthening the management of non-performing\r\nloans, taking into account the developments and timelines of the SSM.
