The text of the\r\nprotocol negotiated with Algeria is attached. \nThe Commission herewith submits a proposal\r\nfor a Council Decision on the signing of the protocol. This protocol contains a\r\nFramework Agreement on the general principles for the participation of Algeria in Union programmes. It contains standard clauses that are intended to be applied\r\nto all ENP partner countries with which such protocols are concluded. The\r\nnegotiated text also provides for the parties to provisionally apply the\r\nprovisions of this protocol from the date of its signing.\nThe Commission is submitting a parallel\r\nproposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the protocol.\nThe Council is invited to adopt the\r\nfollowing proposed decision.\n2014/0196 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing and provisional\r\napplication, on behalf of the Union, of a Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean\r\nAgreement establishing an association between the European Communities and\r\ntheir Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Algeria, of\r\nthe other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and the\r\nRepublic of Algeria on the general principles for the participation of the\r\nRepublic of Algeria in Union programmes\r\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 212\r\nin conjunction with Article 218(5) and (7) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 18 June 2007 the\r\nCouncil authorised the Commission to negotiate a protocol to the\r\nEuro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the\r\nEuropean Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the\r\nRepublic of Algeria, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement\r\nbetween the European Union and the Republic of Algeria on the general\r\nprinciples for the participation of the Republic of Algeria in Union programmes\r\n(hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Protocol\u2019).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The negotiations have been\r\nconcluded.\n(3) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of the\r\nProtocol is to lay down the financial and technical rules enabling Algeria to participate in certain Union programmes.
