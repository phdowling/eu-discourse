Such acts should\r\nbe removed from the law acquis of the European Union to improve transparency and give a\r\nhigher degree of certainty for all\r\ncitizens and all Member States.\nThis is in line\r\nwith the Commission's policy on Regulatory Fitness. In its Communication of\r\nJune 2014 on \"Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT): State\r\nof Play and Outlook\"[2],\r\nthe Commission stated that it was screening the acquis in respect of\r\npolice cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to\r\nidentify acts which could be repealed in the context of the expiry of the\r\ntransitional period set out in the Treaties. \nThe Commission has now completed its assessment on the\r\nlegal acts related to the area of freedom, security and justice, including the former\r\nthird pillar acquis. A number of acts adopted in recent decades have\r\nexhausted all their effects. They are no longer relevant because of their\r\ntemporary nature or because their content has been taken up by successive acts.\r\nFor reasons of legal certainty, the Commission proposes that the measures\r\nreferred to in this proposal are revoked by the European Parliament and the Council.\r\n\nI. Council Joint Action 96/610/JHA[3] created\r\na Directory of specialised counterterrorist competences, skills and expertise in\r\norder to make them more widely and readily available to agencies in all Member\r\nStates, thus enhancing Member States' counter-terrorist capability. That Joint\r\nAction became obsolete since Council Decision 2009/371/JHA[4]\r\nentrusted Europol to support and strengthen action by the competent\r\nauthorities of the Member States and their mutual cooperation in preventing and\r\ncombating terrorism and the Council Decision 2008/615/JHA[5] (so-called Pr\u00fcm\r\nDecision) introduced a new framework for cross-border cooperation on combating\r\nterrorism.\nII.\r\nCouncil Joint Action 96/699/JHA[6] on the exchange of information on\r\nthe chemical profiling of drugs to facilitate combating illicit drug\r\ntrafficking. That Joint Action became obsolete after the entry into force of the\r\nCouncil\r\nDecision 2009/371/JHA[7] establishing\r\nEuropol that has incorporated the formerly existing Drug Unit and of the\r\nConvention\r\non Mutual\r\nassistance in Criminal matters\r\nbetween the Member States of\r\nthe European Union[8] that provides for a broader co-operation among Member States in\r\nthe drug policy area. \nIII.\r\nCouncil Joint Action 96/747/JHA[9]\r\naimed at strengthening the cooperation between Member States' law enforcement\r\nagencies by providing assistance in cooperation in fighting crime across the EU. That\r\nJoint Action became obsolete since Council Decision 2009/371/JHA[10] entrusted Europol with\r\ndeveloping specialist knowledge of the investigative procedures of the Member\r\nStates' competent authorities and providing advice to the national authorities on\r\ninvestigations. Moreover, following the development by Europol of the Europol\r\nPlatform for Experts (EPE), Member States\u2019 Heads of Europol National Unit\r\n(HENU) took the decision on 16 February 2012 to close the directory provided\r\nfor by the Joint Action 96/747/JHA. \nIV. Council Joint Action 96/750/JHA[11]concerning\r\nthe approximation of the laws and practices to combat drug addiction and to\r\ncombat illegal drug trafficking. That Joint Action became obsolete since entry into force of the\r\nConvention on Mutual\r\nassistance in Criminal matters \u00a0between\r\nthe Member States of\r\nthe European Union[12] that provides for a broader co-operation among Member States\r\nalso in the drug policy area and\r\nCouncil\r\nFramework Decision 2004/757/JHA[13]\r\non minimum provisions on criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit\r\ndrug trafficking that has laid down more stringent rules on definitions and\r\nsanction of certain criminal acts in the drug policy area.\nV. Council Joint Action 97/339/JHA[14]\r\nallowed for cooperation and mandated information sharing between Member States\r\nregarding large scale events in order to maintain law and order and prevent\r\ncriminal offences. That Joint Action became obsolete since the Council Decision\r\n2008/615/JHA[15]\r\n(so-called Pr\u00fcm Decision) introduced a new framework for cooperation for\r\nmaintaining public order and security for major events and exchange of data. In\r\naddition, Council Decisions 2002/348/JHA[16]\r\nand 2007/412/JHA[17]\r\nset up National Football Information Points to coordinate and facilitate\r\ninternational police co-operation and information exchange in connection with\r\nfootball matches with an international dimension.\u00a0 \nVI. Council Joint Action 97/372/JHA[18] aimed\r\nat increasing information and intelligence sharing among customs authorities\r\nand other law enforcement authorities in particular on drugs. That Joint\r\nAction became obsolete after the entry into force of the Naples Convention[19] which provides for\r\nmore detailed rules on the mutual assistance and cooperation between Member\r\nStates for preventing and detecting infringements of national customs\r\nprovisions, and prosecuting and punishing infringements of Community and\r\nnational customs provisions. Furthermore, Council Decision 2009/917/JHA[20] increased the\r\neffectiveness of the cooperation and control procedures of the customs\r\nauthorities by setting up a customs information system (CIS) with the aim to\r\nprevent, investigate and prosecute breaches of Community customs or\r\nagricultural legislation. In addition Council Decision\r\n2009/371/JHA entrusted Europol with tasks aimed at\r\nsupporting customs cooperation.\nVII. Council Joint\r\nAction 98/427/JHA[21] on good practice in mutual legal assistance in Criminal Matters became obsolete since the entry into force of the Convention on Mutual assistance in Criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union[22] that provides for a broader co-operation\r\nin criminal matters among Member States.\nVIII. Council Act of 3 December 1998 laying down the staff\r\nregulations applicable to Europol[23]\r\nemployees applied to staff engaged by Europol before the entry into force of Council\r\nDecision 2009/371/JHA. However, the employment contracts in force are to come soon\r\nto their end rendering these staff regulations obsolete. Transitional\r\nprovisions foreseen by the present proposal ensure that these employment\r\ncontracts remain to be governed by that act pending their termination. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nDialogue on identifying legal measures of the former third pillar acquis\r\nthat became obsolete took place during 2014 among the Commission and the\r\nrepresentatives of the Member States and of the Council Secretariat within the\r\nFriends of the Presidency Group that has been activated with a view to\r\nexamining all the issues linked to the end of the 5 year transitional period\r\nset out in Article 10 of Protocol 36 to the Treaties.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n Summary of the proposed measures The proposal repeals a number of legal measures of the former third pillar acquis that have been identified as obsolete. \n Legal basis The legal basis for repealing Council Joint Action 96/610/JHA is Article 87(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The legal basis for repealing Council Joint Action 96/699/JHA is Article 87(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The legal basis for repealing Council Joint Action 96/747/JHA is Article 88(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The legal basis for repealing Council Joint Action 96/750/JHA is Article 83 (1) and 87(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The legal basis for repealing Council Joint Action 97/339/JHA is Article 87(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The legal basis for repealing Joint Action 97/372/JHA is Article 87(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The legal basis for repealing Council Joint Action 98/427/JHA is Article 82 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The legal basis for repealing the Council Act of 3 December 1998 laying down the staff regulations applicable to Europol is Article 88 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Principles of subsidiarity and proportionality The measures concerned by this proposal are obsolete, either because their content has been taken up by successive acts or because they are no longer relevant due to their temporary nature. Therefore, it is in line with the principles of subsidiarity and of proportionality to repeal those measures. It is for the Union legislator to adopt the necessary measures to that effect. \n Choice of instrument \n Proposed instrument: European Parliament and Council regulation. \n Article 88 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that Europol's structure, operation, field of action and tasks are to be determined by the European Parliament and the Council by means of regulations. A regulation is therefore the form of act expressly provided for in this provision of primary law.   \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no budgetary impact\n2014/0339 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nrepealing certain acts in the field of\r\npolice cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 82 (1) and 83 (1)\r\nand 87(2) and Article 88(2) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission[24],\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Improving the transparency\r\nof Union law is an essential element of the better lawmaking strategy that the\r\ninstitutions of the Union are implementing. In that context it is appropriate\r\nto remove from the legislation in force those acts which no longer serve any\r\npurpose.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A number of acts adopted\r\nin the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters\r\nhave become obsolete\r\ndue to their\r\ntemporary nature or because their content\r\nhas been taken up by successive acts, even though they have not been repealed.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Joint Action\r\n96/610/JHA[25]\r\ncreated a Directory of specialised counterterrorist competences, skills and\r\nexpertise in order to make them more widely and readily available to agencies\r\nin all Member States. That Joint Action became obsolete since Council Decision\r\n2009/371/JHA[26]\r\nentrusted Europol to support and strengthen action by the competent authorities\r\nof the Member States and their mutual cooperation in preventing and combating\r\nterrorism and the Council Decision 2008/615/JHA[27] introduced a new\r\nframework for cross-border cooperation on combating terrorism.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Joint Action 96/699/JHA[28] Europol Drugs Unit was\r\ndesignated as the authority to which information from Member States concerning\r\nchemical profiling was to be transmitted. That joint action\r\nbecame obsolete after the entry into force of the Council Decision 2009/371/JHA[29] and of the Convention on Mutual assistance in Criminal matters between the Member States[30].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nJoint Action 96/747/JHA[31] aimed at strengthening the cooperation between Member States' law\r\nenforcement agencies by creating a directory of areas of specialized competencies,\r\nskills and expertise. That joint action became obsolete after the entry into\r\nforce of Decision 2009/371/JHA which entrusted Europol with the task of\r\ndeveloping specialist knowledge of the investigative procedures of the Member\r\nStates' competent authorities and to provide advice on investigations. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Joint Action 96/750/JHA[32] aimed at reinforcing the cooperation of the relevant authorities of\r\nthe Member States in the fight against drug addiction\r\nand to call on Member States to approximate their laws to make them mutually\r\ncompatible to the extent necessary to prevent and combat illegal drug\r\ntrafficking in the Union. That joint action became obsolete since entry into force of the Convention on Mutual assistance\r\nin Criminal matters between the Member States of the European\r\nUnion and of Council\r\nFramework Decision 2004/757/JHA[33]. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Joint Action\r\n97/339/JHA[34]\r\nallowed for cooperation and mandated information sharing between Member States\r\nregarding large scale events which are attended by large numbers of people from\r\nmore than one Member State in order to maintain law and order, protect people\r\nand their property, and prevent criminal offences. That joint action became\r\nobsolete after the entry into force of Council Decisions 2008/615/JHA[35], 2002/348/JHA[36] and 2007/412/JHA[37] which provided for new\r\nrules on the exchange of non-personal and personal data and other forms of\r\ncooperation for maintaining public order and security for major events. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Joint Action\r\n97/372/JHA[38] aimed at increasing information and intelligence sharing among\r\ncustoms authorities and other law enforcement authorities in particular on drugs.\r\nThat joint action become obsolete after the entry into force of Council Act\r\n98/C 24/01[39]\r\n\u00a0drawing up the Naples Convention which introduced detailed rules on mutual\r\nassistance and cooperation between the Member States for preventing and\r\ndetecting infringements of national customs provisions, of Council Decision\r\n2009/917/JHA[40]\r\nthat increased the effectiveness of the cooperation and control procedures of\r\nthe customs authorities by setting up a customs information system (CIS) and of\r\nthe\u00a0 Council Decision 2009/371/JHA that provided Europol with tasks aimed at\r\nsupporting customs cooperation. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nJoint Action 98/427/JHA[41] on good practice in mutual legal assistance in Criminal Matters aimed\r\nat exchange of good practice among Member States for\r\nexecuting requests for legal assistance in criminal matters. That joint action has become obsolete. It has never been evaluated and has de facto lost\r\nits relevance with\r\nthe entry into force\r\nof the Convention\r\non Mutual assistance in Criminal matters between the Member States.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCouncil Act 1999/C 26/07 [42] still applies to staff engaged by Europol before the entry into\r\nforce of the Council Decision 2009/371/JHA. However the employment contracts in\r\nforce are to come soon to their end and thus rendering these staff regulations\r\nobsolete.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For reasons of legal\r\ncertainty and clarity, those obsolete joint actions and the Council Act should\r\nbe repealed.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nRegulation, namely the repeal of a number of obsolete Union acts in the field\r\nof police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters cannot be\r\nachieved by Member States but only at Union level, this Regulation complies\r\nwith the requirements of the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5\r\nof the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out\r\nin that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order\r\nto achieve that objective.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with Article 1 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning
