The rules on marketing authorisations\r\nvalid in all EU Member States are part of the proposal for a Regulation on\r\nveterinary medicinal products. The new Regulation on veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts will cover all routes granting marketing authorisations for veterinary\r\nmedicinal products in the Union \u2013 both at centralised and national level. \nThe costs of the procedures and services\r\nassociated with the operation of this Regulation need to be recovered from those\r\nmaking medicinal products available on the market and from those seeking\r\nauthorisation. Therefore, it is appropriate to establish certain principles\r\napplicable to fees payable to the Agency, including the need to take into\r\naccount, as appropriate, the specific needs for SMEs. The provisions regulating\r\nfees should be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon.\nAs a consequence of the entry into force of\r\nthe Treaty of Lisbon, the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation\r\n(EC) No 726/2004 should be aligned to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union. In order to supplement or amend certain\r\nnon-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the power to adopt acts\r\nin accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the\r\nCommission in respect of amending the Annex to\r\ntechnical and scientific progress, determining the situations in which\r\npost-authorisation efficacy studies may be required, laying down provisions and\r\nrequirements for granting marketing authorisations subject to certain specific\r\nobligations, establishing procedures for the examination of applications for\r\nvariations to the terms of marketing authorisations and for the examination of\r\napplications for the transfer of marketing authorisations and laying down the\r\nprocedure for investigating the infringements and the imposition of fines or\r\nperiodic penalty payments to the holders of marketing authorisations granted\r\nunder this Regulation, the maximum amounts of these penalties as well as the\r\nconditions and methods for their collection.\nThe entry into force and application of\r\nthis Regulation should be on the same date as of the new Regulation on\r\nveterinary medicinal products.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nIt is planned that the costs for the EMA for\r\nimplementing and applying the new rules are entirely covered by fees charged to\r\nindustry. \nTherefore, the proposal is not expected to\r\nhave any financial impact on the budget of the EU.\nAs set out in the legislative financial\r\nstatement the additional resource needs for EMA are approximately 8 staff plus\r\nexpenditure for meetings, translation, IT, etc. \nThe level of fees, their structure and\r\nmodalities and exceptions will be set at a later stage by the Commission by way\r\nof implementing acts. This holds not only for the fees for new tasks for the\r\nEMA set out in this proposal, but for all fees in general.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n2014/0256 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 726/2004\r\nlaying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of\r\nmedicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European\r\nMedicines Agency\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 and Article\r\n168(4)(c) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[3],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[4],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2001/82/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[5]\r\nand Regulation (EC) 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council[6] constituted the Union\r\nregulatory framework for the manufacture, authorisation and distribution of\r\nveterinary medicinal products. In the light of the experience acquired and\r\nfollowing the assessment by the Commission of the functioning of the internal market\r\nfor veterinary medicinal products, the regulatory framework for veterinary\r\nmedicinal products has been reviewed, and Regulation (EU) No [\u2026] of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council[7]\r\nlaying down procedures for the authorisation and supervision of veterinary\r\nmedicinal products has been adopted. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No [\u2026]\r\nalso provides for centralised marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts. The parts of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 relating to procedures for\r\nthose marketing authorisation should therefore be repealed.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The costs of the\r\nprocedures and services associated with the operation of this Regulation need\r\nto be recovered from those making medicinal products available on the market\r\nand from those seeking authorisation. It is appropriate to establish certain\r\nprinciples applicable to fees payable to the Agency, including the need to take\r\ninto account, as appropriate, the specific needs for SMEs. The provisions\r\nregulating fees should be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\r\nentry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the powers conferred on the\r\nCommission under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 should be aligned to Articles 290\r\nand 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union In order to\r\nsupplement or amend certain non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No\r\n726/2004, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty\r\nshould be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending\r\nthe Annex to technical and scientific progress, determining the situations in\r\nwhich post-authorisation efficacy studies may be required, laying down\r\nprovisions and requirements for granting marketing authorisations subject to\r\ncertain specific obligations, establishing procedures for the examination of\r\napplications for variations to the terms of marketing authorisations and for\r\nthe examination of applications for the transfer of marketing authorisations\r\nand laying down the procedure for investigating the infringements and the\r\nimposition of fines or periodic penalty payments to the holders of marketing\r\nauthorisations granted under this Regulation, the maximum amounts of these\r\npenalties as well as the conditions and methods for their collection.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is of particular\r\nimportance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its\r\npreparation of delegated acts, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated\r\nacts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of\r\nrelevant documents to the European Parliament and Council. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, implementing\r\npowers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing acts in\r\nrelation to marketing authorisations for medicinal products for human use.\r\nThose powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[8].\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n726/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly, \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 726/2004 is amended as\r\nfollows:\n(1)                   \r\nthe title is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Union procedures for\r\nthe authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human use and\r\nestablishing a European Medicines Agency\u2019;\n(2)                   \r\nin Article 1, the first paragraph is replaced by\r\nthe following:\n\u2018The purpose of this Regulation is to lay down\r\nUnion procedures for the authorisation, supervision and pharmacovigilance of\r\nmedicinal products for human use and to establish a European Medicines Agency\r\n(hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Agency\u2019).\u2019\n(3)                   \r\nin Article 2, the first paragraph is replaced by\r\nthe following:\n\u2018The definitions laid down in Article 1 of\r\nDirective 2001/83/EC shall apply for the purposes of this Regulation.\u2019\n(4)                   \r\nArticle 3 is amended as follows:\n(a)         \r\nin paragraph 2, point (b) is replaced by the\r\nfollowing:\n\u00a0\u2018(b)\u00a0\u00a0 the applicant shows that the medicinal\r\nproduct constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical\r\ninnovation or that the granting of authorisation in accordance with this\r\nRegulation is in the interests of patients health at Union level.\u2019,\n(b)         \r\nin paragraph 3, the introductory phrase and\r\npoint (a) are replaced by the following:\n\u2018A generic medicinal\r\nproduct of a reference medicinal product authorised by the Union may be\r\nauthorised by the competent authorities of the Member States in accordance with\r\nDirective 2001/83/EC under the following conditions: \n(a) the application for authorisation is\r\nsubmitted in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC;\u2019 ,\n(c)         \r\nparagraph 4 is replaced by the following: \n\u2018The Commission shall\r\nbe empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 87b in order to\r\namend the Annex to technical and scientific progress without extending the\r\nscope of the centralised procedure.\u2019;\n(5)                   \r\nArticle 4(3) is deleted;\n(6)                   \r\nArticle 10 is amended as follows:\n(a)         \r\nparagraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n\u20182.
