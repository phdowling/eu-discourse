By Council Implementing Regulation No 444/2011 (OJ L 122, 11.5.2011, p. 12) the defintive anti-dumping duty on imports of biodiesel originating in the United States of America were extended to imports of biodiesel consigned from Canada, whether declared as originating in Canada or not. || \n Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. || \n 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of interested parties and impact assessment \n Consultation of interested parties || \n Interested parties concerned by the proceeding were given the possibility to defend their interests during the proceeding, in line with the provisions of the basic Regulation. || \n Collection and use of expertise || \n There was no need for external expertise. || \n Impact assessment This proposal is the result of the implementation of the basic Regulation.

The review was initiated following a substantiated request lodged by Canadian producer Ocean Nutrition Canada ('the applicant'). The applicant failed to demonstrate that it is able to produce the entire quantity of biodiesel that it has shipped to the Union since the start of the investigation period of the anti-circumvention investigation. Therefore, the review investigation should be terminated without granting the applicant an exemption from the anti-dumping measures in force as extended. Therefore, it is suggested that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Regulation in order to terminate the interim review investigation, which should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. || \n Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. || \n Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. || \n Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: || \n The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. || \n Indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. || \n Choice of instruments || \n Proposed instrument: Regulation. || \n Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: Other means would not be adequate because the basic Regulation does not foresee alternative options. || \n 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary implication \n The proposal has no implication for the Union budget. || \n2014/0067 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nterminating the partial interim review\r\nconcerning the anti-dumping measures on imports of biodiesel originating in the\r\nUnited States of America, as extended to imports consigned from Canada, whether\r\ndeclared as originating in Canada or not\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\r\ncountries not members of the European Community([1])\r\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019) and in particular Articles 11(3) and 13(4) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\r\nthe European Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) after consulting the Advisory\r\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures\r\nin force\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\r\nRegulation (EC) No 599/2009([2]) the Council imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of\r\nfatty-acid mono-alkyl esters and/or paraffinic gasoil obtained from synthesis\r\nand/or hydro-treatment, of non-fossil origin, commonly known as \u2018biodiesel\u2019, in\r\npure form or in a blend containing by weight more than 20 % of fatty-acid\r\nmono-alkyl esters and/or paraffinic gasoil obtained from synthesis and/or\r\nhydro-treatment, of non-fossil origin (\u2018the product under review\u2019, or\r\n\u2018biodiesel\u2019), currently falling within CN codes ex 1516 20 98, ex 1518 00 91,\r\nex 1518 00 99, ex 2710 19 43, ex 2710 19 46, ex 2710 19 47, ex 2710 20 11, ex\r\n2710 20 15, ex 2710 20 17, ex 3824 90 97, 3826 00 10 and ex 3826 00 90\r\noriginating in the United States of America\u00a0 (\u2018original measures in force\u2019).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\r\nRegulation (EU) No 444/2011([3]), following an anti-circumvention investigation, the Council\r\nextended the definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of biodiesel originating\r\nin the United States of America to imports of biodiesel consigned from Canada,\r\nwhether declared as originating in Canada or not (\u2018extended measures\u2019). \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Request\r\nfor a review\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A request for a partial interim review\u00a0 pursuant to Articles 11(3)\r\nand 13(4) of the basic Regulation was lodged by Ocean Nutrition Canada ('the applicant'), an exporting producer from Canada ('the review request'). \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nrequest was limited in scope to the examination of the possibility of granting\r\nan exemption from the extended measures, as far as the applicant is concerned. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe review request the applicant claimed that it is a genuine producer of\r\nbiodiesel and that it is able to produce the entire quantity of biodiesel that\r\nit has shipped to the Union since the start of the investigation period of the\r\nanti-circumvention investigation leading to the imposition of the extended\r\nmeasure. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ninvestigation period which was taken into consideration for the\r\nanti-circumvention investigation mentioned in recital (2) above, covered the\r\nperiod from 1 April 2009 to 30 June 2010 ('the original investigation period').\r\nThe investigation period for the present investigation covered the period from\r\n1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 ('the investigation period').\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\napplicant provided prima facie evidence that it has been established as a\r\nproducer of biodiesel in Canada long before the imposition of the original\r\nmeasures.

The applicant was invited by the\r\nCommission to justify the use of this CN code. However, it did not provide any\r\ninformation or any other evidence showing that these exports should be covered\r\nby the CN code not subject to the measures. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\nthe basis of the above, it is considered that the applicant has failed to\r\ndemonstrate that it was able to produce the entire quantity of biodiesel that\r\nit has shipped to the Union since the start of the original investigation\r\nperiod. Notwithstanding the fact that the applicant did not provide the\r\ninformation requested by the Commission, it did not provide any other evidence\r\nshowing that it was not involved in circumvention practices. For that reason,\r\nthe review investigation should be terminated without granting the applicant an\r\nexemption from the extended measures. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested\r\nparties were informed of the intention to terminate the review investigation\r\nand were given the opportunity to comment.
