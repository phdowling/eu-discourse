Under Article 83a(4) of the Staff Regulations, each year the Commission shall present to the Council an updated version of the actuarial assessment, in accordance with Article 1(2) of Annex XII. Where it is shown that there is a gap of at least 0,25 points between the rate of contribution currently applied and the rate required to maintain actuarial balance, the Council shall consider whether the rate should be adapted, in accordance with the arrangements laid down in Annex XII. Under Article 13 of Annex XII to the Staff Regulations, Eurostat has submitted the reports required under the above provisions, which determine the rates of contribution required to maintain actuarial balance of the pension scheme for 2011, 2012 and 2013. Pursuant to Article 19 of Annex XIII to the Staff Regulations, as last amended by Regulation No 1023/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Article 83a and Annex XII thereto, as in force before 1 November 2013, shall continue to be in force exclusively for the purpose of any adjustment required to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union under Article 266 of the TFEU on the application of those provisions. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n Consultation of interested parties \n Methods of consultation used, main sectors covered and general profile of respondents The elements of the proposal have been discussed with the staff representatives in accordance with the appropriate procedures. \n Summary of replies received and the way in which they have been taken into account The proposal takes account of the opinions of the parties consulted. \n Collection and use of expertise \n The calculation of the pension contribution rate has been validated by an actuarial expert (external consultant). \n Impact assessment The purpose of the proposal is to adjust the rate of contribution to the pension scheme of officials and other servants of the European Union for the years 2011, 2012 (yearly adjustments) and 2013 (five-yearly adjustment) in order to maintain the actuarial balance of the scheme. The legislation as it was in force until the end of 2013 permitted no alternative. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nIn order to comply with the judgment of the\r\nCourt of Justice in Case C-63/12, the European Parliament and the Council have\r\nadopted Regulations No 422/2014 and No 423/2014 of 16 April 2014, respectively\r\nadjusting with effect from 1 July 2011 and from 1 July 2012 the remuneration and\r\npensions of officials and other servants of the European Union and the\r\ncorrection coefficients applied thereto. This was a part of a global approach\r\nto settle the disputes regarding the 2011 and 2012 adjustments of remuneration\r\nand pensions and the 2011 adjustment of the pension\r\ncontribution, which resulted in an adjustment of 0 % for 2011 and 0,8 %\r\nfor 2012.\nThese adjustments of the salaries and\r\npensions of the EU staff require the respective retroactive adjustment of the\r\nrate of contribution to the pension scheme for the year 2013. Moreover, the purpose of Article 19 of Annex XIII to the Staff\r\nRegulations, as last amended by Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1023/2013 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council, is to enable the institutions to take\r\nthe necessary measures to settle their disputes concerning the 2011 and 2012\r\nadjustments of remuneration and pensions and the 2011 adjustment of the pension\r\ncontribution in compliance with a judgment of the Court of Justice, taking due\r\naccount of the legitimate expectation of staff that the institutions are to\r\ndecide each year on the adjustment of their remuneration and pensions and the rate\r\nof contribution to the pension scheme. \nIn accordance with Article 13 of Annex XII\r\nto the Staff Regulations, Eurostat submitted reports on the 2011, 2012 and 2013\r\nactuarial assessments of the pension scheme updating the parameters referred to\r\nin that Annex. According to these assessments, the rate of contribution\r\nrequired to maintain actuarial balance of the pension scheme is 11,0 % of the\r\nbasic salary for 2011[2],\r\n9,9 % of the basic salary for 2012[3]\r\nand 10,6 % of the basic salary for 2013[4].\r\nIn the interests of actuarial balance of the pension scheme of officials and\r\nother servants of the European Union, the rate of contribution should therefore\r\nbe adjusted to:\n\u00b7                        \r\n11,0 % with effect from 1 July 2011;\n\u00b7                        \r\n10,0 % with effect from 1 July 2012[5]; and \n\u00b7                        \r\n10,6 %.with effect from 1 July 2013.\nFurthermore, under Article 83a(3) of the\r\nStaff Regulations, on the occasion of the five-yearly actuarial assessment in\r\naccordance with Annex XII and in order to ensure the balance of the scheme, the\r\nCouncil shall decide on the rate of contribution. \nThe 2013 actuarial assessment of the\r\npension scheme constitutes such a five-yearly assessment, which requires the\r\nCommission to carry out a full assessment of the scheme for this reference\r\nperiod in order to ensure that the applied pension contribution rate maintains\r\nthe pension scheme in actuarial balance. Such a five-yearly assessment necessarily\r\npresupposes the fixing of the pension contribution rate for 2011, which has not\r\nyet been definitely decided by the Council, and the re-adjustment of the 2012\r\npension contribution rate as indicated in Recital (4) of Council Regulation No.\r\n1331/2013 of 10 December 2013. \nThe yearly adjustment of the rate of\r\ncontribution to the pension scheme for 2011 under Article 83a(4) SR is subject\r\nto an action pending before the\r\nEuropean Court of Justice (C-453/12). Nevertheless, upon a request from the Commission the Court has\r\nsuspended this case in order to leave a room for the parties to reach a global\r\nlegislative solution of all issues related to the pension contribution rate,\r\nfollowing its judgment in case C-63/12 on the 2011 annual adjustment of\r\nremuneration and pensions, as foreseen in Article 19 of Annex XIII to the Staff\r\nRegulations. The current Commission proposal has the objective of paving the\r\nway for a settlement in case C-453/12 and of avoiding\r\nfurther litigation relating to the 'old' Staff Regulations.\nTherefore, in order to ensure that the\r\napplied pension contribution rate maintains the pension scheme in actuarial\r\nbalance for the reference 5-yearly period and to enable the institutions, as a\r\npart of the global approach to settle the disputes, to take the necessary\r\nmeasures as regards the adjustment of the pension contribution rate in\r\ncompliance with the principles of sincere cooperation among institutions, and\r\ntaking due account of the legitimate expectation of staff, the Commission submits\r\na proposal for a Council Regulation, adjusting from 1 July 2011, 1 July 2012\r\nand 1 July 2013, the rate of contribution to the pension scheme of officials\r\nand other servants.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe impact on revenue of the adjustment to\r\nthe rate of contribution to the pension scheme is detailed in the financial\r\nstatement annexed hereto.\n2014/0214 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nadjusting, from 1 July 2011, 1 July 2012\r\nand 1 July 2013, the rate of contribution to the pension scheme of officials\r\nand other servants of the European Union\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to the Staff Regulations of\r\nOfficials of the European Union and the Conditions of Employment of Other\r\nservants of the European Union laid down by Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No\r\n259/68[6],\r\nand in particular Article 83a thereof and Annex XII thereto, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)                   \r\nThe purpose of Article 19 of Annex XIII to the\r\nStaff Regulations, as last amended by Regulation No 1023/2013 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council, is to enable the institutions to take the\r\nnecessary measures to settle their disputes concerning the 2011 and 2012\r\nadjustments of remuneration and pensions and the 2011 adjustment of the rate of\r\ncontribution to the pension scheme in compliance with a judgment of the Court\r\nof Justice, taking due account of the legitimate expectation of staff that the\r\nCouncil is to decide each year on the adjustment of the rate of contribution to\r\nthe pension scheme.\n(2)                   \r\nAs a part of a global approach to settle the\r\ndisputes and in order to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice in\r\nCase C-63/12, the European Parliament and of the Council have adopted\r\nRegulations No 422/2014 and No 423/2014 of 16 April 2014 adjusting with effect\r\nfrom 1 July 2011 and from 1 July 2012 the remuneration and pensions of\r\nofficials and other servants of the European Union. These adjustments require\r\nthe respective retroactive adjustment of the rate of contribution to the\r\npension scheme for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013. \n(3)                   \r\nIn accordance with Article 13 of Annex XII to\r\nthe Staff Regulations, Eurostat submitted reports on the 2011, 2012 and 2013\r\nactuarial assessments of the pension scheme updating the parameters referred to\r\nin that Annex. According to this assessment, the rate of contribution required\r\nto maintain actuarial balance of the pension scheme is 11.0 % from 1 July 2011,\r\n10.0 % from 1 July 2012 and 10.6 % from 1 July 2013. \n(4)                   \r\nIn the interests of actuarial balance of the\r\npension scheme of officials and other servants of the European Union, the rate\r\nof contribution should therefore be retroactively adjusted to 11.0 % of the\r\nbasic salary from 1 July 2011, 10.0 % of the basic salary from 1 July 2012 and\r\n10.6 % of the basic salary from 1 July 2013. \nHAS ADOPTED THIS
