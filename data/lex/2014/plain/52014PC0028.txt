The focus of this draft proposal is on those areas where market and\nregulatory failures hinder addressing the overarching challenges situated\nwithin the context of the EU's air quality and the Better Regulation Agenda. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe measures are balanced with respect to\ntheir environmental effect and burden for the industry. Cost-effectiveness of\nthe measures is supported by accompanying Impact Assessment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThis proposal introduces a number of amendments\nto the Regulation (EC) 715/2007 and Regulation (EC) 595/2009 with respect to\nthe reduction of pollutant emissions from road vehicles.\n2014/0012 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulations (EC) No 715/2007 and\n(EC) No 595/2009 as regards\u00a0 the reduction of pollutant emissions from road\nvehicles\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reduce\nunnecessary burdens for vehicle manufacturers in case of type-approval of vehicle\nplatforms that could potentially be covered by both light and heavy-duty\nvehicle legislation, the approval of certain heavy-duty vehicles in accordance\nwith the requirements for light-duty vehicles with respect to their pollutant\nemissions should be possible without lowering the level of environmental\nprotection within the Union. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although emissions of\nmethane are not known to have a direct harmful effect on human health, methane\nis a strong greenhouse gas. Therefore, in line with the Communication of the\nCommission on the application and future development of Community legislation\nconcerning vehicle emissions from light-duty vehicles and access to repair and\nmaintenance information (Euro 5 and 6)[2]\nand with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) 715/2007 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council[3],\nthe Commission should consider including methane emissions in the calculation\nof CO2 emissions. \n\u00a0(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\nintroduction of natural gas vehicles the current total hydrocarbons (THC) emission\nlimit should be increased and the effect of methane emissions should be taken\ninto account and expressed as a CO2 equivalent for regulatory and\nconsumer information purposes.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Modern diesel vehicles\nemit high and increasing amounts of NO2 as a share of the total NOx emissions\nwhich were not anticipated when Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 was adopted. Most\nair quality problems in affected urban areas appear to be related to direct NO2\nemissions. Therefore, an appropriate emission limit should be introduced.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current emission\nlimits for CO and total hydrocarbons (THC) after a cold start at low\ntemperature have been carried over from Euro 3 requirements set out in Directive\n98/69/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[4], which appear to be\noutdated in the light of existing vehicle technology and air quality needs. In\naddition, air quality problems and results of vehicle emission measurements\nsuggest the need to introduce an appropriate limit for NOx/NO2\nemissions. Therefore, revised emission limits should be introduced pursuant to\nArticle 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 715/2007.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The emission limit set for\nNH3 in Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council[5]\nis a requirement designed to limit the slip of ammonia from NOx after treatment\ntechnologies which use a urea reagent for the reduction of NOx. The application\nof the NH3 limit value should therefore only be applied to those\ntechnologies and not to positive ignition engines.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve EU air\nquality objectives and to ensure a continuous effort to reduce vehicle\nemissions, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFUE) should be delegated\nto the Commission in respect of the detailed rules on the application of Regulation\n(EC) No 715/2007 to vehicles of categories M1, M2, N1\nand N2 with a reference mass exceeding 2 610 kg but with a maximum\nvehicle mass not exceeding 5 000 kg, the specific procedures, tests and\nrequirements for type approval, the requirements for the implementation of the\nprohibition on the use of defeat devices that reduce the effectiveness of\nemission control systems, the measures necessary for the implementation of the\nobligation of a manufacturer to provide unrestricted and standardised access to\nvehicle repair and maintenance information, the replacement of the information\non the mass of CO2 emissions in the certificate of conformity with information\non total mass of CO2 emissions equivalents, the increase or removal\nof the limit value of total hydrocarbons emissions for positive ignition\nvehicles, the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 for the purposes of\nrecalibrating the particulate mass based limit values and introducing particle\nnumber based limit values that would correlate broadly with the petrol and\ndiesel mass limit values, the adoption of a revised measurement procedure for\nparticulates and a particle number limit value, a limit value for emissions of\nNO2 and limits for tailpipe emissions at cold temperatures for\nvehicles approved as complying with the Euro 6 emission limits. The Commission,\nwhen preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous,\ntimely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European\nParliament and to the Council.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Treaty of Lisbon introduced the possibility for the legislator to delegate power to the Commission\nto adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend\ncertain non-essential elements of a legislative act. The measures which can be\ncovered by delegations of powers, as referred to in Article 290(1) TFEU,\ncorrespond in principle to those covered by the regulatory procedure with\nscrutiny established by Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC[6]. It is therefore\nnecessary to adapt to Article 290 TFEU the provisions in Regulation (EC) No\n715/2007 which provide for the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. \n(9) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The adaptation to Article\n290 TFEU of the provisions in Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 which provided for\nthe use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny carried out by this\nRegulation should not affect pending procedures in which the committee has\nalready delivered its opinion in accordance with Article 5a of Decision\n1999/468/EC before the entry into force of this Regulation.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of Article 4(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) No\n715/2007, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those\npowers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[7].\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 715/2007\nand Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 715/2007 is amended as\nfollows: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 2, paragraph 2 is\nreplaced by the following: \n\"2. After publication of the delegated\nacts adopted in accordance with the second subparagraph and at the\nmanufacturer's request, this Regulation shall apply to vehicles of categories M1,\nM2, N1 and N2 as defined in Annex II to\nDirective 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council* with a\nreference mass exceeding 2 610 kg but with a maximum vehicle mass not exceeding\n5 000 kg. \nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt\ndelegated acts in accordance with Article 14a concerning the detailed rules on\nthe application of this Regulation to vehicles of categories M1, M2,\nN1 and N2 as defined in Annex II to Directive 2007/46/EC\nwith a reference mass exceeding 2 610 kg but with a maximum vehicle mass not\nexceeding 5 000 kg. The delegated acts shall ensure in particular that at\nchassis dynamometer tests the actual operational mass of the vehicle is\nappropriately considered for determining the equivalent inertia as well as\nother default power and load parameters.\n____________________________\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 263, 9.10.2007, p. 1.\".\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 4(4) is replaced by the\nfollowing:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"The Commission shall\nestablish specific procedures and requirements for the implementation of\nparagraphs 2 and 3.
