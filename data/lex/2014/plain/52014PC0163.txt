These rules\r\nwere then further developed and consolidated in the framework of the European\r\nUnion, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. For the\r\npurpose of this proposal, the core elements of the legislation in force are the\r\nfollowing:\n\u2013                        \r\nRegulation (EC) No 562/2006 (Schengen Borders\r\nCode) and its subsequent amendments[3],\r\namong others, lay down the entry conditions for third-country nationals for\r\nshort stays;\n\u2013                        \r\nRegulation (EC) No 539/2001 (Visa Regulation) and\r\nits subsequent amendments[4]\r\nlist the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when\r\ncrossing the external borders for short stays, and list countries whose\r\nnationals are exempt from that requirement;\n\u2013                        \r\nRegulation (EC) No 810/2009 (Visa Code) and its\r\nsubsequent amendments[5]\r\nestablish harmonised procedures and conditions for processing short-stay visa\r\napplications and issuing visas;\n\u2013                        \r\nThe Convention implementing the Schengen\r\nAgreement[6]\r\n(CISA), and its amendments lay down the principle of \u2018mutual recognition\u2019 of\r\nshort-stay visas. They also provide the right of free movement for up to 90\r\ndays in any 180-day period for third-country nationals who hold a valid\r\nresidence permit or valid national long-stay visa issued by one of the Member\r\nStates[7].\nIt is of course also possible for\r\nthird-country nationals to stay longer than three months or 90 days in the\r\nSchengen area, but this should not be done on the basis of the existing\r\nprovisions on short stays. It would require taking up residence in one of the\r\nMember States, so third-country nationals should apply for a residence permit\r\nor long-stay visa from the Member State concerned. Such permits are purpose-bound, issued for the purpose of work, business, study,\r\nfamily reunification, etc., but in principle, not for tourism. There are no\r\ngeneral, horizontal EU-level rules establishing the conditions for issuing\r\nresidence permits or long-stay visas, but there are sectorial directives\r\ncovering specific categories of third-country nationals, e.g. workers or\r\nstudents. However, these Directives do not provide for full harmonisation and\r\nleave Member States room for manoeuvre to provide for exceptions and\r\nderogations and to specify certain details in their national laws.\nThe 90 day/180 day \u2018limitation\u2019 in the Schengen\r\nacquis is not unique in aliens\u2019 law. National legislation on foreigners\r\ntraditionally distinguishes between entries for short stays (one, three, six months)\r\n\u2012 \u2018visitors\u2019 \u2012 particularly for tourism and with less stringent\r\nconditions attached, and the admission of third-country nationals who wish to reside\r\nlonger for work, studies, etc. where stricter conditions apply. \u00a0In any case,\r\nirrespective of the dividing line between short visits and residence and the\r\nconditions imposed on foreigners, national legislation provides appropriate\r\nauthorisations for entry, stays and residence, whatever the length of the\r\nenvisaged stay on a Member State\u2019s territory (visas with different lengths of\r\nvalidity, extension of visas, temporary residence permits, permanent residence\r\npermits, etc.).\nThe current Schengen and the EU migration acquis,\r\nhowever, do not provide a system covering all kinds of envisaged stay comparable\r\nto such national legislation. For legal and political reasons, as described\r\nabove, the Schengen acquis covers short stays in the territory of all\r\nMember States, while EU legal instruments developed in the area of immigration/admission\r\npolicy set up the framework for national legislation in view of admitting\r\nthird-country nationals for stays of more than three months on their own territory.\nThe Schengen area has expanded to 26\r\ncountries and many third-country nationals, such as tourists, live performance\r\nartists, researchers, students, etc., have legitimate reasons for travelling within\r\nthis area for more than 90 days in a given 180-day period without being\r\nconsidered as \u2018immigrants\u2019. They do not want and/or do not need to reside in a\r\nparticular Member State for longer than three months. However, there is no \u2018Schengen\u2019\r\nvisa or other authorisation allowing for a stay of more than three months or 90\r\ndays in the Schengen area.\nOver the years, the Commission has received\r\nmany complaints and requests for solutions regarding this problem from\r\nthird-country nationals, both those who require visas and those who are visa\r\nexempt. The 90 day/180 day \u2018limitation\u2019 may have been appropriate for the size\r\nof the five founding members of the Schengen cooperation. However, when the\r\nSchengen area comprises 26 Member States, it poses a considerable barrier for\r\nmany third-country nationals with legitimate interests in travelling in the\r\nMember States. It also leads to missed economic opportunities for Member States.\nThe main characteristic of the travellers\r\nreporting problems is that they intend to \u2018tour around\u2019 Europe/the Member\r\nStates. They wish to stay longer than 90 days (in any 180 days) in the Schengen\r\narea. So, if they are nationals of third countries who require visas, they\r\ncannot apply for a short-stay, \u2018Schengen\u2019 visa, since these are only issued for\r\ntrips of a maximum of 90 consecutive days. Visa-free third-country nationals, as\r\na rule, are not entitled to do so either. But neither category of third-country\r\nnationals intends to stay for more than 90 days in any Member State, so they cannot obtain a \u2018national\u2019 long-stay visa[8],\r\nor residence permit.\nThis legislative gap between the Schengen acquis\r\nand the EU and national immigration rules means that such travellers should, in\r\nprinciple, leave the Schengen area on the last day of their consecutive 90-day\r\nstay and \u2018wait\u2019 for 90 days outside the Member States before they can return for\r\nanother legal stay. This situation cannot be justified by Member States\u2019 security\r\nconcerns and does not serve their economic, cultural and educational interests.\nIn particular, associations and interest\r\ngroups of live performing artists emphasise that they\r\noften have difficulties in organising tours in Europe due to the 90 day/180 day\r\n\u2018limitation\u2019 of stay. Touring companies generally do not meet the residency\r\nrequirements enabling artists, staff and their family members to obtain\r\nlong-stay visas or residence permits. As the staff of such companies are often\r\nhighly specialised and trained, it is not usually possible to replace them, or it\r\nwould be costly or highly disruptive to do so. According\r\nto examples provided by the European Circus Association (ECA) the loss of\r\nrevenue per engagement (i.e. per city where a well-known group performs) was about\r\nEUR 380 000 in one example and EUR 920 000 in another (local\r\nemployment for ushers, concession, cleaning teams, site rental, taxes and fees,\r\nlocal suppliers, printers, marketing, services, hotels and restaurants, local\r\ntransport services, wages and salaries paid in each city). The ECA also\r\nreported cases in which a company had to substitute/rotate cast and crew to\r\ncomply with the \u2018limitation\u2019 of stay. In one case, replacing 36 staff members\r\ncost the company about EUR 110 000. According to the Performing Arts\r\nEmployers Associations League Europe (Pearle*), the lack of an \u2018alternative\u2019\r\nauthorisation costs the EU between EUR 500 million and 1 billion per annum which\r\nis significant in the current financial and economic context.\nTravel agencies, as well as numerous queries\r\naddressed to the Commission, suggest that more and more \u2018individual\u2019 travellers\r\n(students, researchers, artists and culture professionals, pensioners, business\r\npeople, service providers, etc.) also have a strong interest in being allowed\r\nto circulate for longer than 90 days in any 180-day period within the Schengen\r\narea.\nIn addition, there are many third-country\r\nnationals already residing in the Schengen area with a long-stay visa or residence\r\npermit issued by a Member State who need or want to travel to other Member\r\nStates during or after their stay. For instance, third-country national students\r\nmay like to travel within the Schengen area after finishing their studies for, say,\r\nsix months before returning home. According to Article 21 of the CISA, such persons,\r\nin principle, have the right to move freely in the Member States on the basis\r\nof their valid long-stay visa or residence permit, but the 90 day/180 day \u2018limitation\u2019\r\nalso applies to them.\nThe general rule does not pose any problem\r\nfor the vast majority of travellers and should be kept. But as long ago as 2001,\r\nthe Commission recognised the need to complement it by introducing an\r\nauthorisation for stays of longer than three months in the Schengen area. It proposed\r\na Council Directive on conditions under which\r\nthird-country nationals would have the freedom to travel within the territory\r\nof the Member States for periods not exceeding three months, introducing a\r\nspecific travel authorisation and determining the conditions of entry and\r\nmovement for periods not exceeding six months[9]. \nThe Commission\r\nproposed to introduce a specific travel\r\nauthorisation for third-country nationals planning\r\nto travel in the territory of the Member States for a period of no more than\r\nsix months in any given period of 12 months. The authorisation would have\r\nallowed a consecutive 6-month stay within the Schengen area, but recipients\r\nwould not have stayed for more than three months in any single Member State. This proposal \u2014 which covered several other issues, e.g. expulsion \u2014 was\r\nformally withdrawn by the Commission in March 2006. The main concerns of Member\r\nStates at that time were the legal basis and the anticipated bureaucracy related\r\nto the envisaged permit. Some of them disagreed with the plan to introduce the\r\npermit for third-country nationals requiring a visa for a short stay as they\r\nconsidered that it might affect the integrity of the short-stay visa regime.\nThe legislative gap discussed above forces\r\nMember States to bend the rules and make use of legal instruments not designed\r\nfor \u2018extending\u2019 an authorised stay in the Schengen area: application of Article\r\n20(2)[10]\r\nof the CISA or issuing limited territorial validity visas (LTV visas) under Article\r\n25(1)(b) of the Visa Code[11].\r\nThese practices are described in detail in Annex 7 of the Impact Assessment[12] accompanying the\r\nsimultaneously presented Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council on the Union Code on Visas (Visa Code)(recast)[13].\nIt is therefore desirable to introduce a\r\nnew type of visa both for visa-exempt and visa- requiring third-country\r\nnationals with a legitimate interest in travelling around the Schengen area for\r\nmore than 90 days in any 180-day period.\nThe objective of the proposal is to fill\r\nthe legislative gap between the Schengen acquis on short stays and the\r\nEU/national law on residence in a particular Member State by:\n\u2013                        \r\nestablishing a new type of visa (\u2018touring visa\u2019)\r\nfor an intended stay in two or more Member States lasting more than 90 days but\r\nno more than 1 year (with the possibility of extension up to 2 years), provided\r\nthat the applicant does not intend to stay for more than 90 days in any 180-day\r\nperiod in the same Member State, and\n\u2013                        \r\ndetermining the application procedures and the\r\nissuing conditions for touring visas.\nThe proposal regulates neither the\r\nconditions and procedures on admitting third-country nationals for stays longer\r\nthan three months in a Member State, nor the conditions and procedures for issuing\r\nwork permits or equivalent authorisations (i.e. access to the labour market).\nThough the proposal provides that many\r\nprovisions of the Visa Code should apply to processing the new type of visa, a\r\nseparate proposal is justified, rather than integrating the provisions into the\r\nproposal for amending the Visa Code, as the scope of the latter are the rules\r\nand procedures for issuing visas to third-country nationals who require visas (cf.\r\nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\r\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u00b7                        \r\nConsultation of interested parties\nThis is described in the Impact Assessment (IA)\r\nreferred to in section 1. In general, interest groups \u2014 in particular artists\u2019\r\nassociations \u2014 confirm that the gap in the current legal framework is a serious\r\nimpediment to mobility, be it professional or leisure and welcome the introduction\r\nof a new type of visa. The majority of the Member States, however, seems to be\r\nsceptical as to the need to act in view of the limited group of applicants it\r\nwould concern. Some of the Member States raised concerns regarding the legal\r\nbasis (cf. section 3).\n\u00b7                        \r\nImpact assessment\nThe assessment\r\nof the impact of introducing an authorisation allowing third-country nationals\r\nto stay more than 90 days in any 180-day period in the Schengen area is\r\nincluded in the IA accompanying the proposal amending the\r\nVisa Code.\nThe IA\r\nconsidered two regulatory options. \nOne of the\r\noptions, a new type of authorisation with a\r\nview to an intended stay in the Schengen area lasting\r\nmore than 90 days but no more than 360 days was envisaged \u2018only\u2019 for a limited\r\ngroup of third-country nationals: artists (or sportsmen), culture\r\nprofessionals and their crew members employed by reliable and acknowledged live\r\nperforming companies or organisations and core family members travelling with them.\r\nLimiting the beneficiaries to this group was based on the fact that they seem\r\nto be the main group of third-country nationals affected by the current legislative\r\ngap. \nAnother policy\r\noption envisaged a similar authorisation\r\nnot just for that specific category of third-country nationals, but for all\r\nthird-country nationals (i.e. \u2018individual\u2019 travellers, e.g. tourists, researchers,\r\nstudents, business people). Since the problem is due to a legislative gap\r\nbetween the Schengen acquis on short stays in the Schengen area and the\r\nlegislation on admission of third-country nationals for stays longer than 90 days\r\non the territory of a Member State, a non-regulatory policy option was not\r\ndeveloped.\nThe IA showed[14] that the lack of an\r\nauthorisation allowing travellers to stay more than 90 days in any 180-day\r\nperiod in the Schengen area results in a considerable economic loss to the\r\nEU. According to the study supporting the IA, the number of potential\r\nbeneficiaries of the new authorisation is rather limited. Implementation of the\r\nfirst option might concern approximately 60000 applicants, while the second\r\noption might double the number of potential applicants. These are rather small\r\nnumbers, bearing in mind that there were more than 15 million \u2018Schengen\u2019 visa\r\napplications in 2012 and the number of applications is rising steadily. \nHowever, these\r\ntravellers are considered to be \u2018big spenders\u2019 and therefore likely to generate\r\nconsiderable revenue and to boost economic activity in the EU, not least\r\nbecause they stay longer in the Schengen area. The first option could lead to\r\nan estimated EUR 500 million in additional income to the Schengen area per\r\nyear. The economic impact of the other option is\r\nestimated at around EUR 1 billion. In both options, the economic gain would be due\r\nto the spending of \u2018new\u2019 travellers attracted by a new opportunity to stay\r\nlonger in the Schengen area without using cumbersome \u2018alternatives\u2019 on the borderlines\r\nof legality, such as obtaining LTV visas. \nThe IA also\r\nshowed that the administrative cost of processing the\r\nnew type of authorisation would not be significant, given the limited number of\r\napplications expected and the fee to be charged. For third-country nationals today,\r\nmaking applications for new visas or for extensions already implies costs. Regarding\r\nthe second option, the IA pointed out a specific risk: some holders of the new\r\nauthorisation might seek employment on the black market.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \r\nDetailed explanation of the proposal\nThe objective of the proposal is to fill a legislative\r\ngap. Therefore, Article 1 of the proposal establishes a new type of visa,\r\ncalled \u2018touring visa\u2019 (T-type visa). This Article also makes clear that the Regulation does not\r\naffect the admission/immigration acquis. This implies, for instance,\r\nthat the Regulation does not affect Member States\u2019 legislation on the\r\nimpact of \u2018absence\u2019 of residing third-country nationals on their residence\r\npermits while they travel in other Member States on the basis of a touring visa.\r\nThird-country nationals who exercise (intra-EU) mobility under EU rules are not\r\ncovered by the Regulation either.\nArticle 2 sets\r\na fundamental principle by making a cross reference to the provisions of the\r\nVisa Code and Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 concerning\r\nthe Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member\r\nStates on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation)[15].\r\nThe touring visa is quite distinct in many ways from\r\nthe short-stay visa as defined in Article 2 of the Visa Code. However, it is very\r\nsimilar to a uniform visa as in principle, it is valid for the territory of all\r\nMember States. The new type of visa is established on the legal basis of\r\nshort-stay visas and permits, namely Article 77 of the TFEU. Therefore it is\r\njustified in principle to apply the relevant provisions of the Visa Code to the\r\ntouring visa. The subsequent provisions (Articles 4 to 9) specify in detail\r\nwhich provisions of the Visa Code will be applicable as regards the conditions\r\nand procedures for issuing touring visas, and lay down the derogations\r\nfrom and additions to these rules, taking into account the specificities\r\nof the new type of visa. For that purpose, the subsequent articles follow the\r\nstructure of the Visa Code, taking chapter by chapter and confirming for every\r\nsingle provision whether it applies and whether there are any additions or\r\nderogations. Since the Commission is simultaneously proposing a recast of the\r\nVisa Code[16],\r\nthis proposal will refer to the provisions of the proposed recast regulation\r\nrather than the existing regulation[17].\r\nThe VIS Regulation, as amended by this proposal, will fully apply to the\r\ntouring visa without any need for additions or derogations. \nArticle 3 provides\r\nthat certain definitions contained in the Visa Code (e.g. \u2018third-country national\u2019,\r\n\u2018visa sticker\u2019, \u2018application\u2019, \u2018consulate\u2019) are also applicable to this\r\nproposal. In addition it defines the \u2018touring visa\u2019 as an authorisation issued by a Member State with a view to an intended stay in two or more Member States for a total of more than 90\r\ndays in any 180-day period, provided that the applicant does not intend to stay\r\nfor more than 90 days in any 180-day period[18] in the same Member State. With this\r\nlatter \u2018limitation\u2019, admissions for stays longer than three months in one\r\n  Member State are excluded.\nArticle 4 sets\r\nout the provisions in the Visa Code on the authorities taking part in the\r\nprocedures relating to applications which should apply to the touring visa. It\r\nexcludes the possibility of applications for touring visas to be lodged at the\r\nexternal borders, as authorising a stay of possibly up to two years in the\r\nSchengen area requires thorough scrutiny that can never be carried out at\r\nexternal borders. This Article also derogates from Article 5 of the Visa Code\r\nby stating that the Member State competent to examine and decide on an application for a touring visa should be\r\nthe Member State whose external border the applicant intends to cross to enter\r\nthe territory of the Member States. This is justified by the fact that for many\r\nthird-country nationals who wish to tour the Schengen area for longer than 90\r\ndays, the provisions of the current Visa Code (main destination in terms of\r\npurpose or length of stay) would hardly be applicable. The purpose of the visit\r\nis, in principle, the same in all Member States (e.g. live performance or\r\ntourism), while in many cases, applicants may not know in advance the length of\r\ntheir stays in different Member States. Finally, Article 4 entitles certain\r\ncategories of third-country nationals to lodge the touring\r\nvisa application in the territory of the Member State where they are legally\r\npresent. This is justified, as many third-country nationals residing in the\r\nterritory of the Member States, as well as third-country nationals exempt from\r\nthe obligation to be in a possession of a visa for stays of up to 90 days\r\n(short stays), have sufficient financial means and a legitimate interest in\r\ncirculating in other Member States for longer than 90 days in a given 180-day\r\nperiod while residing/staying in a specific Member State (or immediately after\r\nsuch residence). It is neither in the security interests nor in the economic\r\ninterests of the Union to require these persons to leave the Schengen area to\r\napply for a touring visa in their country of origin.\nArticle 5 specifies\r\nthe provisions in the Visa Code that are applicable to the application process\r\nfor a touring visa and lays down additional provisions and exceptions. It requires the applicant to present a valid travel document\r\nrecognised by the Member State competent to examine and decide on an application and at least\r\none other Member State to be visited. An additional condition for applicants is\r\nto present appropriate proof that they intend to stay in\r\nthe territory of two or more Member States for longer than 90 days in total without\r\nstaying for more than 90 days in any 180-day period in the territory of any one\r\nof these Member States. The Article does not provide derogations from the Visa\r\nCode regarding the visa fee which will therefore be EUR 60, (i.e. the\r\nstandard visa fee for an application for a short-stay visa). This is justified\r\nas the tasks of the consulates, irrespective of whether they process short-stay\r\nor touring visa applications, are basically the same. The provisions of the\r\nVisa Code regarding the reduction and waiver of the visa fee should also apply.\r\nSimilarly, the provisions of the Visa Code shall apply regarding the service\r\nfee that can be charged by external service providers and which must not exceed\r\nhalf the EUR 60 visa fee.\nAnother important criterion\r\nset out in this Article is that applicants will have to demonstrate their sufficient means of\r\nsubsistence and stable economic situation by means of salary slips or bank\r\nstatements covering a period of 12 months prior to the date of the application,\r\nand/or supporting documents that demonstrate they will acquire sufficient\r\nfinancial means lawfully during their stay (e.g. proof of entitlement to a pension).\r\nAccording to this Article, applicants in possession of\r\na touring visa shall be allowed to apply in the Member State where they are\r\nlegally present for work permit(s) required in the subsequent Member States. This\r\nprovision does not interfere with provisions related to access to the labour\r\nmarket, and does not regulate whether a work permit is required; nor does it\r\naffect issuing conditions. It solely regulates the place of application, insofar\r\nas a third-country national should be allowed to apply for a work permit\r\nwithout leaving the Schengen area. The Article envisages certain procedural\r\nfacilitations (i.e. possible waiver of submitting certain supporting documents)\r\nfor specific categories of applicants who work for or are invited by a reliable\r\nand acknowledged company, organisation or institution, in particular, at\r\nmanagerial level or as researcher, artist, culture professionals, etc.\r\nStakeholders rightly claim that for these categories of persons, the procedure\r\nshould focus not only on the \u2018individual\u2019 applicant, but also on the reliable\r\nstatus of the sending/hosting/inviting company/organisation/institution.\nApart from the reference to the general\r\nprovisions of the Visa Code on the examination of and decision on an\r\napplication that shall be applicable to touring visas, the core provision in Article\r\n6 is that particular attention should be paid to the applicant\u2019s financial\r\nstatus: sufficient financial means of subsistence for the overall duration of\r\nthe intended stay, including sufficient means to cover accommodation. This\r\nArticle also lays down a general 20 calendar day deadline for deciding on an application.\r\nThis is more than the current processing time for applications for a short-stay\r\nvisa and justified by the need for thorough scrutiny of the applicant\u2019s financial\r\nsituation. \nAs it is necessary to clarify the\r\ninteraction between stays on the basis of existing short-stay visas, long-stay\r\nvisas and residence permits versus stays on the basis of touring visas to\r\nincorporate the new type of visa into the \u2018system\u2019, Article 6 allows for the combination\r\nof stays on the basis of touring visas with previous/future visa-free stays,\r\nstays on the basis of short-stay visas, long-stay visas or residence permits. Similar\r\nprovisions will be introduced in the Visa Code and the Schengen Borders Code.\nArticle 7\r\ndeals with the issuing of the touring visa, where specified provisions of the\r\nVisa Code should also apply. The Article stipulates that the touring visa must always\r\nallow for multiple entries. As regards the length of the authorised stay \u2014 in\r\nconjunction with Article 8 \u2014 the Proposal provides the possibility of a stay of\r\nup to two consecutive years in the Schengen area for all third country\r\nnationals who can prove they fulfil the conditions for such a long period. When assessing an application, and in particular when defining\r\nthe length of an authorised stay, consulates should take into account all\r\nrelevant factors, e.g. the fact that citizens of third countries whose\r\nnationals are exempt from the visa requirement for short stays traditionally do\r\nnot pose problems of irregular migration or security risks. The period of\r\nvalidity of the visa should correspond to the length of authorised stay. Due to\r\nthe nature of the new visa, the Article excludes the possibility of issuing a touring\r\nvisa with a validity limited to the territory of one Member State. A touring visa, by definition, is supposed to allow applicants to circulate in several\r\nMember States. \nThe touring visa is to be issued in the\r\nuniform format (visa sticker) laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1683/95, and\r\nshall bear the letter \u2018T\u2019 as an indication of its type. Article 77(2)(a) of the\r\nTFEU refers to both \u2018visas\u2019 and \u2018short-stay residence permits\u2019. Given that\r\nresidence permits are issued in a (plastic) card format in accordance with\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1030/2002 of 13 June 2002[19],\r\nand bearing in mind that most Member State consulates are not equipped to issue\r\npermits in card format, it would create an excessive burden for Member States\r\nto be required to issue the new authorisation in card format.\nArticle 8 concerns\r\nthe modification of an issued visa, i.e. its extension, annulment and\r\nrevocation. It provides the possibility of extending the length of authorised\r\nstay for a period of up to 2 years. Contrary to the provisions for extending a\r\nshort-stay visa, applicants will not be required to justify \u2018exceptional\u2019\r\ncircumstances. In fact, many potential applicants for this type of visa (especially\r\nlive performance artists) often need to stay for long periods in the Schengen\r\narea without setting up residence in any of the Member States. To apply for the\r\nextension of a touring visa, the applicant will have to prove they continue to\r\nfulfil the entry and visa issuing conditions and that the ongoing stay will\r\ncomply with the requirement of not staying for more\r\nthan 90 days in any 180-day period in one Member State. \nArticle 9 specifies the provisions in the Visa Code's chapter\r\non \u2018Administrative management and organisation\u2019 that\r\nshould also apply for the purpose of issuing touring visas. In the framework of\r\nlocal Schengen cooperation, consulates should exchange statistics and other information\r\non touring visas. \nArticles 10 to 16 are so-called final and/or operational articles, among others,\r\ndealing with the operational instructions on the processing of touring visas\r\n(in which further clarification will be provided as regards the relationship\r\nbetween the Visa Code provisions and the provisions set out in this Proposal),\r\nmonitoring, entry into force, etc. The main objective of the amendments of the Schengen\r\nBorders Code and the VIS Regulation is to \u2018integrate\u2019 the touring visa into the\r\nSchengen acquis. \nFirst and foremost, it means that the entry\r\nconditions set out in Article 5 of the Schengen Borders Code also apply as conditions\r\nfor the issuing of a touring visa and, in addition, it must be ensured that touring\r\nvisa applications/visas are registered in the VIS. It must be noted, however,\r\nthat the proposal also concerns third-country nationals who are exempt from the\r\nshort-stay visa requirement (cf. Annex II of the Visa Regulation and whose data\r\nare thus not registered in the VIS) since, in principle, travellers from these\r\ncountries do not pose security and migratory risks for the Member States.\r\nTherefore, bearing in mind the principle of proportionality, collecting the\r\nfingerprints of nationals of such third countries (e.g. Australia, Canada, United States) is not justified. This exemption is provided in Article 5 and opens the way for Member States to accept the submission of touring\r\nvisa applications electronically or by post from citizens of these third\r\ncountries.\nArticle 12 requires further explanation. It partially repeals Article 20(2) of\r\nthe CISA, according to which, if a Member State\r\nconcluded a bilateral visa waiver agreement with a third country on the list in\r\nAnnex II of the Visa Regulation (\u2018visa-free list\u2019) before the entry into force\r\nof the CISA (or the date of the Member State\u2019s later accession to the Schengen\r\nAgreement), the provisions of that bilateral agreement may serve as a basis for\r\nthat Member State to \u2018extend\u2019 a visa-free stay for longer than three months in\r\nits territory for nationals of the third country concerned. \nThus, for\r\nexample, citizens of Canada, New Zealand or the United States can stay in such\r\nMember States for the period provided by the bilateral visa waiver agreement in\r\nforce between the Member States and these three countries (usually three months),\r\nin addition to the general 90-day stay in the Schengen area. For these\r\ncountries, the Commission is aware of several bilateral agreements, meaning their\r\ncitizens can legally stay for a virtually unlimited period in the Schengen area\r\non the basis of short-stay visa waivers. New Zealand, for instance, has 16\r\nbilateral visa waiver agreements, so on top of the 90-day visa-free stay based\r\non the Visa Regulation, its citizens can in practice remain in the territory of\r\nthe Schengen area for 51 months (three months plus 48 months). \nAlready in\r\n1998, Member States considered that such an unlimited stay was not compatible\r\nwith the spirit of an area without frontiers. The Executive Committee adopted a\r\nDecision concerning the harmonisation of agreements on the removal of the visa\r\nrequirement[20].\r\nAccording to this Decision, Member States were to introduce standard clauses in\r\ntheir bilateral agreements limiting the duration of visa-free stays to three months\r\nper six months in the Schengen area (rather than in the territory of the Member State concerned).\nAfter the incorporation of the Schengen acquis\r\ninto the Community framework by the entry into force of the Treaty of\r\nAmsterdam, Article 20(2) of the CISA ran counter not only to the spirit of the\r\nfrontier-free area, but also became incompatible with the Treaty: Article 62(3)\r\nof the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC) referred to \u2018measures\r\nsetting out the conditions under which nationals of third countries shall have the\r\nfreedom to travel within the territory of the Member States during a period of no\r\nmore than three months\u2019. Therefore, the Commission in its 2001 \u2018right to\r\ntravel\u2019 initiative proposed to repeal Article 20(2).\nThe Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) no longer\r\nlimits the \u2018short stay\u2019 in the Schengen area to three months; it does not\r\nspecify its duration. However, Article 20(2) and the existence of bilateral \u2018extensions\r\nof stays\u2019 is still incompatible with 77(2)(a) and (c) of the Treaty, because the\r\ncommon policy on visas cannot be based on the existence of bilateral agreements\r\nfrom the past. The scope of third-country nationals\u2019 freedom to travel should not\r\ndepend on the number and content of bilateral agreements concluded in the past.\r\nThe same rules should apply to all visa-free third-country nationals. The\r\nimplementation of Article 20(2) raises practical problems and creates legal\r\nuncertainty both for authorities and travellers, especially when the latter are\r\nto depart from the Schengen area. In addition, the future Entry/Exit System\r\nrequires clear-cut rules and for technical reasons, account cannot be taken of the\r\npossible continued application of bilateral visa waiver agreements when the\r\nperiod of authorised stay is to be verified. Finally, one of the ideas behind introducing\r\nthe touring visa is to provide a legal framework and appropriate authorisation enabling\r\nvisa-free third-country nationals to stay in the Schengen area for longer than\r\n90 days.\nThe proposal provides for a five-year transitional\r\nperiod for Member States to \u2018phase out\u2019 the impact of their bilateral agreements\r\nas far as the overall length of stay of third-country nationals is concerned in\r\nthe Schengen area. This takes time and it must be also acknowledged that\r\ncertain third countries attach high importance to keeping the status quo.\r\n\nFrom a political point of view, this is\r\nunderstandable. A visa waiver agreement is among those legal instruments which\r\nbring concrete and direct benefit for citizens on both sides. It must be made\r\nclear that partially deleting Article 20(2) does not imply that these agreements\r\nare immediately and fully becoming inapplicable. In addition, replacing the\r\nexisting regime of extending short stays on the basis of old bilateral visa\r\nwaiver agreements with a new type of visa for up to one year \u2014 with the\r\npossibility of extension up to two years \u2014 would not have a negative impact on\r\nmany Americans, Canadians, New Zealanders, etc. in practice. Many of those who\r\nwant to stay a year or more, are likely to work during that period and will\r\ntherefore need to take up residence in one of the Member States and\r\nconsequently apply for a long-stay visa or residence permit.\n\u00b7                        \r\nLink with the simultaneously tabled proposal for\r\na Regulation recasting the Visa Code and other proposals\nNegotiations on\r\nthe simultaneously tabled proposal for a Regulation recasting\r\nthe Visa Code will have an impact on this proposal, so particular attention should\r\nbe paid to ensuring the necessary synergies between these two proposals during\r\nthe negotiation process. If in the course of these negotiations an adoption\r\nwithin a similar timeframe appears within reach, the Commission intends to merge\r\nthe two proposals into one single recast proposal. \nSimilarly, at a\r\nlater stage, synergies will have to be ensured with the Proposal for a Regulation\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an Entry/Exit System\r\n(EES) to register entry and exit data of third-country nationals crossing the\r\nexternal borders of the Member States of the European Union[21]. Its subject matter\r\nand scope might require changes if it is decided to make use of the EES to\r\ncontrol the entries and exits of touring visa holders at the external borders[22].\n\u00b7                        \r\nLegal basis\nArticle 77 of the TFEU\r\nconfers the power on the Union to act on \u2018short-stays\u2019 in the Schengen area. According\r\nto Article 77(2) of the TFEU:\n\u2018[\u2026] the European Parliament and the\r\nCouncil, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, shall\r\nadopt measures concerning:\n(a) the common policy on visas and other\r\nshort-stay residence permits;\n(b) the checks to which persons crossing\r\nexternal borders are subject;\n(c) the conditions under which nationals\r\nof third countries shall have the freedom to travel within the Union for a short period;\u2019\nThis proposal contains\r\nmeasures concerning each of these three elements. Article 77(2)(a), (b) and (c)\r\nTFEU therefore appears to be the appropriate legal basis for the proposal.\nArticle 79 TFEU confers\r\nthe power on the Union, in the framework of a common immigration policy,\r\nto legislate on long-stay visas and residence permits which both relate to\r\nlegal residence in Member States, i.e. to long-term stays in a single\r\n  Member State. The introductory paragraph (1) of Article 79 as well as paragraph\r\n(2)(b) explicitly refer to third-country nationals residing legally in\r\nMember States. The target group of this proposal neither want nor need to reside\r\nin any of the Member States; they rather wish to travel around Europe, i.e. to circulate within the Schengen area, before leaving it again. Article\r\n79 TFEU is therefore not an appropriate legal basis for the proposal.\nArticle 62 TEC, which preceded Article 77\r\nTFEU, in its third paragraph referred to \u2018measures setting out the\r\nconditions under which nationals of third countries shall have the freedom to\r\ntravel within the territory of the Member States during a period of no more\r\nthan three months\u2019. Article 77(2)(c) TFEU no longer limits the \u2018short\r\nperiod\u2019 to three months. This clear change in the Treaty took away an\r\nobstacle which there might have been under the previous treaties to adopting a\r\nsimilar proposal.\nIn conclusion, Article 77(2)(a), (b) and\r\n(c) of the TFEU is the appropriate legal basis for this proposal, which intends\r\nto regulate the circulation by third-country nationals in the Schengen area and\r\nfrom which situations falling under Article 79 TFEU (admission\r\nfor long-term stays in the territory of a single Member State) are excluded. The\r\nlatter element is ensured by the proposed definition according to which holders\r\nof the touring visa should not be allowed to stay for more than 90 days in any\r\n180-day period in the territory of the same Member State. \n\u00b7                        \r\nSubsidiarity and proportionality principle\nArticle\r\n5(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) states that, in areas which do not\r\nfall within its exclusive competence, the Union shall act only if and insofar\r\nas the objective of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the\r\nMember States, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the\r\nproposed action, be better achieved at Union level. With regard to this\r\nproposal, the need for intervention at Union level is very clear. Any\r\nauthorisation which would be valid in all Member States can only be introduced\r\nat EU level; the \u2018mutual recognition\u2019 of each other\u2019s touring visas cannot be\r\nset up at national level. The issuing conditions and\r\nprocedures should be uniform for all Member States. This can only be\r\nattained through action at Union level.\nArticle 5(4) of the TEU states that action by the Union shall not go\r\nbeyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty. The form\r\nchosen for this EU action must enable the proposal to achieve its objective and\r\nbe implemented as effectively as possible. This proposal does not contain any\r\nelements which would not be directly related to the objectives. It is also proportional\r\nin terms of costs. The proposal therefore complies with the proportionality\r\nprinciple.\n\u00b7                        \r\nChoice of instrument\nThis Proposal will establish a new type of visa\r\nwhich in principle shall be valid in all Member States and determine the conditions\r\nand procedures for issuing this visa. Therefore only a Regulation can be chosen\r\nas a legal instrument.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL\r\nELEMENTS\n\u00b7                        \r\nParticipation\nThis proposal\r\nbuilds on the Schengen acquis in that it concerns the further development\r\nof common policy on visas. Therefore, the following consequences in relation to\r\nthe various protocols annexed to the treaties and agreements with associated\r\ncountries have to be considered:\nDenmark: In\r\naccordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (no 22) on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and TFEU, Denmark does not take part in the adoption by the Council of\r\nmeasures pursuant to Title V of part Three of the TFEU. Given that this\r\nRegulation builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark should, in\r\naccordance with Article 4 of that Protocol, decide within a period of 6 months\r\nafter the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will implement it\r\nin its national law.\nUnited\r\nKingdom and Ireland: In accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the Protocol integrating the\r\nSchengen acquis into the framework of the European Union and Council\r\nDecision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Council Decision 2002/192/EC\r\nof 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland\u2019s request to take part in some of the\r\nprovisions of the Schengen acquis, the United Kingdom and Ireland do not\r\ntake part in implementation of the common visa policy and in particular,\r\nRegulation (EC) No 810/2009 establishing a Community Code on Visas (Visa Code).\r\nTherefore, the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part in the adoption of\r\nthis Regulation and are not bound by it or subject to its application.\nIceland and Norway: The procedures laid down in the Association Agreement concluded by\r\nthe Council and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latter\u2019s association with the implementation, application and development\r\nof the Schengen acquis are applicable, since the present proposal builds\r\non the Schengen acquis as defined in Annex A of this Agreement[23].\nSwitzerland: This Regulation constitutes a\r\ndevelopment of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, as provided for by\r\nthe Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation\r\non the Confederation\u2019s association with the implementation, application and\r\ndevelopment of the Schengen acquis[24].\nLiechtenstein: This Regulation constitutes a\r\ndevelopment of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, as provided for by\r\nthe Protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation\r\nand the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of\r\nLiechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European\r\nCommunity and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation\u2019s association\r\nwith the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis[25].\nCyprus: This Regulation constitutes an act\r\nbuilding on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it, as provided\r\nfor by Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession.\nBulgaria and Romania: This Regulation\r\nconstitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related\r\nto it, as provided for by Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession.\nCroatia: This Regulation constitutes an act\r\nbuilding on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it, as provided\r\nfor by Article 4(2) of the 2011 Act of Accession.\n2014/0095 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nestablishing a touring visa and amending\r\nthe Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement and Regulations (EC) No\r\n562/2006 and (EC) No 767/2008\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 77(2)(a), (b) and\r\n(c) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission[26],\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[27],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union legislation\r\nestablished harmonised rules concerning the entry and stay of third-country\r\nnationals in the Member States for up to 90 days in any 180-day period.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several sectorial Directives\r\nhave been adopted regarding the conditions for admission of third-country\r\nnationals to the territory of the Member States for a period exceeding three months.\r\nArticle 21 of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement[28] grants third-country\r\nnationals who hold valid residence permits or national long-stay visas issued\r\nby one of the Member States the right of free movement within the territory of\r\nthe other Member States for up to 90 days in any 180-day period.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Visa-requiring and visa-exempt\r\nthird-country nationals may have a legitimate interest in travelling within the\r\nSchengen area for more than 90 days in a given 180-day period without staying in\r\nany single Member State for more than 90 days. Rules should therefore be\r\nadopted to allow for this possibility.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Live performance artists, in\r\nparticular, often experience difficulties in organising\r\ntours in the Union. Students, researchers, culture\r\nprofessionals, pensioners, business people, service providers as well as\r\ntourists may also wish to stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period in the\r\nSchengen area. The lack of appropriate authorisation leads to a loss of\r\npotential visitors and consequently to an economic loss.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Treaty distinguishes\r\nbetween, on the one hand, the conditions of entry to the Member States and the\r\ndevelopment of a common policy on short-stay visas, and on the other hand, the\r\nconditions of entry for the purpose of residing legally in a Member State and issuing\r\nlong-stay visas and residence permits for that purpose. However, the Treaty\r\ndoes not define the notion of short stay.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A new type of visa (\u2018touring\r\nvisa\u2019) should be established for both visa-exempt and visa-requiring third-country\r\nnationals planning to circulate in the territory of\r\ntwo or more Member States for more than 90 days, provided that they do not\r\nintend to stay for more than 90 days in any 180-day period in the territory of\r\nthe same Member State. At the same time, the 90 days per 180 days rule\r\nshould be maintained as a general dividing line between short stays and long stays,\r\nas it does not pose any problems for the vast majority of travellers.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where relevant, the provisions\r\nof Regulation (EU) No xxx/201x of the European Parliament and of the Council[29]\r\nand Regulation (EC) No 767/2008\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[30]\r\nshould apply to the application for and the issuing of touring visas. Given the\r\ndifferent needs and conditions of third-country nationals applying for touring\r\nvisas and due to economic and security considerations, specific rules should\r\nnevertheless be introduced, among others, as regards the authorities taking\r\npart in the procedures, the application phase, the examination of and decision\r\non applications and the issuing and refusal of touring visas.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nationals of third\r\ncountries listed in Annex II of Council Regulation\r\n(EC) No 539/2001[31] should benefit from certain facilitations,\r\nsuch as the exemption from the collection of fingerprints.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The interaction between\r\nstays on the basis of short-stay visas, long-stay visas and residence permits\r\nand stays on the basis of touring visas should be clarified to ensure legal\r\ncertainty. It should be possible to combine stays on the basis of touring visas\r\nwith previous and future visa-free stays, stays on the basis of short-stay visas,\r\nlong-stay visas or residence permits. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be possible to\r\nextend the authorised stay, taking into consideration specific travel patterns\r\nand needs, provided that holders of a touring visa continue to fulfil the entry\r\nand visa issuing conditions and can prove that during their prolonged stay,\r\nthey comply with the requirement of not staying for\r\nmore than 90 days in any 180-day period in the territory of the same Member\r\nState\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The touring visa scheme\r\nshould be integrated into the relevant legal instruments of the Schengen acquis.\r\nTherefore, amendments should be introduced to Regulation\r\n(EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council[32] and to Regulation (EC) No 767/2008. The entry conditions set out in Article\r\n5 of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 should apply as visa issuing conditions. Touring visa applications\r\nand decisions on touring visas should be registered in the Visa Information\r\nSystem.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the establishment\r\nof the touring visa, Article 20(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen\r\nAgreement should be amended as it is incompatible with 77(2)(a) and (c) of the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union due to the fact that the common\r\npolicy on visas cannot be based on the existence or non-existence of bilateral visa\r\nwaiver agreements concluded by Member States. The authorised length of stay of\r\nthird-country nationals should not depend on the number and content of such bilateral\r\nagreements concluded in the past.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A five-year transitional\r\nperiod should be provided for phasing out the impact of bilateral visa waiver\r\nagreements as far as the overall length of stay of third-country nationals in\r\nthe Schengen area is concerned.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be\r\nconferred on the Commission in respect of establishing operational instructions\r\non the practices and procedures to\r\nbe followed by Member States when processing touring visa applications.\r\nThose powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[33].\r\nThe examination procedure should be used for the\r\nadoption of such implementing acts.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\r\nRegulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised\r\nby the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

In accordance with the\r\nprinciple of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does\r\nnot go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\r\n1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 22) on the position of Denmark, annexed to the\r\nTreaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not\r\nbound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds\r\nupon the Schengen acquis, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of\r\nthat Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has\r\ndecided on this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation constitutes\r\na development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC[35]; the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or\r\nsubject to its application.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation constitutes\r\na development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council
