Negotiations\r\nof the comprehensive and ambitious Association Agreement between the EU and the\r\n  Republic of Moldova were launched in January 2010. In January 2012, the EU\r\nand the Republic of Moldova also launched negotiations on the Deep and\r\nComprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) part, as a core element of the\r\nAssociation Agreement. \nThe Association Agreement aims to accelerate the deepening\r\nof political and economic relations between the Republic of Moldova and the EU, as well as to advance the Republic of Moldova's gradual\r\neconomic integration with the EU Internal Market in selected areas, inter alia\r\nthrough a DCFTA, as an integral part of the Agreement. \nThe Agreement is a concrete way to exploit the dynamics in\r\nEU-Moldova relations, focusing on support to core reforms, on economic recovery\r\nand growth, governance and cooperation in different sectors. The Agreement also\r\nconstitutes a reform agenda for the Republic of Moldova, based on a\r\ncomprehensive programme of approximation of the Republic of Moldova's legislation to EU norms and standards, around which all partners of the Republic of   Moldova are invited to align themselves and focus their assistance. Future EU\r\nassistance to the Republic of Moldova is linked with the reform agenda as it\r\nemerges from the Agreement. In view of preparing and facilitating the\r\nimplementation of the Association Agreement, an Association Agenda has been\r\nprepared. \nFollowing the 15th\r\nPlenary in March 2013 and the 7th DCFTA round in June 2013, the EU\r\nand the Republic of Moldova finalised the negotiations on the Association\r\nAgreement. On 29 November 2013, the European Union and the Republic of Moldova initialled the text of the Association Agreement, including the DCFTA part.\r\n\nIn line with Article\r\n465 of the Association Agreement, it is foreseen to provisionally apply parts\r\nof the Agreement. Provisional application is foreseen in view of keeping mutual\r\neconomic interests and shared values in equilibrium, and the common will of the\r\nEU and the Republic of Moldova to start implementing and enforcing the eligible\r\nparts of the Agreement in order to advance an early reform impact on sector\r\nspecific issues before the conclusion of the Agreement.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\r\nOF THE NEGOTIATIONS\nThe Council has been\r\nregularly informed and consulted in the relevant Council Working Groups, notably\r\nin COEST and the Trade Policy Committee (TPC), at all stages of the\r\nnegotiations. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council\r\nin its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft Association\r\nAgreement is acceptable to the Union.\nThe final content of\r\nthe Association Agreement can be summarised as follows:\nThe Agreement\r\nestablishes an association between the Union and its Member States of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova of the other part. This constitutes a new\r\nstage in the development of EU-Moldova contractual relations, aiming at\r\npolitical association and economic integration and leaving open the way for\r\nfurther progressive developments. \nThe overall aims of the\r\nassociation focus on promoting a gradual rapprochement between the parties on\r\nthe basis of common values; strengthening the framework for enhanced political\r\ndialogue; promoting, preserving and strengthening peace and stability in both\r\nthe regional and international dimensions; establishing conditions for enhanced\r\neconomic and trade relations leading towards the Republic of Moldova's gradual\r\neconomic integration with the EU internal market in selected areas; enhancing justice,\r\nfreedom and security cooperation with the aim of reinforcing the rule of law\r\nand respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and establishing\r\nconditions for increasingly close cooperation in other areas of mutual\r\ninterest. \nThe General\r\nPrinciples of the Agreement include a specific set of \"essential\r\nelements\", the violation of which by one of the Parties could give rise to\r\nspecific measures under the Agreement, including the suspension of rights and\r\nobligations. These elements are; respect for democratic principles, human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms as defined in relevant international\r\ninstruments; respect for the rule of law; and countering the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, related materials and means of delivery. \nOther General\r\nPrinciples of the Agreement relate to the principles of a free market\r\neconomy, good governance, the fight against corruption, the fight against\r\ntrans-national organised crime and terrorism, the promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and effective multilateralism.\nThe Agreement sets out the\r\naims of a strengthened political dialogue promoting gradual convergence\r\non foreign and security matters. The Agreement provides for dialogue and\r\ncooperation on domestic reform based on the common principles set out by the\r\nParties. There are also provisions for intensified dialogue and cooperation on\r\nforeign and security policy, including on Common Security and Defence Policy,\r\nfor the promotion of peace and international justice by implementing the Rome\r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, and for joint efforts on\r\nanti-terrorism, anti-proliferation and disarmament and arms control. The\r\nAgreement further reiterates the Parties' commitment to a sustainable solution\r\nto the Transnistrian issue, in full respect of the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of the Republic of Moldova as well as to facilitating jointly\r\npost-conflict rehabilitation. \nIn the field of justice,\r\nfreedom and security, the Agreement pays particular attention to the rule\r\nof law and to the effective functioning of institutions in the areas of law\r\nenforcement and the administration of justice. The Agreement sets out the\r\nframework for cooperation on migration, asylum and border management, on\r\npersonal data protection, money laundering and terrorism and on anti-drugs\r\npolicy. The Agreement contains provisions on movement of persons, including on\r\nreadmission, on visa facilitation and on the gradual steps towards a visa-free\r\nregime in due course provided that relevant conditions for well-managed and\r\nsecure mobility are in place. The commitment to combat crime, corruption and\r\nother illegal activities and the further development of judicial cooperation in\r\ncivil and criminal matters is also covered - making full use of relevant\r\ninternational and bilateral instruments. \nThe Association\r\nAgreement also foresees a wide range of sector cooperation, focusing on support\r\nto core reforms, economic recovery and growth, governance and sector\r\nco-operation in 28 areas, such as: public administration reform, management of\r\npublic finances, energy, transport, environmental protection and promotion,\r\nindustrial and small and medium enterprise cooperation, social policies,\r\nconsumer protection, agriculture and rural development, cross-border and\r\nregional level cooperation, education, training, civil service cooperation and\r\nyouth as well as cultural cooperation. In all of these areas, enhanced\r\ncooperation starts from the basis of current frameworks, both bilateral and\r\nmultilateral, with the aim of more systematic dialogue and exchange of\r\ninformation and good practice. Key to the sectoral cooperation parts of the\r\nAgreement is a comprehensive menu of gradual approximation set out in the annexes\r\nto the Agreement. Specific schedules for approximation and implementation by the\r\n Republic of Moldova of selected parts of the EU acquis will provide a\r\nfocus for on-going cooperation, and will form the core of the Republic of Moldova's domestic reform and modernisation agenda. \nThe Agreement includes\r\nan updated institutional framework encompassing cooperation and dialogue fora.\r\nSpecific decision-making roles are foreseen for an Association Council, and by\r\ndelegation, for an Association Committee, which may also meet in a specific\r\nconfiguration to address trade issues. Fora for civil society and parliamentary\r\ncooperation are also foreseen. The Agreement also includes provisions on\r\nmonitoring, approximation, fulfilment of obligations and dispute settlement\r\n(including separate provisions for trade-related matters). \nWith regard to the DCFTA\r\npart of the Agreement, the Commission has reached the objectives set out in the\r\nnegotiating directives to dismantle import duties on substantially all trade,\r\nwhile providing a strong binding framework to ban all arbitrary\r\ntrade-restrictive measures, including export duties and quantitative export\r\nrestrictions. The DCFTA foresees specific, time-bound provisions for sensitive\r\nproducts and issues, especially through transitional periods, selected\r\ntariff-rate quotas, and the anti-circumvention mechanism for sensitive\r\nagricultural products.\nIn terms of technical\r\nbarriers to trade, the Republic of Moldova will progressively adapt its\r\ntechnical regulations and standards to those of the EU. Negotiations for an\r\nAgreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA)\r\nwill ensure that in specific sectors Moldovan legislation and market surveillance\r\nsystems will be in line with those in the EU, so that trade between the Parties\r\ncan take place under the same conditions as between EU Member States.\nAs regards trade in\r\nanimals, plants and their products the DCFTA will provide for the alignment of Moldova's sanitary and phyto-sanitary and animal welfare legislation to the EU's SPS and\r\nanimal welfare legislation which would consequently lead to further trade\r\nfacilitation. The DCFTA will ensure the setting up of a rapid consultation\r\nmechanism to solve SPS-related trade irritants, including a specific rapid\r\nalert and early warning system for veterinary and phyto-sanitary emergencies. \nBuilding on current\r\ncooperation on customs matters, the Protocol on mutual administrative\r\nassistance in customs matters provides a stronger legal framework to ensure the\r\ncorrect application of customs legislation and the fight against customs fraud.\r\n\nAs regards\r\nestablishment, the DCFTA provides for national treatment and most favoured\r\nnation treatment of companies, subject to limited reservations. With regard to\r\ntrade in services, the DCFTA foresees a wide market access, as well as the\r\npossibility to liberalise further the market access, including as a result of\r\napproximation by the Republic of Moldova with the EU acquis in the fields\r\nof financial, telecommunications/electronic commerce, postal and courier, and\r\ninternational maritime transport services. \nThe DCFTA will provide\r\nhigh levels of protection for all EU agricultural Geographical Indications\r\n(GIs), not only those relating to wines and spirits, and any new products added\r\nto the list of protected GIs. The Agreement includes the provisions of the\r\nEU-Republic of Moldova Agreement on Geographical Indications which entered into\r\nforce on 1 April 2013, including its annexes. It foresees a mechanism enabling\r\nfull protection of new indications which may be added to the Agreement on\r\nGeographical Indications before the Association Agreement enters into force.\r\nMoreover, the DCFTA includes provisions on copyright, designs (including unregistered\r\nones), and patents which complement and up-date the TRIPS Agreement and include\r\nprovisions for the enforcement of IPRs based on the EU's internal rules.\nIn terms of integration\r\nof the public procurement markets, the DCFTA will allow access of the Republic of Moldova, a non-EEA Member\r\nto the EU public procurement market, following a period of transition during\r\nwhich the Republic of Moldova will approximate \u00a0current and future EU\r\nlegislation on public procurement. Further access to the EU procurement market\r\nfor bids below the value thresholds may be discussed once approximation has\r\nbeen successfully completed. As a result, suppliers and service providers will\r\nhave mutual market access to the public procurement markets, exception made for\r\nthe defence sector. \nThrough the DCFTA, the Republic of   Moldova will ensure implementation of comprehensive competition laws, ensure\r\neffective implementation of the principles of undistorted competition and\r\nsubject state monopolies, state enterprises or enterprises entrusted with\r\nspecial or exclusive rights to abide to those competition laws. \nThe section on\r\nsubsidies is particularly significant in so far as it contains a commitment of\r\nthe Republic of Moldova to adopt a domestic system of state aid control similar\r\nto that of the EU and to establish an operationally independent authority\r\nentrusted with the control of state aid. \nOn trade-related energy\r\nissues, the DCFTA introduces binding provisions on pricing, including the\r\nprohibition of dual pricing, on uninterrupted transit of energy goods with a\r\nview to ensuring the security of supply, on the independence of regulatory\r\nauthorities in the energy field, and to clarify the relationship with Moldova's commitments under the Energy Community Treaty.\u00a0 \nCommitments to pursue sustainable development in\r\ntrade and to abide by multilateral commitments in this respect are provided\r\nfor, while ensuring the right to regulate own levels of domestic environmental\r\nand labour protection. The DCFTA includes a commitment to refrain from waiving\r\nor derogating from such standards in a manner that affects trade or investment\r\nbetween the parties.\nEffective settlement\r\nprocedures based on the model of\r\nthe WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding will provide for a swifter resolution\r\nof bilateral trade disputes,\r\nincluding by allowing the affected party to impose proportionate sanctions,\r\nwith even faster procedures for urgent disputes on trade-related energy\r\nmatters. \nSpecific provisions on\r\ntransparency and dialogue with the civil society and stakeholders have also\r\nbeen agreed to ensure a consultative, open and predictable nature of\r\npolicy-making in trade-related areas. Furthermore, the DCFTA contains\r\ndisciplines facilitating the conduct and assessment of approximation processes\r\nin trade-related areas. \nThe Republic of Moldova's closer economic integration with the EU through the DCFTA will be a\r\npowerful stimulant to the country's economic growth. As a core element of the\r\nAssociation Agreement, the DCFTA will create business opportunities in both the\r\nEU and the Republic of Moldova and will promote real economic modernisation and\r\nintegration with the EU. Higher standards of products, better services to\r\ncitizens, and above all the Republic of Moldova's ability to compete\r\neffectively in international markets should be the result of this process. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nOn the part of the Union, the legal basis for the signature and provisional application of this Agreement is\r\nArticle 217, in conjunction with Article 218(5) and the second subparagraph of\r\nArticle 218(8), as well as Article 218(7) of TFEU.
