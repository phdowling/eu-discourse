Montenegro indicated its intention to complete its accession with reference to the text of\r\nthe GPA, as amended (the text was adopted by the Parties on 30 March 2012 and\r\nconcluded by the EU via a Council decision of 3.12.2013[1]). The GPA, as amended, has\r\nentered into force for the Union, on 6 April 2014.\nThe Commission, on behalf of the Union,\r\nnegotiated a series of market opening commitments as presented by Montenegro both in a bilateral format and within the WTO the Committee\r\non Government Procurement (\"GPA Committee\"). \nMontenegro subsequently\r\nsubmitted a final offer on 18 July 2014. A summary of Montenegro's final offer and the Commission's assessment thereof are set out below. \n\u00a02. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of the terms of Montenegro's accession to the GPA\nMontenegro's\r\nfinal offer\nMarket access commitments (covered\r\nentities, goods, services and construction services)\nEntities\nIn Annex 1 (\u201ccentral government entities\u201d) Montenegro provides for an exhaustive list featuring central government entities whose\r\nprocurement is open to GPA Parties. The notes included under this Annex are\r\nidentical to the EU ones.\nIn Annex 2 (\u201csubcentral government entities\u201d)\r\n  Montenegro includes all regional and local contracting authorities of\r\nadministrative units. The definition of administrative units corresponds to the\r\nEU classification of such units as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[2].\r\nBodies governed by public law are also included under Annex 2. The definition\r\nof those bodies is identical to the EU one as provided for in Directive\r\n2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council[3]. An indicative list of\r\nthose bodies is added to the Annex. The notes specified under Annex 2\r\ncorrespond to the EU notes under Annex 2.\nIn Annex 3 (\u201cother entities\u201d) Montenegro grants to GPA Parties all utilities operating in the same sectors ( meaning\r\ndrinking water, electricity, airport, port, urban transport and railways ) as provided\r\nfor by the EU. An indicative list of entities is included. The reservations\r\nprovided for under this Annex are identical to the ones contained in the EU\r\nAnnex 3.\nGoods \nMontenegro provides\r\nfor a positive list of goods containing some exceptions which correspond to\r\nthose included in the EU Annex 4. \nServices\nMontenegro offers a\r\npositive list of services which corresponds to those offered by the EU in its\r\nAnnex 5.\nConstruction services\nMontenegro offers\r\nall the construction services in Division 51 of the Central Product\r\nClassification, as it is commonly offered by all GPA Parties. Moreover, it\r\ngrants to the EU and few other GPA Parties access to works concessions\r\ncontracts under a national treatment regime.\nThresholds\nMontenegro applies\r\nthresholds that are commonly applied by GPA Parties for goods, services and\r\nconstruction services. \nMontenegro's Legislation \nGiven its status as a candidate country (to\r\naccede to the EU), Montenegro\u2019s public procurement system is broadly aligned\r\nwith the EU acquis on public procurement. Montenegro's legislation in the field\r\nis non-discriminatory. There are no provisions granting domestic supplies and\r\nsuppliers more favourable treatment than that accorded to foreign suppliers or\r\nsupplies. \nCommission\u2019s Assessment of Montenegro's\r\nOffer\nThe final offer of Montenegro mirrors the EU offer under Appendix I to the revised GPA. Therefore, it is\r\nsatisfactory and acceptable. Its government procurement legislation is compliant\r\nwith the GPA.\nIn particular, the following terms of Montenegro's accession will be reflected in the EU Appendix I:\nWith regard to the fact that Montenegro\r\nprovides an exhaustive list of entities under its Annex 1, the access of goods,\r\nservices, suppliers and service providers of Montenegro to the EU coverage\r\nshould be that indicated under point 2 of section 2 of the EU Annex 1, meaning\r\naccess to the procurement of the central government contracting authorities as\r\nlisted under Annex 1.\nMontenegro will be\r\nincluded among the GPA Parties (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and South-Korea) to which the EU\r\ngives access to works concessions tenders under section 2 of Annex 6. \n3. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL \nThe revised GPA includes a provision on accession. Article XXII(2)\r\nof the GPA provides that any Member of the WTO may accede to the GPA on terms\r\nto be agreed between that Member and the Parties, with such terms stated in a\r\ndecision of the GPA Committee. \u00a0\nThe terms of Montenegro\u2019s accession will be\r\nset out in a decision of the GPA Committee which is expected to be adopted in the\r\nsecond half of 2014. This decision will include Montenegro's final offer for\r\naccess to its public procurement market (which will become part of Appendix I\r\nto the GPA upon Montenegro's accession), as well as any specific terms of\r\naccession requested by other GPA Parties. The Decision will be adopted by\r\nconsensus within the GPA Committee. \nArticle 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union (TFEU) provides that, when a decision having legal effect\r\nneeds to be taken in a body set up by an international agreement, the Council,\r\non a proposal from the Commission, should adopt a Decision establishing the\r\nposition to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf. The decision of the GPA Committee\r\nthat will set out the terms of Montenegro's accession falls under Article\r\n218(9) TFEU as the decision is taken in a body set up by an international\r\nagreement and it will have legal effects.\n4. RECOMMENDATION\nMontenegro's\r\naccession to the GPA is expected to make a very positive contribution to\r\nfurther international opening of public procurement markets, by enlarging the\r\nnumber of parties to the GPA and thus encouraging other countries to accede to the\r\nGPA. The Commission recommends that the final offer by Montenegro is accepted with the above mentioned terms.\nAccordingly, it is proposed that the Commission be authorised to\r\nexpress within the Committee on Government Procurement the position of the Union\r\nin favour of Montenegro\u2019s accession, to be reflected in the GPA Committee\r\nDecision on Montenegro's accession.\n2014/0263 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be taken on\r\nbehalf of the European Union within the Committee on Government Procurement on\r\nthe accession of Montenegro to the Agreement on Government Procurement\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of\r\nArticle 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 4 November 2013, Montenegro applied for accession to the Agreement on Government Procurement (\u201cthe GPA\u201d).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Montenegro\u2019s commitments on\r\ncoverage are laid down in its final offer, as submitted to the GPA Parties on 18\r\nJuly 2014. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Montenegro\u2019s final offer\r\nmirrors the Union\u2019s offer under Appendix I to the revised GPA. Therefore, it is\r\nsatisfactory and acceptable. The terms of Montenegro's accession, as reflected\r\nin the Annex to this Decision, will be reflected in the decision adopted by the\r\nCommittee on Government Procurement (\u201cthe GPA Committee\u201d) on Montenegro's accession. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Montenegro's accession to\r\nthe GPA is expected to make a positive contribution to further international\r\nopening of public procurement markets.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article XXII(2) of the GPA\r\nprovides that any Member of the WTO may accede to the Agreement on terms to be\r\nagreed between that Member and the Parties, with such terms stated in a\r\ndecision of the GPA Committee. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, it is neccessary\r\nto establish the position to be taken on the Union's behalf within the GPA Committee\r\nin relation to the accession of Montenegro, \nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe position to be taken on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union within the Committee on Government Procurement shall be to\r\napprove the accession of Montenegro to the Agreement on Government Procurement,\r\nsubject to specific terms of accession set out in the Annex to this Decision.\n\u00a0Article 2\nThis Decision\r\nshall enter into force on the day of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision of 2 December 2013 on the conclusion\r\nof the Protocol Amending the Agreement on Government Procurement\u00a0 (OJ L 68,\r\n7.3.2014, p. 1).\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common\r\nclassification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS), (OJ L 154,\r\n21.6.2003, p.1).\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing\r\nDirective 2004/18/EC (OJ L 94, 28.3.2014, p. 65).\nANNEX\nEU TERMS OF MONTENEGRO's ACCESSION TO THE GPA\nUpon Montenegro's accession to the Agreement on Government Procurement, point 2\r\nof section 2 (The Central Government contracting authorities of the EU Member\r\nStates) of Annex 1 to Appendix I for the European Union shall read as follows: \n'2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the goods, services,\r\nsuppliers and service providers of Israel and Montenegro, procurement by the\r\nfollowing central government contracting authorities.'\nUpon Montenegro's accession to the Agreement on Government Procurement, section\r\n2 of Annex 6 shall read as follows:\n'2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Works concessions\r\ncontracts, when awarded by Annex 1 and 2 entities, are included under the\r\nnational treatment regime for the construction service providers of Iceland,\r\nLiechtenstein, Norway, the Netherlands on behalf of Aruba, Switzerland and\r\nMontenegro, provided their value equals or exceeds 5,000,000 SDR and for the\r\nconstruction service providers of Korea; provided their value equals or exceeds\r\n15,000,000 SDR.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
