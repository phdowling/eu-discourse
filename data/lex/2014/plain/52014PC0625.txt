In accordance with Article 395(2) of the VAT Directive, the\r\nCommission informed the other Member States by letter dated 6 June 2014 of the\r\nrequest made by Lithuania. By letter dated 12 June 2014, the Commission\r\nnotified Lithuania that it had all the information necessary to consider the\r\nrequest.\nGeneral context\nChapter 1 of Title XII of the VAT Directive\r\nallows for the possibility for Member States to apply special schemes for small\r\nenterprises, including the possibility of exempting taxable persons below a\r\ncertain annual turnover. This exemption implies that a taxable person does not\r\nhave to charge VAT on his supplies and, consequently, he cannot deduct VAT on\r\nhis inputs.\nLithuania was first\r\ngranted the measure by Council Implementing Decision 2011/335/EU[1] which will expire on 31\r\nDecember 2014. The measure derogates from Title XII of the VAT Directive only\r\nin so far as the taxable person\u2019s annual turnover threshold for the special\r\nscheme is higher than that currently allowed for Lithuania under Article\r\n287(11) of the VAT Directive, which is EUR 29 000.\nLithuania has now\r\nrequested that the measure, which is optional for taxable persons, be extended\r\nfor a further limited period.\nFrom information provided by Lithuania, it appears that the impact of the measure on tax revenue collected at the final\r\nconsumption stage is negligible. However, the analysis provided by Lithuania shows that the majority of taxable persons who have registered for VAT purposes\r\n(approximately 82 %) during years 2012-2013 did it on the basis of this\r\nmeasure. \nIt is therefore proposed to extend the\r\nderogation for another period until 31 December 2017. \nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nSimilar derogations have been granted to\r\nother Member States.\nConsistency with the other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union.\nThe measure is in line with the Union's\r\nobjectives for small businesses, as laid out in Commission Communication\r\n\"Think small first\" \u2013 a \"Small Business Act\" for\r\nEurope\" (COM(2008) 394 of 25 June 2008).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nNot relevant.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThe decision aims at continuing a\r\nsimplification measure which removes many of the VAT obligations for businesses\r\noperating below an annual turnover.\nBecause of the narrow scope of the\r\nderogation, and its limited application in time, the scope will in any case be\r\nlimited.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nAuthorisation for Lithuania to continue to\r\napply a derogating measure from the VAT Directive as regards the introduction\r\nof a simplification measure for businesses with an annual turnover no higher\r\nthan EUR 45 000.\nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive.\nSubsidiarity principle\nConsidering the provision of the VAT\r\nDirective on which the proposal is based, the proposal falls under the\r\nexclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does\r\nnot apply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThis Decision concerns an authorisation\r\ngranted to a Member State upon its own request and does not constitute any\r\nobligation.\nGiven the limited scope of the derogation,\r\nthe special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: Council Implementing\r\nDecision.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reasons:\nUnder Article 395 of the VAT Directive,\r\nderogation from the common VAT rules is only possible on the authority of the\r\nCouncil acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission. A Council\r\nImplementing Decision is the only suitable instrument since it can be addressed\r\nto an individual Member State.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nbudget of the Union because Lithuania will carry out a compensation calculation\r\nin accordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC EURATOM) 1553/89. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nThe proposal includes a sunset clause.\n2014/0289 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nextending the application of Council\r\nImplementing Decision 2011/335/EU authorising the Republic of Lithuania to continue to apply a special measure derogating from Article 287 of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive\r\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax ([2]) (the VAT Directive),\r\nand in particular Article 395(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a letter registered by\r\nthe Commission on 16 May 2014, the Republic of Lithuania requested\r\nauthorisation for a measure derogating from Article 287(11) of the VAT\r\nDirective in order to continue to exempt certain taxable persons whose annual\r\nturnover is no higher than the equivalent in national currency of EUR 45 000 at\r\nthe conversion rate on the day of its accession to the European Union. Through\r\nthat measure, those taxable persons would be exempt from certain or all of the\r\nobligations in relation to value added tax (VAT) referred to in Chapters 2 to 6\r\nof Title XI of the VAT Directive.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission informed\r\nthe other Member States by letter dated 6 June 2014 of the request made by Lithuania. By letter dated 12 June 2014, the Commission notified Lithuania that it had all\r\nthe information necessary to consider the request.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A special scheme for small\r\nenterprises is already available to Member States under Title XII of the VAT\r\nDirective. The extended measure derogates from Title XII of the VAT Directive\r\nonly in so far as the taxable person\u2019s annual turnover threshold for the special\r\nscheme is higher than that allowed for Lithuania under Article 287(11) of the\r\nVAT Directive, which is EUR 29 000.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Implementing\r\nDecision 2011/335/EU of 30 May 2011,[3]\r\n  Lithuania was authorised, as a derogating measure, to exempt taxable persons\r\nwhose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 45 000 until 31 December 2014.\r\nGiven that this threshold has resulted in reduced VAT obligations for smaller\r\nbusinesses, Lithuania should be authorised to apply the measure for a further\r\nlimited period. Taxable persons may still opt for the normal VAT arrangements.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From information provided\r\nby Lithuania, the extension of the derogation will only have a negligible\r\nimpact on the overall amount of tax revenue collected at the final stage of\r\nconsumption.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogation has no\r\nimpact on the Union's own resources accruing from value added tax,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nIn Article 2 of Decision 2011/335/EU, the\r\ndate \u201831 December 2014\u2019 shall be replaced by \u201831 December 2017\u2019.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall apply from 1 January\r\n2015.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of   Lithuania.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 150, 9.6.2011, p. 6.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 150, 9.6.2011, p. 6.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
