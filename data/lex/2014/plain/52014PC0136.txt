The GFCM is responsible for the conservation\r\nand management of fisheries resources in the Mediterranean. The European Union\r\nbecame a contracting party to GFCM in 1998. \nPursuant to Article 218(9) of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union, the position to be adopted on behalf of the Union in RFMOs such as\r\nwhen they are called upon to adopt acts having legal effects, with the\r\nexception of acts supplementing or amending their institutional framework, must\r\nbe adopted by Council Decision, on a proposal from the Commission.\nSuch position within the RFMO is currently\r\nestablished according to a two tier approach. A Council Decision sets out the\r\nguiding principles and orientations of the Union's position on a multiannual\r\nbasis, whereas it is thereafter adjusted for each annual meeting by Commission\r\nnon-papers to be discussed in the Council Working Party.\nAs regards the GFCM, Council Decision\r\n7265/09 of 19 March 2009, provides for a review of the Union's position before\r\nthe 2014 annual meeting. Therefore, this proposal aims at setting out the Union's position within GFCM for the period 2014-2019 and thereby replacing Council\r\nDecision 7265/09 of 19 March 2009 which is covering the period 2009-2014.\nThis revision aims\r\nat incorporating the principles and orientations of the new Common Fisheries\r\nPolicy (CFP) as laid down in Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[1], taking also into account the objectives of the Commission\r\nCommunication on the external dimension of the CFP[2]. Moreover, the Union's position has been adjusted to the Lisbon Treaty. At last, the position has been\r\naligned to the extent possible taking into account the specificities of the\r\ndifferent RFMOs. \nAs it is the case for the current positions,\r\nthe following \"negotiating mandate\" contains principles and\r\norientations. In addition, the standard process for the year to year\r\nspecification of the Union position has been incorporated as requested by\r\nMember States for positions aligned more recently.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe external dimension of the CFP was part\r\nof the impact assessment for the CFP reform proposals. The principles and\r\norientations agreed for the new CFP are simply being transposed into the\r\nrevised positions. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe following Decision is based on the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\r\n43(2), in conjunction with Article 218(9) which provides that the Council, on a\r\nproposal from the Commission shall adopt a decision establishing the positions\r\nto be adopted on the Union's behalf in a body set up by an agreement, when that\r\nbody is called upon to adopt acts having legal effects. This shall apply to the\r\nposition to be adopted by the Commission, on behalf of the Union, in the GFCM. \nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[3]\r\nis the legal basis setting up the principles to be\r\nreflected in this negotiating mandate. \nThe following Decision shall replace\r\nCouncil Decision 7265/09 which is covering the period 2009-2014, and shall\r\ncover the period 2014-2019. \n2014/0071 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf\r\nof the European Union, in the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 38 of the Treaty\r\non the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article 39\r\nthereof, provides that one of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy is\r\nto assure the availability of supplies. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[4] provides that the Union\r\nshall ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally\r\nsustainable in the long-term and are managed in a way that is consistent with\r\nthe objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits, and of\r\ncontributing to the availability of food supplies.

It also provides that the Union shall aim to take management\r\nand conservation measures based on best available scientific advice, to promote\r\nfishing methods that contribute to more selective fishing and the avoidance and\r\nreduction, as far as possible, of unwanted catches, to fish with low impact on\r\nmarine ecosystem and fishery resources and to gradually eliminate discards. Besides,\r\nthe regulation specifically provides that these principles shall be applied by\r\nthe Union in its external policy. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union as well\r\nas Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece; Italy, Malta, Romania, Slovenia\r\nand Spain are Contracting Parties to the Agreement establishing the General\r\nFisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM).
