In February 2012, the EU and the Republic of   Moldova also launched negotiations on the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade\r\nArea (DCFTA) part, as a core element of the Association Agreement. On 29\r\nNovember 2013, the European Union and the Republic of Moldova initialled the\r\ntext of the Association Agreement, including the DCFTA part. \nThe Association\r\nAgreement aims to accelerate the deepening of political and economic relations\r\nbetween the Republic of Moldova and the EU, as well as advance the Republic of   Moldova's gradual economic integration with the EU Internal Market in\r\nselected areas, inter alia through a DCFTA, as an integral part of the\r\nAgreement. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\r\nOF THE NEGOTIATIONS\nThe Council has been\r\nregularly informed and consulted in the relevant Council Working Groups,\r\nnotably in COEST and the Trade Policy Committee (TPC), at all stages of the\r\nnegotiations. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council\r\nin its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft Association\r\nAgreement is acceptable to the Union.\nThe final content of\r\nthe Association Agreement can be summarised as follows:\nThe Agreement\r\nestablishes an association between the Union and its Member States of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova of the other part. This constitutes a new\r\nstage in the development of EU-Moldova contractual relations, aiming at\r\npolitical association and economic integration and leaving open the way for\r\nfurther progressive developments. \nThe overall aims of the\r\nassociation focus on promoting a gradual rapprochement between the parties on\r\nthe basis of common values; strengthening the framework for enhanced political\r\ndialogue; promoting, preserving and strengthening peace and stability in both the\r\nregional and international dimensions; establishing conditions for enhanced\r\neconomic and trade relations leading towards the Republic of Moldova's gradual\r\neconomic integration with the EU internal market in selected areas; enhancing justice,\r\nfreedom and security cooperation with the aim of reinforcing the rule of law\r\nand respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and establishing\r\nconditions for increasingly close cooperation in other areas of mutual\r\ninterest. \nThe Association\r\nAgreement also foresees a wide range of sector cooperation, focusing on support\r\nto core reforms, economic recovery and growth, governance and sector cooperation\r\nin 28 areas, such as; public administration reform, management of public\r\nfinances, energy, transport, environmental protection and direct action,\r\nindustrial and small and medium enterprise cooperation, social policies,\r\nconsumer protection, agriculture and rural development, cross-border and\r\nregional level cooperation, education, training, civil society cooperation and youth\r\nas well as cultural cooperation. In all of these areas, enhanced cooperation\r\nstarts from the basis of current frameworks, both bilateral and multilateral,\r\nwith the aim of more systematic dialogue and exchange of information and good\r\npractice. Key to the sectoral cooperation chapters is a comprehensive menu of gradual\r\napproximation with the EU acquis set out in the annexes to the\r\nAgreement. Specific schedules for approximation and implementation by the Republic of Moldova of selected parts of the EU acquis will provide a focus for on-going\r\ncooperation, and will form the core of the Republic of Moldova's domestic\r\nreform and modernisation agenda. \nThe Agreement includes\r\nan updated institutional framework encompassing cooperation and dialogue fora.\r\nSpecific decision-making roles are foreseen for an Association Council, and by\r\ndelegation for an Association Committee, which may also meet in a specific\r\nconfiguration to address trade issues. Fora for civil society and parliamentary\r\ncooperation are also foreseen. The Agreement also includes provisions on\r\nmonitoring, approximation, fulfilment of obligations and dispute settlement\r\n(including separate provisions for trade-related matters). \nCloser economic integration through the DCFTA\r\nwill be a powerful stimulant to the country's economic growth. Approximation by\r\nthe Republic of Moldova with EU legislation, norms and standards, will be the\r\nmethod. As a core element of the Association Agreement, the DCFTA will create\r\nbusiness opportunities in both the EU and the Republic of Moldova and will\r\npromote real economic modernisation and gradual integration with the EU. Higher\r\nstandards of products, better services to citizens, and above all the Republic of   Moldova's ability to compete effectively in international markets should be\r\nthe result of this process. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nOn the part of the Union, the legal basis for the\r\nconclusion of this Agreement is Article 217, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and the second\r\nsubparagraph of Article 218(8), as well as Article 218(7) of TFEU.\nThe attached proposal constitutes the legal instrument for\r\nthe conclusion of the Association Agreement on behalf of the Union.
