More substantial problems began in the late 1970s and\r\n1980s, when driftnets with large mesh sizes and net lengths of tens of\r\nkilometres began to be used. These large-scale driftnets resulted in\r\nsignificantly increased amounts of incidental mortality of protected species\r\nincluding, in particular, cetaceans, sea turtles and sharks and lead to\r\ninternational concerns about their environmental impacts.\nIn the early 90s, following specific United\r\nNations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolutions[1],\r\nwhich called for a moratorium on large-scale pelagic driftnet[2] fishing on the High\r\nSeas, the EU developed legislation on driftnets fisheries.\nConsequently the keeping on board or use of\r\ndriftnets longer than 2,5 Km is prohibited in the EU since June 1992 (except in\r\nthe Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound). Since 2002 all driftnets, no matter\r\ntheir size, are prohibited when intended for the capture of species listed in\r\nAnnex VIII of Council Regulation (EC) No 894/97 (unauthorized species).It is\r\nalso prohibited to land species listed in Annex VIII which have been caught in\r\ndriftnets.\u00a0 Additionally, since 1 January 2008 it is prohibited to keep on\r\nboard or use any kind of driftnets in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound. \nThe current EU legislative framework on driftnets\r\nhas however shown weaknesses since existing rules are easy to circumvent. The\r\nabsence of EU rules on gear characteristics (e.g. maximum mesh size, maximum\r\ntwine thickness, hanging ratio, etc.)\u00a0 and gear use (e.g. maximum distance from\r\nthe coast, soaking time, fishing season etc) combined with the possibility to\r\nkeep on board other fishing gears, made it possible for fishermen to illegally\r\nuse driftnets to catch species prohibited to be caught with this fishing gear,\r\nwhile declaring that they have been caught for example with another gear (e.g.\r\nlonglines, etc).\nFurthermore despite these provisions on\r\ndriftnets, the illegal use of driftnets continues to be reported in EU waters.\r\nSerious non-compliance by some Member States has also been addressed by two rulings\r\nof the European Court of Justice against France (C-556/07; C-479/07)\r\nand Italy (C-249/08). \nControl and enforcement efforts are not\r\nproducing the necessary results since the small scale nature of the activity\r\nmakes it easy to adapt and find strategies to escape controls. Small scale\r\ndriftnets are still allowed and the loopholes in the EU legislation facilitate\r\ntheir illegal use. This makes it extremely difficult for control authorities to\r\nhave robust evidences of illegal activities and to finally enforce the rules.\nAgainst this background, it is clear that\r\nserious environmental and conservation concerns linked to the use of these\r\nfishing gears still persist. \nIn order to address this situation and to comply\r\nwith EU international obligations to properly regulate driftnet fisheries, the\r\nproposed Regulation, on the basis of a precautionary approach, stipulates a\r\nfull prohibition to take on board or use any kind of driftnets as off 1 January\r\n2015 in all EU waters. It also introduces a revised and more comprehensive\r\ndefinition of this fishing gear, to close any possible existing loophole.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nAn Impact Assessment (IA) has been\r\nconducted, taking into account information from different sources: a web-based\r\npublic consultation, two coordinated studies[3],\r\ninformation provided by Member States and comments from the IA Steering Group\r\n(IASG).\nThe IA has explored the following policy\r\noptions: 1) status quo; 2) actions on technical and/or control measures to\r\nenhance controllability and environmental compatibility; 3) selected ban of\r\ndriftnet fisheries identified as being still most harmful to the strictly\r\nprotected species and/or not able to avoid by-catches of unauthorised species; 4)\r\ntotal ban of driftnet fisheries. \nHowever, the lack or poor monitoring of these\r\nfisheries by Member States, both for control and scientific purposes, together\r\nwith \u00a0the limited sampling effort by the two studies made it extremely\r\ndifficult to have a comprehensive view on current fishing activities and their\r\nactual environmental impact and it was therefore not possible to assess impacts\r\nof the different policy\u00a0 options through an indicator led analysis.\nOptions 4 has been preferred over the options\r\n1, 2 and 3, as it satisfies to the largest extent the relevance, effectiveness,\r\nefficiency and coherence criteria while providing the best result in terms of\r\nenvironmental impact and less administrative burden. It is supported by more\r\nthan 52% of the respondents to the public consultation including fishermen\r\nassociations and NGOs. Thus option 4 has been retained as the most adequate, based\r\non the application of the precautionary principle towards fisheries which might\r\nhave a high risk of incidental takings of strictly protected species while\r\nbeing poorly or not at all monitored by Member States.\nThe majority of the driftnet fisheries\r\nidentified are seasonal and the participating active fleets are comprised of\r\npolyvalent vessels, totalling at least 840 vessels (excluding the Baltic Sea), dispersed over a wide area. For most of the fishers driftnetting represent\r\nonly a few months of fishing activity in any year with some fishers using\r\ndriftnets for less than half a month per year. Thus the total prohibition to\r\nuse driftnets is not expected to result in a corresponding reduction of fishers\r\nwhich will continue to operate with other gears as already authorised in their\r\nfishing licence. On the basis of the information collected for the impact\r\nassessment the economic performance and importance of the gear for the vessels\r\nand fleets is highly variable though limited at national level. For the fleets\r\nwhere the data are available such as the UK vessels the total value of small\r\nscale driftnets, for around 250 vessels, represent 0.14% of the total value of UK landings in 2011. For Italy, where a smaller number of around 100 active vessels has\r\nbeen detected, the economic importance of\u00a0 driftnets is low at national level\r\n(0.8% in value and 1.3 % in weight of landing) though the value landed ranges from\r\naround 20% to 55% (up to 90% in one fishery) of the turnover generated by these\r\nvessels; however the profit generated by the use of driftnets is highly\r\nvariable ranging from 1 % to 54% of the turnover generated by the vessels, with\r\nan average of 22% across all Italian driftnet fisheries. While it cannot be excluded\r\nthat the ban may affect some of the vessels carrying out these fisheries, the\r\noverall \u00a0socio-economic impact of the total ban is therefore considered\r\nirrelevant at national and sub-regional level.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7        \r\nSummary of the proposed action\nIntroduce a full prohibition to take on\r\nboard or use any kind of driftnets as off 1 January 2015, in all EU waters and\r\nby all EU vessels.

It is particularly important to cover by this definition\r\ngears that unlike drifting gillnets \u00a0are made up of two or more walls of\r\nnetting hung jointly in parallel on the headline(s) yet they operate close to\r\nthe water surface in the same manner as drifting gillnets do and have similar\r\nimpact on marine resources, hence should be coherently regulated. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current Union\r\nlegislative framework on driftnets has shown weaknesses and loopholes in that\r\nrules proved easy to circumvent and ineffective in terms of addressing the conservation\r\nconcerns linked to this fishing gear. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The driftnet fishing is\r\ncarried out by an undefinable number of small-scale multipurpose fishing\r\nvessels, the vast majority of which operating without any regular scientific\r\nand control monitoring. Due to the small scale nature of these fishing\r\nactivities, which makes it easy to escape monitoring, the control and\r\nenforcement efforts have not produced the necessary results in terms of\r\nconservation of marine resources, in particular with regard to certain protected\r\nspecies.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Illegal driftnet activities\r\ncarried out by Union fishing vessels, in particular for the purpose of\r\ntargeting species listed in Annex VIII of Regulation (EC) No 847/97, continue\r\nto be reported and have been cause of criticism regarding the Union compliance\r\nwith applicable international obligations in this respect. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the driftnet\r\nfishing by operating close to or at the water surface continues to be cause of\r\nhigh concern for incidental takings of air-breathing animals such as marine\r\nmammals, sea turtles and sea birds, which are mostly classified as species to\r\nbe strictly protected under Union legislation.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Additionally, monitoring\r\nand reporting systems established under Council Directive 92/43/EEC (Habitats\r\nDirective)[11]\r\nhave proven to be not effective for the identification and recording of the\r\nanthropogenic causes of death of strictly protected species due to fishing\r\nactivities.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ecosystem-based\r\napproach to fisheries management makes it a requirement that negative impacts\r\nof fishing activities on the marine ecosystems be minimised and unwanted\r\ncatches be avoided and reduced to the extent possible.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the reasons stated\r\nabove and in order to properly address the conservation concerns that this\r\nfishing gear continues to cause, as well as to achieve the environmental and\r\nenforcement objectives in an effective and efficient manner, while taking into\r\naccount the minimal socio-economic impacts, it is necessary to introduce a full\r\nprohibition to take on board or use any kind of driftnets in all Union waters\r\nand by all Union vessels whether they operate within Union waters or beyond, as\r\nwell as by non-Union vessels in Union waters.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For reasons of clarity of\r\nUnion legislation, it is also necessary to delete all other provisions related\r\nto driftnets by amending Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98[12], Regulation (EC) No\r\n812/2004, Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 and Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006[13],\u00a0 and repealing\r\nRegulation (EC) No 894/97. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vessels carrying out\r\nfisheries with small-scale driftnets may need some time to adjust to the new\r\nsituation and necessitate a phasing-out period. This Regulation should\r\ntherefore enter into force on 1 January 2015.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nScope\nThis Regulation shall apply to all fishing\r\nactivities within the scope of \u00a0the Common Fisheries Policy as set out in\u00a0\r\nArticle 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.\nArticle 2\nDefinition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of this\r\nRegulation the definitions set out in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013 shall apply.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, a 'driftnet'\r\nmeans a net made up of one or more walls of netting, hung jointly in parallel\r\non the headline(s), held on the water surface or at a certain distance below it\r\nby floating devices and \u00a0drifting with the current, either independently or\r\nwith the boat to which it may be attached.
