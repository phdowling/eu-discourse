The Chair of\r\nthe Scientific Committee submitted the risk assessment report to the Commission\r\nand to the Council on 23 April 2014.\nThe main results of the risk assessment are\r\nthe following:\n\u00b7                        \r\n25I-NBOMe is a\r\nderivative of 2C-I, a known synthetic derivative of phenethylamine with\r\nstimulant and hallucinogenic properties, subjected to risk assessment and\r\ncontrol measures in 2003. It has been available on the EU drug market since at\r\nleast May 2012 and has been detected in 23 Member States and Norway. There have been four deaths associated with 25I-NBOMe\r\nregistered in three Member States. Severe toxicity associated with its use has\r\nbeen reported in four Member States, which notified 32 non-fatal intoxications.\r\nInformation from seizures and collected samples suggest that 25I-NBOMe is being\r\nsold on the illicit market as LSD. \n\u00b7                        \r\nAH-7921 is a structurally atypical synthetic\r\nopioid analgesic, which has been available in the EU since at least July 2012\r\nand has been detected in eight Member States and Norway. There have been 15 deaths\r\nassociated with AH-7921, all occurred in three Member States within a limited\r\nperiod, between December 2012 and September 2013. Severe toxicity was reported\r\nby one Member State, where six non-fatal intoxications occurred. AH-7921\r\nappears to be sold by Internet retailers since 2011, advertised as 'research\r\nchemical' or 'legal opioid'.\n\u00b7                        \r\nMDPV is a ring substituted synthetic derivative\r\nof cathinone, chemically related to pyrovalerone, which are both subject to\r\ncontrol under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. There\r\nhave been 108 fatalities registered in eight Member States and Norway between September 2009 and August 2013, where MDPV has been detected in post-mortem\r\nbiological samples or implicated in the cause of death. Eight Member States\r\nreported 525 non-fatal intoxications associated with MDPV. MDPV has been\r\npresent in the EU drug market since November 2008. Multi-kilogram seizures of\r\nMDPV were reported in 27 Member States, Norway and Turkey. It is mainly sold as\r\na substance of its own right and it is widely available from Internet suppliers\r\nand retailers, head shops and street level dealers.\n\u00b7                        \r\nMethoxetamine is an arylcyclohexylamine\r\nsubstance, chemically similar to ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP). Like\r\nketamine and PCP, methoxetamine has dissociative properties. Some 20 deaths\r\nassociated with methoxetamine were reported by six Member States that detected\r\nthe substance in post-mortem samples. Used alone or in combination with other\r\nsubstances, methoxetamine was also detected in 20 non-fatal intoxications\r\nreported by five Member States. Twenty three Member States, as well as Turkey and Norway reported detections of methoxetamine, since November 2010.\u00a0 Information suggests\r\nthat methoxetamine is sold and used as a substance in its own right, but also\r\nas a \u2018legal\u2019 replacement for ketamine by Internet retailers, head shops and\r\nstreet-level drug dealers.\nPursuant to Article 8(1) of Council\r\nDecision 2005/387/JHA, within six week from the date of receipt of the risk\r\nassessment report, the Commission shall present to the Council either an\r\ninitiative to subject the new psychoactive substances to control measures\r\nacross the Union, or a report explaining its views on why such an initiative is\r\nnot deemed necessary.\nAlthough the scientific evidence concerning\r\nthe overall risks of 25I-NBOMe, AH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine is limited at\r\nthis stage, the Commission considers that there are grounds for subjecting these\r\nsubstances to control measures across the Union. The main reason is that,\r\naccording to the information available from the risk assessment reports, the\r\nacute toxicity of 25I-NBOMe, AH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine is such that it\r\ncan cause severe harms to the health of individuals. Moreover, the risks are\r\nheightened by the fact that these substances have been reported, in some cases,\r\nto be consumed unknowingly by certain users together with or instead of other\r\nstimulant substances.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe objective of this proposal for a\r\nCouncil Decision is to call upon the Member States to subject 25I-NBOMe,\r\nAH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine to control measures and criminal penalties as\r\nprovided under their legislation by virtue of their obligations under the 1971\r\nUnited Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.\n2014/0183 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non subjecting 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)phenethylamine\r\n(25I-NBOMe), 3,4-dichloro-N-[[1-(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl]methyl]benzamide\r\n(AH-7921), 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) and\r\n2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-(ethylamino)cyclohexanone (methoxetamine) to control\r\nmeasures\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Decision\r\n2005/387/JHA of 10 May 2005 on the information exchange, risk-assessment and\r\ncontrol of new psychoactive substances[2],\r\nand in particular Article 8(3) thereof, \nHaving regard to the initiative of the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)                   \r\nRisk assessment reports on the new psychoactive\r\nsubstances 25I-NBOMe, AH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine were drawn up in\r\ncompliance with Article 6 of Decision 2005/387/JHA by a special session of the\r\nextended Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and\r\nDrug Addiction (EMCDDA), and were subsequently submitted to the Commission and\r\nto the Council on 23 April 2014.\n(2)                   \r\n25I-NBOMe, AH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine have\r\nnot been under assessment at the United Nations\u2019 level, but they will be\r\nsubject to evaluation in June 2014 by the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence\r\nof the World Health Organization. \n(3)                   \r\n25I-NBOMe, AH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine have\r\nno established or acknowledged medical use (human or veterinary). Apart from\r\ntheir use in analytical reference materials, and in scientific research\r\ninvestigating their chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology as a result of their\r\nemergence on the drug market - and, in the case of 25I-NBOMe, also in the field\r\nof neurochemistry - there is no indication that they are being used for other\r\npurposes.\n(4)                   \r\n25I-NBOMe is a potent synthetic derivative of\r\nthe 2C-I, a classical serotonergic hallucinogen, which was subject to risk\r\nassessment \u00a0and to control measures and criminal penalties at Union level in\r\n2003.\n(5)                   \r\nThe specific physical effects of 25I-NBOMe are\r\ndifficult to determine because there are no published studies assessing its\r\nacute and chronic toxicity, its psychological and behavioural effects, and dependence\r\npotential, and because of the limited information and data available. Clinical\r\nobservations of individuals who have used this substance suggest that it has\r\nhallucinogenic effects and has the potential for inducing severe agitation,\r\nconfusion, intense auditory and visual hallucinations, aggression, violent accidents\r\nand self-induced trauma.\n(6)                   \r\nThere have been four deaths associated with\r\n25I-NBOMe registered in three Member States. Severe toxicity associated with its\r\nuse has been reported in four Member States, which notified 32 non-fatal\r\nintoxications. If this new psychoactive substance were to become more widely\r\navailable and used, the implications for individual and public health could be\r\nsignificant. There is no available information on the social risks associated\r\nwith 25I-NBOMe.\n(7)                   \r\nTwenty two Member States and Norway have reported to the EMCDDA and Europol that they detected 25I-NBOMe. No prevalence\r\ndata is available on the use of 25I-NBOMe, but the limited information that\r\nexists suggests that it may be consumed in a wide range of settings, such as home,\r\nbars, nightclubs and music festivals.\n(8)                   \r\n25I-NBOMe is openly marketed and sold on the\r\nInternet as a 'research chemical' and information from seizures, collected samples,\r\nuser websites and Internet retailers suggests that it is being sold as a drug\r\nin its own right and also marketed as a 'legal' replacement for LSD. EMCDDA\r\nidentified more than 15 Internet retailers selling this substance, which may be\r\nbased within the Union and China.\n(9)                   \r\nThe risk assessment report reveals that there is\r\nlimited scientific evidence available on 25I-NBOMe and points out that further\r\nresearch would be needed to determine the health and social risks that it\r\nposes. However, the available evidence and information provides sufficient\r\nground for subjecting 25I-NBOMe to control measures across the Union. As a result of the health risks that it poses, as documented by its detection in\r\nseveral reported fatalities, of the fact that users may unknowingly consume it\r\nand of the lack of medical value or use of the substance, 25I-NBOMe should be\r\nsubjected to control measures across the Union.\n(10)               \r\nSince six Member States control 25I-NBOMe under\r\nnational legislation complying with the obligations of the 1971 United Nations\r\nConvention on Psychotropic Substances and seven Member States use other\r\nlegislative measures to control it, subjecting this substance to control\r\nmeasures across the Union would help avoid the emergence of obstacles in\r\ncross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and would help protect\r\nfrom the risks that its availability and use can pose.\n(11)               \r\nAH-7921 is a structurally atypical synthetic\r\nopioid analgesic commonly known by Internet suppliers, user websites and media as\r\n'doxylam'. It can be easily confused with 'doxylamine', an antihistaminic\r\nmedicine with sedative-hypnotic properties, which could lead to unintentional\r\noverdoses.\n(12)               \r\nThe specific physical effects of AH-7921 are\r\ndifficult to determine because there are no published studies assessing its\r\nacute and chronic toxicity, its psychological and behavioural effects, and dependence\r\npotential, and because of the limited information and data available. Based on\r\nuser reports, the effects of AH-7921 appear to resemble those of classical\r\nopioids with the feeling of mild euphoria, itchiness and relaxation; nausea\r\nappears to be a typical adverse effect. In addition to self-experimentation\r\nwith AH-7921, as well as \u2018recreational use\u2019, some of the users report\r\nself-medicating with this new drug to relieve pain, others to alleviate\r\nwithdrawal symptoms due to cessation of the use of other opioids. This may\r\nindicate a potential of AH-7921 to spread among the injecting opioid population.\r\n\n(13)               \r\nThere is no prevalence data on the use of\r\nAH-7921, but the information available suggests that it is not widely used and\r\nthat it is used in the home environment. \n(14)               \r\nThere have been 15 fatalities registered in\r\nthree Member States between December 2012 and September 2013 where AH-7921,\r\nalone or in combination with other substances, was detected in post-mortem\r\nsamples. While it is not possible to determine with certainty the role of\r\nAH-7921 in all of fatalities, in some cases it has been specifically noted in\r\nthe cause of death. One Member State reported six non-fatal intoxications associated\r\nwith AH-7921. If this new psychoactive substance were to become more widely\r\navailable and used, the implications for individual and public health could be\r\nsignificant. There is no available information on the social risks associated\r\nwith AH-7921.\n(15)               \r\nThe risk assessment report reveals that there is\r\nlimited scientific evidence available on AH-7921 and points out that further\r\nresearch would be needed to determine the health and social risks that it\r\nposes. However, the available evidence and information provides sufficient\r\nground for subjecting AH-7921 to control measures across the Union. As a result\r\nof the health risks that it poses, as documented by its detection in several\r\nreported fatalities, of the fact that users may unknowingly consume it, and of\r\nthe lack of medical value or use of the substance, AH-7921 should be subjected\r\nto control measures across the Union.\n(16)               \r\nSince one Member State controls AH-7921 under\r\nnational legislation complying with the obligations of the 1971 United Nations\r\nConvention on Psychotropic Substances and five Member States use other\r\nlegislative measures to control it, subjecting this substance to control\r\nmeasures across the Union would help avoid the emergence of obstacles in\r\ncross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and would help protect\r\nfrom the risks that its availability and use can pose.\n(17)               \r\nMDPV is a ring substituted synthetic derivative\r\nof cathinone chemically related to pyrovalerone, which are both subject to\r\ncontrol under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. \n(18)               \r\nInformation on the chronic and acute toxicity\r\nassociated with MDPV, as well as on psychological and behavioural effects, and\r\non dependence potential, is not collected uniformly across the Union. Information from published studies, confirmed by clinical cases, suggests that the\r\npsychopharmacological profile observed for MDPV is similar to that for cocaine\r\nand methamphetamine, albeit more potent and longer lasting. Furthermore, MDPV\r\nwas found to be ten-time more potent in its ability to induce locomotor\r\nactivation, tachycardia and hypertension. \n(19)               \r\nUsers' websites indicate that its acute toxicity\r\ncan provoke adverse effects on humans, similar to those associated with other\r\nstimulants. These include paranoid psychosis, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis,\r\nbreathing problems, severe agitation, auditory and visual hallucinations, profound\r\nanxiety, hyperthermia, violent outbursts and multiple organ dysfunctions. \n(20)               \r\nThere have been 108 fatalities registered in\r\neight Member States and Norway between September 2009 and August 2013, where MDPV\r\nhas been detected in post-mortem biological samples or implicated in the cause\r\nof death. A total of 525 non-fatal intoxications associated with MDPV have been\r\nreported by eight Member States. If this new psychoactive substance were to\r\nbecome more widely available and used, the implications for individual and\r\npublic health could be significant. \n(21)               \r\nThe detection of MDPV has also been reported in\r\nbiological samples related to fatal and non-fatal road traffic accidents, or driving\r\nunder the influence of drugs, in four Member States since 2009. \n(22)               \r\nMDPV has been present in the Union drug market\r\nsince November 2008 and 27 Member States, Norway and Turkey reported multi-kilogram\r\nseizures of the substance. MDPV is being sold as a substance of its own right but\r\nit has also been detected in combination with other substances. It is widely\r\navailable from Internet suppliers and retailers, head shops and street-level\r\ndealers. There are some indications that suggest a degree of organisation in\r\nthe tableting and distribution of this substance in the Union.\n(23)               \r\nThe risk assessment report reveals that further\r\nresearch would be needed to determine the health and social risks posed by MDPV.\r\nHowever, the available evidence and information provides sufficient ground for\r\nsubjecting MDPV to control measures across the Union. As a result of the health\r\nrisks that it poses, as documented by its detection in several reported\r\nfatalities, of the fact that users may unknowingly consume it, and of the lack\r\nof medical value or use of the substance, MDPV should be subjected to control\r\nmeasures across the Union.\n(24)               \r\nSince 21 Member States control MDPV under\r\nnational legislation complying with the obligations of the 1971 United Nations\r\nConvention on Psychotropic Substances and four Member States use other\r\nlegislative measures to control it, subjecting this substance to control\r\nmeasures across the Union would help avoid the emergence of obstacles in\r\ncross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and would protect from\r\nthe risks that its availability and use can pose.\n(25)               \r\nMethoxetamine is an arylcyclohexylamine\r\nsubstance which is chemically similar to ketamine and the internationally\r\ncontrol substance phencyclidine (PCP). Like ketamine and PCP, it has\r\ndissociative properties. \n(26)               \r\nThere are no studies assessing the chronic and\r\nacute toxicity associated with methoxetamine, as well as its psychological and\r\nbehavioural effects, and dependence potential. Self-reported experiences from\r\nuser websites suggest adverse effects similar to ketamine intoxication. These include\r\nnausea and severe vomiting, difficulty in breathing, seizures, disorientation,\r\nanxiety, catatonia, aggression, hallucination, paranoia and psychosis. In\r\naddition, acute methoxetamine intoxications may include stimulants effects\r\n(agitation, tachycardia and hypertension) and cerebral features, which are not\r\nexpectable with acute ketamine intoxication. \n(27)               \r\nTwenty deaths associated with methoxetamine were\r\nreported by six Member States that detected the substance in post-mortem\r\nsamples. Used alone or in combination with other substances, methoxetamine was\r\ndetected in 20 non-fatal intoxications reported by five Member States. If this\r\nnew psychoactive substance were to become more widely available and used, the\r\nimplications for individual and public health could be significant. \n(28)               \r\nTwenty three Member States, Turkey and Norway have reported that they detected methoxetamine, since November 2010. \u00a0Information\r\nsuggests that it is sold and used as a substance in its own right, but it is also\r\nsold as a \u2018legal\u2019 replacement for ketamine by Internet retailers, head shops\r\nand street-level drug dealers. \n(29)               \r\nMulti-kilograms quantities in powder were seized\r\nwithin the Union, but there is no information on the possible involvement of\r\norganised crime. The manufacture of methoxetamine does not require\r\nsophisticated equipment. \n(30)               \r\nData prevalence is limited to\r\nnon-representatives studies in two Member States. These suggest that the\r\nprevalence of the use of methoxetamine is lower than that of ketamine. The\r\navailable information suggests that it may be consumed in a wide range of\r\nsettings, including home, bars, nightclubs and music festivals.\n(31)               \r\nThe risk assessment report reveals that further\r\nresearch would be needed to determine the health and social risks posed by methoxetamine.\r\nHowever, the available evidence and information provides sufficient ground for\r\nsubjecting methoxetamine to control measures across the Union. As a result of\r\nthe health risks that it poses, as documented by its detection in several\r\nreported fatalities, of the fact that users may unknowingly consume it, and of\r\nthe lack of medical value or use, methoxetamine should be subjected to control\r\nmeasures across the Union.\n(32)               \r\nSince nine Member States control methoxetamine\r\nunder national legislation complying with the obligations of the 1971 United\r\nNations Convention on Psychotropic Substances and nine Member States use other\r\nlegislative measures to control it, subjecting this substance to control\r\nmeasures across the Union would help avoid the emergence of obstacles in\r\ncross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and would protect from\r\nthe risks that its availability and use can pose,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe following new psychoactive substances shall\r\nbe subjected to control measures across the Union:\n(a)         \r\n4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl) phenethylamine(25I-NBOMe);\n(b)         \r\n3,4-dichloro-N-[[1-dimethylamino) cyclohexyl]methyl]\r\nbenzamide (AH-7921);\n(c)         \r\n3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV); \n(d)        \r\n2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-(ethylamino)cyclohexanone\r\n(methoxetamine).\nArticle 2\nBy [one year from the date this Decision is published], Member\r\nStates shall take the necessary measures, in accordance with their national law,\r\nto subject the new psychoactive substances referred to in Article 1 to control\r\nmeasures and criminal penalties, as provided for under their legislation\r\ncomplying with their obligations under the 1971 United Nations Convention on\r\nPsychotropic Substances.\nArticle 3\nThis\r\nDecision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its\r\npublication in the Official Journal of the European Union\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ\r\nL 127, 20.5.2005, p. 32.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ\r\nL 127, 20.5.2005, p. 32.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
