The Chair of the Scientific Committee submitted the\r\nrisk assessment report to the Commission and to the Council on 19 September 2014.\nThe main findings of the risk assessment\r\nare the following:\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe new psychoactive substance 4,4'-DMAR appears\r\nto have psychostimulant properties. 4,4'-DMAR is structurally related to two\r\nsubstances listed in the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic\r\nSubstances (4-methylaminorex and aminorex).\n\u00b7                        \r\n4,4'-DMAR has been available on the drug market\r\nin the European Union since at least December 2012 and has been detected in\r\nnine Member States.\n\u00b7                        \r\nAlthough the information available suggests that\r\nthis substance has not been widely used, there have been 31 deaths associated\r\nwith 4,4'-DMAR, registered in three Member States over a period of\r\napproximately one year, and one non-fatal intoxication.\nOn 25 September 2014, pursuant to Article\r\n6(1) of the Council Decision, the Council decided to request the risk\r\nassessment of 1-cyclohexyl-4-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine (also known as MT-45).\u00a0\r\n\nThe risks of MT-45 were assessed by the\r\nScientific Committee of the EMCDDA, acting in compliance with the provisions of\r\nArticle 6(2), (3) and (4) of the Council Decision. The Chair of the Scientific\r\nCommittee submitted the risk assessment report to the Commission and to the\r\nCouncil on 6 October 2014.\nThe main findings of the risk assessment\r\nare the following:\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe new psychoactive substance MT-45 is a\r\nsynthetic opioid, with a unique structure, which had been investigated for its analgesic\r\nproperties in the 1970s.\n\u00b7                        \r\nMT-45 has been available on the drug market in\r\nthe European Union since October 2013 and has been detected in three Member\r\nStates.\n\u00b7                        \r\nA total of 28 deaths associated with MT-45 have\r\nbeen reported in one Member State, within a period of nine months, as well as\r\n18 non-fatal intoxications.\nPursuant to Article 8(1) of Council\r\nDecision, within six weeks from the date of receipt of the risk assessment\r\nreport, the Commission shall present to the Council either an initiative to subject\r\nthe new psychoactive substances to control measures across the Union, or a report explaining its views on why such initiative is not deemed necessary.\nAlthough the scientific evidence concerning\r\nthe overall risks posed by the two substances is limited at this stage, the\r\nCommission considers that there are grounds for subjecting 4,4'-DMAR and MT-45 to\r\ncontrol measures across the Union. The main reason is that, according to the\r\ninformation available from the risk assessment reports, the toxicity of these\r\nsubstances is such that it can cause severe harms to the health of individuals.\r\nMoreover, the risks are heightened by the fact that these substances have been\r\nreported, in some cases, to be consumed unknowingly by certain users together with\r\nor instead of other psychoactive substances.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe objective of this proposal for a\r\nCouncil Decision is to call upon the Member States to subject 4,4'-DMAR and\r\nMT-45 to control measures and criminal penalties as provided under their\r\nlegislation by virtue of their obligations under the 1971 United Nations\r\nConvention on Psychotropic Substances.\n2014/0340 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non subjecting\r\n4-methyl-5-(4-methylphenyl)-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-amine (4,4'-DMAR) and\r\n1-cyclohexyl-4-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine (MT-45) to control measures \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Decision\r\n2005/387/JHA of 10 May 2005 on the information exchange, risk-assessment and\r\ncontrol of new psychoactive substances[2],\r\nand in particular Article 8(3) thereof, \nHaving regard to the initiative of the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A risk assessment report\r\non the new psychoactive substance 4-methyl-5-(4-methylphenyl)-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-amine\r\n(4,4'-DMAR) was drawn up in compliance with Article 6 of Decision 2005/387/JHA\r\nby a special session of the extended Scientific Committee of the European\r\nMonitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), and was subsequently\r\nsubmitted to the Commission and to the Council on 19 September 2014.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,4'-DMAR is a synthetic\r\nsubstituted oxazoline derivative. It is a derivative of aminorex and\r\n4-methylaminorex (4-MAR), two synthetic stimulants controlled under the 1971\r\nUnited Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,4'-DMAR has been\r\navailable on the Union's drugs market since at least December 2012 and was notified\r\nto the Early Warning System in December 2012. Nine Member States reported\r\ndetections in seizures, mainly under the form of white or coloured powders and\r\ntablets, as well as biological and collected samples. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,4'-DMAR emerged on the\r\nnew psychoactive substances market\r\nas a 'research chemical' sold by internet retailers, and it is now available on\r\nthe street market. 4,4'-DMAR is being sold and consumed as a substance in its\r\nown, but it has also been mis-sold on the illicit market as ecstasy and\r\namphetamines.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There have been 31 deaths\r\nassociated with this substance registered in three Member States, between June\r\n2013 and June 2014. In most cases, 4,4'-DMAR was either the cause of death or\r\nis likely to have contributed to death together with other substances. One Member State reported a case of non-fatal intoxication.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are no studies on the\r\ntoxicity of 4,4'-DMAR.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is no prevalence\r\ndata on the use of 4,4'-DMAR, but the information available suggests that it\r\nhas not been widely used. Information from death cases also suggests that users unknowingly consumed 4,4'-DMAR when\r\nseeking other stimulants. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is limited\r\ninvolvement of organised crime in the manufacture, distribution, trafficking\r\nand supply of 4,4'-DMAR within the Union. The chemical precursors and the\r\nsynthetic routes used to manufacture 4,4'-DMAR are unknown. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,4'-DMAR is not listed\r\nfor control in the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs or\r\nin the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances; it is currently\r\nnot under assessment and has not been under assessment by the United Nations\u2019 system\r\nand no such assessment is planned.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,4'-DMAR has no established\r\nor acknowledged medical human or veterinary use in the Union. Apart from its use\r\nin analytical reference materials, and in scientific research investigating its\r\nchemistry, pharmacology and toxicology, there is no indication that it is being\r\nused for other purposes.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The risk assessment report\r\nreveals that there is limited scientific evidence available on 4,4'-DMAR and\r\npoints out that further research would be needed to determine the health and\r\nsocial risks that it poses. However, the available evidence and information\r\nprovides sufficient ground for subjecting 4,4'-DMAR to control measures across\r\nthe Union. As a result of the risks to health that the consumption of 4,4'-DMAR\r\nposes, as documented by its detection in several fatalities, of the fact that\r\nusers may unknowingly consume it and of the lack of medical value of this\r\nsubstance, 4,4'-DMAR should be subjected to control measures.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since three Member States\r\ncontrol 4,4'-DMAR under national legislation complying with the obligations of\r\nthe 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances and five Member\r\nStates use other legislative measures to control it, subjecting this substance\r\nto control measures across the Union would help avoid the emergence of\r\nobstacles in cross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and would\r\nprotect from the risks that its availability and use can pose.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A risk assessment report on\r\nthe new psychoactive substance 1-cyclohexyl-4-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine (MT-45)\r\nwas drawn up in compliance with Article 6(2), (3) and (4) of Decision\r\n2005/387/JHA by a special session of the extended Scientific Committee of the EMCDDA,\r\nand was subsequently submitted to the Commission and to the Council on 6\r\nOctober 2014.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MT-45 is an N,N\u2019-disubstituted\r\npiperazine, having a cyclohexane ring attached to one of the nitrogen atoms of\r\nthe piperazine ring and a 1,2-diphenylethyl moiety attached to the other\r\nnitrogen atom. MT-45 is one of a series of 1-(1,2-diphenyl\u00adethyl) piperazine\r\nanalgesics invented in the early 1970s. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MT-45 has been present on\r\nthe drug market in the Union since October 2013 where it is sold as a 'research\r\nchemical', mostly on the Internet. EMCDDA identified 12 sites of internet\r\nsuppliers and retailers that offered MT-45 for sale, including some apparently\r\nbased in the Union.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A total of 28 fatalities\r\noccurring between November 2013 and July 2014 were reported by one Member State. In most cases, the presence of MT-45 in biological samples was analytically\r\nconfirmed. Some 18 non-fatal intoxications were also reported by the same Member State and the clinical features were similar to opioid intoxication, responding in\r\nsome cases to the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are several studies\r\nin animals indicating that the acute toxicity of MT-45 is several-fold higher\r\nthan that of morphine. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Available information\r\nsuggests that MT-45 has not been widely used. The substance appears to be\r\nmostly used in the home environment either by users willing to try any new\r\nsubstance or by opioid dependent users with no access to heroin or any other\r\nopioid. Users may combine MT-45 with other psychoactive substances. There is no\r\ninformation on the social risks that may be related to MT-45.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is no evidence of involvement\r\nof organised crime in the manufacture, distribution, trafficking and supply.\r\nThe chemical precursors and the synthetic routes used to manufacture the MT-45\r\ndetected in Member States are unknown. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MT-45 is not listed for\r\ncontrol in the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs or in\r\nthe 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances; it is currently\r\nnot under assessment and has not been under assessment by the United Nations\u2019\r\nsystem, and no such assessment is planned.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MT-45 has no established or\r\nacknowledged human or veterinary medical use in the Union. Apart from its use\r\nin analytical reference materials, and in scientific research investigating its\r\nchemistry, pharmacology and toxicology, there is no indication that it is being\r\nused for other purposes.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The risk assessment report\r\nreveals that there is limited scientific evidence available on MT-45 and points\r\nout that further research would be needed to determine the health and social\r\nrisks that it poses. However, the available evidence and information provides\r\nsufficient ground for subjecting MT-45 to control measures across the Union. As a result of the health risks that it poses, as documented by its detection in\r\nseveral fatalities, and of the lack of medical value of this substance, MT-45\r\nshould be subjected to control measures.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since one Member States\r\ncontrols MT-45 under national legislation complying with the obligations of the\r\nUnited Nations Drug Conventions and seven Member States use other legislative\r\nmeasures to control it, subjecting this substance to control measures across\r\nthe Union would help avoid the emergence of obstacles in cross-border law\r\nenforcement and judicial cooperation, and would protect from the risks that its\r\navailability and use can pose,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe following new psychoactive substances shall\r\nbe subjected to control measures across the Union:\n(a)         \r\n4-methyl-5-(4-methylphenyl)-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-amine\r\n(4,4'-DMAR);\n(b)         \r\n1-cyclohexyl-4-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine\r\n(MT-45).\nArticle 2\nBy [one year from the date this Decision is published], Member\r\nStates shall take the necessary measures, in accordance with their national law,\r\nto subject the new psychoactive substances referred to in Article 1 to control\r\nmeasures and criminal penalties, as provided for under their legislation\r\ncomplying with their obligations under the 1971 United Nations Convention on\r\nPsychotropic Substances.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\ntwentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of\r\nthe European Union\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ\r\nL 127, 20.5.2005, p. 32.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ\r\nL 127, 20.5.2005, p. 32.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
