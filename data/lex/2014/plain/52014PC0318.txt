Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the Commission\r\ndecided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more\r\nthan ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that\r\ndepartments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for\r\nwhich they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and\r\nreadily understandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law\r\napplicable to a given matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament,\r\nthe Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the\r\nfast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 452/2003 of 6 March 2003 on measures that the Community may take in\r\nrelation to the combined effect of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with\r\nsafeguard measures[3]. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in\r\nit[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by\r\nthe codification exercise itself.\n.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was drawn up on the\r\nbasis of a preliminary consolidation, in 22 official languages, of Regulation (EC) No 452/2003 and the\r\ninstrument amending it, carried out by the Publications Office of the European\r\nUnion, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have\r\nbeen given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is\r\nshown in a table set out in Annex II to the codified Regulation.\n\u00ea 452/2003\r\n(adapted)\n2014/0164 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non measures that the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 may take in\r\nrelation to the combined effect of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with\r\nsafeguard measures (codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5, and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00ea \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 452/2003[6]\r\nhas been substantially amended[7].\r\nIn the interests of clarity and rationality, that Regulation should be\r\ncodified.\n\u00ea 452/2003\r\nrecital 1 (adapted)\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009[8],\r\ncommon rules \u00d6 were laid\r\ndown \u00d5 for protection\r\nagainst dumped imports from countries which are not members of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5.\n\u00ea 452/2003\r\nrecital 2 (adapted)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 597/2009[9],\r\ncommon rules \u00d6 were laid\r\ndown \u00d5 for protection\r\nagainst subsidised imports from countries which are not members of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5.\n\u00ea 452/2003\r\nrecital 3 (adapted)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 260/2009[10] and Council Regulation\r\n(EC) No 625/2009[11], common rules \u00d6 were laid\r\ndown \u00d5 for the\r\nadoption of safeguard measures against imports from certain countries which are\r\nnot members of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5. Safeguard\r\nmeasures may take the form of tariff measures applicable either to all imports\r\nor to those imports in excess of a pre\u2011determined quantity. Such safeguard\r\nmeasures imply that the goods are eligible to enter the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 market upon\r\npayment of the relevant duties.\n\u00ea 452/2003\r\nrecital 4\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nimportation of certain goods may be subject to both anti-dumping or anti-subsidy\r\nmeasures on the one hand and safeguard tariff measures on the other. The\r\nobjectives of the former are to remedy market distortions created by unfair\r\ntrading practices, whilst the objectives of the latter are to grant relief\r\nagainst greatly increased imports.\n\u00ea 452/2003\r\nrecital 5 (adapted)\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However,\r\nthe combination of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with safeguard tariff\r\nmeasures on one and the same product could have an effect greater than that\r\nintended or desirable in terms of the \u00d6 Union\u2019s \u00d5 trade defence\r\npolicy and objectives. In particular, such a combination of measures could\r\nplace an undesirably onerous burden on certain exporting producers seeking to\r\nexport to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5, which may\r\nhave the effect of denying them access to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 market.\n\u00ea 452/2003\r\nrecital 6 (adapted)\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently,\r\nexporting producers seeking to export to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 should not be\r\nsubject to undesirably onerous burdens and should continue to have access to\r\nthe \u00d6 Union \u00d5 market.\n\u00ea 452/2003\r\nrecital 7 (adapted)\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis therefore desirable to ensure that the objectives of the safeguard tariff\r\nmeasures and anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy measures can be met without\r\ndenying those exporting producers access to the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 market.\n\u00ea 452/2003\r\nrecital 8 (adapted)\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore,\r\nspecific provisions should be \u00d6 laid\r\ndown \u00d5 to enable the\r\nCommission, where \u00d6 it\r\nconsiders \u00d5 it\r\nappropriate, to take action with a view to ensuring that a combination of\r\nanti-dumping or anti\u2011subsidy measures with safeguard tariff measures on\r\nthe same product does not have such an effect.\n\u00ea 452/2003\r\nrecital 9 (adapted)\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While\r\nit may be foreseeable that both the safeguard duty and the anti-dumping or anti\u2011subsidy\r\nmeasures may become simultaneously applicable to the same product, it is not\r\nalways possible to determine in advance at which precise point in time this may\r\noccur. Therefore, the Commission should be in a position to provide for such a\r\nsituation in a manner ensuring sufficient predictability and legal certainty\r\nfor all operators concerned.\n\u00ea 452/2003\r\nrecital 10 (adapted)\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission may consider it appropriate to amend, suspend or repeal anti-dumping\r\nand/or anti-subsidy measures or to provide for exemptions in whole or in part\r\nfrom any anti-dumping or countervailing duties which would otherwise be\r\npayable, or to adopt any other special measures. Any suspension or amendment\r\nof, or exemption from, anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures should be granted\r\nonly for a limited period of time.\n\u00ea 452/2003\r\nrecital 11\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any\r\nmeasures taken under this Regulation should be applicable from the date of\r\ntheir entry into force, unless otherwise specified therein, and should\r\ntherefore not provide a basis for the reimbursement of duties collected prior\r\nto that date.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .10 (adapted)\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  In order to ensure uniform conditions for \u00d6 the \u00d5 implementation\r\n\u00d6 of this Regulation \u00d5, implementing\r\npowers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised\r\nin accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[12],\n\u00ea 452/2003\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .10(1)\n1. Where the Commission considers that a\r\ncombination of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with safeguard tariff\r\nmeasures on the same imports could lead to effects greater than is desirable in\r\nterms of the Union's trade defence policy, it may adopt such of the following\r\nmeasures as it deems appropriate, in accordance with the examination procedure\r\nreferred to in Article 3(2):\n\u00ea 452/2003\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 measures to amend, suspend or\r\nrepeal existing anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy measures;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 measures to exempt imports in\r\nwhole or in part from anti-dumping or countervailing duties which would\r\notherwise be payable;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 any other special measures\r\nconsidered appropriate in the circumstances.\n2.
