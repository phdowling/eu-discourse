The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n \u00b7      Summary of the proposed action On 12 March 2013 the Commission initiated an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of electrolytic manganese dioxides (\u2018EMD\u2019) originating in South Africa. Following imposition of measures, imports of EMD from South Africa virtually ceased. However, the investigation concluded that there was a likelihood of recurrence of dumping should the measures be allowed to lapse. The Union industry was found to be still in a fragile and vulnerable situation and the likelihood of recurrence of injury was considered to be very high. The investigation further established that the continuation of measures would not be against the Union interest. It is therefore proposed that the Council adopt the attached proposal for a Regulation in order to prolong the measures currently in force on imports of EMD from South Africa, which should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. \n \u00b7      Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. \n \u00b7      Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n \u00b7      Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n The form of action is described in the basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n Indication of how the financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n \u00b7      Choice of instruments \n Proposed instruments: Regulation. \n Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union\nbudget.\n2014/0025 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on\nimports of certain manganese dioxides originating in the Republic of South Africa following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community [1] (the \u2018basic\nRegulation\u2019), and in particular Article 11(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission ('the Commission') after consulting the Advisory Committee,\nWhereas:\nA.

The request was lodged by the companies\nCegasa Internacional SA and Tosoh Hellas A.I.C. (\u2018the applicants\u2019), the only two\nUnion producers of EMD.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request was based on\nthe grounds that the expiry of the anti-dumping measures in force would be\nlikely to result in a recurrence of injurious dumping to the Union industry.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation of an expiry\nreview \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined, after\nconsulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed for the\ninitiation of an expiry review, the Commission announced on 12 March 2013 the\ninitiation of an expiry review under Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, by\na notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union[4], ('notice of\ninitiation'). \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review investigation period\nand the period considered\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation of\nlikelihood of recurrence of dumping covered the period from 1 January 2012 to\n31 December 2012 (\u2018the review investigation period\u2019 or \u2018RIP\u2019). The examination\nof the trends relevant for the assessment of the likelihood of a continuation\nor recurrence of injury covered the period from 1 January 2009 to the end of\nthe review investigation period (\u2018the period considered\u2019).\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the\ninvestigation\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the applicants, the exporting producer in South Africa, importers,\nusers in the Union known to be concerned and their associations, and the\nrepresentatives of the exporting country concerned, of the initiation of the\nexpiry review.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties were\ngiven the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a\nhearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. All\ninterested parties, who so requested and showed that there were particular\nreasons why they should be heard, were granted a hearing.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the limited\nnumber of interested parties which made themselves known, sampling of interested\nparties was not necessary.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Questionnaire replies were\nreceived from the exporting producer in South Africa, the two Union producers\nand two users belonging to the same group of related companies.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sought and\nverified all the information it deemed necessary for a determination of the\nlikelihood of recurrence of dumping and resulting injury and for the\ndetermination of the Union interest. Verification visits were carried out at\nthe premises of the following companies:\n(a)              \nUnion producers:\n\u2013     \nCegasa Internacional SA (\u2018Cegasa\u2019)\n\u2013     \nTosoh Hellas A.I.C (\u2018THA\u2019)\n(b)              \nExporting producers in South Africa:\n\u2013     \nDelta E.M.D. (Pty) Ltd\n(c)              \nUsers\n\u2013     \nPanasonic Energy Belgium NV\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 29 October 2013, the\nCommission disclosed to all interested parties the essential facts and\nconsiderations on the basis of which it intended to propose maintaining the\nanti-dumping measures in force. Again, parties were given an opportunity to\nprovide comments and those who so requested were granted a hearing in the\npresence of the Hearing Officer. The comments made by the interested parties were\nconsidered by the Commission and responded to below.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRODUCT CONCERNED AND\nLIKE PRODUCT\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned by\nthis review is the same as the one defined in Regulation (EC) No 221/2008, namely\nelectrolytic manganese dioxides (i.e. manganese dioxides produced through an\nelectrolytic process) not heat-treated after the electrolytic process (\u2018the\nproduct under review\u2019 or \u2018EMD\u2019), originating in the Republic of South Africa,\ncurrently falling within CN code ex 2820 10 00. It comprises two main types, carbon\nzinc grade EMD and alkaline grade EMD.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The review investigation\nconfirmed that, as in the original investigation, the product under review imported\ninto the Union market and the products manufactured and sold by the exporting\nproducer on their domestic market, as well as those manufactured and sold in\nthe Union by the Union Industry (\u2018the like product\u2019), have the same basic\nphysical and chemical characteristics and uses. Therefore, these products are\nconsidered to be like products within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic\nRegulation.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENCE\nOF DUMPING\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n11(2) of the basic Regulation, the Commission examined whether the expiry of\nthe existing measures would be likely to lead to a recurrence of dumping.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping of imports during\nthe RIP\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports to the Union from South Africa dropped to almost zero after the imposition of measures, with only a very\nsmall quantity exported in 2010, 2011 and during the RIP. To assess whether the\nsole known exporting producer Delta EMD (Pty) Ltd (\u2018Delta\u2019) was exporting to\nthe Union at dumped prices during the RIP, the Commission sent a questionnaire\nto Delta. It received a reply including data on domestic sales, exports to the Union and exports to other destinations. The reply provided was verified as detailed below.\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal value\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n2(2) of the basic Regulation Delta\u2019s domestic sales were examined to see whether\nthe total volume of sales of the like product to independent customers was\nrepresentative in comparison with its total volume of export sales to the\nUnion, i.e. whether the total volume of such sales represented at least 5% of\nthe total volume of export sales of the product under review to the Union. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the domestic sales of\nthe product under review were representative there were no sales in the\nordinary course of trade as Delta\u2019s domestic sales of EMD were unprofitable. Normal\nvalue was therefore constructed under Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This was done on the basis\nof the actual cost of production of EMD, to which a reasonable amount for\nselling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) and for profit was added\nin accordance with Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The SG&A was calculated\nusing Article 2(6)(c), as Delta's sales were not in the ordinary course of\ntrade and since both Article 2(6)(a) and (b) were not applicable given that\nrespectively there are no other exporters or producers subject to the\ninvestigation, and Delta does not have any other sales of products of the same\ngeneral category. Using the SG&A of the original investigation, which gave\nan almost identical percentage as the actual SG&A, was therefore considered\na reasonable method. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After disclosure, Delta\nrequested the Commission to calculate the constructed normal value by expressing\nthe SG&A calculated above as a percentage of cost of manufacturing rather\nthan as a percentage of turnover. Given that all domestic sales were unprofitable,\nthe use of turnover would result in inflated SG&A costs. The Commission\naccepted Delta\u2019s claim and when constructing normal value, the Commission added\nSG&A as a percentage of the cost of manufacturing per kg from this review\ninvestigation.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Profit was also calculated\nusing the same methodology as in the original investigation, i.e. on the basis\nof long-term lending commercial interest rates in South Africa during the RIP\nunder Article 2(6)(c). Delta does not sell other products on the domestic\nmarket, and there are no other known producers of EMD or other producers of\nproducts of the same general category in South Africa from whom profit data\ncould be taken.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After disclosure the Union\nindustry requested that the Commission use sales to the USA to determine normal value, as they perform the function of sales on the domestic market, under\nArticle 2(3) of the basic Regulation.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This was rejected as normal\nvalue was constructed under Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation using the same\nmethodology as in the original investigation, and therefore \u00a0in line with Article\n11(9) of the same Regulation.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export price\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The very small quantity of\nEMD exported to the Union during the RIP was sold directly to an unrelated\nimporter in the Union. In accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation,\nthe export price was taken as the price paid by the importer to Delta.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A comparison was made\nbetween the export price and the constructed normal value by taking account of\nthe claimed and verified adjustments under Article 2(10) of the basic\nRegulation, namely freight costs, insurance, credit costs and handling charges\non the export side. The normal value was constructed on an ex-works basis by\nremoving freight charges and credit costs. The costs of packaging and technical\nassistance were not removed as they were already accounted for in the cost of\nmanufacturing and therefore included in both the export price and the\nconstructed normal value.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margin\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EMD sold to the Union by Delta during the RIP was found not to have been dumped. However the quantity\ninvolved was extremely small and thus this finding could not be fully relied\nupon to establish likelihood of recurrence of dumping, should the measures\nlapse.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evidence of likelihood of\nrecurrence of dumping\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since no conclusions could\nbe drawn from the sale to the EU during the RIP, the Commission analysed\nwhether there was evidence of likelihood of recurrence of dumping should the\nmeasure lapse. When doing so, the following elements were analysed: the export\nprice from South Africa to other destinations, the production capacity and\nspare capacity in South Africa and the attractiveness of the Union market and\nother third markets.\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exports from South Africa to other destinations\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delta produces both\nalkaline grade EMD and carbon zinc grade EMD, and given that there is a market\nin the EU for the alkaline grade EMD and also (to a smaller extent) carbon zinc\ngrade EMD, the Commission examined the export price of both grades to third\ncountries during the RIP. These sales were compared to the constructed normal\nvalue as calculated above, taking into account differences which affect price\ncomparability.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sales of alkaline grade EMD\nto the USA, Delta\u2019s most important export market, accounted for roughly\ntwo-thirds of Delta\u2019s total exports during the RIP and were not dumped. However\nsales of alkaline grade EMD to other destinations (such as Thailand, Korea, China and Brazil), sold in smaller quantities, were found to be exported at dumped\nprices, with dumping margins ranging from 2% to 21%. In addition, when looking\nat the export sales of carbon zinc grade EMD to other destinations, mainly sold\nat low prices and low quantities, the dumping margins were higher, ranging from\n13% to 66%. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure the\nUnion industry claimed that the Commission should ignore the sales made to the USA during the RIP as the prices to that market were not an appropriate guide as to the likely\nprice level of sales to the EU market should measures lapse.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delta, on the other hand,\nrequested the Commission after disclosure to pay particular attention to the\nsales made to the USA, which represents the large majority of its alkaline\ngrade exports and is the most comparable market to the EU. \u00a0\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission analysed all\nexport sales to all destinations, calculated an average weighted export price\nof Delta\u2019s exports to all other non-EU destinations but also looked into great\ndetail at export prices to individual third countries. When looking at the\nquestion of the likelihood of recurrence of dumping, all export sales to all\ndestinations were found to be relevant, in particular in view of the\nsignificant price differences found on different export markets. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The USA market has its own particular characteristics, allowing Delta to charge significantly\nhigher prices there than elsewhere. In the USA demand significantly exceeds domestic\nsupply. Also, high entry barriers exist for a large number of potential\ncompetitors as high anti-dumping duties are in force against imports from China and Australia. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In these circumstances\nthere is no reason why the Commission should base its findings only on the\naverage export price or only examine export sales to one country instead of\nanalysing all export sales to all destinations. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delta\u2019s price behaviour to\nother export markets than the EU shows that although their exports to their\nmost important market (the USA) were not sold at dumped prices, sales to other\ndestinations were dumped. Further indicators, as set out below, are therefore\nrequired to assess the likelihood of recurrence of dumping should the measures\nlapse.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production capacity and\nspare capacity in South Africa\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delta has spare capacity to\nproduce EMD that could allow it to resume exports to the Union in some\nsignificant quantity should the measures lapse. Delta has estimated, and the\nCommission has confirmed, that this spare capacity was between 4 000 to 6 000\nMT per year. This calculation takes into account electricity shortages current\nin South Africa and volumes of waste. Given some difficulty in maintaining\nquality levels with a manually controlled plant, the Commission conservatively estimates\nthat between 2 000 to 3 000 MT per year would be alkaline grade EMD whereas the\nrest would be carbon zinc grade EMD. Both grades would however be suitable for\nthe EU market. \u00a0Whereas part of the carbon zinc grade EMD quantity might be\nabsorbed by other third country markets, there are no indications that other\nthird country markets or the domestic market could absorb the significant spare\ncapacity of alkaline grade EMD. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delta stated during the\nverification that they are a long established \u201ctop-up\u201d supplier for their\ncustomers on the US market, whereby they fill the gap when domestic producers\ncannot produce enough. Delta\u2019s exports to the USA have been stable over the\nlast 4 years, which suggests that there was no possibility for Delta to\nincrease its sales to the USA. If it was possible to increase exports to the USA, Delta would have done so already in order to benefit from the higher prices that prevail on the\n  US market and also from the increased economies of scale arising from\nproducing higher quantities. \n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delta\u2019s sales to the Asian\nmarket were more focused on carbon zinc EMD. Delta\u2019s sales to Asia account for\n50% of all of Delta\u2019s carbon zinc EMD sales. China has domestic EMD producers\nand Delta\u2019s exports to China during the IP remained limited to the very small\nquantity of alkaline EMD. As currently EMD exports to Japan are subject to anti-dumping measures and due to the fact that Japan has domestic EMD producers,\nit is unlikely that this market would absorb Delta\u2019s spare capacity. Therefore\nit is unlikely that the Asian market could absorb Delta\u2019s spare capacity of\nalkaline EMD. \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, the\nUnion industry commented that Delta\u2019s spare capacity was much higher than that\ngiven above, and pointed to several factors that would suggest this to be the\ncase. They also stated that all of Delta\u2019s spare capacity could be used to produce\nalkaline grade EMD of a quality to be sold to the EU market at dumped prices.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry also\nstated that Delta\u2019s exports to the USA would very likely diminish in the near\nfuture as one US producer had already announced increases in its production\ncapacity and the very probable decrease in demand for EMD in the USA following the announced exit from the market of a user of EMD. In addition, the Union\nindustry claimed that sales from South Africa to the USA after the end of the\ninvestigation period had already started to decline. This would mean that Delta\npotentially has additional quantities of alkaline EMD that would very likely be\ndiverted to the EU market should measures lapse.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delta\u2019s plant, capacity and\ncapacity to produce were verified by the Commission during the investigation. As\nstated above, in its calculations the Commission based itself on conservative calculations,\nin particular the conservative estimate of the split between alkaline and\ncarbon zinc production based on using its spare capacity. \u00a0Even with this conservative\nestimate, a significant \u00a0spare capacity, in view of the consumption in the EU\nof the product concerned, that can be used to produce alkaline grade EMD, was\nestablished.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As to the claim regarding\nthe likely evolution of Delta\u2019s exports to the USA the evidence presented to\nthe Commission suggests that these could come under pressure should USA EMD capacity\ncontinue to increase and demand continue to fall.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After disclosure, one user\nargued that Delta\u2019s spare capacity is low, given that Delta had a market share\nof 60-70% before measures were imposed. However, even by using a conservative\nestimate of Delta\u2019s \u00a0spare capacity, if this spare capacity is used to export\nto the EU, Delta could easily significantly increase its market share without\ntaking into account the possibility that exports to other destinations could be\nredirected to the EU. Such a development would result in a further increase of\nDelta\u2019s potential market share. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the Union\nmarket and other third markets\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delta\nhas a long-standing and profitable sales channel to the USA and no evidence was found that would\nsuggest that it would be in the interests of the company to deliberately redirect\nany of these sales to the Union. However, the spare capacity identified during\nthe investigation, or at least a substantial part of it, could likely only be\ndirected to the Union for the reasons mentioned in the recitals above. Moreover,\nthis is so because the Union market is among the largest in the world. In\naddition, before the anti-dumping measures in force were imposed, the Union\nmarket had been very attractive for Delta as it had a market share of between\n60-70%. \n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If Delta was to compete on\nprice with the Union producers, then it would be forced to reduce its export\nprices and thus to sell at dumped prices to match the prices charged by one\nUnion producer during the RIP. Delta could also redirect\ntheir exports of alkaline grade EMD that are currently sold to third countries (other\nthan the USA) to the EU at dumped prices because the Union market is more\nattractive than other non-US markets due to its size and generally higher prices.\nFurthermore, if Delta in the future might have to reduce the quantities of EMD\nexported to the USA then the EU market would be the very likely destination of\nsuch additionally available quantities.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, Delta\ncommented that their pricing policy was to sell on the EU market only if it\ncould achieve a profitable price.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This may or may not be the\ncase, but a profitable sale can still be a dumped one, if the export price\nremains lower than the normal value. In any case, no evidence could be provided\nto back up such a statement as Delta did not export significant quantities to\nthe EU over the last five years. In addition, the Union industry claimed that the\nsmall quantities of EMD that were sold by Delta to the EU during the IP were\ndone in order to maintain its certification with EU clients.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delta also commented that\nthe average import price into the EU of EMD during 2012 was EUR 1809 per MT,\nwhich was above their normal value, showing in Delta\u2019s view, that they could\ncompete with other importers and not dump.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However this average figure\nis made up of some extremely expensive imports from the USA, and some much cheaper imports from China. The imports from the USA could not be included in\nthis comparison as the extremely high price level, up to three or four times\nthe normal prices charged on the EU market, shed doubt on the reliability of\nthese prices and/or the imported product. If Delta was to compete on price with\nthe Chinese imports, at around EUR 1200 per MT, then Delta would be dumping on\nthe European market.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the\nlikelihood of recurrence of dumping\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the above, there is a\nlikelihood that if the measures were to lapse, dumping would reoccur. Alkaline\ngrade EMD is the product type manufactured by Delta which would most likely be\nsold to the Union should measures lapse as this was the product type that was exported\nby Delta in the past. Also currently most demand in the EU is still for\nalkaline grade EMD. The investigation showed that sales of alkaline grade EMD\nto destinations such as South Korea, China and Brazil were found to be exported\nat dumped prices, with dumping margins from 2% to 21%. \n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, Delta\u2019s spare\ncapacity is of a significant quantity in comparison to the Union consumption\nduring the RIP. If this capacity was used to export to the Union and to compete\non price with the Union producers or on price with the major imports from third\ncountries, then there is a strong likelihood that such exports would be made at\ndumped prices. \nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DEFINITION OF THE UNION\nINDUSTRY\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During\nthe RIP, the like product was produced by two producers in the Union, THA and Cegasa, who cooperated fully in the\ninvestigation. In the original investigation, Cegasa, which at that time did\nnot produce for the open market but only for captive use, was not a complainant\nand did not cooperate but did not oppose the investigation.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, an\ninterested party questioned the admissibility of Cegasa as applicant in the\nexpiry review since it was not a complainant in the original investigation, was\nnot producing for the open market and thus was not experiencing injury at that\ntime. This claim was rejected as a request for an expiry review must be lodged\nby or on behalf of Union producers but not necessarily by (only) the original\ncomplainant(s).\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two Union producers\naccount for all EMD production in the EU, and constitute the 'Union industry'\nwithin the meaning of Article 4(1) and Article 5(4) of the basic Regulation.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe purpose of the injury analysis, due to cooperation of the entire Union\nindustry, all injury indicators have been established at the microeconomic\nlevels. To protect confidentiality, all data are\npresented in indexed form or given as ranges.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SITUATION ON THE UNION\nMARKET\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumption in the Union\nmarket\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union\nconsumption was established on the basis of (i) the verified sales volumes of\nthe Union industry on the Union market, (ii) verified import volumes from the\nsole South African producer and, (iii) imports from other countries based on\nEurostat data.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union\nconsumption of EMD remained stable between 2009 and the RIP. It increased in 2010 and 2011 but in 2012 it went back to the levels\nof 2009.\nTable\n1\n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RIP \n Index (2009 = 100) || 100 || 102 || 108 || 100 \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from South Africa\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume and market share\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following imposition of\nmeasures, imports from South Africa virtually ceased.\nTable\n2\n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RIP \n Volume of imports subject to measures from South Africa || 100 || 2 || 3 || 1 \n Market share of imports subject to measures from South Africa \u00a0 || 100 || 2 || 4 || 1 \n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prices and undercutting\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The very few sales of EMD\nfrom South Africa to the Union during the RIP were not undercutting the Union\nindustry prices. However, in view of their very small volume, they cannot be\nrelied upon to draw any meaningful conclusion. \n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A comparison was therefore also\nmade between the prices of EMD produced and sold by the Union industry and\nthose of EMD produced in South Africa and sold to the rest of the world, based\non two scenarios; including and excluding sales to the USA. The reason for carrying out an analysis excluding Delta's export price to the USA was based on the particular market situation in the USA resulting in very high prices as\ncompared to Delta\u2019s export prices to other countries (see recitals above).\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ncomparison showed that, during the RIP, sales from South Africa to the rest of the world were\nnot undercutting the Union industry\u2019s prices if sales to the USA were taken into account , but were undercutting the Union industry\u2019s prices if sales to the USA were excluded. In addition, excluding the sales to the USA, Delta\u2019s export prices were also underselling the Union industry\u2019s prices.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, the\nUnion industry maintained that Delta\u2019s prices to the USA are not indicative of\nits future pricing to the EU and that due to structural differences between the\nEU and the US market, such prices should be disregarded. On the other hand,\nDelta reiterated that the US market is a mature EMD market where domestic\nproducers and importers compete freely and where there are many users,\nincluding users which are also present in the EU. As a consequence, Delta\u2019s\nsales to the USA should not be excluded. In addition, Delta considered that for\nthe purpose of underselling calculations, the Commission should have not used\nthe target profit achieved by the Union industry in the absence of dumped\nimports in the original investigation.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present case where\nimports from the country concerned virtually ceased following imposition of\noriginal measures, the investigating authority has to carry out a\nforward-looking analysis based on a number of reasonable assumptions, including\nthe likely price at which Delta would sell its EMD in the Union should the\nanti-dumping measures in force be allowed to lapse.\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is an undisputed fact\nthat each EMD market (USA, EU, Asia) is different and EMD producers apply\ndifferent pricing stategies bearing in mind not only their costs of production\nbut also the production capacity in the target country, the need to (re)gain\nmarket shares and the local conditions of competition. It is also an undisputed\nfact that Delta is pricing its EMD sales to the US market significantly higher\nthan in other markets. Therefore, it is expected that Delta\u2019s future prices to\nthe EU will not be determined by its current prices to the USA but will follow the specific EU market conditions and realities. \n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the disclosure document,\nfor the purposes of dumping calculations, Delta\u2019s selling prices of only alkaline\ngrade EMD to various markets were compared to the constructed normal value,\nwhereas for the purpose of undercutting calculations also Delta\u2019s sales of one\ntype of carbon zinc grade were taken into account. Following disclosure, the\nUnion industry commented that all Delta\u2019s sales of alkaline and carbon zinc\ngrade EMD should be taken into account for dumping and injury calculations. In\ncontrast, Delta claimed that since the vast majority of Union consumption and\nDelta\u2019s exports to the Union only consist of alkaline EMD, sales of carbon zinc\ngrade EMD should not be taken into account at all.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has reached\nthe conclusion that both alkaline and carbon zinc grade EMD, all types\nincluded, should be taken into account for both dumping and injury\ncalculations, for the following main reasons: First of all, as mentioned above,\nthere is also a market and consequently demand for carbon zinc grade EMD in the\nEU, albeit smaller than the market of alkaline grade EMD, and this market could\nalso be of interest for Delta\u2019s exports to the Union. Secondly, alkaline grade\nand carbon zinc grade EMD are manufacturerd in the same plant and in the same\nproduction line using the same raw material and the same production process. Depending\non the settings of the parameters in the electrolysis process (current density,\ntemperature, electrolyte concentration etc.), EMD producers can choose to\nproduce alkaline or carbon zinc EMD. Therefore, it is more appropriate to\ncalculate the undercutting by comparing the average export price of Delta\u2019s EMD\n(both alkaline and carbon zinc) with the average selling price of the Union\nproducers of EMD (both alkaline and carbon zinc). \n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As far as the underselling analysis\nis concerned, the Commission used as a reference the target profit achieved by\nthe Union industry in the absence of dumped imports in the original\ninvestigation, which corresponds to the profit that a capital intensive\nindustry such as the EMD manufacturers can expect to achieve in normal\nconditions of competition. However, the issue of the most appropriate target\nprofit is irrelevant in the context of this particular expiry review. Indeed, the\nCommission acknowledges that there was no continuation of dumping and therefore\nthere was no continuation of injury due to the undercutting. The focus of the\nanalysis is therefore forward-looking and aims to predict the likelihood of\nrecurrence of injury in case of likely recurrence of dumping.\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delta claimed that\npost-importation costs appeared to be underestimated because they did not take\ninto account the transport costs for the product delivered to customers from\nthe Antwerp port.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the Commission\ncompared the Union industry\u2019s prices ex-work with the exporters\u2019 price at Union\nborders, and therefore post-importation costs only concerned handling and\ntesting but not transportation costs. This claim was therefore rejected.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from other third\ncountries\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The following table shows\nthe development of imports from other third countries during the period\nconsidered in terms of volume and market share, as well as the average price of\nthese imports. \nTable\n3\n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RIP \n Volume of imports from other countries (tonnes) || 5 000 \u2013 10 000 || 10 000 \u2013 15 000 || 5 000 \u2013 10 000 || 5 000 \u2013 10 000 \n \u00a0Index 2009=100 || 100 || 113 || 92 || 88 \n Market share of imports from other third countries || 25% - 30% || 30% - 35% || 20% - 25% || 20% - 25% \n Values of imports from other countries (EUR) || 10m -15m || 15m-20m || 10m-15 m || 10m -15m \n Index 2009=100 || 100 || 113 || 93 || 102 \n Price of imports (EUR/tonne) || 1 566 || 1 572 || 1 590 || 1 809 \n Source: Eurostat \n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The volume of imports from\nother third countries of EMD into the EU decreased in the period considered.\nPrices of these imports are above the average level of prices of the Union\nindustry and Delta\u2019s prices to other markets excluding the USA during the RIP. As mentioned above, the value of 1809 euros per tonne is an average of very\ndiverse import prices, ranging from low priced imports from China to very expensively priced imports from USA. In particular, recorded price levels of imports\nfrom the USA are extremely high compared to any other price ranges from the\nUnion producers, Delta and other exporters, that they cannot be reasonably\nrelied upon to carry out the analysis. Therefore, this average cannot be taken\nas such as a reference price for future imports from South Africa. Delta would\nnot compete on price with the US imports but with the Union industry prices.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic situation of the\nUnion industry\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under Article 3(5) of the basic\nRegulation, all relevant economic factors and indices having a bearing on the\nstate of the Union industry during the period considered were examined.\n(a)         \nProduction\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union production\nincreased by 6% between 2009 and the RIP.

However, the observed increase in quantity,\nwhich was not significant as such, should be seen in the context of increased\nproduction capacity and decrease in selling prices, which resulted in the Union\nproducers\u2019 capacity utilisation and unit selling price dropping respectively by\n3 and 11 percentage points.\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time the\neconomic situation of the Union industry showed a deterioration in terms of profitability,\nreturn on investment, employment and cash flow. In particular, the\nprofitability, which is an important indicator of the status of the Union industry,\nis still significantly below the target profit as established in the original\ninvestigation. The Union industry has not yet fully recovered from the effects\nof past dumping, and is still in a fragile situation, and thus very vulnerable\nto any recurrence of dumped imports. Average sales prices have decreased over\nthe years and would in all likelihood decrease further if dumped imports from South Africa were to reoccur, thus exacerbating the already fragile situation of the Union\nindustry.\n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, certain\ninterested parties claimed that the current fragile and vulnerable situation of\nthe Union industry was neither due to dumped imports from South Africa nor due to the effects of past dumping.\n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They noted that the trends\nof the key economic indicators shown above concerned a period (from 2009 to the\nend of the RIP) where: (i) the original anti-dumping measures had already been\nin force for a while; (ii) imports from South Africa had virtually ceased; and\n(iii) a new player (Cegasa) entered the open Union market. Interested parties\nlooked at the economic indicators of each of the two Union producers\nseparately, instead of aggregating them, and concluded that the Union industry\nwas in a difficult situation due to newly experienced internal competition\namong the only two Union producers in the market.\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In particular, these interested\nparties claimed that the Commission had failed to acknowledge the fundamental\nchanges occurred in the Union industry since 2009. They noted that following\nimposition of the anti-dumping measures in force the economic indicators of the\noriginal and only complainant (THA) improved dramatically, thus removing all\nnegative effects of the past dumping. However, subsequently, the other Union\nproducer, Cegasa, which was previously manufacturing EMD only for captive use,\nrelocated its battery production facility outside the Union. As a consequence,\nit freed a significant amount of EMD for the open market, and started selling\nit at a low price, thus competing with the only other Union producer and\nexerting a strong downward pressure on prices, capacity utilisation and profitability.\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the disclosure document,\nthe Commission had already acknowledged the change in the configuration of the Union\nindustry compared to the original investigation. This has been a positive\ndevelopment which shows market openess and an increased level of competition\namong the various players including imports.\n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission also agrees\nthat under these circumstances and notably in the absence of imports from South\nAfrica the current state of the Union industry cannot be due to the dumping\nfrom South Africa and should not be qualified as \u2018continuation of injury\u2019.\n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has examined\nthe aggregate trends of both Union producers since 2009 and has concluded that\nthe key economic indicators are not favourable and that the Union industry is\nin a fragile and vulnerable state. Clearly, in the absence of imports from South Africa the reason cannot be the dumping practices of Delta. However, in an expiry\nreview where the focus is on the likelihood of recurrence of dumping and injury\nshould the measures lapse, dumping, injury and causation during the RIP are not\nthe determining factors of the analysis.\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission concludes\nthat the Union industry is still in a fragile and vulnerable situation and its\nprofitability is far from the levels that could be expected in such a capital\nintensive industry. A comparison with the original investigation can only be\nmade for one Union producer, as the other did not sell on the open Union market\nat that time. For that Union producer, profits in the RIP were significantly\nlower than found in the original investigation in the absence of dumped\nimports.\nF. LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENCE OF\nINJURY\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact of the projected\nvolume of imports and price effects in case of repeal of measures\n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only known South\nAfrican producer (Delta) of EMD has spare capacity and a potential to restart exporting\nto the Union market in significant quantities. During the original period\nconsidered (2002 to 2005/6) the market share of Delta increased strongly from\naround 30-40% to 60-70%. Delta has thus already shown its capability to rapidly\nincrease export volumes to the Union. \n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 The CIF export prices of\nDelta to the other markets, excluding the USA and including all types and all\ngrades of EMD, were lower than the prices of the Union industry in the RIP and\nundercut them. Lower prices on the other markets could be an incentive for\nDelta to divert these exports to the EU market should the measures lapse.\n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the spare capacity\nidentified during the investigation, the saturation of other export markets combined\nwith the attractiveness of the Union market, Delta would in all likelihood try\nto regain its substantial market share in the Union which was lost after\nimposition of the measures in force. As concluded above, for Delta to regain market share it\nwould need to export at dumped prices. Consequently, in the absence of\nanti-dumping duties on imports of EMD originating in South Africa, any recurrence\nof dumped imports would exercise an even stronger price pressure on the Union\nindustry and in all likelihood cause material injury.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the\nlikelihood of recurrence of injury\n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 The repeal of the measures\nwould in all likelihood result in a recurrence of dumped imports from South Africa resulting in a downwards pressure on Union industry prices and a worsening of its\neconomic situation. The repeal of measures against South Africa would therefore\nlikely result in a recurrence of injury due to the likely exacerbation of the\nalready fragile and vulnerable situation in which the Union industry was\ncurrently found to be.\nG. UNION INTEREST\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 Under Article 21 of the\nbasic Regulation, the Commission examined whether maintaining the existing\nanti-dumping measures against South Africa would be against the interest of the\nUnion as a whole. The determination of the Union interest was based on an\nappreciation of all the various interests concerned. \n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 All interested parties were\ngiven the opportunity to make their views known pursuant to Article 21(2) of\nthe basic Regulation. \n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 In the original\ninvestigation the imposition of measures was considered not to be against the\ninterest of the Union. As this investigation is a review, it analyses a\nsituation in which anti-dumping measures have already been in place, thereby allowing\nthe assessment of any undue negative impact on the parties concerned by the\ncurrent anti-dumping measures.\n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the conclusions on\nthe likelihood of recurrence of injurious dumping, the Commission examined whether\ncompelling reasons existed which would lead to the conclusion that it is not in\nthe Union interest to maintain measures against imports of EMD originating in\nSouth Africa.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the Union\nindustry and other Union producers\n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 Although the anti-dumping\nmeasures in force prevented dumped imports from entering the Union market, the\nUnion industry is still in a fragile and vulnerable situation, as confirmed by\nthe negative trends of some key injury indicators.\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 Should the measures be allowed\nto lapse, it is likely that the current situation of the Union industry will continue\nand further deteriorate given the likely influx of substantial volumes of\ndumped imports from South Africa. This influx would cause, amongst others, loss\nof market share, decrease in sales price, decrease in capacity utilisation and\nin general a serious deterioration of the Union industry's financial situation.\n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore clear that the\nmaintenance of anti-dumping measures against South Africa would not be against\nthe interest of the Union industry.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of importers\n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 In the original\ninvestigation it was found that the impact of the imposition of measures was\nnot likely to have a serious negative effect on the situation of importers in\nthe Union. No traders/importers cooperated in the current investigation.\nBearing in mind that there is no evidence suggesting\nthat the measures in force have considerably affected importers, it can be\nconcluded that the continuation of measures will not negatively affect the\nUnion importers to any significant extent.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of users\n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 All\nknown users of EMD in the Union (used by battery producers as raw material) were\ncontacted. Replies were received from two companies belonging to the same\nmultinational group. In the original investigation two additional battery\nproducers cooperated, which opposed the imposition of measures.\n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 The cooperating user\nexplained the difficult economic situation faced by battery producers in the\nUnion due to the downward pressure on prices exerted by their main customers\n(retailers), and the consequent risk of loss of jobs. However, it could not\nprovide any explanations or arguments as to why and how the termination of the\nmeasures against imports of EMD from South Africa would improve the situation.\n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 EMD accounts for only 10-15%\nof the total cost of production of batteries. This value decreased compared to\nthe original investigation. In addition, following imposition of measures, the\naverage sales price of EMD in the Union actually decreased. In reality, no\nevidence was provided that maintaining the measures in force would have a\nnon-negligible influence on the costs of production of battery producers.\n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of such\nevidence, the Commission concludes that maintaining the measures would not\nunduly affect the EMD users.\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, the\nsame user disagreed with the Commission\u2019s assessment of the situation and\ncommented that following imposition of measures one source of good quality EMD\ndisappeared, prices for EMD increased and even if EMD accounts for only 10-15%\nof the production costs this has a a significant impact on the already small\nprofitability of EU battery producers.\n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding the claim,\nthe evidence in the file shows that the user\u2019s choice not to make use of\nDelta\u2019s EMD was not linked to the imposition of anti-dumping duties and that\nthe threat to the user\u2019s profitability and jobs is not an increase in EMD price\nbut is in fact the downward pressure on price exerted by their main customers (multinational\nretailers with significant purchasing power) and by Chinese battery producers. \n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 The same user of EMD\ncommented that the measures should not be maintained, as the investigation\nfound no dumping to the EU during the RIP and that there was no risk of\nrecurrence of dumping due to the small market share possible for Delta if all\nits spare capacity was directed to the Union.\n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 This argument was rejected\nas Delta's potential market share identified would clearly be significant and\nthese exports to the Union would likely be made at dumped prices.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Future developments\n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainants mentioned\nin the request for an expiry review that if demand for electric cars increases\nin the EU in the future, there will be an upstream increase in demand for EMD\nwhich is said to be the raw material most frequently used in the production of\nlithium manganese oxide (LMO) which in turns serves as cathode material for\nrechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIB) used in many models of electric vehicles.\nThey claim that if injury from dumped South African imports re-occurs, the\nUnion EMD industry may not be around to service this potential future demand in\nnew technologies.\n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation did not\nfind conclusive evidence in support or against the claim that any future\ndevelopment in the electric car sector would significantly impact the EMD\nindustry and the demand for EMD. However, it is a fact that the Union industry is\ntesting the feasibility of manufacturing LMO using EMD, is able to obtain the\nknow-how and the equipment to do so in the future and is participating in a\nnumber of EU funded projects related to the research and development of\nlithium-ion batteries. \n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, this\nissue was briefly mentioned by some interested parties, but again no conclusive\nevidence was provided on the possible impact of any future development in the electric\ncar sector in the Union and/or in other markets on the product concerned.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on Union\ninterest\n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the evidence above, there\nare no compelling reasons against the maintenance of the current anti-dumping\nmeasures.\n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore under Article\n11(2) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports\nof certain electrolytic manganese dioxides originating in South Africa should\nbe maintained for an additional period of five years,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\ndefinitive anti-dumping duty is imposed on imports of electrolytic\nmanganese dioxides (i.e. manganese dioxides produced through an electrolytic\nprocess) not heat-treated after the electrolytic process, currently falling\nwithin CN code ex 2820 10 00 (TARIC code 2820 10 00 10) and originating in the\nRepublic of South Africa.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nrate of the definitive anti-dumping duty applicable to the net,\nfree-at-Union-frontier price, before duty, for the products manufactured by the\ncompanies listed below shall be as follows:\n Company || Anti-Dumping Duty || TARIC Additional Code \n Delta E.M.D. (Pty) Ltd. || 17,1% || A828 \n All other companies || 17,1% || A999 \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unless\notherwise specified, the provisions in force concerning customs duties shall\napply.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\nthe day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 69, 13.3.2008, p. 1.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C 180, 21.6.2012, p. 15.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C 72, 12.3.2013, p. 8.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
