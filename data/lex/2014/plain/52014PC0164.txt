The report is accompanied by a Commission staff working paper[3] containing the detailed evaluation.\nThis proposal also contains two measures to\r\nfacilitate family contacts: It introduces certain\r\nprocedural facilitations for close relatives coming to visit Union citizens\r\nresiding in the territory of the Member State of which the latter are nationals\r\nand for close relatives of Union citizens living in a third country and wishing\r\nto visit together with the Union citizen the Member State of which the latter\r\nis a national.\nFurthermore, it clarifies\r\nthat the same procedural facilitations should as a minimum be granted to family\r\nmembers of EU citizens who benefit from article 5(2), second subparagraph of Directive\r\n2004/38/EC on the rights of Union citizens and their family members to move and\r\nreside freely within the territory of the Member States.\nGeneral context \nRegulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing a Community Code on\r\nVisa (Visa Code) became applicable on 5 April 2010. The provisions regarding\r\nnotification and the requirements on providing the grounds of refusal,\r\nrevocation and annulment of visas and the right to appeal against such\r\ndecisions, became applicable on 5 April 2011.\nArticle 57(1) of the Visa Code requires the\r\nCommission to send the European Parliament and the Council an evaluation of its\r\napplication two years after all the provisions of the Visa Code have become\r\napplicable (i.e. 5 April 2013). The evaluation and accompanying staff working\r\ndocument have been submitted. Article 57(2) provides that the evaluation may\r\nbe accompanied by a proposal for an amendment of the Regulation. \nIn the light of the evaluation report's\r\nconclusions, the Commission decided to submit this proposal for amendments to\r\nthe legislation together with the report. \nThe proposed amendments while maintaining\r\nsecurity at the external borders and ensuring the good functioning of the Schengen\r\narea, make travel easier for legitimate travellers and simplify the legal\r\nframework in the interest of Member States, e.g. by allowing more flexible\r\nrules on consular cooperation. The common visa policy should contribute to\r\ngenerating growth and be coherent with other EU policies on external relations,\r\ntrade, education, culture and tourism. \nExisting provisions\nRegulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing a Community Code on\r\nVisas (Visa Code).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT \nConsultation of interested parties \nThe consultation of interested parties is\r\ncovered in the impact assessment[4] accompanying this proposal. \nImpact assessment (IA)\nBased on the evaluation report referred to\r\nin section 1, two principal problem areas were identified:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The overall length and costs\r\n(direct and indirect) and the cumbersome nature of the procedures; \nThe complex nature of this problem area is\r\nexplained in detail in the IA. As far as regulatory options are concerned, the issuing of multiple-entry visas (MEVs) with a long\r\nvalidity accompanied by certain procedural facilitations was considered the only win-win solution for both sides. It\r\nhas the potential to lessen the administrative burden on consulates and, at the\r\nsame time, it is considered a very important facilitation for certain groups of\r\ntravellers. In practice it would be equivalent to a visa waiver for the period\r\nof validity of the MEV, resulting in significant savings and efficiency\r\ngains both for visa applicants (in terms of time and cost) and consulates\r\n(time). The policy options envisaged in response to this problem area are\r\ntherefore fairly similar. Only the beneficiaries to be covered and the length\r\nof validity of the MEVs to be issued differ, as follows:\nMinimum regulatory option: introduction of\r\nmandatory procedural facilitations and mandatory issuing of MEVs valid for at\r\nleast one year and subsequently for three years for frequent travellers\r\n(defined as applicants who have previously lawfully used at least three visas\r\n(within the previous 12 months prior to the date of the application) that\r\nare registered in the Visa Information System (VIS).\nIntermediate option: introduction of mandatory procedural facilitations and mandatory\r\nissuing of MEVs valid for at least three years and subsequently for five years\r\nfor regular travellers (defined as applicants who have previously lawfully used\r\nat least two visas that are registered in the VIS).\nThe maximum option identified would\r\nextend mandatory procedural facilitations and mandatory issuing of MEVs\r\nimmediately for five years to the majority of applicants ('VIS registered\r\napplicants') by requiring only one lawfully used visa (within the previous\r\ntwelve months prior to the date of the application) that is registered in the VIS. \nThe IA showed that these options would all\r\nfurther harmonise the current legal framework and would lead towards a\r\ngenuinely common visa policy. The potential economic impacts on the Member States\r\nof these options occur because the travellers in possession of long(er)\r\nvalidity MEVs with are likely to make more trips to the Schengen area than they\r\notherwise would. The IA estimates that some 500 000 additional trips to the\r\nSchengen area with the minimum policy option, some 2 million with the\r\nintermediate and some 3 million with the maximum policy option. The additional\r\ntrips to the Schengen area obviously generate additional income: some. EUR 300\r\nmillion (some 7 600 supported full time equivalent /FTE/ jobs) in case\r\nof the minimum option; more than EUR 1 billion (ca. 30 000 supported FTE job)\r\nwith the intermediate option and some EUR 2 billion (50 000 supported FTE jobs)\r\nwith the maximum option. The IA also showed that the very high potential economic\r\nimpact of the maximum option is associated with a higher security risk. \nNone of these options would involve\r\nconsiderable additional costs. In fact, one of the driving forces behind the\r\npolicy options is to produce savings for both the Member States/consulates and\r\nvisa applicants. These options progressively lead to cost savings on the\r\napplicants' side, mainly resulting from the increasing number of long-validity\r\nMEVs issued. From the applicants' point of view, the maximum option is\r\nobviously the most efficient, and the minimum option is the least efficient.\r\nThe declining number of visa applications under the MEV-system, is expected to\r\nreduce Member States' visa revenues. However, the issuing of MEVs also reduces\r\ncosts, as fewer visa applications need to be processed: the economic benefits\r\nconsiderably exceed the estimated costs in all options.\nWhile it was clear that the maximum option\r\nhad a very high potential economic impact, it is associated with a potentially\r\nhigher security risk, too. To mitigate this risk, the approach proposed is to\r\nissue longer-validity MEVs gradually to 'VIS registered regular travellers'\r\n(first for three years, then on the basis of lawful use of that visa, for five\r\nyears). The impacts of this approach fall between the intermediate and the\r\nmaximum option identified in the IA, probably closer to the impacts of the\r\nmaximum option as far as the economic impacts are concerned. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 insufficient geographical\r\ncoverage in visa processing. \nThe minimum policy option assessed for this\r\nproblem area was to repeal Article 41 of the Visa Code (co-location, Common\r\nApplication Centres (CAC)) and to introduce a general notion/concept of\r\n'Schengen Visa Centre' which would provide a more realistic, more\r\nflexible definition with regard to certain forms of consular cooperation. The\r\nintermediate option in addition to the 'Schengen Visa Centres' was introducing\r\nthe concept of 'mandatory representation' according to which, if the Member\r\nState competent to process the visa application is neither present nor\r\nrepresented (under such an arrangement) in a given third country any other\r\nMember State present in that country would be obliged to process visa\r\napplications on their behalf. Finally, as a maximum option, in order to ensure\r\nadequate visa collecting/processing coverage, Commission implementing decisions\r\ncould\u00a0 lay down what the Schengen visa collecting network in third countries\r\nshould look like in terms of representation arrangements, cooperation with\r\nexternal service providers and pooling of resources by other means. \nThe\r\nIA noted that the maximum policy option could have the most positive impacts in\r\nterms of rationalising the visa collecting/processing presence and could offer\r\nimportant advantages for visa applicants and significant efficiency gains for consulates.\r\nHowever its feasibility appears low. Based on the impact assessment, the\r\nintermediate option was preferred. The IA points out that 'mandatory\r\nrepresentation' would secure consular coverage in any third country where there\r\nis at least one consulate present to process visa applications. This could have\r\na positive impact on some 100 000 applicants who would be able to lodge the\r\napplication in their country of residence instead of travelling to a country\r\nwhere the competent Member State is present or represented. \nThe\r\neconomic impacts of all the policy options were considered fairly modest. In\r\nfact due to the very nature of the problem, the policy options were not aimed\r\nat generating economic growth in the first place, but providing a better\r\nservice for visa applicants and providing a good legal framework for Member\r\nStates to rationalise their resources. The financial impacts of 'mandatory\r\nrepresentation' were considered not to be significant because, in principle, if\r\na high number of visa applications is addressed to a Member State in a given\r\nthird country that state will, in principle, already have ensured consular\r\npresence by being present or represented. Moreover the visa fee, in principle,\r\ncovers the average cost of processing. \nThe non-regulatory policy options were\r\nconsidered to have very little positive impact on addressing the problems or\r\nachieving the policy objectives, so they were not considered very effective.\nThe evaluation report suggests, and this\r\nproposal deals with a number of other (mostly quite technical) issues. The IA\r\ndid not cover those issues because the changes envisaged were not considered to\r\nhave substantial and/or measurable budgetary, social, or economic implications;\r\nmost of the proposed changes are intended to clarify or adjust/complement\r\ncertain provisions of the Visa Code without altering their substance.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary \nThe proposed amendments concern the\r\nfollowing issues: \nThe provisions on individual Member States'\r\nintroduction of airport transit visa requirement for nationals of specific\r\nthird countries have been revised to ensure transparency and proportionality\r\n(Article 3).\nTo distinguish clearly between different\r\ncategories of visa applicants while taking into account the full roll out of the\r\nVIS, definitions of 'VIS registered applicants' and 'VIS registered regular\r\ntravellers' have been added (Article 2). This distinction is reflected in all\r\nsteps of the procedure (Articles 5, 10, 12, 13, 18 and 21). An overview of the\r\nvarious procedural facilitations is set out below: \n   || Lodging in person || Collection of fingerprints || Supporting documents || Visa to be issued \n First time applicant \u2013 not VIS registered || YES || YES || Full list corresponding to all entry conditions || Single entry corresponding to travel purpose. However, a MEV may be issued, if the consulate considers the applicant reliable. \n VIS registered applicant (but not a regular traveller) || NO || NO, unless the fingerprints have not been collected within the last 59 months || Full list corresponding to all entry conditions || Single entry or MEV \n VIS registered regular traveller || NO || NO || Only proof of travel purpose Presumption (because of 'visa history' of fulfilment of entry conditions regarding migratory and security risk and sufficient means of subsistence. || First application: three year MEV Following applications: five-year MEV \nThe provisions regarding \"competent\r\nMember State\" (Article 5) have been simplified to make it easier for\r\napplicants to know where to lodge the application and to ensure that they can,\r\nin principle, always lodge the application in their country of residence. This\r\nimplies that in case the competent Member State is neither present nor\r\nrepresented in a given location, the applicant is entitled to apply at one of\r\nthe consulates present according to criteria set out in the article. \nThe provisions provide certain procedural\r\nfacilitations for close relatives of Union citizens so as to contribute to\r\nimproving their mobility, in particular by facilitating family visits (Articles\r\n8, 13, 14 and 20).\nFirst, the provisions provide for\r\nfacilitations for family members intending to visit Union citizens residing in\r\nthe territory of the Member State of which they are nationals and for family\r\nmembers of Union citizens living in a third country and wishing to visit together\r\nthe Member State of which the EU citizens are nationals. Both categories of\r\nsituations are outside the scope of Directive 2004/38/EC. The Visa Facilitation\r\nAgreements concluded and implemented by the EU with a number of third countries\r\ndemonstrate the importance of facilitating such visits: the amended Visa\r\nFacilitation Agreements with Ukraine and Moldova, as well as the recent Visa\r\nFacilitation Agreements with Armenia and Azerbaijan, provide facilitations\r\n(e.g. visa fee waiver and the issuing of multiple entry visas (MEVs) with a\r\nlong validity) for the citizens of the third country concerned visiting close\r\nrelatives who have the nationality of the Member State of residence. This practice of the Union should be made\r\ngeneral in the Visa Code.\nSecondly, according to the provisions the\r\nsame facilitations are granted as a minimum in situations covered by Directive\r\n2004/38/EC. As provided in Article 5(2) of the Directive, Member States may,\r\nwhere the EU citizen exercises the right to move and reside freely in their\r\nterritory, require the family member \u00a0who is a non-EU national to have an entry\r\nvisa. As confirmed by the Court of Justice[5],\r\nsuch family members have not only the right to enter the territory of the Member State but also the right to obtain an entry visa for that purpose. According\r\nto Article 5(2), second subparagraph of the Directive, Member States must grant\r\nsuch persons every facility[6]\r\nto obtain the necessary visas, which must be issued free of charge as soon as\r\npossible and on the basis of an accelerated procedure.\nIt should be noted that Article 5(2) cited\r\nabove essentially contains the same provision as Article 3(2) of Directive\r\n68/360/EEC[7]\r\nwhich was repealed by Directive 2004/38/EC. Article 3(2) of Directive\r\n68/360/EEC was adopted at a time when the then Community had no competence to\r\nlegislate on visas. Since the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May\r\n1999, the Community has had a competence to legislate on visas. This\r\ncompetence, currently enshrined in Article 77 of the TFEU, was used for the\r\nadoption of the Visa Code. It is desirable to render more precise the\r\nfacilitations which Directive 2004/38/EC refers to, and the appropriate place\r\nto do so is the Visa Code, where detailed rules on conditions and procedures for\r\nthe issuing of visas are established. While respecting the freedom of Member\r\nStates to grant further facilitations, the facilitations proposed for certain\r\nclose relatives of Union citizens who have not made use of their right to move\r\nand reside freely within the Union should apply, as a minimum, in situations\r\nwhich fall within the scope of Directive 2004/38/EC. Those facilitations are\r\nthen a common implementation in the Visa Code and for the Member States bound\r\nby it, of the obligation contained in Article 5(2), second subparagraph of\r\nDirective 2004/38/EC.\nThe provisions on visa fee waivers have\r\nbecome mandatory rather than optional to ensure equal treatment of applicants\r\n(Article 14). Certain categories eligible to visa fee waivers have been\r\nenlarged, e.g. minors up to 18 years, or added (close relatives of Union\r\ncitizens not exercising their right to free movement). \nGeneral procedural facilitations: \n\u2013                        \r\nThe principle of all applicants having to lodge\r\nthe application in person has been abolished (cf. Commission staff working\r\npaper, point 2.1.1.1 (paragraph (7)).Generally, applicants will only be\r\nrequired to appear in person at the consulate or the external service provider\r\nfor the collection of fingerprints to be stored in the Visa Information System\r\n(Article 9).\n\u2013                        \r\nThe maximum deadline for lodging an application\r\nhas been increased to allow travellers to plan ahead and avoid peak seasons;\r\nlikewise a minimum deadline for lodging an application has been set to allow\r\nMember States time to proper assessment of applications and organisation of\r\nwork (Article 8). \n\u2013                        \r\nThe general visa application form (Annex I) has\r\nbeen simplified and a reference has been made to the use of electronic filling\r\nin of the application form (Article 10).\n\u2013                        \r\nThe list of supporting documents in Annex II is no\r\nlonger a \"non-exhaustive list\" and a distinction has been made\r\nbetween unknown applicants and VIS registered regular travellers as regards the\r\nsupporting documents to be submitted (Article 13). The provisions regarding the\r\npreparatory work on drawing up lists adapted to local circumstances in local\r\nSchengen cooperation have been reinforced in Article 13. \n\u2013                        \r\nThe unknown visa applicant (i.e. someone who has\r\nnot applied for a visa before) should prove that he fulfils the visa issuing\r\nconditions.\n\u2013                        \r\nIn this context, attention is drawn to the\r\nrecent 'Koushkaki judgement'[8] according to which Articles 23(4), 32(1) and 35(6) (Articles 20(4),\r\n29(1) and 32(5) of the recast Visa Code) \"must be interpreted as meaning\r\nthat the competent authorities of a Member State cannot refuse, following the\r\nexamination of an application for a uniform visa, to issue such a visa to an\r\napplicant unless one of the grounds for refusal of a visa listed in those\r\nprovisions can be applied to that applicant. Those authorities have a wide discretion\r\nin the examination of that application so far as concerns the conditions for\r\nthe application of those provisions and the assessment of the relevant facts,\r\nwith a view to ascertaining whether one of those grounds for refusal can be\r\napplied to the applicant.\"\n\u2013                        \r\nThe European Court of Justice also ruled that the\r\nprovisions of Article 32(1) (now Article 29(1)) of the Visa Code, read in\r\nconjunction with Article 21(1) (now Article 18(1)), \"must be interpreted\r\nas meaning that the obligation on the competent authorities of a Member State\r\nto issue a uniform visa is subject to the condition that there is no reasonable\r\ndoubt that the applicant intends to leave the territory of the Member States\r\nbefore the expiry of the visa applied for, in the light of the general\r\nsituation in the applicant's country of residence and his individual characteristics,\r\ndetermined in the light of information provided by the applicant.\" \n\u2013                        \r\nIt should be presumed that 'VIS registered\r\nregular travellers' fulfil the entry conditions regarding the risk of irregular\r\nimmigration and need to possess sufficient means of subsistence. However, this\r\npresumption should be reversible in individual cases.\n\u2013                        \r\nThe proposal establishes that the authorities of\r\nthe Member States can rebut the presumption of fulfilment of entry conditions\r\nin an individual case and it establishes on which basis this can occur (Article\r\n18(9)).\n\u2013                        \r\nGeneral reduction of the deadlines for taking a\r\ndecision on a visa application (Article 20) in the light of the shortening of\r\nthe response time in the prior consultation procedure (Article 19). Short\r\ndeadlines are introduced for the examination of applications from family\r\nmembers of Union citizens exercising their right to free movement and from\r\nclose relatives of Union citizens not exercising their right to free movement.\n\u2013                        \r\nA MEV may be issued with a validity going beyond\r\nthe validity of the travel document (Article 11(a)).\n\u2013                        \r\nThe provisions on travel medical insurance (TMI)\r\nshould be deleted because the actual added value of the TMI measure has never\r\nbeen established (cf. Commission staff working paper, point 2.1.1.2 (14)).\n\u2013                        \r\nThe standard form for notifying and motivating\r\nrefusal, annulment or revocation of a visa has been be revised to include a\r\nspecific ground for refusal of an airport transit visa and to ensure that the\r\nperson concerned is properly informed about appeal procedures.\n\u2013                        \r\nProvisions derogating from the general\r\nprovisions on the exceptional issuing of visas at the external border have been\r\nintroduced: Member States will in view of promoting short term tourism be\r\nallowed to issue visas at the external borders under a temporary scheme and\r\nupon notification and publication of the organisational modalities of the\r\nscheme (Article 33). \n\u2013                        \r\nFlexible rules allowing Member States to\r\noptimise use of resources, increase consular coverage and develop cooperation\r\namong Member States have been added (Article 38).\n\u2013                        \r\nMember States' use of external service provider\r\nis no longer to be the last resort solution. \n\u2013                        \r\nMember States are not obliged to maintain the\r\npossibility of \"direct access\" for lodging applications at the\r\nconsulate in places where an external service provider has been mandated to\r\ncollect visa applications (deletion of previous Article 17(5)). However, family\r\nmembers of Union citizens exercising their right to free movement and close\r\nrelatives of Union citizens not exercising their right to free movement as well\r\nas applicants who can justify a case of emergency should be given an immediate appointment.\n\u2013                        \r\nMember States should annually report to the\r\nCommission on the cooperation with external service providers, including the\r\nmonitoring of the service providers. \n\u2013                        \r\nStreamlining of the provisions regarding\r\nrepresentation arrangements (Article 39) (cf. Commission staff working paper,\r\npoints 2.1.1.5 (paragraph (20)) and 2.1.4 (paragraph 41)).\n\u2013                        \r\nAs explained in the evaluation report (point 3.2)\r\nthe lack of sufficiently detailed statistical data hinders the assessment of\r\nthe implementation of certain provisions. Therefore, Annex VII is amended to\r\nprovide for the collection of all relevant data in a sufficiently disaggregated\r\nform allow for proper assessment. All data concerned can be retrieved (by\r\nMember States) from the VIS, except for information on the number of visas\r\nissued free of charge, but given that that is linked to the general treasury of\r\nthe Member State, such data should be easily accessible. \n\u2013                        \r\nStrengthening of the legal framework regarding\r\ninformation to the public (Article 45):\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A common Schengen visa internet\r\nwebsite is to be created by the Commission\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A template for the information to be given to visa\r\napplicants is to be developed by the Commission\nTechnical amendments: \n\u2013                        \r\nDeletion of the reference to the specific travel\r\npurpose \"transit\" (Article 1(1) mainly) given that short stay visas\r\nare not purpose bound. The reference has only been maintained where it referred\r\nto as a specific travel purpose, e.g. in Annex II to the Visa Code, listing the\r\nsupporting documents to be submitted according to purpose of travel\n\u2013                        \r\nEstablishing harmonised rules on the handling of\r\nsituations of loss of identity document and valid visa (Article 7). \n\u2013                        \r\nPrecise deadlines for Member States' various\r\nnotifications (15 days): on representation arrangements, introduction of prior\r\nconsultation and ex-post information.\n\u2013                        \r\nIn accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU, the\r\npower to amend non-essential elements of Regulation is delegated to the Commission\r\nin respect of the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold\r\nan airport transit visa when passing through the international transit areas of\r\nairports situated on the territory of the Member States (Annex III) and the\r\nlist of residence permits entitling the holder to transit through the airports\r\nof Member States without being required to hold an airport transit visa (Annex\r\nIV).\n\u2013                        \r\nIn accordance with Article 291 of the TFEU, the\r\nCommission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts establishing the list\r\nof supporting documents to be to be used in each location to take account of\r\nlocal circumstances, details for filling in and affixing of the visa stickers\r\nand the rules for issuing visas to seafarers at the external borders.\r\nTherefore, the previous annexes VII, VIII and IX should be deleted.\nLegal basis \nArticle 77(2)(a) of the Treaty of the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union.\nThis proposal recasts Regulation (EC) No\r\n810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009\r\nestablishing a Community Code on Visas (Visa Code) which was based on the\r\nequivalent provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community, i.e.\r\nArticle 62(2)(a) and (b)(ii). \nSubsidiarity principle\nArticle 77(2)(a) of the\r\nTFEU empowers the Union to develop measures concerning 'the common policy on\r\nvisas and other short stay residence permits'. \nThe current proposal is within the limits\r\nset by this provision. The objective of this proposal is to further develop and\r\nimprove the measures of the Visa Code concerning the conditions and procedures\r\nfor issuing visas for intended stays in the territory of Member States not\r\nexceeding 90 days in any 180 days period. It cannot be sufficiently achieved by\r\nthe Member States acting alone, because an amendment to an existing Union Act\r\n(the Visa Code) can only be achieved by the Union.\nProportionality principle\nArticle 5(4) of the TEU states that the content and form of Union\r\naction must not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the\r\nTreaties. The form chosen for this action must enable the proposal to achieve\r\nits objective and be implemented as effectively as possible. \nThe establishment of the Visa Code in 2009\r\ntook the form of a Regulation in order to ensure that it would be applied in\r\nthe same way in all the Member States that apply the Schengen acquis.\r\nThe proposed initiative constitutes an amendment to an existing regulation and\r\nmust therefore take the form of a regulation. As to the content, this\r\ninitiative is limited to improvements of the existing regulation and based on\r\nthe policy objectives to which one new objective was added: economic growth.\r\nThe proposal therefore complies with the proportionality principle.\nChoice of instrument\nThis proposal recasts Regulation No\r\n810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009\r\nestablishing a Community Code on Visas (Visa Code). Therefore only a Regulation\r\ncan be chosen as a legal instrument.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\r\nIMPLICATIONS\nThe proposed amendment has no implications\r\nfor the EU budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS \nConsequences of the various protocols\r\nannexed to the Treaties and of the association agreements concluded with third\r\ncountries \nThe legal basis for this proposal is to be\r\nfound in Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion, with the result that the system of \u2018variable geometry\u2019, provided for in\r\nthe protocols on the position of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark and\r\nthe Schengen protocol applies. The proposal builds on the Schengen acquis.\r\nThe consequences for the various protocols therefore have to be considered with\r\nregard to Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom; Iceland and Norway; and\r\nSwitzerland and Liechtenstein. Likewise, the consequences for the various Acts\r\nof Accessions must be considered. The detailed situation of each of these\r\nstates concerned is described in recitals 49-57 of this proposal. The system of\r\n'variable geometry' of this proposal is identical to the one that applies to\r\nthe original Visa Code, with the addition of a reference to the 2011 Act of\r\nAccession regarding Croatia. \nLink with the simultaneous proposal for\r\na Regulation establishing a touring visa[9]\nPossible amendments to this proposal during\r\nthe legislative process will have an impact on the proposal for a Regulation\r\nestablishing a touring visa, so particular attention should be paid to ensuring\r\nthe necessary synergies between these two proposals during the negotiation\r\nprocess. If in the course of these negotiations an adoption within a similar\r\ntimeframe appears within reach, the Commission intends to \u00a0merge the two\r\nproposals into one single recast proposal. In case the legislators reach\r\nagreement on the present proposal before there is prospect of imminent\r\nagreement on the proposal for a Regulation establishing the touring visa, the\r\nprovisions in this proposal relating to the envisaged touring visa (Articles\r\n3(7), 12(3), 18(6)) should not be maintained for adoption but be inserted later\r\nby an amendment to the Visa Code when agreement on the touring visa proposal has\r\neventually been reached.\nSuccinct\r\noverview of the proposed amendments \nArticle 1 \u2013 Amendments to the Visa Code\nArticle 1 \u2013 Subject matter and\r\nscope\n\u2013                        \r\nHorizontal change: throughout the text the\r\nreference to \"transit\" as a travel purpose has been deleted. \nArticle 2 - Definitions\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 6 is added to refer to the definition\r\nof 'touring visa' in the relevant Regulation. \n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 7 is added to provide a definition of\r\n'close relatives' (of citizens of the Union).\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 8 is added to provide a definition of\r\n'VIS registered applicant' to ensure that full benefit is drawn of the Visa\r\nInformation System. \n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 9 is added to provide a definition of\r\n'VIS registered regular traveller' to ensure that full benefit is drawn of the\r\nVisa Information System and account is taken of the applicant's 'visa history'.\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 12 is added to provide a definition of\r\n'valid' in the sense of not expired as opposed to false, counterfeit or forged.\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 16: a definition of 'seafarer' is\r\nadded to ensure that all staff working on ships benefit from the various\r\nprocedural facilitations.\nArticle 3 \u2013 Third country nationals\r\nrequired to hold an airport transit visa\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 4: the provisions on the introduction\r\nby individual Member States of an airport transit visa requirement for\r\nnationals of specific third countries have been revised to be covered by the\r\nappropriate institutional legal framework. \nArticle 5 \u2013 Member State competent\r\nfor examining and deciding on an application\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 1 (b) is amended to maintain only one\r\nobjective criterion, i.e. length of stay, for determining the Member State\r\ncompetent for examining an application when the envisaged trip covers more than\r\none destination. Additionally, provisions have been added to cover situations\r\nwhere the traveller is to carry out several trips to different Member States\r\nwithin a short timeframe, i.e. two months.\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 2 is amended to overcome situations\r\nwhere the \"competent\" Member State is neither present nor represented\r\nin the third country where the applicant legally resides. The provisions cover\r\nall possible situations and offer solutions expressing the spirit of\r\ncooperation and confidence on which the Schengen cooperation is based.\nArticle 7 - Competence to issue\r\nvisas to third-country nationals legally present within the territory of a\r\nMember State \n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 1 is amended as a consequence of the\r\namendment of Article 5. \n\u2013                        \r\nParagraphs 2 and 3 are inserted to create a\r\nharmonised legal framework for situations where a third country national loses\r\nhis/her travel document, or this document is stolen, while staying in the\r\nterritory of the Member States. \nArticle 8 \u2013 Practical modalities\r\nfor lodging an application\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 1 establishes general maximum and\r\nminimum deadlines for lodging an application. \n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 3 is added to provide facilitation in certain\r\nsituations involving relatives of Union citizens where an immediate appointment\r\nshould be given.\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 4 is amended to become mandatory ('shall')\r\nrather than optional ('may'), meaning that urgency cases shall always be\r\ntreated immediately.\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 5 is amended to clarify the rules on\r\nwho may lodge the application on behalf of the applicant and a reference has\r\nbeen made to professional, cultural,sports or education association or\r\ninstitution as distinct from commercial intermediaries.\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 6 has been moved from the previous Article\r\n40(4) and amended to cover only the provision on applicants having only to\r\nappear in person at one location to lodge an application. \nArticle 9 - General rules for lodging\r\nan application\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 1 has been replaced by a new text to\r\ntake account of the abolition of the general principle of all applicants having\r\nto lodge the application in person (cf. Commission staff working paper, point\r\n2.1.1.1 (paragraph (7)).\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 2 is amended as a consequence of the\r\namendment of paragraph 1.\nArticle 10 \u2013 Application form \n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 1 is amended to add a reference to the\r\npossibility of filling in the application form electronically.\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 2 is inserted to ensure that the\r\nelectronic version of the application form corresponds precisely to the\r\napplication form set out in Annex I\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 4 has been simplified to ensure that\r\nthe application form is always, as a minimum, available in the official\r\nlanguage of the Member State, for which the visa is requested, and the host\r\nstate.\nArticle 11 \u2013 Travel document \n\u2013                        \r\nPoint (a) is amended with a cross reference to\r\nthe new provision in Article 21 (2), see below.\n\u2013                        \r\nPoint (b) is amended to ensure that one blank\r\ndouble page be available in the applicant's travel document so that the visa\r\nsticker and subsequent entry-exit stamps are placed next to each other. This\r\nwill facilitate border checks; cf. Commission staff working paper, point\r\n2.1.1.2 (paragraph (11)).\nArticle 12 \u2013 Biometric identifiers \n\u2013                        \r\nParagraphs 2 and 4 are amended as a consequence\r\nof the amendment of Article 9 (1)).\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 3 is amended to take account of the\r\nproposal on the 'touring visa'.\nArticle 13 \u2013 Supporting documents \n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 2 is inserted to take account of the\r\nprocedural facilitations to be granted to VIS registered regular travellers,\r\nmeaning that this category of applicants only have to present proof of travel\r\npurpose. \n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 3 is inserted to grant or clarify\r\nfacilitations for relatives of Union citizens in certain situations. \n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 4 is amended to establish that the\r\nharmonised list of supporting documents in Annex II is exhaustive.\n\u2013                        \r\nParagraph 6 is inserted to ensure that\r\napplicants can submit facsimile or copies of original supporting documents.
