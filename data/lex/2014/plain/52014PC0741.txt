As a consequence, in application of its Article\r\n10(3), the Convention entered into force in relation to the EU on\r\n1 May 2012. Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, the other Contracting\r\nParties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area[2] (hereafter \u2018the EEA\r\nAgreement\u2019), signed the Convention on 15 June 2011, 30 June 2011 and 15 June\r\n2011, respectively and deposited their instrument of acceptance with the\r\ndepositary of the Convention on 9 November 2011, 12 March 2012 and 28 November\r\n2011, respectively. As a consequence, in application of its Article 10(3), the\r\nConvention entered into force in relation to Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein on 1 January 2012, 1 May 2012 and 1 January 2012, respectively.\nArticle 6 of the Convention provides that\r\neach Contracting Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the\r\nConvention is effectively applied. As a consequence, in the EEA Agreement,\r\nProtocol 4 on rules of origin should be replaced by a new Protocol which, as\r\nmuch as possible, refers to the Convention. At the same time, the text of\r\nProtocol 4 is updated aligning it, inter alia, to the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union.\nThis proposal replaces Protocol 4 entirely\r\nwith a new Protocol in order to enhance readability for economic operators and\r\nfor administrations. The changes compared to the current Protocol are the\r\nfollowing:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 3 is amended in\r\norder to extend the application of diagonal cumulation of origin to any country\r\nwhich is a participant in the EU\u2019s Stabilisation and Association Process[3], which is one of the\r\nmain goals of the Convention. The reference to the countries participating in\r\nthe EU\u2019s Stabilisation and Association Process is added in Article 3(1) in\r\norder to avoid the mandatory use of EUR-MED certification. For the same reason,\r\nthe reference to the Faroe Islands is moved from Article 3(2) to 3(1).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the reference to\r\nArticle 32 in the Table of Contents, the words \u2018Mutual assistance\u2019 are replaced\r\nby \u2018Administrative cooperation\u2019.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The word \u2018Community\u2019 is\r\nreplaced by \u2018European Union\u2019 in the heading \u2018Joint Declarations\u2019 in the Table\r\nof Contents, in Articles 3(1), 3(5), 4(2) and 31(1), as well as in the Joint\r\nDeclarations.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The words \u2018Commission of\r\nthe European Communities\u2019 are replaced by \u2018European Commission\u2019 in Articles\r\n3(5), 31(3) and 32(1).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 5(2) the words\r\n\u2018shall not be used\u2019 is replaced by \u2018should not be used\u2019.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 6(1) the\r\nfollowing is inserted after letter (m):\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\u2018(n)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mixing of sugar with any materials;\u2019\u00a0\u00a0 \r\nThe current letters (n) to (p) are renumbered letters (o) to (q).\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The title of Article 32 is\r\nreplaced by:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\u2018Administrative cooperation\u2019\nThe content of Annexes I to IVb, is\r\nreplaced by a reference to the Convention.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe EU Member States were consulted on the\r\ndraft Council Decision in the Customs Code Committee's Origin Section of 13 May\r\n2013. The Contracting Parties to the Convention were consulted at the meeting\r\nof the Pan-Euro-Med working group of 14 and 15 May 2013.\nNo recourse to external expertise has been\r\nnecessary. Furthermore, it has not been necessary to conduct an impact\r\nassessment, since the proposed amendments are technical in nature and do not\r\naffect the substance of the protocol on rules of origin currently in effect.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n2894/94 concerning arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement provides\r\nthat the Council establishes the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf on such Decisions, on a proposal from the Commission.\nThe legal basis for the amendment of this\r\nprovision is Article 207in conjunction with Article 218(9) of the Treaty\r\non the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union.
