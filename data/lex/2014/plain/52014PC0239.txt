In adopting the convention in\r\n1930, the International Labour Conference called upon member States to suppress\r\nthe use of forced labour within the shortest possible period, and to\r\ncriminalize the offence. Yet, over 80 years later, and despite almost universal\r\nratification of the Convention, the practice still exists, albeit in different\r\nforms to those that provoked such concern in the early twentieth century, with\r\nthe ILO estimating that at least 20.9 million people are victims of forced\r\nlabour globally.\nThe aim of the ILO Recommendation to be\r\nconsidered by the 103rd session of the International Labour\r\nConference, hereinafter \"the Conference\" is to address implementation\r\ngaps to advance prevention of trafficking for labour exploitation as well as\r\nprotection and compensation of victims of forced labour.\nThe adoption of a Protocol on the same\r\nsubject is also on the agenda of the Conference and is subject to a separate\r\nRecommendation for a Council Decision authorising the opening of negotiations.\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consideration and possible\r\nadoption of a Recommendation to supplement the ILO Forced Labour Convention\r\nn\u00b029, 1930, at the 103rd session of the International Labour\r\nConference on 28 May-12 June 2014\nA standard setting item on \"supplementing\r\nthe Forced Labour Convention n\u00b029, 1930\u201d is on the agenda of the 2014\r\nInternational Labour Conference with a view to adopt a Protocol and/or a\r\nRecommendation. \nThis Conference agenda item was selected by the\r\n317th Session of the ILO Governing Body (March 2013) as a standard-setting,\r\nsingle-discussion item for the 103rd Session of the Conference.[1] This decision follows\r\nthe recommendations of the February 2013 meeting of experts on forced labour\r\nand trafficking for labour exploitation convened by the ILO Governing Body \u201cto\r\nidentify gaps in existing coverage of ILO standards with a view to determining\r\nwhether there is a need for standard setting to: (i) complement the ILO\u2019s\r\nforced labour Conventions to address prevention and victim protection,\r\nincluding compensation; and (ii) address human trafficking for labour\r\nexploitation\u201d[2].\r\nThe process forms part of the ILO framework for action for the effective and\r\nuniversal respect, promotion and realization of fundamental principles and\r\nrights at work 2012-2016[3].\nThe form of the instrument(s) submitted -\r\nProtocol and/or Recommendation \u2013 is to be decided by the Conference itself, on\r\nthe basis of the proposals made by the International labour Office in the March\r\n2014 report to the Conference, following the consultation of the ILO\u2019s\r\ntripartite constituents in late 2013[4].\r\nSome constituents favour a Recommendation accompanying a Protocol, others a\r\nRecommendation only and the outcome of the Conference\u2019s decision to this regard\r\nis uncertain[5].\r\nA Recommendation will supplement the Convention and possibly the Protocol by\r\nproviding more detailed guidelines on how the basic principles of the\r\nConvention and possibly the Protocol are to be applied. This proposal focuses\r\non the content of such Recommendation in either case, on the basis of the\r\nreport submitted to the Conference.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Content of the proposed\r\nRecommendation \nThe aim of the standard(s) under consideration\r\nis \u201cto address implementation gaps to advance prevention, protection and\r\ncompensation measures, to effectively achieve the elimination of forced\r\nlabour\u201d.\nThe proposal for a Recommendation, which forms\r\nthe report IV (2B) submitted to the 103rd session of the ILC[6], addresses the\r\nfollowing aspects: \n\u00b7              \r\nNational policies: including plans of action,\r\ncoordination and monitoring bodies, data collection;\n\u00b7              \r\nPrevention: strategies to address root causes of\r\nforced labour, including empowering specific at-risk population groups,\r\ncoverage and enforcement of labour law, awareness raising, training programmes\r\nand pre-departure orientation for migrants, use of languages/translation,\r\ncoherent migration policies and international cooperation on migration, social\r\nprotection floors, reduction of trade in and demand for goods and services\r\ntainted by forced labour;\n\u00b7              \r\nProtection of victims on the basis of their\r\ninformed consent and not conditional to their willingness to cooperate in criminal\r\nproceedings: providing immediate assistance and long-term recovery and\r\nrehabilitation for all victims, healthcare, housing, material, social and\r\neconomic assistance, education and training, protection from intimidation and\r\nretaliation and from punishment for crimes they have been compelled to commit,\r\nspecific protection for children with presumption of minor status and migrant\r\nworkers with reflection and recovery period, temporary or permanent residence\r\npermit as appropriate as well as safe and preferably voluntary repatriation;\r\nmeasures against fraudulent placement services;\n\u00b7              \r\nCompensation and access to justice: access to\r\nappropriate remedies for all victims, right to obtain compensation and damages,\r\ninformation and advice, possible representation of victims, access to legal\r\nremedies irrespective of victims' nationality and legal status in the\r\nterritory, victims compensation funds; \n\u00b7              \r\nEnforcement: labour inspection, confiscation of\r\nprofits of forced labour, liability of legal persons, punishment of perpetrators,\r\nindicators for identification of victims;\n\u00b7              \r\nInternational cooperation: technical\r\ncooperation, mutual legal assistance, sharing of information and good practice.\nThe proposal for a Recommendation will be the\r\nbasis of the negotiations for the Recommendation to be adopted at the 103rd\r\nsession of the International Labour Conference.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Division of competences in\r\nthe field of the Convention and the proposed Recommendation\nThe proposed provisions of the Recommendation\r\nare in part covered by competences conferred upon the Union by the Treaties. In\r\naddition, many of them address areas of Union law in which the degree of\r\nregulation on the level of the EU has already reached an advanced stage. \nThe Recommendation deals with aspects relating\r\nto anti-trafficking and protection of victims, which are aspects related primarily\r\nto the judicial cooperation in criminal matters area[7] where rules are set by\r\nDirective 2011/36/EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings\r\nand protecting its victims (\u201canti-trafficking\u201d) and Directive 2012/29/EU\r\nestablishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims\r\nof crime (\u201cvictims\u2019 rights\u201d). These aspects are also dealt with by the UN\r\nProtocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially\r\nWomen and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against\r\nTransnational Organized Crime, 2000, (\u201cUN Trafficking Protocol\u201d), to which the\r\nEU is a party.\nThe Recommendation is to deal with aspects\r\nrelated to the social policy area[8],\r\nwhere requirements are notably set by Directive 91/533/EEC on an employer\u2019s\r\nobligation to inform employees on the conditions applicable to the contract or\r\nemployment relationship (\u201cwritten statement\u201d) and Directive 2008/104/EC on\r\ntemporary agency work, as well as by Directives on health and safety at work,\r\nworking time, protection of young people at work or maternity protection[9]..\nThe Recommendation is to deal with aspects\r\nrelated to the asylum and immigration area[10]\r\nwhere requirements are notably set by Directive 2004/81/EC in the residence\r\npermit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in\r\nhuman beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal\r\nimmigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities, Directive 2009/52/EC\r\non sanctions against employers who knowingly employ illegally staying third\r\ncountry workers (\u201cemployers' sanctions\u201d) providing for sanctions, including\r\ncriminal ones, against employers exploiting irregular migrants and containing\r\ncompensation measures for victims of such exploitation. \nThe Recommendation may, for the protection of\r\nmigrant workers, have an impact on the freedom of movement for workers secured\r\nunder Article 45 TFEU and Regulation 492/2011 on freedom of movement for\r\nworkers within the Union. The Recommendation is further to affect EU international\r\nagreements, development cooperation and trade instruments making reference to\r\nthe core labour standards and the ratification and effective implementation of fundamental\r\nILO Conventions by third countries, enlargement countries and in the EU.\nAt the same time, the Recommendation will also\r\ndeal with matters which fall outside competences conferred upon the EU by the\r\nTreaties. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot applicable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe 103rd session of the\r\nInternational Labour Conference is to be entrusted to consider and adopt the\r\nsaid proposal for a Recommendation to supplement the ILO Forced Labour\r\nConvention, n\u00b029, 1930.\nA Recommendation has as such no binding\r\nforce and is not subject to ratification by ILO members. However, a\r\nRecommendation is used by ILO standard supervisory bodies to assess the\r\napplication of the related labour standards and provides guidance as to national\r\npolicy, legislation and practice. In accordance with Article 19(6)(b) and (c)\r\nof the ILO Constitution, the adoption of a Recommendation implies certain\r\nobligations for the parties. In this respect, each Party has to launch\r\nlegislative or administrative procedures within a fixed period of time to\r\nconsider its implementation in its domestic legal order, must inform the ILO of\r\nthe measures taken to bring its legal order in line with the Recommendation\r\nand, where it decides not to apply the Recommendation, must report to the ILO\r\nin appropriate intervals the current state of domestic law and practice as\r\nregards the matters dealt with by the Recommendation.\nIt follows that the envisaged\r\nRecommendation will constitute an act of a body set up by an international\r\nagreement which will produce legal effects in the sense of Article 218(9) TFEU.\nOnly States are members of the ILO, can\r\npropose amendments and vote on the adoption of the Recommendation at the\r\nInternational Labour Conference. The Union is invited to the Conference with an\r\nobserver status.\nHowever, given that the Recommendation will\r\nrelate to issues covered both by competences conferred upon the Union by the\r\nTreaties and sole national competences, the Union and Member States must act\r\ntogether in the spirit of sincere cooperation, as provided for in Article 4(3)\r\nTEU. To that effect, when acting in the ILO, Member States should also act\r\njointly in the interest of the Union.\nAt this stage, it appears that the proposed\r\nRecommendation is in accordance with the orientations of Union law and policies\r\nin this area. There is no contradiction between the general principles pursued\r\nby the proposed Recommendation and Union law and policies, and there is prima facie no incompatibility between the\r\nproposed Recommendation and the Union acquis.\nHowever, amendements to the proposed text\r\nduring the Conference should only be proposed or accepted if they are\r\ncompatible with existing Union legislation. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRACTICALITIES\nMember States should act within the bodies\r\nof the ILO jointly in the interest of the Union in a coordinated manner. Given\r\nthe legal framework of the ILO, only Member States can propose amendments and\r\ncast votes throughout the negotiation process. Therefore, Member States acting\r\nboth on national competences and jointly in the interest of the Union, and the Commission should act together in the spirit of sincere cooperation. To that\r\naim, Member States and the Commission should assist each other in carrying out\r\nthe tasks to ensure the best possible defence of the interests of the Union and\r\nits Member States and should be supported, in the exercise of their tasks, by\r\nthe best available experts of both Member States and the Commission.\nBecause of the interplay between the\r\nProtocol and the Recommendation subject the discussions and negotiations at the\r\nconference in the same Committee, the detailed position of the Union should be taken after considering the negotiating position established for the\r\nProtocol. \n2014/0131 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted on behalf of\r\nthe European Union at the 103rd session of the International Labour Conference\r\nconcerning a Recommendation to supplement the Forced Labour Convention n\u00b0 29,\r\n1930, of the International Labour Organisation\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union and, in particular, Articles 82(2), 83(1),\r\n153 and 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)                   \r\nThe Forced Labour Convention n\u00b029, 1930, of the\r\nInternational Labour Organisation (ILO), hereinafter \u2018the Convention\u2019, requires\r\nits Parties to suppress the use of forced labour within the shortest possible\r\nperiod, and to criminalize the offence. \n(2)                   \r\nProposals for a Recommendation to supplement the\r\nConvention, hereinafter \u201cthe draft Recommendation\u201d, are on the agenda of the\r\n103rd session of the International Labour Conference on 28 May - 12\r\nJune 2014, hereinafter \u201cthe Conference\u201d, for consideration and adoption.\n(3)                   \r\nThe aim of the draft Recommendation is to\r\naddress implementation gaps to advance prevention of trafficking for labour\r\nexploitation as well as protection and compensation of victims of forced\r\nlabour.\n(4)                   \r\nThe rules under the Convention and the\r\nprovisions under the draft Recommendation are covered in part by competences\r\nconferred upon the Union by the Treaties. In addition, the draft Recommendation\r\nwill interplay with existing acquis in the areas of social policy[11], asylum and\r\nimmigration[12],\r\nfreedom of movement for workers[13]\r\nand fundamental rights[14].\r\nIn particular, most of the provisions of the draft Recommendation have been the\r\nsubject of Directive 2011/36/EU on preventing and combating trafficking in\r\nhuman beings and protecting its victims (\u201canti-trafficking\u201d), where\r\nappropriate, and Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the\r\nrights, support and protection of victims of crime (\u201cvictims\u2019 rights\u201d). These\r\naspects are also dealt with by the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish\r\nTrafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United\r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 2000, (\u201cUN\r\nTrafficking Protocol\u201d), to which the EU is a party. The draft Recommendation is\r\nfurther to interplay with international agreements, development cooperation and\r\ntrade instruments making reference to core labour standards and the\r\nratification and effective implementation of fundamental ILO Conventions by\r\nthird countries, candidate countries and in the EU.\n(5)                   \r\nIn accordance with Article 19(6)(b) and (c) of\r\nthe ILO Constitution, the adoption of a Recommendation implies certain\r\nobligations for the parties. A Recommendation further provides guidance as to\r\nnational policy, legislation and practice and is used by ILO standard\r\nsupervisory bodies to assess the application of the related labour standards.\r\nIt follows that the draft Recommendation will constitute an act of a body set\r\nup by an international agreement which will produce legal effects.\n(6)                   \r\nGiven the above, in accordance with Article\r\n218(9) TFEU, it is necessary that the Council adopts a decision to establish\r\nthe position to be adopted on the Union's behalf as regards matters falling\r\nwithin the Union's competence.
