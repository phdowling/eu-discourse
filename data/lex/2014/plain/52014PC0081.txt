The Protocol on Cultural\r\nCooperation (hereafter: the Protocol), concluded by the Parties within the\r\nframework of the FTA, established a framework within which the Parties shall\r\ncooperate to facilitate exchanges in cultural activities, goods and services,\r\nincluding in the audio-visual sector, and to improve the conditions governing\r\nsuch exchanges. \nBy derogation from the institutional provisions\r\nof the FTA, the Trade Committee shall have no jurisdiction over the Protocol. Instead\r\nthe Committee on Cultural Cooperation, established within the framework of the\r\nProtocol and comprising senior officials from within the administration of each\r\nParty, shall exercise all functions of the Trade Committee as regards the\r\nProtocol, where such functions are relevant for the purposes of implementing\r\nthe Protocol. The Committee on Cultural Cooperation met for the first time on 5\r\nDecember 2013 in Brussels and the Parties on that occasion shared information\r\non their respective legal bases and cultural activities. \nWith the Protocol, the Parties, in conformity\r\nwith their respective legislation, agreed inter alia to grant an\r\nentitlement for audio-visual co-productions between producers from the EU party\r\nand Korea to benefit from their respective schemes for the promotion of\r\nlocal/regional cultural content according to certain specific conditions. Such\r\nco-productions can be considered European works within the EU and Korean works\r\nwithin Korea, as long as they respect the conditions stipulated in Article 5 of\r\nthe Protocol (see points 8(a) to (c) in particular). This entitlement was\r\nestablished for a period of three years (from 1 July 2011 until 30 June 2014)\r\nand it is now proposed that this entitlement be renewed for another three\r\nyears.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Protocol foresaw that each Party establish\r\na Domestic Advisory Group (DAG), comprised of cultural and audio-visual\r\nrepresentatives active in the fields covered by this Protocol. The EU DAG met\r\non 25 September 2013 in Brussels in order to evaluate the results of the\r\nimplementation of the entitlement in terms of enhancement of cultural diversity\r\nand mutually beneficial cooperation on co-produced works. \nThe DAG noted the lack of EU-Korea audio-visual\r\nco-productions under the conditions mentioned in the Protocol, agreed that the\r\nProtocol has nonetheless the potential of being a useful tool, and recommended\r\nthat the entitlement for EU-Korean co-productions be extended for three more\r\nyears. The DAG also concluded that there is a need to promote the Protocol at\r\nindustry, state and EU level if the entitlement is to be properly exploited.\u00a0 \nThe entitlement to audio-visual co-productions\r\nwas discussed with the EU Member States at a meeting of the Cultural Affairs\r\nCommittee of the Council of the European Union on 31 October 2013. It is following\r\nthe consultation of the Member States and in light of the opinion of the DAG\r\nthat the Commission is now proposing that the entitlement be extended for\r\nanother three-year period. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe procedure for renewing the entitlement is\r\nprovided for in Article 5 of the Protocol. The required steps have been taken,\r\nas detailed above.\nArticle 5(8) of the Protocol stipulates that if\r\nit is decided that the entitlement should be renewed, it can be extended for\r\nanother three year period and, thereafter, it will be automatically renewed for\r\nfurther successive periods of the same duration unless a Party terminates the\r\nentitlement by giving notice in writing of at least three months before the\r\nexpiry of the period. Co-productions which predate any such termination can\r\nstill benefit from the respective schemes for the promotion of local/regional\r\ncultural content. \nAccording to article 4.1 of Council Decision\r\n2011/265/EU a Council Decision is required for this proposed renewal of the\r\nentitlement to be enacted.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION N/A\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS N/A\n2014/0041 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nOn the position to be taken on behalf of\r\nthe European Union\r\nas regards the extension of the entitlement to co-productions as provided for\r\nin Article 5 of the Protocol on Cultural Cooperation to the Free Trade\r\nAgreement\r\nbetween the European Union and its Member States, of the one part,\r\nand the Republic of Korea, of the other part\r\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union, and in particular Article 167(3) in conjunction\r\nwith Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 23 April 2007 the\r\nCouncil authorised the Commission to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement with the Republic of Korea on behalf of the European Union and its Member States.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those negotiations were\r\nconcluded and the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Korea, of the other part[2] (\"the\r\nAgreement\") was signed on 6 October 2010.
