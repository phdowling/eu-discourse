It was intended that Regulation\r\n(EU) No 374/2014 would cease to apply on 1 November 2014\r\nat the latest. \nIn the Joint Ministerial\r\nStatement on the Implementation of the EU-Ukraine AA/DCFTA of 12 September 2014 following the tri-lateral consultations between\r\nthe European Union, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, the EU side agreed to propose\r\nas part of a comprehensive peace process in Ukraine, to EU Member States to delay\r\nuntil 31 December 2015 the provisional application of the DCFTA while continuing\r\nautonomous trade measures of the EU to the benefit of Ukraine during this\r\nperiod. Consequently, in order to\r\nsupport the political and economic stability of Ukraine, the European Commission\r\nwould propose the extension of the application of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs\r\nduties on goods originating in Ukraine until 31 December 2015. \nArticle 2 of the Association Agreement with\r\nUkraine provides that the respect for democratic principles, human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms and respect for the principle of the rule of law, promotion\r\nof respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity,\r\ninviolability of borders and independence, as well as countering the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, related materials and their means\r\nof delivery constitute essential elements of that Agreement. The autonomous preferences provided for under Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 are subject to the respect of these same principles by Ukraine. Volumes/duties\r\ngranted by the EU under the ATMs regulation in 2014 shall continue to apply for\r\n2015.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nNot applicable. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the proposal is\r\nArticle 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe European Union will see a loss of\r\ncustoms revenue corresponding to EUR 487 million (gross) annually. However,\r\nthose figures are estimates, having regard to the political and economic\r\nsituation of Ukraine and can change.\n2014/0279 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on\r\nthe reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ukraine is a priority partner country within the\r\nEuropean Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership. The European\r\nUnion has been seeking an increasingly close relationship with Ukraine in view of Ukraine's political association and economic integration with the European Union.\r\nIn this respect, the European Union and Ukraine negotiated\r\nin 2007-2011 an Association Agreement, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free\r\nTrade Area (DCFTA), which was signed by both parties on 27 June 2014. Under the\r\nprovisions of the DCFTA, the European Union and Ukraine are to establish a free\r\ntrade area over a transitional period of a maximum of 10 years starting from\r\nthe entry into force of the Association Agreement, in accordance with Article\r\nXXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the unprecedented security, political and economic challenges\r\nfaced by Ukraine, and in order to support its economy, it was\r\ndecided to anticipate the implementation of the Schedule\r\nof concessions set out in Annex I-A to the Association Agreement between the EU\r\nand Ukraine by means of the autonomous trade preferences\r\nprovided for under Regulation (EU) No 374/2014. In view\r\nof the challenges Ukraine still faces, the application of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 374/2014 shall be extended until 31 December 2015. For the purpose of\r\npredictability, the customs duties and access to tariff quotas should following\r\nthe extension remain the same as for 2014.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 2 of the\r\nAssociation Agreement with Ukraine provides that the respect for democratic\r\nprinciples, human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the principle\r\nof the rule of law, promotion of respect for the principles of sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity, inviolability of borders and independence, as well as\r\ncountering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, related materials\r\nand their means of delivery constitute essential elements of that Agreement. The autonomous preferences provided for\r\nunder Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 shall also be subject to the respect of these\r\nsame principles by Ukraine. In order to align Regulation\r\n(EU) No 374/2014 with Union practice and other EU trade policy instruments, it\r\nis appropriate to introduce the possibility to temporarily suspend the preferences in case of failure to respect the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law by Ukraine. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the urgency of\r\nthe matter, it is important to apply an exception to the eight-week period\r\nreferred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments\r\nin the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EU) No 374/2014 is amended as\r\nfollows: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 1 is replaced by\r\nthe following:\n\"Article 1\nPreferential\r\narrangements\nCustoms duties on goods originating in Ukraine shall be reduced or eliminated in accordance with Annex I. Where reference in that\r\nAnnex is made to staging categories, the basic rate of duties for 2014 and 2015\r\nshall be eliminated in case of staging category 0 and shall be reduced by\r\n25 % in case of staging category 3, by 16,7 % in case of staging category 5 and\r\nby 12,5 % for staging category 7.\";\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 2, the\r\nfollowing point (e) is added:\n\"(e) the respect for democratic\r\nprinciples, human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the principle\r\nof rule of law provided for in Article 2 of the Association Agreement with\r\nUkraine.\";\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 7, the second paragraph is replaced\r\nby the following: \n\"It shall apply\r\nuntil 31 December 2015. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annexes II and III are replaced by the text set out in Annexes I and II\r\nrespectively to this Regulation.\nArticle 2\nThis
