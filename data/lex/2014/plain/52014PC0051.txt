The Commission, by Decision 2000/745/EC, as amended by Decision 2005/697/EC and Commission Decision 2013/223/EU, accepted three price undertakings from Indian companies. \n 141 || \u00b7           Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. \n 2) Consultation of interested parties and impact assessment \n   || \u00b7           Consultation of interested parties \n 219 || Interested parties concerned by the proceeding have had the opportunity to comment, in line with Article 13 (9) of the basic Regulation. \n   || \u00b7           Collection and use of expertise \n 229 || There was no need for external expertise. \n 230 || \u00b7           Impact assessment This proposal is the result of the implementation of the basic Regulation. The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed.   \n 3) Legal elements of the proposal \n 305 || \u00b7           Summary of the proposed action The Commission decided to withdraw three price undertakings due to the change in circumstances during their implementation. For one exporter the withdrawal is also due to repetitive breach of the undertaking reporting obligations. Hence, the underlying Council Regulation imposing the definitive countervailing duty should be amended accordingly. Therefore, it is proposed that the Council adopts the attached proposal for Regulation which should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. \n 310 || \u00b7           Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community. \n 329 || \u00b7           Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n   || \u00b7           Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n 331 || The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n 332 || Indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n   || \u00b7           Choice of instruments \n 341 || Proposed instruments: regulation. \n 342 || Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The above-mentioned basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n 4) Budgetary implication \n 409 || The proposal has no implication for the Union budget. \n2014/0026 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU) No 461/2013\nimposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET) originating in India following an expiry review pursuant to\nArticle 18 of Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 \nTHE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised\nimports from countries not members of the European Community[6] ('the basic\nRegulation'), and in particular Article 13 thereof,\nHaving\nregard to the proposal submitted by the European Commission after having\nconsulted the Advisory Committee,\nWhereas:\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PREVIOUS\nPROCEDURE\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The countervailing measures on imports of polyethylene\nterephthalate (\u2018PET\u2019) originating in India have been in force since 2000[7]. These measures have\nbeen last maintained by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 461/2013[8], following an expiry\nreview.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anti-dumping measures on\nimports of PET originating in India have been in force since 2000[9]. These measures have\nbeen last maintained by Council Regulation (EC) No 192/2007[10], following an expiry\nreview. On 24 February 2012, the Commission initiated a subsequent expiry\nreview. By\nImplementing Decision 2013/226/EU[11],\nthe Council rejected the Commission\u2019s proposal for a Council implementing\nregulation maintaining the anti-dumping duty on imports of PET originating in, inter\nalia, India and, thus, the anti-dumping measures expired. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2000,\u00a0 by Decision\n2000/745/EC[12], the Commission accepted\u00a0 price undertakings ('the undertakings'),\noffered in connection with both the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy proceedings\nfrom inter alia the Indian companies: Pearl Engineering Polymers Limited\n(\u2018Pearl\u2019) and Reliance Industries Limited (\u2018Reliance\u2019). In 2005, by Decision\n2005/697/EC[13] amending Decision 2000/745/EC, the Commission accepted an\nundertaking from the Indian company South Asean Petrochem Limited which as a\nresult of a merger changed its name to Dhunseri Petrochem & Tea Limited\n(\u2018Dhunseri\u2019)[14].\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 WITHDRAWAL OF UNDERTAKINGS AND AMENDMENT\nOF REGULATION No (EU) 461/2013\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Decision XX[15], the Commission withdrew the acceptance of the undertakings offered by three Indian companies Dhunseri, Reliance\nand Pearl. Therefore, Article 1(4) and Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 461/2013 together\nwith the Annex to the Regulation should be repealed accordingly. Accordingly,\nthe definitive countervailing duties imposed by Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU)\nNo 461/2013 should apply to imports of PET produced by the companies Dhunseri,\nReliance and Pearl (TARIC additional code A585 for Dhunseri, TARIC additional\ncode A181 for Reliance and TARIC additional code A182 for Pearl).\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.
