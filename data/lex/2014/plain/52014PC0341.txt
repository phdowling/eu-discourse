Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the\r\nCommission decided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more\r\nthan ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that\r\ndepartments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for\r\nwhich they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and\r\nreadily understandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law\r\napplicable to a given matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament,\r\nthe Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for\r\nthe fast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 3286/94 of 22 December 1994 laying down Community procedures in the field of the common\r\ncommercial policy in order to ensure the exercise of the Community's rights\r\nunder international trade rules, in particular those established under the\r\nauspices of the World Trade Organization[3].\r\nThe new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by\r\nthe codification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was drawn up on the\r\nbasis of a preliminary consolidation, in 22 official languages, of Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 and the instruments amending it,\r\ncarried out by the Publications Office of the European Union, by means of a\r\ndata-processing system. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the\r\ncorrelation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in\r\nAnnex II to the codified Regulation.\n\u00ea 3286/94\r\n(adapted)\n2014/0174 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nlaying down \u00d6 Union \u00d5 procedures in\r\nthe field of the common commercial policy in order to ensure the exercise of\r\nthe \u00d6 Union\u2019s \u00d5 rights under\r\ninternational trade rules, in particular those established under the auspices\r\nof the World Trade Organization (codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00ea \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 3286/94[6] has been substantially amended several times[7].

Member States shall supply the\r\nCommission, upon request, with all information necessary for the examination,\r\nin accordance with the detailed arrangements laid down by the Commission.\n4. The complainants and the exporters\r\nand importers concerned \u00d6 and \u00d5 the representatives of the country or countries concerned may:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 inspect all information made\r\navailable to the Commission except for internal documents for the use of the\r\nCommission and the administrations, provided that such information is relevant\r\nto the protection of their interests and not confidential within the meaning of\r\nArticle 10 and that it is\r\nused by the Commission in its examination procedure; the persons concerned\r\nshall address a reasoned request in writing to the Commission, indicating the\r\ninformation required;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  ask to\r\nbe informed of the principal facts and considerations resulting from the\r\nexamination procedure.\n5. The Commission may hear the parties\r\nconcerned. It shall hear them if they have, within the period prescribed in the\r\nnotice published in the Official Journal of the European \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , made a written request for a hearing showing that they are a party\r\nprimarily concerned by the result of the procedure.\n6. The Commission shall, on request, give the parties primarily\r\nconcerned an opportunity to meet, so that opposing views may be presented and\r\nany rebuttal argument put forward. In providing this opportunity the Commission shall take account of the wishes of the\r\nparties and of the need to preserve confidentiality. There shall be no\r\nobligation on any party to attend a meeting and failure to do so shall not be\r\nprejudicial to that party's case.\n7. \u00d6 Where \u00d5 the information requested by the Commission is not supplied within a\r\nreasonable time or where the investigation is significantly impeded, findings\r\nmay be made on the basis of the facts available.\n8. When it has concluded its examination\r\nthe Commission shall report to the Committee. The report \u00d6 shall \u00d5 be presented\r\nwithin five months of the announcement of initiation of the procedure, unless\r\nthe complexity of the examination is such that the Commission extends the\r\nperiod to seven months.\nArticle 10\nConfidentiality\n1. Information received pursuant to this\r\nRegulation shall be used only for the purpose for which it was requested.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .4(5)\n2. The Commission and the Member States, including\r\nthe officials of either, shall not reveal any information of a confidential\r\nnature received pursuant to this Regulation, or any information provided on a\r\nconfidential basis by a party to an examination procedure, without specific\r\npermission from the party submitting such information.\n\u00ea 3286/94\r\n(adapted)\n\u00a0Each request for confidential treatment shall indicate why the\r\ninformation is confidential and shall be accompanied by a non-confidential\r\nsummary of the information or a statement of the reasons why the information is\r\nnot susceptible of such summary.\n3. Information \u00d6 shall \u00d5 be considered\r\nto be confidential if its disclosure is likely to have a significantly adverse\r\neffect upon the supplier or the source of such information.\n4. \u00d6 Where \u00d5 it appears that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and\r\nif the supplier is unwilling either to make the information public or to\r\nauthorise its disclosure in generalised or summary form, the information in\r\nquestion may be disregarded.\n5. This Article shall not preclude the\r\ndisclosure of general information by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 authorities and in particular of the reasons on which decisions\r\ntaken pursuant to this Regulation are based. Such disclosure \u00d6 shall \u00d5 take into account the legitimate interest of the parties concerned\r\nthat their business secrets \u00d6 shall \u00d5 not be divulged.\nArticle 11\nEvidence\n1. An examination of injury shall involve,\r\nwhere applicable, the following factors:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the volume of \u00d6 Union \u00d5 imports or\r\nexports concerned, notably where there has been a significant increase or\r\ndecrease, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption on\r\nthe market in question;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the prices of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry's\r\ncompetitors, in particular in order to determine whether there has been, either\r\nin the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or on third country markets, significant undercutting of the prices\r\nof the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the consequent impact on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 industry and\r\nas indicated by trends in certain economic factors such as: production,\r\ncapacity \u00d6 utilisation \u00d5, stocks,\r\nsales, market share, prices (that is depression of prices or prevention of price increases which would\r\nnormally have occurred),\r\nprofits, return on capital, investment, employment.\n2. Where a threat of injury is alleged, the\r\nCommission shall also examine whether it is clearly foreseeable that a\r\nparticular situation is likely to develop into actual injury. In this regard,\r\naccount may also be taken of factors such as:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the rate of increase of exports\r\nto the market where the competition with \u00d6 Union \u00d5 products is\r\ntaking place;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 export capacity in the country of\r\norigin or export, which is already in existence or will be operational in the\r\nforeseeable future, and the likelihood that the exports resulting from that\r\ncapacity will be to the market referred to in point (a).\n3. Injury caused by other factors which,\r\neither individually or in combination, are also adversely affecting \u00d6 the Union \u00d5 industry must not be attributed to the practices under\r\nconsideration.\n4. Where adverse trade effects are alleged,\r\nthe Commission shall examine the impact of such adverse effects on the economy\r\nof the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or of a region of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 , or on a\r\nsector of economic activity therein. To this effect, the Commission may take\r\ninto account, where relevant, factors of the type listed in paragraphs 1 and 2. Adverse trade effects may arise, inter alia, in situations\r\nin which trade flows concerning a product or service are prevented, impeded or\r\ndiverted as a result of any obstacle to trade, or from situations in which\r\nobstacles to trade have materially affected the supply or inputs \u00d6 , for example \u00d5 parts and components or raw materials, to \u00d6 Union \u00d5 enterprises.\r\nWhere a threat of adverse trade effects is alleged, the Commission shall also\r\nexamine whether it is clearly foreseeable that a particular situation is likely\r\nto develop into actual adverse trade effects.\n5. The Commission shall also, in examining\r\nevidence of adverse trade effects, have regard to the provisions, principles or\r\npractice which govern the right of action under relevant international rules\r\nreferred to in Article 2(1)(a).\n6. The Commission shall further examine any\r\nother relevant evidence contained in the complaint or in the \u00d6 request \u00d5 . In this respect, the list of factors and the indications given in paragraphs 1 to 5 are not exhaustive, nor can one or several of such factors and indications necessarily\r\ngive decisive guidance as to the existence of injury or of adverse trade\r\neffects.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .4(6) (adapted)\nArticle 12\nTermination\r\nand suspension of the procedure\n1. When it is found, as a result of the\r\nexamination procedure conducted pursuant to Article 9, that the interests\r\nof the Union do not require any action to be taken, the procedure shall be\r\nterminated by the Commission acting in accordance with the examination\r\nprocedure referred to in Article 7(3).\n2. When, after an examination procedure\r\nconducted pursuant to Article 9, the third country or countries concerned take(s) measures which\r\nare considered satisfactory, and therefore no action by the Union is required,\r\nthe procedure may be suspended by the Commission acting in accordance with the\r\nadvisory procedure referred to in Article 7(2).\nThe Commission shall supervise the\r\napplication of \u00d6 those \u00d5 measures, where appropriate on the basis of information supplied at\r\nintervals, which it may request from the third countries concerned and check as\r\nnecessary.\nWhere the measures taken by the third\r\ncountry or countries concerned have been rescinded, suspended or improperly\r\nimplemented or where the Commission has grounds for believing this to be the\r\ncase or, where information \u00d6 requested \u00d5 by the Commission \u00d6 pursuant\r\nto \u00d5 the second subparagraph has not been \u00d6 provided \u00d5 , the Commission shall inform the Member States, and where necessary\r\nand, justified by the results of the investigation and the new facts available,\r\nany measures shall be taken in accordance with Article 14(2).\n3. Where, either after an examination\r\nprocedure conducted pursuant to Article 9, or at any time before, during or after an international dispute\r\nsettlement procedure, it appears that the most appropriate means of resolving a\r\ndispute arising from an obstacle to trade is the conclusion of an agreement\r\nwith the third country or countries concerned which may change the substantive\r\nrights of the Union and of the third country or countries concerned, the\r\nprocedure shall be suspended by the Commission acting in accordance with the\r\nadvisory procedure referred to in Article 7(2), and negotiations shall be carried out in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of Article 207\r\nof the Treaty.\n\u00ea 3286/94\r\n(adapted)\nArticle 13\nAdoption\r\nof commercial policy measures\n1. Where it is found, as a result of the\r\nexamination procedure, unless the factual and legal situation is such that an\r\nexamination procedure may not be required, that action is necessary in the interests of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 in order to\r\nensure the exercise of the \u00d6 Union\u2019s \u00d5 rights under international trade rules, with a view to removing the\r\ninjury or the adverse trade effects resulting from obstacles to trade adopted\r\nor maintained by third countries, the appropriate measures shall be determined\r\nin accordance with the procedure \u00d6 laid\r\ndown \u00d5 in Article 14.\n2. Where the \u00d6 Union\u2019s \u00d5 international\r\nobligations require the prior discharge of an international procedure for\r\nconsultation or for the settlement of disputes, the measures referred to in\r\nparagraph 3 shall only be decided on after that procedure has been\r\nterminated, and taking account of the results of the procedure. In particular,\r\nwhere the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 has requested an international dispute settlement body to indicate\r\nand authorise the measures which are appropriate for the implementation of the\r\nresults of an international dispute settlement procedure, the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 commercial policy measures which may be needed in consequence of\r\nsuch authorisation shall be in accordance with the recommendation of such\r\ninternational dispute settlement body.\n3. Any commercial policy measures may be\r\ntaken which are compatible with existing international obligations and\r\nprocedures, notably:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 suspension or withdrawal of any\r\nconcession resulting from commercial policy negotiations;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the raising of existing customs\r\nduties or the introduction of any other charge on imports;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the introduction of quantitative\r\nrestrictions or any other measures modifying import or export conditions or\r\notherwise affecting trade with the third country concerned.\n4. The corresponding decisions shall state\r\nthe reasons on which they are based and shall be published in the Official\r\nJournal of the European \u00d6 Union \u00d5 . Publication\r\nshall also be deemed to constitute notification to the countries and parties\r\nprimarily concerned.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .4(7) (adapted)\nArticle 14\nDecision-making\r\nprocedures\n1.
