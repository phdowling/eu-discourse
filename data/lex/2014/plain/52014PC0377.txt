Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the Commission\r\ndecided[1] to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after\r\nno more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum\r\nrequirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter\r\nintervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that their\r\nprovisions are clear and readily understandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the importance of codification as it offers\r\ncertainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament,\r\nthe Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the\r\nfast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 107 and 108 of the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of\r\nhorizontal State aid[3]. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in\r\nit[4]; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being\r\ncodified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such\r\nformal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was\r\ndrawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in 22 official\r\nlanguages, of Regulation (EC) No 994/98 and the instrument amending it, carried out by the Publications\r\nOffice of the European Union, by means of a data\u2011processing system.\r\nWhere the articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old\r\nand the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex II to the\r\ncodified Regulation.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nArt. 1.1\n2014/0192 (COD)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non the application of Articles 107 and 108\r\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of\r\nhorizontal state aid (codification)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\u00ea 994/98\r\n(adapted)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 109 \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[5],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[6],\nWhereas:\n\u00ea \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n994/98[7]\r\nhas been substantially amended[8].\r\nIn the interests of clarity and rationality that Regulation should be codified.\r\n\n\u00ea 994/98\r\nrecital 2 (adapted)\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) \u00d5 , the\r\nassessment of compatibility of aid with the \u00d6 internal \u00d5 market\r\nessentially rests with the Commission. \n\u00ea 994/98\r\nrecital 3\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proper functioning of\r\nthe internal market requires strict and efficient application of the rules of\r\ncompetition with regard to state aid.\n\u00ea 994/98\r\nrecital 4 (adapted)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should be enabled to declare by means of regulations,\r\nin areas where the Commission has sufficient experience to define general compatibility\r\ncriteria, that certain \u00d6 specified \u00d5 categories of aid are compatible with the \u00d6 internal \u00d5 market pursuant to one or more of the provisions of Article \u00d6 107 \u00d5 (2) and (3) \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 and are\r\nexempted from the procedure provided for in Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 (3) thereof.\n\u00ea 994/98 recital 5 (adapted)\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00d6 Block \u00d5 exemption regulations\r\n\u00d6 ensure \u00d5 transparency\r\nand legal certainty. They can be directly applied by national courts, without\r\nprejudice to Article \u00d6 4(3) of\r\nthe Treaty on European Union (TEU) \u00d5 and \u00d6 to\r\nArticle 267 \u00d5 \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 .\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 2 (adapted)\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 State\r\naid is an objective notion defined in Article 107(1) TFEU. The power of the\r\nCommission to adopt block exemptions as provided for in \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation\r\nonly applies to measures that fulfil all the criteria of Article 107(1) TFEU\r\nand therefore constitute state aid. Inclusion of a certain category of aid in \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation or\r\nin an exemption regulation does not predetermine the qualification of a measure\r\nas state aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 3 (adapted)\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The Commission \u00d6 should be enabled \u00d5 to declare\r\nthat, under certain conditions, aid to small and medium-sized enterprises; aid in favour of research, development \u00d6 and innovation \u00d5 ; aid in favour of environmental protection; aid in favour of employment and training; and aid that complies with the map approved by the Commission for\r\neach Member State for the grant of regional aid is compatible with the internal\r\nmarket and not subject to the notification requirement.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 4 (adapted)\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Innovation\r\nhas become a Union policy priority in the context of \u2018Innovation Union\u2019, one of\r\nthe Europe 2020 flagship initiatives. Moreover, many aid measures for\r\ninnovation are relatively small and create no significant distortions of\r\ncompetition.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 5 (adapted)\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe culture and heritage conservation sector, a number of measures taken by\r\nMember States might not constitute aid because they do not fulfil all the\r\ncriteria of Article 107(1)TFEU, for example because the beneficiary does not\r\ncarry out an economic activity or because there is no effect on trade between\r\nMember States. However, to the extent measures in the field of culture and\r\nheritage conservation do constitute state aid within the meaning of Article\r\n107(1) TFEU, the Commission \u00d6 should be enabled to declare that, under certain conditions, that \u00d5 aid \u00d6 is compatible with the internal market and not subject to the\r\nnotification requirement \u00d5. Small culture, creation and heritage\r\nconservation projects do not typically give rise to any significant distortion,\r\nand recent cases have shown that such aid has limited effects on trade.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 6 (adapted)\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exemptions\r\nin the culture and heritage conservation sector could be designed on the basis\r\nof the Commission\u2019s experience as set out in guidelines, such as for\r\ncinematographic and audiovisual works, or developed case by case. When drafting\r\nsuch block exemptions, the Commission should take into account that they should\r\nonly cover measures constituting state aid, that they should in principle focus\r\non measures that contribute to the objectives of \u2018EU state aid modernisation\u2019,\r\nand that only aid is block-exempted in respect of which the Commission has\r\nalready substantial experience. Furthermore, the primary competence of the\r\nMember States in the area of culture, the special protection enjoyed by\r\ncultural diversity under Article 167(1) TFEU and the special nature of\r\nculture should be taken into account.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 7 (adapted)\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00d6 As regards \u00d5 state aid\r\nmeasures to make good the damage caused by natural disasters \u00d6 , as well as state aid measures to make good the damage caused by\r\ncertain adverse weather conditions in fisheries, \u00d5 the amounts granted in \u00d6 those areas \u00d5 are usually\r\nlimited, and clear compatibility conditions can be defined. \u00d6 This \u00d5 Regulation \u00d6 should enable \u00d5 the Commission\r\nto exempt such aid from the notification requirement. In the Commission\u2019s\r\nexperience, such aid does not give rise to any significant distortion, and\r\nclear compatibility conditions can be defined on the basis of the experience\r\nacquired.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 9 (adapted)\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with Article 42 TFEU, state aid rules do not apply under certain\r\nconditions to certain aid measures in favour of agriculture products listed in\r\nAnnex I to the TFEU. Article 42 does not apply to forestry or to products not\r\nlisted in \u00d6 that \u00d5 Annex . The\r\nCommission should be able to exempt certain types of aid in favour of forestry,\r\nincluding aid contained in the rural development programmes and also that in\r\nfavour of promoting and advertising food sector products not listed in Annex I \u00d6 to the TFEU \u00d5 , where, according to the Commission\u2019s experience, the distortions of\r\ncompetition are limited and clear compatibility conditions can be defined.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 10\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According\r\nto Article 7 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006[9],\r\nArticles 107, 108 and 109 TFEU apply to aid granted by the Member States to\r\nenterprises in the fisheries sector, except for payments made by Member States\r\npursuant to, and in conformity with, Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006.\r\nAdditional state aid for the conservation of marine and freshwater biological\r\nresources usually has limited effects on trade between Member States, contributes\r\nto the Union\u2019s objectives in the field of maritime and fisheries policy, and\r\ndoes not create serious distortions of competition. The amounts granted are\r\nusually limited and clear compatibility conditions can be defined.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 11 (adapted)\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe sports sector, in particular in the field of amateur sport, a number of\r\nmeasures taken by Member States might not constitute aid because they do not\r\nfulfil all the criteria of Article 107(1) TFEU, for example because the beneficiary\r\ndoes not carry out an economic activity, or because there is no effect on trade\r\nbetween Member States. However, to the extent that measures in the field of\r\nsports do constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, the\r\nCommission \u00d6 should be enabled to declare that, under certain conditions, that aid is compatible with the internal\r\nmarket and not subject to the notification requirement \u00d5 . State aid measures for sport, in particular those in the field of\r\namateur sport or those that are small-scale, often have limited effects on\r\ntrade between Member States and do not create serious distortions of\r\ncompetition. The amounts granted are typically also limited. Clear\r\ncompatibility conditions can be defined on the basis of the experience acquired\r\nso as to ensure that aid to sports does not give rise to any significant\r\ndistortion.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 12\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nrelation to aid concerning air and maritime transport, in the Commission\u2019s\r\nexperience, aid having a social character for the transport of residents of\r\nremote regions such as outermost regions and islands, including single region\r\nisland Member States and sparsely populated areas, does not give rise to any\r\nsignificant distortion, provided that it is granted without discrimination\r\nrelated to the identity of the carrier. Moreover, clear compatibility\r\nconditions can be defined.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 13\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe field of aid to broadband infrastructure, the Commission has in recent years\r\nacquired vast experience and has devised guidelines[10]. In the Commission\u2019s experience, aid for certain types of broadband\r\ninfrastructure does not give rise to any significant distortion and could\r\nbenefit from a block exemption, provided that certain compatibility conditions\r\nare met and that the infrastructure is deployed in \u2018white areas\u2019, being areas\r\nwhere there is no infrastructure of the same category (either broadband or very\r\nhigh-speed next-generation access, \u2018NGA\u2019) and where none is likely to be developed\r\nin the near future, as outlined in the criteria developed in the guidelines.\r\nThis is true of aid covering the provision of basic broadband, as well as of\r\naid for small individual measures covering NGA networks, and of aid to\r\nbroadband-related civil engineering works and passive broadband infrastructure.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 14 (adapted)\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nregards infrastructure, a number of measures taken by Member States might not\r\nconstitute aid because they do not fulfil all the criteria of Article 107(1)\r\nTFEU, for example because the beneficiary does not carry out an economic\r\nactivity, because there is no effect on trade between Member States, or because\r\nthe measure consists of compensation for a service of general economic interest\r\nwhich fulfils all the criteria of the Altmark case-law[11]. However, to the extent that the financing of infrastructure\r\nconstitutes state aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, the Commission\r\n\u00d6 should be enabled to declare that, under certain conditions, that aid is compatible with the internal\r\nmarket and not subject to the notification requirement \u00d5 . With regard to infrastructure, small amounts of aid for\r\ninfrastructure projects can be an efficient way of supporting the Union\u2019s objectives, to the extent \u00d6 that \u00d5 the aid\r\nminimises costs and the potential distortion of competition is limited. The\r\nCommission should therefore be able to exempt state aid for infrastructure\r\nprojects that are in support of the objectives mentioned in this Regulation and\r\nin support of other objectives of common interest, in particular the Europe\r\n2020 objectives[12]. This could include support for projects involving multi-sectoral\r\nnetworks or facilities where relatively small amounts of aid are necessary.\r\nHowever, block exemptions can only be granted for infrastructure projects where\r\nthe Commission has enough experience to define clear and strict compatibility\r\ncriteria, ensuring that the risk of potential distortion of competition is\r\nlimited and that large amounts of aid remain subject to notification pursuant\r\nto Article 108(3) TFEU.\n\u00ea 994/98\r\nrecital 6 (adapted)\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate that the\r\nCommission, when it adopts regulations exempting categories of aid from the\r\nobligation to notify provided for in Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 (3) \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 , specifies\r\nthe purpose of the aid, the categories of beneficiaries and thresholds limiting\r\nthe exempted aid, the conditions governing the cumulation of aid and the\r\nconditions of monitoring, in order to ensure the compatibility with the \u00d6 internal \u00d5 market of aid\r\ncovered by this Regulation.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 16 (adapted)\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Thresholds for each category\r\nof aid in respect of which the Commission adopts a block exemption regulation \u00d6 can \u00d5 be expressed in\r\nterms of aid intensities in relation to a set of eligible costs, or in terms of\r\nmaximum aid amounts. \u00d6 Moreover, the Commission should also be enabled to issue block exemptions for \u00d5 certain types\r\nof measures involving state aid which, because of the specific way in which\r\nthey are designed, cannot be expressed precisely in terms of the aid intensities\r\nor maximum amounts of aid, such as financial engineering instruments or certain\r\nforms of measures aimed to promote risk capital investments. Such complex\r\nmeasures may involve aid at different levels: direct beneficiaries,\r\nintermediate beneficiaries and indirect beneficiaries. Given the increasing\r\nimportance of such measures and their contribution to the Union\u2019s objectives, \u00d6 it \u00d5 should be\r\npossible to exempt them. It should therefore be possible, in the case of such\r\nmeasures, to define the thresholds for a particular award of aid in terms of\r\nthe maximum level of state support in or related to that measure. The maximum\r\nlevel of state support may comprise an element of support, which may not be state\r\naid, provided that the measure includes at least some elements that contain state\r\naid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU and which elements are not\r\nmarginal.\n\u00ea 994/98\r\nrecital 8 (adapted)\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It may be useful to set\r\nthresholds \u00d6 or \u00d5 other\r\nappropriate conditions requiring the notification of awards of aid in order to\r\nallow the Commission to examine individually the effect of certain aid on\r\ncompetition and trade between Member States and its compatibility with the \u00d6 internal \u00d5 market.\n\u00ea 994/98\r\nrecital 7 (adapted)\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to enable\r\nthe Commission, when it adopts regulations exempting certain categories of aid\r\nfrom the obligation to notify in Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 (3) \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 , to attach\r\nfurther detailed conditions in order to ensure the compatibility with the \u00d6 internal \u00d5 market of aid\r\ncovered by this Regulation.\n\u00ea 994/98\r\nrecital 9 (adapted)\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, having\r\nregard to the development and the functioning of the \u00d6 internal \u00d5 market, should\r\nbe enabled to establish by means of a regulation that certain aid does not\r\nfullfil all the criteria of Article \u00d6 107 \u00d5 (1) \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 and is\r\ntherefore exempted from the notification procedure laid down in Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 (3) \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 , provided\r\nthat aid granted to the same undertaking over a given period of time does not\r\nexceed a certain fixed amount.\n\u00ea 994/98\r\nrecital 10 (adapted)\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 (1) \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 the Commission\r\nis under an obligation, in cooperation with Member States, to keep under\r\nconstant review all systems of existing aid. For this purpose and in order to\r\nensure the largest possible degree of transparency and adequate control it is\r\ndesirable that the Commission ensures the establishment of a reliable system of\r\nrecording and storing information about the application of the regulations it\r\nadopts, to which all Member States have access, and that it receives all\r\nnecessary information from the Member States on the implementation of aid\r\nexempted from notification to fulfil this obligation, which may be examined and\r\nevaluated with the Member States within the Advisory Committee \u00d6 on state\r\naid \u00d5 . For this\r\npurpose it is also desirable that the Commission may require such information\r\nto be supplied as is necessary to ensure the efficiency of such review.\n\u00ea 733/2013\r\nrecital 17 (adapted)\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Member States \u00d6 should \u00d5 provide\r\nsummaries of information concerning aid implemented by them which is covered by\r\nan exemption regulation. The publication of those summaries is necessary to\r\nensure the transparency of the measures adopted by the Member States. With the\r\ngrowth of electronic communication media, publication of the summaries on the\r\nwebsite of the Commission is a fast and effective method \u00d6 ensuring \u00d5 transparency\r\nfor the benefit of interested parties. Therefore, those summaries should be\r\npublished on the website of the Commission.\n\u00ea 994/98\r\nrecital 11 (adapted)\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The control of the granting\r\nof aid involves factual, legal and economic issues of a very complex nature and\r\ngreat variety in a constantly evolving environment. The Commission should\r\ntherefore regularly review the categories of aid which should be exempted from\r\nnotification. The Commission should be able to repeal or amend regulations it\r\nhas adopted pursuant to this Regulation where circumstances have changed with\r\nrespect to any important element which constituted grounds for their adoption\r\nor where the progressive development or the functioning of the \u00d6 internal \u00d5 market so\r\nrequires.\n\u00ea 994/98\r\nrecital 12 (adapted)\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, in close\r\nand constant liaison with the Member States, should be able to define precisely\r\nthe scope of those regulations and the conditions attached to them.
