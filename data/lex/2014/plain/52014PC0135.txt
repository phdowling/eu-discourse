The ICCAT is a Regional Fisheries\r\nManagement Organisation (RFMO) responsible for the conservation of tunas and\r\ntuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas. The European Union\r\nbecame a contracting party to the ICCAT in 1997. \nPursuant to Article 218(9) of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union, the position to be adopted on behalf of the Union in RFMO such as the\r\nICCAT when they are called upon to adopt acts having legal effects, with the\r\nexception of acts supplementing or amending their institutional framework, must\r\nbe adopted by Council Decision, on a proposal from the Commission.\nSuch position within the RFMO is currently\r\nestablished according to a two tier approach. A Council Decision sets out the\r\nguiding principles and orientations of the Union's position on a multiannual\r\nbasis, whereas it is thereafter adjusted for each annual meeting by Commission\r\nnon-papers to be discussed in the Council Working Party.\nAs regards ICCAT, Council Decision\r\n14863/08, as amended by Council Decision 11625/13, provides for a review of the\r\n Union's position before the 2014 annual meeting. Therefore, this proposal aims\r\nat setting out the Union's position within the ICCAT for the period 2014-2019\r\nand thereby replacing Council Decision 14863/08 which is covering the period\r\n2008-2013.\nThis revision aims\r\nat incorporating the principles and orientations of the new Common Fisheries\r\nPolicy (CFP) as laid down in Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[2],\r\ntaking also into account the objectives of the Commission Communication on the\r\nexternal dimension of the CFP[3].\r\nMoreover, the Union's position has been adjusted to the Lisbon Treaty. At last,\r\nthe position has been aligned to the extent possible taking into account the\r\nspecificities of the different RFMOs. \nAs it is the case for the current\r\npositions, the following position contains principles and orientations. In\r\naddition, the standard process for the year to year specification of the Union\r\nposition has been incorporated as requested by Member States for positions\r\naligned more recently.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe external dimension of the CFP was part\r\nof the impact assessment for the CFP reform proposals. The principles and\r\norientations agreed for the new CFP are simply being transposed into the\r\nrevised positions. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe following Decision is based on the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2),\r\nin conjunction with Article 218(9) which provides that the Council, on a\r\nproposal from the Commission shall adopt a decision establishing the positions\r\nto be adopted on the Union's behalf in a body set up by an agreement, when that\r\nbody is called upon to adopt acts having legal effects. This shall apply to the\r\nposition to be adopted by the Commission, on behalf of the Union, in the ICCAT.\r\n\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council is the legal\r\nbasis setting up the principles to be reflected in this negotiating mandate. \nThe following Decision shall replace\r\nCouncil Decision 14863/08 which is covering the period 2008-2013, and shall cover\r\nthe period 2014-2019. \n2014/0070 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf\r\nof the European Union, in the International Commission for the Conservation of\r\nAtlantic Tunas (ICCAT)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 38 of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article 39 thereof, provides\r\nthat one of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy is to assure the\r\navailability of supplies. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[4] provides that the Union\r\nshall ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally\r\nsustainable in the long-term and are managed in a way that is consistent with\r\nthe objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits, and of\r\ncontributing to the availability of food supplies. It also provides that the Union shall apply the precautionary approach to fisheries managements, and shall aim to\r\nensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and\r\nmaintains population of harvested species above levels which can produce the\r\nmaximum sustainable yield. It also provides that the Union shall aim to take\r\nmanagement and conservation measures based on best available scientific advice,\r\nto promote fishing methods that contribute to more selective fishing and the\r\navoidance and reduction, as far as possible, of unwanted catches, to fish with\r\nlow impact on marine ecosystem and fishery resources and to gradually eliminate\r\ndiscards. Besides, the regulation specifically provides that these principles\r\nshall be applied by the Union in its external policy. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision of 9\r\nJune 1986[5]\r\nthe European Community approved the International Convention for the\r\nConservation of Atlantic Tunas (the Convention), which established the\r\nInternational Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The ICCAT\r\nis responsible for the adoption of measures designed to ensure the long-term\r\nconservation and sustainable use of the fishery resources in the Convention\r\nArea and to safeguard the marine eco-systems in which these resources occur.
