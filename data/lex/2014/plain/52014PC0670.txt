In this respect, Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Common\r\nFisheries Policy (\u201cthe basic regulation of the CFP\u201d) sets out the objectives\r\nfor the annual proposals for catch and fishing effort limitations to ensure\r\nthat Union fisheries are ecologically, economically and socially sustainable. \nThe fishing opportunities exercise\r\nrepresents an annual management cycle (biennial in the case of deep sea\r\nstocks). However, this does not stand in the way of the introduction of\r\nlong-term management approaches. The Union has made good progress in this\r\nregard and key stocks of commercial interest are now subject to multi-annual\r\nmanagement plans; yearly TACs and effort ceilings must comply with those plans.\nScope\nThis proposal contains fishing\r\nopportunities that the Union establishes autonomously. However, it also\r\nfeatures fishing opportunities resulting from agreed measures in multilateral\r\nor bilateral fisheries agreements or processes. In those cases, the Union\r\nintervenes on the basis of a position stemming from its own policy objectives,\r\nas well as scientific advice. The outcome of such negotiations implies the\r\nUnion's consent to assume obligations vis-\u00e0-vis third parties. Therefore, the\r\nUnion has no substantive margin of discretion beyond the internal allocation\r\namong Member States when it comes to implementing such decisions in Union law,\r\ni.e. by means of this proposal. As for internal allocation, the principle of\r\nrelative stability applies. \nThus this proposal covers, apart from\r\nautonomous Union stocks:\n\u00b7                        \r\nShared stocks, i.e. stocks that are jointly\r\nmanaged with Norway in the North Sea and the Skagerrak, or related to North\r\nEast Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) Coastal State Agreements.\n\u00b7                        \r\nFishing opportunities resulting from agreements\r\nreached in the framework of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations\r\n(RFMOs).\nA number of fishing opportunities are\r\nmarked as \"pm\" (pro memoria) in this proposal. This is due to\r\nthe fact that:\n\u2013                        \r\nthe advice on some stocks will not be available\r\nby the time the proposal is scheduled for adoption; or\n\u2013                        \r\ncertain catch limitations and other\r\nrecommendations from the relevant RFMOs are pending because their annual\r\nmeetings have not taken place yet; or\n\u2013                        \r\nfor stocks in Greenland waters, as well as\r\nshared stocks or stocks exchanged with Norway and other third countries, the figures\r\nare not available yet, pending the conclusion of consultations in November and\r\nDecember 2014 with those countries.\nA new set of measures are proposed for the\r\nprotection of the stock of seabass in the North East Atlantic. In June 2014,\r\nthe International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) released\r\nscientific advice on this stock, which has been in rapid decline since 2012. Furthermore,\r\nthe Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisherires (STECF) considered\r\nthat in general current national measures for the protection of seabass have\r\nproved ineffective. Seabass is a late maturing and slow growing species whose\r\nfishing mortality currently quadruples the levels maximum sustainable yield\r\n(MSY) levels. In view of the worrying situation of this stock, which could be\r\non the verge of collapse, fishing opportunities are proposed in the form of\r\nfishing effort and catch limits, which should target the main sources of\r\nfishing mortality, i.e. pelagic trawling and recreational fishing. This\r\nincludes a new Annex IIE to the proposed regulation, which is to be completed\r\nwith information being sought from Member States.\nFinally, in 2014 the STECF assessed the\r\nimpact of management measures for Bay of Biscay anchovy. It concluded that\r\nchanging the management period to a normal calendar year (January to December)\r\nconsiderably reduces the risk of the stock falling below biomass safety levels\r\nand leads to a small increase in quantity and stability of catches as compared\r\nto the present management period running from July to June. Following\r\nconsultations with Spain, France and the South Western Waters Advisory Council\r\n(SWWAC), and without prejudice of measures to be adopted in the context of future\r\nmanagement plans, stakeholders indicated their preference for an anchovy TAC\r\nfor the 2015 calendar year based on a specific TAC-setting option assessed by\r\nthe STECF whereby the risk of stock collapse is less than 5%. Following a\r\ncalendar year, like most other TACs in the Atlantic, will also reduce the\r\nadministrative burden linked to the management of this stock. On this basis it\r\nis appropriate to repeal Council Regulation (EU) No 779/2014[1] and at the same time\r\nintroduce a new TAC for the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay for 2015,\r\nwhich will remain in \u201cpm\u201d in the proposed regulation until the necessary\r\nscientific advice is released in December 2014. \nStock overview\nAs usual, the Commission has reviewed the\r\nsituation to which the fishing opportunities proposals must respond via its\r\nannual Communication from the Commission concerning a consultation on Fishing\r\nOpportunities (COM(2014)388 final, hereinafter \"Communication\"). The Communication provides\r\nan overview of the state of the stocks based on the findings of the scientific\r\nadvice issued in 2013. On the positive side, the Communication reports that,\r\namong the stocks for which a full analysis is available, those fished above\r\nsustainable levels have fallen from 86 % in 2009 to 41% in 2014. However, some\r\ntrends still give rise to concern. For instance, the number of stocks under an\r\nadvice to reduce catches to the lowest possible level has increased. \nIn response to the Commission's request,\r\nthe International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) provided in\r\nJuly its annual advice on most fish stocks covered by this proposal. ICES has\r\ntaken into account the orientations presented by the Commission in its\r\nCommunication. This advice was reviewed by the STECF in an Expert Working Group\r\nand at its summer plenary.\nScientific advice delivered by those two\r\nbodies is essentially dependent on data: only stocks for which there is\r\nsufficient and reliable data can be fully assessed, so that stock size\r\nestimates are produced, as well as a forecast of how they will react to the\r\nvarious exploitation scenarios (this is referred to as \"catch options\r\ntables\"). Where sufficient data is available, the scientific bodies are\r\nable to provide estimates of adjustments to the fishing opportunities that will\r\nbring the stock to produce its maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The advice is\r\nthen referred to as \"MSY advice\". In other cases, the Scientific\r\nbodies rely on the precautionary approach to make recommendations as to what\r\nthe level of fishing opportunities should be. The methodology followed by ICES\r\nto that end is presented in ICES published material pertaining to the\r\nimplementation of advice for data limited stocks[2].\nThe main group of TACs proposed are\r\nincluded in Annex IA. This annex contains 151 TACs for stocks fished in the\r\nSkagerrak, Kattegat, ICES subareas I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XII\r\nand XIV, EU waters of CECAF and French Guiana waters. Of these TACs, 12\r\nare set according to MSY advice. As for the rest:\n\u00b7                        \r\n12 TACs are proposed in line with long-term\r\nmanagement strategies e.g.. management plans stemming from specific CFP\r\nregulations in force, Commission proposals for management plans not yet\r\nadopted, or a management approach put forward by Advisory Councils (ACs) and\r\nevaluated as precautionary by scientific advisory bodies.\n\u00b7                        \r\n47 TACs concern data-limited stocks, for which a\r\nfull assessment is not available. Of these, 26 TACs are proposed at the same\r\nlevel as in 2014, following a joint statement by the Council and the Commission\r\nwhereby the fishing opportunities would be kept stable unless scientific advice\r\nbecame available showing that the stock is deteriorating. The rationale for\r\nthis decision lies in the fact that most of these stocks are by-catches in\r\nmixed fisheries and there is no real incidence of TAC changes on the evolution\r\nof their status, whereas recurrent TAC cuts may give rise to regulatory\r\ndiscards.\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe remaining TACs are at this stage shown in\r\n\u201cpm\u201d (pro memoria) due to the fact that the related scientific advice is not\r\nyet available, further socio-economic information is necessary or international\r\nnegotiations or arrangements need to be concluded later in the year (e.g. RFMO\r\nmeetings). For these stocks, the proposal will need to be updated as the\r\nrelated advice and information becomes available.\nAll the proposed fishing opportunities\r\nrespond to the scientific advice received by the Commission as to the state of\r\nthe stocks, which has been used in the manner outlined in the Communication.\nConsistency with other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThe measures proposed are designed in\r\naccordance with the objectives and the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and\r\nare consistent with the Union's policy on sustainable development.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation methods, main\r\nsectors targeted and general profile of respondents\nThe Commission has consulted stakeholders,\r\nin particular through the Advisory Councils (ACs), and Member States on its\r\nproposed approach to its various fishing opportunities proposals on the basis\r\nof its Communication on Fishing Opportunities for 2015.\nIn addition, the Commission has followed\r\nthe orientations outlined in its Communication to the Council and European\r\nParliament on improving consultation on Community fisheries management\r\n(COM(2006)246 final), which sets out the principles for the so called\r\nfront-loading process.\nFurthermore, the Commission organised an\r\nevent for stakeholders on 26 September, at which the outcomes of the scientific\r\nadvice and its key implications were presented and discussed.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of responses and how they\r\nwere taken into account\nThe response to the Commission Communication\r\non Fishing Opportunities mentioned above reflects the views of stakeholders on the\r\nevaluation made by the Commission of the state of the resources and how to\r\nensure the appropriate management response.\nThe Pelagic AC (PELAC), in particular,\r\nhoped that progress is made in the adoption of multiannual management plans; it\r\nalso pointed out that the involvement of non-EU countries can complicate the\r\nprocess. PELAC also urged the Commission to consider the plan it has developed\r\nfor herring in the Celtic Sea when proposing the relevant TAC for 2015. PELAC\r\nexpressed concerns regarding the fact that the Communication is vague as\r\nregards how the objective of MSY beyond 2015 is to be delayed in certain\r\njustified cases, i.e. who must provide evidence of the need for delay and how\r\nwill the process work. As regards the landing obligation for pelagic fisheries,\r\nwhich enters into force on 1 January 2015, PELAC deplored the lack of detail in\r\nthe Commission Communication as to how TAC adaptations will be effected in\r\norder to integrate discards. \nThe South Western Waters AC (SWWAC)\r\nwelcomed the clarity of the Communication and in particular the description of\r\nthe Commission\u2019s methodology to propose TAC levels for next year. It recalled\r\nthat, in most cases, the follow-up of MSY levels should be guided by fishing\r\nmortality rather than biomass indicators. It identified sole in the Bay of\r\nBiscay and Southern hake as potential stocks where MSY in 2015 might not be\r\nfeasible, considering the advice released by ICES for those two stocks. SWWAC\r\nacknowledged, however, that it had not developed a methodology to assess when\r\nMSY can be delayed beyond 2015 on account of socio-economic impacts. SWWAC also\r\nrecommended that the TACs proposed take into account the landing obligation.The\r\nNorth Western Waters AC (NWWAC) supports, as regards the landing obligation,\r\nthe use of best available science for the determination of any quota adjustment.\r\nHowever, these adjustments cannot prejudice achieving the MSY objective of the\r\nCFP. The AC also highlighted the need for consideration of economic impacts in\r\nthe setting of fishing opportunities. It also emphasised the need to develop\r\nmanagement plans and considered this a focus for its own work planning. The\r\nNWWAC also called for an extensive process of consultation before decisions are\r\nmade on implementation of advice related to mixed fisheries.\u00a0 \nCollection and use of expertise\nAs for the methodology used, the Commission\r\nconsulted, as already noted, the International Council for the Exploration of\r\nthe Sea (ICES) and its Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for\r\nFisheries (STECF). Advice from ICES is based on an advice framework developed\r\nby its expert groups and decision-making bodies and issued in accordance with\r\nthe Memorandum of Understanding agreed with the Commission. The STECF gives its\r\nadvice following terms of reference that it receives from the Commission.\nThe ultimate objective is to bring and\r\nmaintain the stocks to levels that can deliver Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).\r\nThis objective has been incorporated expressly in the new basic regulation of\r\nthe CFP, whose Article 2(2) states that this objective \u201cshall be achieved by\r\n2015 where possible, and [\u2026] by 2020 for all stocks\". This reflects\r\nthe commitment taken by the Union regarding the conclusions of the 2002 World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and its related Plan of\r\nImplementation. As already noted, for some stocks information on maximum\r\nsustainable yield levels is indeed available. Among these, there are very\r\nimportant stocks in terms of volume of catches and commercial value such as\r\nhake, cod, anglerfish, sole, megrims, haddock and Norway lobster. \nReaching the MSY objective may, in certain\r\ncases, need a reduction in fishing mortality rates and/or a reduction in\r\ncatches. Against this background, this proposal makes\r\nuse of the MSY advice, where available. In line with the objectives of\r\nthe Common Fisheries Policy, where TACs are proposed on the basis of MSY\r\nadvice, the TAC corresponds to the level which, according to that advice, would\r\nensure delivery of the MSY objective in 2015.This approach follows the\r\nprinciples presented in the Communication on fishing opportunities for 2015. \nFor data-limited\r\nstocks, the scientific advisory bodies issue recommendations as to whether to\r\nreduce, stabilise or allow catches to increase. ICES advice has in many cases\r\nprovided quantitative guidance about such variations, based on their\r\nmethodology of a +/- 20% maximum change in catches from one year to the other,\r\non precautionary grounds. This guidance has been used to set the TACs proposed.\r\nWhere there is no scientific advice at all, the precautionary approach has been\r\nfollowed, meaning precautionary TAC reductions by 20%.\nFor some stocks (mainly\r\nwidely distributed stocks, sharks and rays) the advice will be issued in the\r\nautumn. This proposal will need to be updated as appropriate once that advice\r\nis received. Finally, as mentioned above, for certain stocks the advice is used\r\nfor the purpose of implementing management plans. \nSTECF confirms, and has in some cases develops on, the\r\nadvice provided by ICES.\nMeans used to make the expert advice\r\npublicly available\nAll STECF reports are available on the DG\r\nMARE website. All ICES reports are available on ICES' website.\nImpact assessment\nThe scope of the fishing opportunities\r\nregulation is circumscribed by Article 43(3) of the Treaty.\nThe Union has adopted a number of multiannual\r\nmanagement plans for stocks of key economic importance, including hake, cod,\r\nsole, plaice, Norway lobster and others. Before their adoption, such plans are\r\nsubject to the requirement of an impact assessment. Once in force, they\r\ndetermine the TAC and effort levels that must be fixed for the given year in\r\norder to attain their long-term objectives. The Commission is bound to make its\r\nproposal for fishing opportunities in accordance with these plans as long as\r\nthey remain valid and in force. As a result, many crucial fishing opportunities\r\nincluded in the proposal are the result of the specific impact assessment\r\ncarried out for the plan they are based upon. \nFor the remainder, and despite the fact\r\nthat multiannual plans may not be in place, the proposal seeks to avoid\r\nshort-term approaches in favour of long-term sustainability decisions, and\r\nhence it takes into account initiatives from stakeholders and ACs if they have\r\nbeen positively reviewed by ICES and/or STECF. Furthermore, the Commission's CFP\r\nreform proposal was duly developed on the basis of an impact sssessment\r\n(SEC(2011)891) in the context of which the MSY objective was analysed. Its\r\nconclusions identify this objective as a necessary condition to achieve environmental,\r\neconomic and social sustainability. The co-legislators have accepted the\r\nrationale underlying the Commission's reform proposal and reached political\r\nagreement in June last year whereby the MSY target is now explicit and binding. \nAs regards RFMO fishing opportunites and\r\nstocks which are shared with third countries, this proposal essentially\r\ntransposes internationally agreed measures. Any elements relevant to assess\r\npossible impacts of the fishing opportunities are dealt with in the preparation\r\nand conduct phase of international negotiations in the framework of which the\r\nUnion's fishing opportunities are agreed with third parties.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis of this proposal is Article\r\n43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. \nThe Union's obligations for sustainable\r\nexploitation of living aquatic resources arise from obligations set out in\r\nArticle 2 of the basic regulation of the CFP.\nSummary of the proposal\nThe\r\nproposal establishes the catch and effort limitations applicable to Union\r\nfisheries in order to achieve the CFP's objective of ensuring fisheries at\r\nlevels that are environmentally, economically and socially sustainable.\nApplication\nThe\r\nprovisions in the area of the proposal are applicable until 31 December 2015,\r\nwith the exception of certain provisions on effort limitations which are applicable\r\nuntil 31 January 2016, and certain TACs with specific seasonal cycles or\r\narising from certain specific seasonal characteristics of RFMO stocks.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe\r\nproposal falls under the Union exclusive competence as referred to in Article\r\n3(1)(d) of the Treaty. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reason: the CFP is a common policy.\r\nAccording to Article 43(3) of the Treaty it is incumbent upon the Council to\r\nadopt the measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\nThe proposed Council Regulation allocates\r\nfishing opportunities to Member States. Having regard to Articles 16 and 17 of\r\nRegulation 1380/2013, Member States then proceed to allocate in turn such\r\nopportunities among regions or operators as they see fit. Therefore, Member\r\nStates have ample room for manoeuvre on decisions related to the\r\nsocial/economic model of their choice to exploit their allocated fishing\r\nopportunities.\nThe proposal has no new financial\r\nimplications for Member States. This Regulation is adopted by Council every\r\nyear, and the public and private means to implement it are already in place.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed\r\ninstrument: regulation. \nLanding obligation introduced by Regulation (EU) No 1389/2013\nThe new basic regulation of the CFP\r\n(Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013) entered into force in 2014; the landing\r\nobligation it introduces will start to become applicable progressively from\r\n2015 to 2019. In 2019, all stocks under a TAC shall be under the landing\r\nobligation. \nDuring the transitional period, however,\r\nfish under TACs must be landed only if caught (either targeted or as a\r\nby-catch) in fisheries for certain species in certain areas. \nThe concepts of stock under TAC and fishery\r\ndo not match, however. This is why, for the Atlantic and North Sea stocks under\r\nthis Regulation, catches will be subject to the landing obligation only if\r\ncaught in fisheries for industrial purposes and fisheries for mackerel,\r\nherring, horse mackerel, blue whiting, boarfish, anchovy, greater silver smelt,\r\nsprat, sardine, bluefin tuna, swordfish, albacore tuna, bigeye tuna, and blue\r\nand white marlin[3].\nFurthermore, with the introduction of the\r\nlanding obligation, and in accordance with Article\r\n16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the fishing opportunities proposed shall\r\nreflect the change from amount landed to amount caught. This is done on the\r\nbasis of the received scientific advice for the fish stocks in fisheries\r\nreferred to in Article 15(1) of the new basic regulation of the CFP. The\r\nfishing opportunities should also be fixed in accordance with Articles 16(1)\r\n(referring to the principle of relative stability) and 16(4) (referring to the\r\nobjectives of the Common Fisheries Policy and the rules provided for in\r\nmultiannual plans).\nThe landing obligation impacts directly on\r\nconservation objectives for a number of TACs in the proposed fishing\r\nopportunities. These are TACs for elasmobranchs in a poor conservation status,\r\ni.e. sharks, skates and rays; they have been set at 0 for many years so to\r\navoid that these species are targeted in the relevant areas. In addition to the\r\n0 TACs, specific provisions attached to the TAC entries forced their immediate discarding\r\nbecause of their high survivability. Landing them would increase their\r\nmortality rates. After a consultation with experts from Member States held on\r\n31 July 2014, \u00a0there was support to the idea of adding these species, in the\r\nareas covered by the TACs, to the prohibited list of species the fishing\r\nopportunities regulation. This is the aproach reflected in the proposed\r\nregulation: the obligation to release, and hence the level of conservation it\r\nguarantees, is maintained because prohibited species cannot be landed. Regulation\r\n1380/2013 directly exempts prohibited species from the landing obligation via its\r\nArticle 15(4)(a). \nFinally, the links between the new basic\r\nregulation of the CFP and Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n847/96 must be considered. The latter establishes additional conditions for\r\nyear-to-year management of TACs, including flexibility provisions under\r\nArticles 3 and 4 for precautionary and analytical stocks respectively. Under\r\nits Article 2, when fixing the TACs, the Council shall decide to which stocks\r\nArticles 3 and 4 shall not apply, in particular on the basis of the biological\r\nstatus of the stocks. More recently, another flexibility mechanism was introduced\r\nby Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.\r\nTherefore, in order to avoid excessive flexibility that would undermine the\r\nprinciple of rational and responsible exploitation of living marine biological\r\nresources and hinder the achievement of the objectives of the Common Fisheries\r\nPolicy, it should be clarified that Article 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No\r\n847/96 cannot apply in addition to the year-to-year flexibility provided for in\r\nArticle 15(9) of Regulation 1380/2013. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nSimplification\nThe proposal provides for simplification of\r\nadministrative procedures for public authorities (Union or national), in\r\nparticular as regards requirements regarding the\r\neffort management.\nReview/revision/sunset clause\nThe proposal concerns an annual Regulation\r\nfor the year 2015 and therefore does not include a revision clause.\nDetailed explanation of the proposal\nThis proposal is limited to the fixing and\r\nallocation of fishing opportunities and conditions functionally linked to the\r\nuse of those opportunities. \nIn terms of the actual\r\ntrends in the evolution of the stocks, the following cases may be highlighted:\nIberian waters\nOn the one hand anglerfish biomass is increasing and the stock is exploited\r\nat sustainable levels. On the other hand the stock of megrims has deteriorated\r\nand several Norway lobster functional units remain depleted. As regards Southern\r\nhake, biomass continues to increase despite fishing pressure remaining high\r\nwhich, in accordance with the relevant management plan, results in a small TAC cut\r\nand the corresponding effort reduction. \nBay of Biscay\nThe state of the sole stock is deteriorating. Over the past years\r\nscientists have been advising on TAC reductions. In 2013 ICES considered precautionary\r\nlong-term management measures put forward by stakeholders. The 2014 TAC is\r\nbased on those measures aimed at keeping the TAC constant while gradually bringing\r\ndown fishing mortality to sustainable levels. Since fishing mortality increased\r\nin recent years the TAC should be reduced in 2015. \nCeltic Sea and\r\nEnglish Channel\nHigh levels of discarding are a persistent problem in this area,\r\nboth in the whitefish and the flatfish fisheries. Accordingly, scientific\r\nadvice calls for significant TAC cuts e.g. for cod and haddock. As regards sole\r\nin the Eastern English Channel, priority must be given to implement urgent\r\nmeasures to recover this stock: recruitment has been low over the last two\r\nyears and the long-term viability of the fishery is at risk.\nWest of Scotland\nAs a result of the ICES benchmark for haddock in 2014, the stock of\r\nhaddock in the West of Scotland (ICES areas Vb and VIa) is considered a part of\r\nthe biological stock assessed in ICES areas III and IV . Therefore a single\r\nadvice for all these areas is provided. The TAC must remain in \u201cpro memoria\u201d\r\n(pm) in the proposed regulation while appropriate allocations to Member States\r\nare determined. As for cod and whiting, they remain in poor condition with\r\ndiscards still in the region of 70% for both species. The situation may be\r\nworsened by the advice on Norway lobster, to be released in autumn: discards of\r\nwhitefish originate mostly in the latter fishery. Commitments made as regards\r\nselectivity measures have had no discernable impact so far: ICES has not been able\r\nto identify any change in mortality as a result of these measures.\nIrish Sea\nCod and whiting remain in poor condition, although selectivity for\r\nthe Norway lobster fleet seems to have produced some results for these two\r\nstocks; still, ICES advice identifies high discards here. Sole remains overfished\r\nand at its lowest recorded spawning biomass; exploitation should remain at a\r\nlow level. In contrast, plaice is under-utilised and widely discarded, but the\r\nstock is stable.\nThe Kattegat\nAs regards cod in the Kattegat, the advice for 2015 is similar to\r\nthe one for 2014, i.e. that on the basis of precautionary considerations there\r\nshould be no directed fisheries of this species in this area, and bycatch and\r\ndiscards should be minimised. ICES insists particularly on the need to improve\r\nselectivity as a matter of urgency: discard estimations in 2013 were the\r\nhighest in record since 1997.\nNorth Sea\nThe stocks of cod, haddock, whiting,\r\nsaithe, plaice, mackerel and herring in the North Sea are jointly managed with\r\nNorway, so the TACs andthe quota allocations will be fixed following the\r\nEU-Norway consultations in November and December. Of these stocks, cod\r\ncontinues to recover, but very slowly. Whiting and saithe are both declining,\r\nwith the saithe biomass falling below precautionary limits for the last three\r\nyears. Haddock remains stable, with a fishing mortality below MSY levels, but\r\npoor recruitment in recent years. The stock of plaice continues to increase,\r\nand is now at the highest levels on record. As for stocks that are not shared\r\nwith Norway and whose TAC levels are already specified in this proposal, the\r\nstock of sole is slowly increasing, though fishing mortality is just above MSY\r\nlevels, so the applicable management plan calls for a slight TAC reduction. The\r\nstocks of Norway lobster in the North Sea show an overall increase.\n2014/0311 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nfixing for 2015 the fishing opportunities\r\nfor certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Union waters\r\nand, for Union vessels, in certain non-Union waters and repealing Council\r\nRegulation (EU) No 779/2014\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 43(3) of the\r\nTreaty provides that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, is to\r\nadopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[4] requires that\r\nconservation measures be adopted taking into account available scientific,\r\ntechnical and economic advice, including, where relevant, reports drawn up by\r\nthe Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is incumbent upon the\r\nCouncil to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing\r\nopportunities, including, as appropriate, certain conditions functionally\r\nlinked thereto. In accordance with Article 16(1) and (4) of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013 fishing opportunities should be allocated to Member States in\r\nsuch a way as to ensure relative stability of fishing activities of each\r\nMember State for each fish stock or fishery and in accordance with the\r\nobjectives of the Common Fisheries Policy established in Article 2(2) of\r\nthat Regulation.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The total allowable catch\r\n(TACs) should therefore be established, in line with Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013, on the basis of available scientific advice, taking into account\r\nbiological and socio-economic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between\r\nfishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions expressed during the\r\nconsultation of stakeholders, in particular at the meetings of the Advisory\r\nCouncils.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The landing obligation\r\nreferred to in Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is introduced on a\r\nfishery-by-fishery basis. In the region covered by this regulation, when a\r\nfishery falls under the landing obligation, all species in that fishery subject\r\nto catch limits should be landed. As of 1 January 2015, the landing obligation\r\nshould apply to small pelagic fisheries (i.e. fisheries for mackerel, herring,\r\nhorse mackerel, blue whiting, boarfish, anchovy, argentine, sardine and sprat),\r\nto large pelagic fisheries (i.e. fisheries for bluefin tuna, swordfish, albacore\r\ntuna, bigeye tuna and blue and white marlin), to fisheries for industrial\r\npurposes (e.g. fisheries for capelin, sandeel and Norwegian pout). Article 16(2)\r\nof that Regulation provides that, when the landing obligation is introduced in\r\nrespect of a fish stock, fishing opportunities are to be fixed taking into\r\naccount the change from fixing fishing opportunities that reflect landings to\r\nfixing fishing opportunities that reflect catches.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For some years, certain TACs\r\nfor stocks of elasmobranchs (skates, sharks, rays) have been set at 0, with a\r\nlinked provision establishing an obligation to immediately release accidental\r\ncatches. The reason for this specific treatment is that those stocks are in a\r\npoor conservation status and, because of their high survival rates, discards\r\nwill not raise fishing mortality rates for them; discards are deemed as\r\nbeneficial for the conservation of these species. As of 1 January 2015,\r\nhowever, catches of these species in pelagic fisheries will have to be landed,\r\nunless they are covered by any of the derogations from the landing obligation\r\nforeseen in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. Article 15(4)(a) of\r\nthat Regulation allows such derogations for species in respect of which fishing\r\nis prohibited and identified as such in a Union legal act adopted in the area\r\nof the Common Fisheries Policy. Therefore, it is appropriate to prohibit the\r\nfishing of these species in the areas concerned.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In recent years, the TAC\r\nfor anchovy in the Bay of Biscay has been set in a separate fishing\r\nopportunities regulation valid from 1 July of one year to 30 June of the\r\nfollowing year. In 2014, STECF concluded that changing the management period to\r\na normal calendar year (January to December) considerably reduces conservation\r\nrisks for this stock. Following consultations with Spain, France and the South\r\nWestern Waters Advisory Council (SWWAC), the change proposed by STECF was\r\npositively assessed. On this basis it is appropriate to repeal Council\r\nRegulation (EU) No 779/2014[5]\r\nand to introduce a new TAC for the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay for\r\n2015 in this Regulation. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, pursuant to\r\nArticle 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, for stocks subject to specific\r\nmultiannual plans the TACs should be established in accordance with the rules\r\nlaid down in those plans. Consequently, the TACs for stocks of Southern hake\r\nand Norway lobster, of sole in the Western Channel, of plaice and sole in the\r\nNorth Sea, of herring to the west of Scotland, of cod in the Kattegat, to the\r\nwest of Scotland, the Irish Sea, the North Sea, Skagerrak and the Eastern\r\nChannel and of bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean\r\nshould be established in accordance with the rules laid down in Council\r\nRegulations (EC) No 2166/2005[6],\r\n(EC) No 509/2007[7],\r\n(EC) No 676/2007[8],\r\n(EC) No 1300/2008[9],\r\n(EC) No 1342/2008[10]\r\n(the \"Cod Plan\") and (EC) No 302/2009[11]. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard, however, to\r\nthe stocks of northern hake (Council Regulation (EC) No 811/2004[12]) and sole in the Bay\r\nof Biscay (Council Regulation (EC) No 388/2006[13]), the minimum targets\r\nof the relevant recovery and management plans have been reached and, therefore,\r\nit is appropriate to follow scientific advice provided in order to achieve or\r\nmaintain the TACs at maximum sustainable yield levels, as the case may be.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For stocks for which there\r\nis no sufficient or reliable data in order to provide size estimates,\r\nmanagement measures and TAC levels should follow the precautionary approach to\r\nfisheries management as defined in Article 4(1)(8) of Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 1380/2013, while taking into account stock-specific factors, including,\r\nin particular, available information on stock trends and mixed fisheries\r\nconsiderations.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 847/96[14]\r\nintroduced additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs, including\r\nflexibility provisions under Articles 3 and 4 for precautionary and analytical\r\nstocks respectively. Under Article 2 of that Regulation, when fixing the TACs,\r\nthe Council is to decide to which stocks Articles 3 and 4 do not apply, in\r\nparticular on the basis of the biological status of the stocks. More recently,\r\na flexibility mechanism was introduced for all catches covered by the landing\r\nobligation by Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. Therefore, in\r\norder to avoid excessive flexibility, which would undermine the conservation\r\nobjectives set out in the Common Fisheries Policy, and to prevent negative\r\nimpacts on the biological state of the stocks, Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 847/96 may apply to TACs only where Member States do not use the\r\nyear-to-year flexibility provided for in Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a TAC relating to a\r\nstock is allocated to one Member State only, it is appropriate to empower\r\nthat Member State in accordance with Article 2(1) of the Treaty to\r\ndetermine the level of such TAC. Provisions should be made to ensure that, when\r\nfixing that TAC level, the Member State concerned acts in a manner fully\r\nconsistent with the principles and rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In June 2014, the\r\nInternational Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) released scientific\r\nadvice on the stock on seabass in the North East Atlantic, and confirmed that this\r\nstock has been in rapid decline since 2012. \u00a0Furthermore, STECF has evaluated the\r\nprotection of seabass by national measures in place and, in general, has deemed\r\nthem ineffective. Seabass is a late maturing and slow growing species whose\r\nfishing mortality currently quadruples the levels maximum sustainable yield\r\n(MSY) levels. It is therefore appropriate to establish fishing opportunities\r\nfor this stock in the form of fishing effort and catch limits, which should\r\ntarget the main sources of fishing mortality, i.e. pelagic trawling and\r\nrecreational fishing. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to\r\nestablish the fishing effort ceilings for 2015 in accordance with\r\nArticle 8 of Regulation (EC) No 2166/2005, Article 5 of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 509/2007, Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 676/2007,\r\nArticles 11 and 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 and Articles\r\n5 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 302/2009, while taking into account Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 754/2009[15].\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the most\r\nrecent scientific advice from International Council for the Exploration of the\r\nSea (ICES) and in accordance with the international commitments in the context\r\nof the North East Atlantic Fisheries Convention (NEAFC), it is necessary to\r\nlimit the fishing effort on certain deep-sea species.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For certain species, such\r\nas certain species of sharks, even a limited fishing activity could result in a\r\nserious risk to their conservation. Fishing opportunities for such species\r\nshould therefore be fully restricted through a general prohibition on fishing\r\nthose species.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of fishing\r\nopportunities available to Union vessels set out in this Regulation is subject\r\nto Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009[16],\r\nand in particular to Articles 33 and 34 of that Regulation,\r\nconcerning the recording of catches and fishing effort and the notification of\r\ndata on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities. It is therefore necessary to\r\nspecify the codes to be used by Member States when sending data to\r\nthe Commission relating to landings of stocks subject to\r\nthis Regulation.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For certain TACs\r\nMember States should be allowed to grant additional allocations for\r\nvessels participating in trials on fully documented fisheries. The aim of those\r\ntrials is to test a catch\u2011quota system in fisheries that are not yet\r\nunder the landing obligation set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, i.e. a\r\nsystem where all catches should be landed and counted against quotas in order\r\nto avoid discards and the waste of otherwise usable fish resources they entail.\r\nUncontrolled discards of fish are a threat to the long term sustainability of\r\nfish as a public good and thus to the Common Fisheries Policy objectives. By\r\ncontrast, catch\u2011quota systems inherently present the fishers with an\r\nincentive to optimise the catch selectivity of their operations. In order to\r\nachieve a rational management of discards, a fully documented fishery should\r\ncover every operation at sea, rather than what is landed at port. The\r\nconditions for Member States to grant such additional allocations should\r\ntherefore include an obligation to ensure the use of close circuit television cameras\r\n(CCTV) associated to a system of sensors (jointly referred to as \"CCTV\r\nsystem\"). This should enable the recording, in detail, of all retained and\r\ndiscarded parts of catches. A system based on human observers operating in real\r\ntime on board would be less efficient, more costly, and less reliable.\r\nConsequently, the use of CCTV systems is, at this time, a prerequisite for the\r\nachievement of discard reduction schemes such as fully documented fisheries. In\r\nthe use of such system, the requirements of Directive 95/46/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[17]\r\nshould be complied with.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\r\ntrials of fully documented fisheries can effectively evaluate the potential of\r\ncatch-quota systems to control the absolute fishing mortality of the stocks\r\nconcerned, it is necessary for all fish caught in those trials, including those\r\nunder minimum landing size, to be counted against the total allocation assigned\r\nto the participating vessel, and for fishing operations to cease when that\r\ntotal allocation has been fully utilised by that vessel. It is also appropriate\r\nto allow transfers of allocations between vessels participating in the fully\r\ndocumented fisheries trials and non-participating vessels provided that it can\r\nbe demonstrated that discards by non-participating vessels do not increase.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate,\r\nfollowing advice from the ICES, to maintain a specific system to manage sandeel\r\nin Union waters of ICES divisions IIa and IIIa and ICES subarea IV. Given that\r\nthe ICES scientific advice is expected to become available only in\r\nFebruary 2015, it is appropriate to set the TAC and quotas provisionally\r\nat zero until such advice is released.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nprocedure provided for in the agreements or protocols on fisheries relations with\r\nNorway[18],\r\nthe Faroe Islands[19]\r\nand Iceland[20],\r\nthe Union has held consultations on fishing rights with those partners. The\r\nconsultations with Norway and the Faroe Islands on arrangements for 2015 have\r\nnot been finalised. In order to avoid the interruption of Union fishing\r\nactivities, whilst allowing for the necessary flexibility for the conclusion of\r\nthose arrangements early in 2015, it is appropriate to establish the fishing\r\nopportunities for stocks subject to those arrangements on a provisional basis.\r\nIt has not been possible to conclude consultations with Iceland on fisheries\r\narrangements for 2015. In accordance with the procedure provided for in the\r\nagreement and protocol on fisheries relations with Greenland[21], the Joint Committee\r\nhas established the concrete level of fishing opportunities available for the\r\nUnion in Greenland waters in 2015. [Recital to be modified, as well as the\r\nrelevant provisions to which it refers, after the new consultations are held].\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its Annual Meeting in\r\n2013, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas\r\n(ICCAT) adopted a one year extension of the existing TAC and quotas for bluefin\r\ntuna, and confirmed TACs and quotas for North-Atlantic swordfish, Southern\u2011Atlantic\r\nswordfish and North-Atlantic Albacore at the current level for the 2014\u20112016\r\nperiod. As a result, the Union quota for these stocks remains the same as\r\nin 2013. Although the TAC of Southern-Atlantic albacore was also\r\nmaintained at the current level for the 2014-2016 period, individual quotas of\r\nContracting Parties, including the Union, were slightly reduced in order to\r\ngrant a quota to another Contracting Party. All these measures should be\r\nimplemented in the law of the Union. [Recital to be modified, as well as the\r\nrelevant provisions to which it refers, after the new annual meeting is held].\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its Annual Meeting in\r\n2013, the Parties to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine\r\nLiving Resources (CCAMLR) adopted catch limits for both target and by-catch\r\nspecies. Those measures should be implemented in the law of the Union.\r\n[Recital to be modified, as well as the relevant provisions to which it refers,\r\nafter the new annual meeting is held].\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its\r\nAnnual Meeting in 2014, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) did not modify the conservation and management measures in\r\nplace.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nthird Annual Meeting of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management\r\nOrganisation (SPRFMO) will be held in February 2015. It is appropriate\r\nthat current measures in the SPRFMO Convention Area are provisionally maintained\r\nuntil such Annual Meeting is held. However, the stock of jack mackerel shall\r\nnot be targeted before a TAC is set as a result of that Annual Meeting.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its 87th Annual Meeting\r\nin 2014, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) maintained its\r\nconservation measures for yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna and skipjack tuna. IATTC\r\nalso maintained its resolution on the conservation of oceanic whitetip sharks.\r\nThose measures should continue to be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its Annual Meeting in\r\n2013, the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (SEAFO) adopted a\r\nrecommendation for new bi-annual TACs for Patagonian toothfish and deep\u2011sea\r\nred crab for 2014 and 2015, the existing TACs for orange roughy and alfonsinos\r\nagreed for 2013 and 2014 at its annual meeting in 2012 remained in force.\r\nThe currently applicable measures on allocation of fishing opportunities\r\nadopted by SEAFO should be implemented in the law of the Union. [Recital to\r\nbe modified, as well as the relevant provisions to which it refers, after the\r\nnew annual meeting is held].\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The 10th Annual Meeting of\r\nthe Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) in 2013 modified\r\nits measures regarding fishing opportunities by setting a total amount of days\r\nthat can be fished in the high seas and by adapting the closure concerning\r\naggregation devices (FAD) fishing. The revision of the measure of FAD fishing\r\nrequires that the Union as a Contracting Party to WCPFC decides on one of two\r\navailable options, either to confirm the current period of FAD fishing closure\r\nor to opt for a reduction of FAD sets. Until such a decision is taken, the\r\ncurrently applicable closure adopted by the WCFPC should continue to be\r\nimplemented in the law of the Union. [Recital to be modified, as well as the\r\nrelevant provisions to which it refers, after the new annual meeting is held].\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its Annual Meeting in\r\n2013, the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of\r\nPollock resources in the central Bering Sea did not modify its measures\r\nregarding fishing opportunities. Those measures should be implemented in the\r\nlaw of the Union.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its 36th Annual Meeting\r\nin 2014, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) adopted a number\r\nof fishing opportunities for 2015 of certain stocks in Subareas 1\u20114\r\nof the NAFO Convention Area. In that context, NAFO adopted a moratorium for the\r\nshrimp fishery in Division 3L, increased the TAC for redfish in Division 3M in\r\norder to cover certain by-catches and reopened the fishery for witch flounder\r\nin Division 3NO. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain international\r\nmeasures which create or restrict fishing opportunities for the Union are\r\nadopted by the relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) at\r\nthe end of the year and become applicable before the entry into force of this\r\nRegulation. It is therefore necessary for the provisions that implement such\r\nmeasures in the law of the Union to apply retroactively. In particular,\r\nsince the fishing season in CCAMLR\r\nConvention Area runs from 1 December to 30 November,\r\nand thus certain fishing opportunities or prohibitions in the CCAMLR Convention\r\nArea are laid down for a period of time starting from 1 December 2014, it is\r\nappropriate that the relevant provisions of this Regulation apply from that\r\ndate. Such retroactive application will be without prejudice to the principle\r\nof legitimate expectations as CCAMLR members are forbidden to fish in the\r\nCCAMLR Convention Area without authorisation.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\ndeclaration by the Union addressed to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on\r\nthe granting of fishing opportunities in EU waters to fishing vessels flying\r\nthe flag of Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the exclusive economic zone off\r\nthe coast of French Guyana[22],\r\nit is necessary to fix the fishing opportunities for snappers available to\r\nVenezuela in Union waters.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for granting an individual Member State an authorisation to benefit\r\nfrom the system of managing its fishing effort allocations in accordance with a\r\nkilowatt days system, implementing powers should be conferred on\r\nthe Commission.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission relating to the granting of additional\r\ndays at sea for permanent cessation of fishing activities and for enhanced\r\nscientific observer coverage as well as to establish the formats of spreadsheet\r\nfor the collection and transmission of information concerning transfer of days\r\nat sea between fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State. Those powers\r\nshould be exercised in accordance with Regulation\r\n(EU) No 182/2011[23].\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid the\r\ninterruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihood of the\r\nfishermen of the Union, this Regulation should apply\r\nfrom 1 January 2015, except for the provisions concerning\r\nfishing effort limits, which should apply from 1 February 2015,\r\nand certain provisions in particular regions, which should have a specific date\r\nof application.
