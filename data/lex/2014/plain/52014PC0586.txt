Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the\r\nCommission decided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten\r\namendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments\r\nshould endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they\r\nare responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily\r\nunderstandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a\r\ngiven matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament, the\r\nCouncil and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the\r\nfast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 779/98 of\r\n7 April 1998 on the import into the Community of agricultural products\r\noriginating in Turkey, repealing Regulation (EEC) No 4115/86 and amending\r\nRegulation (EC) No 3010/95[3].\r\nThe new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the\r\ncodification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was\r\ndrawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in 23 official languages,\r\nof Regulation (EC) No 779/98 and the instrument amending it, carried out\r\nby the Publications Office of the European Union, by means of a data-processing\r\nsystem.
