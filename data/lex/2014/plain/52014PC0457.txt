The GFCM is\r\na Regional Fisheries Management Organisation established under Article XIV of\r\nthe FAO Constitution; its main objectives are to promote the development,\r\nconservation, rational management and best utilization of living marine\r\nresources and the sustainable development of aquaculture in the Mediterranean, Black Sea and connecting waters. The GFCM has the authority to adopt compulsory decisions\r\n(\u201crecommendations\u201d) in its area of competence; these acts are essentially\r\naddressed to the Contracting Parties but may also contain obligations for\r\noperators (e.g. the vessel master). The recommendations become binding within\r\n120 days after the date of first notification, provided that no objections are\r\nlodged. \nThe EU and ten Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Slovenia, Spain and Romania) are Contracting Parties to the GFCM Agreement. To the extent to which the content\r\nof the GFCM recommendations is not covered or is only partially covered by\r\nexisting Union Law, the transposition of the relevant GFCM provisions is\r\nnecessary to ensure that the latter will receive uniform and effective\r\napplication throughout the European Union. \nThe last transposition of GFCM decisions was\r\ndone by means of Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011[1].\r\nThe current proposal will insert into that legislative act the measures to be\r\ntransposed by way of amendments to it. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThere was no need for consultation of\r\ninterested parties or for impact assessment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal contains technical measures\r\nfor the sustainable exploitation of red coral, the mitigation of incidental\r\ncaptures of seabirds, sea turtles and cetaceans and the conservation of monk\r\nseals, sharks and rays in the GFCM Agreement area[2]. Such measures go\r\nbeyond the protection already ensured to these species at EU level by the\r\nHabitats Directive and other Union acts[3]\r\nand include specific recording and reporting obligations for both operators and\r\nMember States. The proposal also implements in Union law certain measures for\r\nfisheries for small pelagic stocks in the Adriatic Sea[4].\nLegal basis\nArticle 43(2) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under exclusive\r\ncompetence of the European Union.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposed text will ensure the\r\ntransposition of the relevant GFCM measures in Union law without exceeding what\r\nis necessary to achieve the objective pursued.\nChoice of instrument\nProposed instrument: Regulation of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council amending an existing Regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reason: a Regulation must be amended by a Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis measure does not involve any\r\nadditional Union expenditure.\n2014/0213 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on certain\r\nprovisions for fishing in the GFCM (General Fisheries Commission for the\r\nMediterranean) Agreement area \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nAgreement for the establishment of the General Fisheries Commission for the\r\nMediterranean (\u201cthe GFCM Agreement\u201d) provides an\r\nappropriate framework for multilateral cooperation to promote the development,\r\nconservation, rational management and best utilisation of living marine\r\nresources in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea at levels which are considered\r\nsustainable and at low risk of collapse.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union, as\r\nwell as Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Malta, Romania and Slovenia are contracting parties to the GFCM Agreement.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1343/2011 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil [6] lays down certain provisions for fishing in the General Fisheries\r\nCommission for the Mediterranean (\"GFCM\") Agreement area. It is the\r\nappropriate legislative act for the implementation of\r\nthe GFCM recommendations whose content is not yet covered by Union law. Indeed,\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1343/2011 can be amended to include the measures contained in the relevant GFCM recommendations.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its Annual Sessions in\r\n2011 and 2012, the GFCM adopted measures for the sustainable exploitation of\r\nred coral in its area of competence to be implemented in Union law. One of those measures concerns the use of Remotely Operated\r\nunder-water Vehicles (ROVs). The GFCM decided that ROVs in zones under national\r\njurisdiction exclusively for observation and prospection of red coral on the\r\nbasis of recommendation GFCM/35/2011/2, are no longer to be allowed after 2014.\r\nAccording to another measure laid down in recommendation GFCM/36/2012/1, red\r\ncoral catches are to be landed only in a limited number of ports with adequate\r\nport facilities and the lists of designated ports are to be communicated to the\r\nGFCM Secretariat. Any changes affecting the lists of ports designated by Member\r\nStates should be communicated to the European Commission for further\r\ntransmission to the GFCM Secretariat. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its Annual Sessions in\r\n2011 and 2012, the GFCM adopted recommendations GFCM/35/2011/3, GFCM/35/2011/4,\r\nGFCM/35/2011/5, GFCM/36/2012/2 laying down measures for the mitigation of\r\nincidental catches of seabirds, sea turtles, monk seals and cetaceans in\r\nfishing activities in the GFCM Agreement area to be implemented in Union law.\r\nThose measures include the prohibition to use, from 1 January 2015, bottom-set\r\ngillnets with monofilament or twines greater than 0.5mm, with a view to\r\nmitigate incidental catches of cetaceans. Such prohibition is already contained\r\nin Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 which, however, covers only the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore it should be included in this Regulation in order to apply also\r\nto the Black Sea. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its Annual Session in\r\n2012, the GFCM also adopted recommendation GFCM/36/2012/3 laying down measures aiming\r\nto ensure in its area of competence a high level of protection from fishing\r\nactivities to sharks and rays, and in particular to the shark and ray species\r\nlisted as endangered or threatened under Annex II of the Protocol concerning\r\nSpecially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean[7] to the Barcelona Convention[8]. \u00a0According to a GFCM\r\nmeasure, fishing activities carried out with trawl nets are to be prohibited\r\nwithin 3 nautical miles off the coast, provided that the 50 meters isobaths is\r\nnot reached, or within the 50 meters isobaths where the depth of 50 meters is\r\nreached at a shorter distance from the coast. Such\r\nprohibition is already contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 which,\r\nhowever, covers only the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore it should be included in this\r\nRegulation in order to apply also to the Black Sea. Certain\r\nother measures aimed at proper identification of sharks included in that recommendation,\r\nwhich are not covered by Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003[9] or other Union legislation,\r\nneed to be included in this Regulation in order to be fully implemented in Union\r\nlaw. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its Annual Session in\r\n2013 and 2014, the GFCM adopted recommendations GFCM/37/2013/1 and\r\nGFCM/38/2014/1 laying down measures for fisheries exploiting small pelagic\r\nstocks in the Adriatic Sea which should be implemented in Union law. These\r\nmeasures concern the management of fishing capacity for\r\nsmall pelagic stocks in GFCM Geographical Sub-Areas 17 and 18, on the basis of\r\nthe reference fishing capacity established by the means of the list of vessels\r\nthat had to be communicated to the GFCM Secretariat by 30 November 2013, in\r\naccordance with paragraph 22 of recommendation GFCM/37/2013/1. That list includes all vessels\r\nequipped with trawl nets, purse seines or other types of surrounding\r\nnets without purse line, authorised by the concerned Member States to fish for\r\nsmall pelagic stocks and registered in harbours located in Geographical Sub-Areas 17 and 18, or operating in Geographical\r\nSub-Area 17 and/or in Geographical Sub-Area 18 although registered in harbours\r\nlocated in other Geographical Sub-Areas at the date of 31 October 2013. Any changes which may affect\r\nthe above-mentioned list should be\r\ncommunicated to the European Commission as soon as they occur for further transmission to the GFCM Secretariat. The GFCM\r\nmeasure also includes a prohibition to retain on board\r\nor land which should be implemented in EU law in line with Article 15(2) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013[10].\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of certain provisions of this Regulation, implementing\r\npowers should be conferred on the Commission. These provisions concern: the\r\nformat and transmission of the request for a derogation\r\nfrom a minimum depth for harvesting of red coral or from the minimum basal\r\ndiameter of colonies of red coral; the format and transmission of the results\r\nof scientific evaluations of the zones subject to a derogation from a minimum\r\ndepth for harvesting of red coral; the format and transmission of data on\r\nharvesting of red coral; information related to incidental catches of sea\r\nbirds, sea turtles, monk seals, cetaceans and sharks and rays, changes of lists\r\nof ports designated for landing catches of red coral, impacts of certain\r\nfishing vessels on cetacean populations and changes occurred to maps and lists\r\nof geographical locations which identify the location of caves of monk seals. \u00a0These\r\npowers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[11]. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure that the Union continues to fulfil its obligations under the\r\nGFCM Agreement, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the\r\nTreaty should be delegated to the Commission concerning authorisations to\r\nderogate from the prohibition to harvest red coral at\r\ndepths less than 50 m and to depart from the minimum basal diameter of red\r\ncoral colonies. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out\r\nappropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert\r\nlevel. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should\r\nensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\r\ndocuments to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1343/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011\nRegulation (EU) No 1343/2011 is\r\namended as follows:\n(1)         \r\nthe following Article 15a is inserted:\n\"Article\r\n15a\n\"Use\r\nof trawl nets and gill-nets fisheries in the Black Sea\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of\r\ntrawl nets shall be prohibited within 3 nautical miles off the coast, provided\r\nthat the 50 meters isobath is not reached, or within the 50 meters isobath\r\nwhere the depth of 50 meters is reached at a shorter distance from the coast.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From 1 January 2015, monofilament or twines diameter of bottom-set\r\ngillnets shall not exceed 0,5mm.\"\n(2)         \r\nin Title II, the following Chapters IV, V and VI are\r\nadded:\n\"Chapter IV\nConservation and sustainable\r\nexploitation of red coral\nArticle 16a\nScope\nThe provisions of this Chapter shall\r\napply without prejudice to Article 4(2) and Article\r\n8(1), (e) and (g) of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1967/2006 or any stricter measures stemming from\r\nDirective 92/43/EEC*.\nArticle 16b\nMinimum depth for harvesting \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The harvesting of red\r\ncoral shall be prohibited at depth less than 50 m. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall be\r\nempowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 27 to grant derogations\r\nfrom paragraph 1.
