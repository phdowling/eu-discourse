In February 2012, the EU and the Republic of Moldova also launched negotiations on the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) part,\r\nas a core element of the Association Agreement. On 29 November 2013 the European Union and \u00a0the Republic of   Moldova initialled the text of the Agreement.\nThe Association\r\nAgreement is the most advanced agreement of this type ever negotiated by the EU,\r\nin particular with regard to trade and economic integration, going far beyond a\r\nsimple market opening. The aim is to accelerate the deepening of political and\r\neconomic relations between the Republic of Moldova and the EU, as well as to\r\nadvance the Republic of Moldova's gradual economic integration with the EU\r\nInternal Market in selected areas, notably through establishing a DCFTA.\nOn 16 June 2014,\r\nthe Council adopted its decision [1]\r\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union and the European Atomic Energy\r\nCommunity and their Member States, and provisional application of certain\r\nprovisions of the Association Agreement, including its Deep and Comprehensive\r\nFree Trade Area (DCFTA) part between the European Union and the European Atomic\r\nEnergy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of\r\nMoldova, of the other part. Subsequently, the Agreement was signed in Brussels on Friday, 27 June 2014 in the margins of the European Council.\u00a0 \nThe Republic of   Moldova ratified the Agreement on 2 July 2014 and completed, in parallel with\r\nthe European Union, the requisite notification procedures within the same\r\nmonth. Consequently, in accordance with Article 464 of the Agreement certain\r\nprovisions thereof (specified in Article 4 of the Council Decision on the\r\nsigning and provisional application of the Agreement with the Republic of Moldova of 16 June 2014) are applied on a provisional basis starting from 1\r\nSeptember 2014, pending ratification by the EU Member States.\nThe provisional\r\napplication is foreseen in view of keeping mutual economic interests and shared\r\nvalues in equilibrium, and the common will of the EU and the Republic of Moldova to start implementing and enforcing the eligible parts of the Agreement in\r\norder to advance an early reform impact on sector specific issues before the\r\nconclusion of the Agreement.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF\r\nTHE NEGOTIATIONS\nTitle VII of the\r\nAgreement with the Republic of Moldova provides for the institutional framework\r\nthat is necessary for the proper function and the implementation of the\r\nAgreements. The Agreement establishes an Association Council (Article 434(1))\r\nat ministerial level to supervise and monitor the application and\r\nimplementation of the Agreement. \nTo prepare the\r\nmeetings and deliberations of the Association Council, implement the decisions\r\nof the Association Council where appropriate and, in general, ensure continuity\r\nof the association relationship and the proper function of the Agreement an\r\nAssociation Committee is also established (as per Article 437(1) of the\r\nAgreement). \nThe Association\r\nCouncil as well as the Association Committee may decide to set up any other\r\nspecialised sub-committee or body that can assist it in carrying out its\r\nduties, and shall determine the composition and duties of such committees or\r\nbodies and how they shall function. Furthermore, the Association Council has\r\nthe power to amend or update the Annexes to the Agreement (Article 436(3) of\r\nthe Agreement). It may delegate any of its powers to the Association Committee,\r\nincluding the power to take binding decisions (Article 438(2) of the Agreement)\nThe Association\r\nCommittee shall meet in a specific configuration to address all issues, deriving\r\nfrom Title V (Trade and Trade-related matters). The DCFTA part of the Agreement\r\nforesees specific subcommittees on sanitary & phytosanitary measures, on customs,\r\non geographical indicators, and on trade & sustainable development to\r\nassist the Association Committee in Trade configuration with its duties. \nFora for civil\r\nsociety and parliamentary cooperation are also foreseen.\nWith a view to\r\nensuring smooth and timely implementation of the DCFTA part of the Agreement,\r\nin particular with regard to the updates or amendment of several trade-related\r\nAnnexes to the Agreement, it is suggested to delegate such powers by the\r\nAssociation Council to the Association Committee in Trade configuration. Such\r\ndelegation will ensure the necessary link between, and create conditions for a\r\ntimely follow-up to, the technical discussions within that Committee on the\r\nimplementation of trade-related commitments, including those pertaining to\r\napproximation to the EU acquis by the Republic of Moldova. \nWith a view to\r\ncompleting the institutional framework and allowing for expert level\r\ndiscussions in the key areas falling within the scope of provisional\r\napplication of the Agreements, it is suggested to establish two subcommittees,\r\ndesignated as follows: \n(1) Subcommittee\r\non Justice, Freedom & Security (JFS); \n(2) Subcommittee\r\non Economic and other Sector cooperation. \nThe purpose of\r\nthe subcommittees is to focus on those topics where concrete results are\r\nexpected, rather than to necessarily cover the same agenda of topics year after\r\nyear. \nAdditional\r\nsubcommittees may be established at a later stage, following agreement of the\r\nParties.\nThe Association\r\nAgreement foresees a wide range of sector cooperation, focusing on support to\r\ncore reforms, economic recovery and growth, governance and sector cooperation\r\nin 28 areas, such as; justice, energy, transport, statistics, environment\r\nprotection and promotion, industrial and small and medium enterprise\r\ncooperation, agriculture and rural development, social policies, civil society\r\ncooperation, consumer policy, public administration reform, education, training\r\nand youth as well as cultural cooperation. \nIn all of these\r\nareas, enhanced cooperation starts from the basis of current frameworks, both\r\nbilateral and multilateral, with the aim of more systematic dialogue and\r\nexchange of information and good practice. Key to the sectoral cooperation\r\nchapters is a comprehensive menu of gradual approximation, where relevant, with\r\nthe EU acquis set out in annexes to the Agreement. Specific schedules\r\nfor approximation and implementation by the Republic of Moldova of selected\r\nparts of the EU acquis will provide a focus for on-going cooperation,\r\nand will form the core of the Republic of Moldova's domestic reform and\r\nmodernisation agenda. \nAny \"regular\r\ndialogues\" as frequently referred to in the Agreement may cover all of the\r\naforementioned policy areas.\u00a0 The second subcommittee may thus meet in different configurations as the need\r\narises. This proposal draws on experience with the\r\nPartnership & Cooperation Agreements with the three countries and aims to\r\nstreamline the functioning of the subcommittee structure under the Association\r\nAgreement. \nBoth the EU and the Republic of   Moldova have committed to a rapid and effective implementation of the\r\nAgreement. The aim of this proposal is therefore to ensure that the\r\ninstitutional framework of the Agreement becomes operational as soon as\r\npossible. In order to facilitate this it will be crucial to proceed rapidly\r\nwith the adoption process of the Rules of Procedure for the Association\r\nCouncil, the Association Committee and the subcommittees so that these can soon\r\nstart functioning. It is intended to call the first meeting of the Association\r\nCouncil with the Republic of Moldova on 20 October 2014, coinciding with the Foreign\r\nAffairs Council in Luxembourg. This timing is of prime importance to the Republic of   Moldova in view of the general elections to be held on 30 November. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nFor the Union, the legal basis for authorising the Union position to be adopted in\r\nthe Association Council established by the Association Agreement between the EU\r\nand the Republic of Moldova is the Treaty on the functioning of the European\r\nUnion, and in particular its Article 218(9) TFEU. \nIn light of the above-mentioned results of negotiations, on\r\nthe basis of Article 218(9) TFEU the European Commission proposes that the\r\nCouncil adopts the Decision authorising the Union position to be adopted in the\r\nfirst EU-Republic of Moldova Association Council with regard to: \n\u2013                        \r\nthe rules of procedure for the Association\r\nCouncil and the Association Committee,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u2013                        \r\nthe establishment of two specialised\r\nsubcommittees, \nand\n\u2013                        \r\nthe delegation of certain powers by the\r\nAssociation Council to the Association Committee in Trade configuration.\n2014/0273 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the Union position to be adopted in the\r\nAssociation Council established by the Association Agreement between the\r\nEuropean Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member\r\nStates, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other part, in\r\nrelation to the adoption of the rules of procedure of the Association Council\r\nand of the Association Committee, to the establishment of two specialised\r\nsubcommittees, and to the delegation of certain powers by the Association\r\nCouncil to the Association Committee in Trade configuration\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nfunctioning of the European Union, and in particular its Article 218 (9),\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nCommission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 464of the Association\r\nAgreement (\u201dthe Agreement\u201d) between the European Union and the European Atomic\r\nEnergy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of\r\nMoldova, of the other part provide for provisional application of the Agreement\r\nin part.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 4 of the Council\r\nDecision of 23 June 2014 on the signing and provisional application of the\r\nAgreement specifies certain provisions of the Agreement to be applied\r\nprovisionally.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 435(2) of the\r\nAgreement provides that the Association Council shall establish its own rules\r\nof procedure. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 435(3) of the\r\nAgreement provides that the Association Council shall be chaired in turn by a\r\nrepresentative of the Union and a representative of the Republic of Moldova.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 437(1) of the\r\nAgreement provides that the Association Council shall be assisted in the\r\nperformance of its duties by an Association Committee while Article 438(1)\r\nprovides that the Association Council shall determine in its rules of procedure\r\nthe duties and functioning of the Association Committee. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 439(2) provides\r\nthat the Association Council may decide to set up any other specialised\r\nsub-committee or body in specific areas necessary for the implementation of the\r\nAgreement that can assist it in carrying out its duties. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Association Council is\r\nresponsible for supervising and monitoring the application and implementation\r\nof the Agreement.
