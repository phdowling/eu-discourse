These amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, regulation 13, paragraph 5.1\r\nintroduce a 5-year postponement of the introduction of Tier III NOx emission\r\nstandards. The changes are set out in Annex 12 of the MEPC report (MEPC 65/22).\r\n Para 4.64 of this report indicates that these amendments will be adopted at\r\nMEPC 66. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADOPTION OF THE IMO\r\nAMENDMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of amendments to\r\nMARPOL Annex VI concerning the postponement of the Tier III NOx emission\r\nstandards.\nThese draft amendments were approved at the 65th\r\nsession of the Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting between 13 \u2013 17\r\nMay 2013 and are to be submitted for adoption to the 66th session of\r\nthat Committee between 31 March \u2013 4 April 2014.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Acceptance and entry into\r\nforce. \nOnce approved and adopted by the Marine Environment\r\nProtection Committee, the above amendments will be submitted to the respective\r\ncontracting parties in order for them to express their consent to be bound by\r\nthe said amendments.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RELEVANT EU LEGISLATION\r\nAND EU COMPETENCE\nEU Policy\nEnvironmental protection, which is the\r\nsubject-matter of the amendments to MARPOL, is a shared competence under the EU\r\nTreaty and is in very large measure regulated by Union legislation The EU has\r\nextensively exercised its competence in the area of air and water quality\r\npolicy, both through legislation and agreed policy objectives. The environment policy\r\nincludes a clear commitment of the Union to improve air and water quality,\r\nincluding at international level.\nThe aim and design of the EU's air quality\r\npolicy framework, as set out for example in the Thematic Strategy on Air\r\nPollution[1],\r\nis to make substantial progress towards the long-term EU objectives of\r\npreserving, protecting and improving the environment and protecting human\r\nhealth (art 191 (1) TFEU), i.e \"to achieve levels of air quality that\r\ndo not result in unacceptable impacts on, and risks to, human health and the\r\nenvironment\". This objective, first set out in the Sixth Environment\r\nAction Programme[2]\r\na decade ago, is confirmed in the 7th Environmental Action Programme recently\r\nagreed by the EU, which guides the development of EU policy until 2020[3], most recently\r\nreflected in the Clean Air Programme for Europe adopted by the Commission.[4]\nThese policy objectives would be adversely affected\r\nby the postponement of the stricter NOx standards applicable in NOx Emission\r\nControl Areas (NECAs).\nEU legislation\nExisting legislation covers a wide range of\r\npollutants, including NOx, and a wide range of sources including all modes of\r\ntransport. \nThe National Emission Ceilings Directive (2001/81/EC)[5] and the Ambient Air\r\nQuality Directive (2008/50/EC)[6]\r\nprovide for limit values of NOx in the air. The NEC Directive requires that\r\nemissions from maritime shipping be quantified and reported. Emissions from national\r\nmaritime shipping and international shipping on inland waterways count towards\r\nthe NEC\u2019s national emission ceilings. However, other emissions from\r\ninternational maritime shipping do not count towards the ceilings, even though\r\nthey impact substantially on air quality in the EU. This exclusion is in view\r\nof the IMO\u2019s role in regulating these emissions. \u00a0For this reason the need to\r\nact externally on those emissions is explicitly recognised by Article 11 of the\r\nNEC Directive which states that \"To promote the achievement of the\r\nobjective set out in Article 1, the Commission and Member States, as\r\nappropriate, shall, without prejudice to Article 300 of the Treaty, pursue\r\nbilateral and multilateral cooperation with third countries and relevant\r\ninternational organisations such as the United Nations Economic Commission for\r\nEurope (UNECE), the International, Maritime Organization (IMO) and the\r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), including through the\r\nexchange of information, concerning technical and scientific research and development\r\nand with the aim of improving the basis for the facilitation of emission\r\nreductions\"\nMoreover, the Clean Air Quality Package[7], adopted by the\r\nCommission on 18 December 2013, confirms the shipping emissions' impact on air\r\nquality on land and the cost-effectiveness of further measures in this sector.\r\nNOx emissions from shipping are a direct contribution to eutrophication of inland\r\nand marine waters and terrestrial habitats, and to the formation of (secondary)\r\nparticulate matter affecting health. Thus failing to address this source would\r\nimpair the possibility for Baltic and North Sea riparian states to meet the\r\nobjectives set in the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC)[8], the Marine Strategy\r\nDirective (2008/56/EC)[9],\r\nthe Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC)[10]\r\nand the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC)[11]\r\nto limit adverse impacts on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems including from\r\neutrophication.\u00a0 It would likewise impair their possibility to meet the limit\r\nvalues for PM10 and PM2,5 of the Ambient Air Quality\r\nDirective 2008/50/EC set to protect human health.\nThe Tier III NOx emission standards, which\r\nare at issue in the present action, have not yet been the explicit subject of\r\nspecific Union legislation, but their current regulation under the IMO, in\r\naccordance with the 2008 Amendment of MARPOL Annex VI, is considered necessary\r\nand consistent with the overall agreed EU policy objectives. In particular, extending\r\nthe application date will undermine the scope for Member States to make use of\r\nNECAs for the purpose of addressing air pollution and its impacts.\nCouncil Decision\nArticle 218(9) TFEU is an appropriate legal\r\nbasis for the establishment of the EU position to be expressed at the meeting\r\nas it relates to acts having legal effects. The MEPC 66 decision on the date of\r\nentry into force of the Tier III NOx emission standards has a binding legal\r\neffect as it will determine a date from which the NOx Tier III standards will\r\napply in the areas designated as NECA to ships of all IMO's MARPOL Annex VI\r\nParties. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary\nIn view of the relevant EU policy and acquis\r\nreferred to above, the Commission considers that the issue covered by the above-cited\r\namendments expected to be adopted at MEPC 66 meeting is of EU relevance requiring\r\na common position to be taken by the EU, to be expressed by all Member States\r\nrepresented in the MEPC in the interest of the Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONCLUSION\nThe Commission therefore proposes a Council\r\nDecision on the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union for the amendments\r\ncited in para 2.1 above to be adopted at the 66th session of the\r\nMarine Environment Protection Committee.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n2014/0042 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted on behalf of\r\nthe European Union at the International Maritime Organization during the 66th\r\nsession of the Marine Environment Protection Committee on the adoption of\r\namendments to MARPOL Annex VI concerning the delay of the Tier III NOx emission\r\nstandards\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 192(1) and 218(9)\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The initial 2008\r\nAmendment of MARPOL Annex VI set a date of 2016 for the date of application of Tier\r\nIII NOx emission standards applying to ships built after that date and sailing\r\nthrough Nitrogen Oxide Emission Control Areas (NECAs)]\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The International Maritime\r\nOrganization Marine Environment Protection Committee at its 65th session in May\r\n2013 approved [draft] amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, Regulation 13, paragraph\r\n5.1. Those amendments are expected to be adopted in the 66th session of the\r\nMEPC, to be held from 31 March to 4 April 2014.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to the\r\nMARPOL Annex VI, regulation 13, paragraph 5.1 concerning the postponement of\r\nthe Tier III NOx emission standards will introduce a 5-year delay in their\r\nentry into force and will become binding upon the Parties to MARPOL Annex VI 6\r\nmonths after the date of its acceptance in accordance with Article 16,\r\nparagraph 2 of the MARPOL Convention. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Environmental protection,\r\nwhich is the subject-matter of the proposed measures, is in very large measure\r\nregulated by Union legislation. The EU has extensively exercised its competence\r\nin the area of air and water quality policy, both through legislation and\r\nagreed policy objectives. Current legislation covers a wide range of\r\npollutants, including Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) and a wide range of sources\r\nincluding all modes of transport. Directive 2000/60/EC establishing a framework\r\nfor Community action in the field of water policy[12], Directive 2008/56/EC establishing a framework for community action\r\nin the field of marine environmental policy[13],\r\nDirective 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna\r\nand flora[14]\r\nand Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds[15] set objectives to\r\nlimit adverse impacts on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems including from\r\neutrophication, of which NOx is a principle driver. Directive 2008/50/EC on\r\nambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe[16]\r\nsets limit and target values for particulate matter and ozone for which NOx is\r\na precursor.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2001/81/EC on\r\nNational Emission Ceilings[17]\r\nrequires that emissions from maritime shipping be quantified and reported,\r\nwhile recognising that regulation of emissions from international maritime\r\nshipping (other than in internal waters) is a matter for the IMO.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 11 in combination\r\nwith Article 1 of Directive 2001/81/EC requires the Commission and the Member States to pursue cooperation at international level with the aim of reducing\r\nemissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, including NOx. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the overall agreed\r\nEU policy objectives and acquis, the postponement of the Tier III NOx emission\r\nstandards to be adopted at MEPC 66 meeting is of EU relevance requiring a\r\ncommon position to be taken by the EU, to be expressed by all Member States\r\nrepresented in the MEPC in the interest of the Union.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union is neither a\r\nmember of the IMO nor a contracting party to the conventions and codes\r\nconcerned. It is therefore necessary for the Council to authorise Member States\r\nto express the position set out below, acting in the interest of the Union.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position of the Union at the 66th session of the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee shall be to oppose\r\nthe adoption of the amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, Regulation 13, paragraph 5.1\r\nas laid down in Annex 12 of the IMO document MEPC 65/22.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position of the Union\r\nas set out in paragraph 1 shall be expressed by the Member States, which are\r\nmembers of IMO, acting jointly in the interest of the Union.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minor changes to this\r\nposition may be agreed without requiring that position to be amended. \nArticle 2\nThis\r\nDecision is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2005) 446 final\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 242, 10.9.2002, p. 1\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A General Union Environmental action Programme,\r\n\"Living well, within the limits of our planet\", COM (2012)710 final.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2013)918 final\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 309, 27.11.2001, p.22\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 152, 11.6.2008, p.1\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All relevant documents are available at:\r\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/clean_air_policy.htm\n[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p.1\n[9]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 164, 25.6.2008, p.19\n[10]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 206, 22.7.92, p.7\n[11]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ 103, 25.4.79, p.1\n[12]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p.1\n[13]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 164, 25.6.2008. p.19\n[14]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 206, 22.7.92, p.7\n[15]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 103, 25.4.79, p.1\n[16]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 152, 11.6.2008, p.1\n[17]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 309, 27.11.2001, p.22\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
