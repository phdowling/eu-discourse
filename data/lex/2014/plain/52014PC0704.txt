There is no discretion to agree on a later date.\nIn particular near the end of the financial\r\nyear, and if the amounts at stake are very high, this may put Member States in\r\na difficult budgetary situation and may even imply a significant risk for their\r\neconomic or financial stability.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONTENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nTherefore, under the following\r\ncircumstances, where the global amount is exceptionally high, Member States\r\nshall have the possibility to make available the amount resulting from these\r\nadjustments (the VAT and GNI balances) at any moment between the first working\r\nday of December and the first working day of September of the following year:\n(a) Excess of the individual threshold: if\r\nthe amount of VAT- and GNI balances regarding any Member State exceeds two\r\nmonthly twelfths to be made available as VAT resources and the additional\r\nresource by that Member State, taking into account the effect on these\r\nresources of the correction granted to the United Kingdom for budgetary\r\nimbalances, according to current budgetary figures, or \n(b) Excess of the global threshold: if the\r\ntotal amount of adjustments regarding all Member States exceeds \u00a0half of the\r\nnormal twelfth to be made available as own resources based on VAT and GNI by\r\nall Member States, taking into account the effect on these resources of the\r\ncorrection granted to the United Kingdom for budgetary imbalances, according to\r\ncurrent budgetary figures.\nIn 2014, four Member States would be\r\nentitled to postpone the making available because the individual threshold\r\n(more than two normal twelfths) is exceeded. As for other years since 2002,\r\nonly in 2007 two Member States would have been entitled.\nNevertheless, as in 2014 also the global\r\nthreshold is exceeded (VAT and GNI balances for all Member States amount to 9.5\r\nbillion EUR, while half of a normal twelfth is less than 5 billion EUR), all\r\nMember States may postpone the making available of these balances.\u00a0 In all\r\nother years since 2004, except 2007, the global threshold was not exceeded.\nThis amendment shall already apply to the\r\nVAT and GNI balances to be entered in the Commission\u2019s accounts on the first\r\nworking day of December 2014.\nEach Member State who defers the making\r\navailable of the adjustments, fully or partly, should inform the Commission in\r\ngood time, and at any event before the first working day of December, of the\r\ndate or dates when the corresponding amounts will be made available. This date\r\nor dates are binding. Accordingly, any delay in\r\nmaking available the adjustments on the date or dates communicated to the\r\nCommission should give rise to interest under the conditions of Article 11 of\r\nRegulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000.\nRegulation (EC,\r\nEuratom) No 1150/2000 will be retroactively repealed by Regulation 609/2014[1] .Therefore,\r\nthe amendments made by this proposal would need to be taken into due\r\nconsideration in the context of the proposal to amend Regulation 609/2014,\r\nwhich the Commission has committed to present by the end of March 2015[2].\n2014/0332 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000\r\nimplementing Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom on the system of the European\r\nCommunities' own resources\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 322(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the\r\nEuropean Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[3],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Court of Auditors[4],\r\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 10(4)\r\nto (8) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000[5] the\r\nCommission should calculate and inform Member States of adjustments to the own\r\nresources referred to in Article 2(1)(b) and (c) of Council Decision\r\n2007/436/EC, Euratom on the system of the European Communities\u2019 own resources[6]\r\n(VAT resources and the GNI-based own resource hereafter referred to as the\r\nadditional resource), in time for them to enter these adjustments in the Commission\u2019s\r\naccount referred to in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 on\r\nthe first working day of December.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under exceptional\r\ncircumstances these adjustments may result in very high amounts which may\r\nexceed substantially, as regards some Member States, two monthly twelfths to be\r\nmade available as VAT resources and the additional resource, and in total, for\r\nall Member States, half of aggregate monthly twelfths.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For some Member States the\r\nobligation to make available such high amounts may represent a high financial\r\nburden which may cause a severe fiscal strain on the country, particularly\r\ntowards the end of the year.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore Member States should\r\nhave the possibility to postpone the making available of these amounts until\r\nthe first working day of September of the following year if certain conditions are\r\nmet.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any Member State which decides to apply this option should inform the Commission well in advance of the\r\nfirst working day of December of the date or dates of making available the\r\nadjustments, in order to allow an efficient management of the Union\u2019s cash\r\nrequirements. Any delay in making available those adjustments on the date or\r\ndates communicated to the Commission should give rise to interest under the\r\nconditions of Article 11 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This option should be\r\napplicable for the first time for adjustments which, pursuant to Regulation (EC,\r\nEuratom) no 1150/2000, would have to be entered in the Commission\u2019s accounts on\r\nthe first working day of December 2014.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC, Euratom)\r\nNo 1150/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 is\r\nhereby amended as follows:\nA new paragraph 7a is introduced in Article\r\n10:\n'7a. By way of derogation from paragraphs 4\r\nto 7 of this Article, a Member State may enter in the account referred to in\r\nArticle 9(1) of this Regulation amounts to be credited to the Commission\r\npursuant to these paragraphs until the first working day of September of the\r\nfollowing year, if one of the following conditions is fulfilled: \n(a)              \r\nif the Member State concerned would have to\r\nenter in the account referred to in Article 9(1) of this Regulation on the\r\nfirst working day of December an amount exceeding two twelfths of the total for\r\nthat Member State in the budget for VAT resources and the additional resource, as\r\nreferred to in paragraph 3, first subparagraph of this Article, as applicable\r\non 15 November of the same year, or\n(b)              \r\nif Member States in total would have to enter in\r\nthe account referred to in Article 9(1) of this Regulation on the first working\r\nday of December a total amount exceeding one half of a twelfth of the total in\r\nthe budget for VAT resources and the additional resource, as referred to in paragraph\r\n3, first subparagraph of this Article and applying the\r\nexchange rates defined in that subparagraph, as\r\napplicable on 15 November of the same year.\nMember States may only apply the first\r\nsubparagraph if they have informed the Commission before the first working day\r\nof December of their decision, and of the date or dates of entry of the amount of the adjustments in the account referred to in Article 9(1) of this\r\nRegulation.\nAny delay in entering\r\nthe amount of the adjustments in the account referred to in Article 9(1) of\r\nthis Regulation on the date or dates communicated to the Commission under the\r\nsecond subparagraph shall give rise to the payment of interest by the Member\r\nState concerned under the conditions of Article 11 of this Regulation.'\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the\r\nday following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union.\nIt shall apply to amounts to be entered into the accounts referred to in Article\r\n9(1) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 after 30 November 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGET LINES:\nChapter and Article: \nAmount budgeted for the year concerned: \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FINANCIAL IMPACT\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial implications\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a\r\nfinancial impact on revenue \u2013 the effect is as follows:\n(EUR\r\nmillion to one decimal place)\n   ||   || \n Budget line || Revenue[7]   || 12 month period, starting dd/mm/yyyy || [Year n] \n Article   || Impact on own resources ||   ||   \n Article   || Impact on own resources ||   ||   \n Situation following action \n   || [n+1] || [n+2] || [n+3] || [n+4] || [n+5] \n Article   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Article   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OTHER REMARKS\nThe amendments provide for the possibility for\r\nMember States to make available adjustments of VAT resources and the additional\r\nresource (chapters 31 and 32) in installments, provided their overall amount is\r\nexceptionally high (excess of individual or a global threshold).\nIf Member States make use of this possibility\r\nthis may lead in 2014 to own resources made available only in 2015.\nIt is difficult to predict in advance to what\r\nextent Member States would chose to defer payments.\nThresholds are very unlikely to be exceeded\r\neach year.
