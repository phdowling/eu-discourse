This Regulation focuses mainly on Atlantic and North Sea stocks. These\nfishing opportunities are usually amended several times during the period in\nwhich they are in effect. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot applicable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposed amendments seek to modify\nRegulation 43/2014 as described below.\nIn accordance with the procedure provided\nfor in the agreements or protocols on fisheries relations with Norway, Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Iceland, the Union held consultations on fishing rights\nwith those partners during 2013. The consultations with Iceland were not finalised. Consultations with Norway and the Faroe Islands were postponed\nto January 2014, so Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 included provisional fishing\nopportunities for those stocks affected by arrangements with Norway and the Faroe Islands. The consultations have been delayed and are yet to be concluded. Therefore,\nmost of the figures in this proposal are provisionally marked as pro memoria\n(pm); it will be necessary to update them as quickly as possible after the\nconsultations are finalised.\nNew fishing opportunities in the South\nPacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) were established\nfollowing the outcome of the 2nd annual meeting of the SPRFMO Commission held\non 27-31 January 2014. The provisional quotas included in Annex IJ of\nRegulation (EU) No 43/2014 for jack mackerel must now be modified accordingly.\nIn addition, SPRFMO redefined the specific area to which effort and catch\nceilings for bottom fisheries will apply as of 4 May 2014.\nFinally, this proposal caters for a number\nof errors identified in and clarifies certain points of Regulation (EU) No 43/2014.\nThese amendments are related to certain TAC entries (boarfish, cod, herring,\nanglerfish, and sole), the Western Channel sole effort management regime (Annex\nIIC) and a specific reporting obligation in the context of the Inter-American\nTropical Tuna Commission (IATTC).\n2014/0106 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 as\nregards certain fishing opportunities\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission[1],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation (EU) No 43/2014[2] the Council fixed, for\n2014, fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks\nin Union waters and, for Union vessels, in certain non-Union waters.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fishing opportunities for Union\nvessels in Norwegian and Faroese waters and for Norwegian and Faroese vessels\nin Union waters, and the conditions of access to each other\u2019s waters, are\nestablished each year following consultations on fishing rights held in\naccordance with the procedure provided for in the\nagreements or protocols on fisheries relations with Norway[3]\nand the Faroe Islands[4],\nrespectively. Pending the conclusion of those consultations on the arrangements\nfor 2014, Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 fixed provisional fishing opportunities\nfor the stocks concerned. On [date to be determined], the consultations\nwith Norway and the Faroe Islands were concluded and the arrangements for the\nfishing opportunities for 2014 established. Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 should\nbe amended accordingly.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its second annual\nmeeting in 2014, the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation\n(SPRFMO) adopted fishing opportunities consisting of a total allowable catch\n(\u201cTAC\u201d) for jack mackerel. SPRFMO also redefined the specific area to which catch\nand effort ceilings for bottom fisheries will apply from 4 May 2014 onwards. These\nprovisions should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to clarify\ncertain provisions concerning certain stocks, the Western Channel sole effort\nmanagement regime and a specific reporting obligation in the context of the\nInter-American Tropical Tuna Commission.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The catch limits and\neffort limits provided for in Regulation (EU) 43/2014 apply respectively from 1\nJanuary and 1 February 2014. The provisions of this Regulation concerning catch\nlimits and fishing effort should therefore also apply from those dates. Such\nretroactive application will be without prejudice to the principles of legal certainty\nand protection of legitimate expectations as the fishing opportunities\nconcerned have not yet been exhausted. However, the catch and effort limits for\nbottom fisheries in the area specified by SPRFMO should apply from 4 May 2014. Since\nthe modification of some catch limits and effort regimes have an influence on\nthe economic activities and the planning of the fishing season of Union vessels, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) No 43/2014\nRegulation (EU) No 43/2014 is amended as\nfollows:\n(1)                   \nIn Article 1, point 3 is deleted.\n(2)                   \nArticle 31 is replaced by the following:\n\u201cArticle 31\nBottom fisheries\nMember States with a\ntrack record in bottom fishing catch or effort in the SPRFMO Convention Area\nover the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006 shall limit their bottom fishing catch or effort in the Convention\nArea to those parts of the Convention Area where bottom fishing has occurred in\nthat period and to a level that does not exceed the annual average levels of\ncatches or effort parameters over the period from 1 January 2002 to 31\nDecember 2006.\u201d\n(3)                   \nIn Article 32(6), point (b) is replaced by the\nfollowing:\n\u201c(b)\u00a0\u00a0 report the information specified in paragraph\n(a) to the Member State of which they are nationals.
