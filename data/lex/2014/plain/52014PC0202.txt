The Commission outlined this policy aspect more extensively in\r\nits Communication of December 2006 \u2018on the general approach to enable\r\nEuropean Neighbourhood Policy partner countries to participate in Community\r\nagencies and Community programmes\u2019[1].\r\n\nThe Council endorsed this approach in its\r\nconclusions of 5 March 2007[2].\r\n\nBased upon this Communication and those\r\nconclusions, on 18 June 2007 the Council issued directives to the\r\nCommission to negotiate Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan,\r\nEgypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian\r\nAuthority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their\r\nparticipation in Community programmes[3].\r\n\nThe June 2007 European Council[4] reaffirmed the\r\nparamount importance of the ENP and endorsed a Presidency Progress Report[5] that had been submitted\r\nto the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) meeting on 18/19\r\nJune 2007 as well as the related Council Conclusions[6]. The report referred to\r\nthe Council directives for negotiating the relevant additional protocols. \nThe Joint Communication by the Commission\r\nand the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and\r\nSecurity Policy \u2018A new response to a changing Neighbourhood\u2019[7], endorsed by Council\r\nConclusions on 20 June 2011, further stressed the EU\u2019s intention to facilitate\r\npartner countries\u2019 participation in EU programmes.\nIn September 2011, the participants in the\r\nEastern Partnership\u2019s Warsaw Summit agreed to facilitate participation by\r\npartner countries in EU programmes and agencies.\nTo date, protocols have been signed with Armenia, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco and Ukraine. \nIn December 2013, Tunisia expressed its interest in participating in the broad range of programmes open to\r\npartner countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The text of the\r\nprotocol negotiated with Tunisia is attached. \nThe Commission herewith submits a proposal\r\nfor a Council Decision on the signing of the protocol. This protocol contains a\r\nFramework Agreement on the general principles for the participation of Tunisia in Union programmes. It contains standard clauses that are intended to be applied\r\nto all ENP partner countries with which such protocols are to be concluded. The\r\nnegotiated text also provides for the Parties to provisionally apply the\r\nprovisions of this protocol from the date of its signing.\nThe Commission is submitting a parallel\r\nproposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the protocol.\nThe Council is invited to adopt the\r\nfollowing proposed decision.\n2014/0117 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing and provisional\r\napplication, on behalf of the Union, of a Protocol to the Euro\u2011Mediterranean\r\nAgreement establishing an association between the European Communities and\r\ntheir Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Tunisia, of the other\r\npart, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of\r\nTunisia on the general principles for the participation of the Republic of\r\nTunisia in Union programmes\r\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 212\r\nin conjunction with Article 218(5) and (7) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 18 June 2007 the\r\nCouncil authorised the Commission to negotiate a protocol to the\r\nEuro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the\r\nEuropean Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the\r\nRepublic of Tunisia, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the\r\nEuropean Union and the Republic of Tunisia on the general principles for the\r\nparticipation of the Republic of Tunisia in Union programmes (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as \u2018the Protocol\u2019).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nnegotiations have been concluded.\n(3) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of the\r\nProtocol is to lay down the financial and technical rules enabling Tunisia to participate in certain Union programmes. The horizontal framework established by\r\nthe Protocol constitutes an economic, financial and technical cooperation\r\nmeasure which allows for access to assistance, in particular financial\r\nassistance, to be provided by the Union pursuant to the Union programmes. This\r\nframework applies only to those Union programmes for which the relevant\r\nconstitutive legal acts provide for the possibility of Tunisia\u2019s participation. The signing and provisional application of the Protocol therefore\r\ndoes not entail the exercise of powers under the various sectoral policies\r\npursued by the programmes, which are exercised when establishing the\r\nprogrammes.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Protocol should be\r\nsigned on behalf of the Union and it should be applied on a provisional basis\r\npending the completion of the procedures for its conclusion,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe signing on behalf of the Union of the Protocol to the\r\nEuro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European\r\nCommunities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of\r\nTunisia, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union\r\nand the Republic of Tunisia on the general principles for the participation of\r\nthe Republic of Tunisia in Union programmes (\u2018the Protocol\u2019) is hereby\r\nauthorised, subject to the conclusion of the said Protocol.\nThe text of the Protocol is attached to this Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe Council Secretariat-General shall\r\nestablish the instrument of full powers to sign the Protocol, subject to its\r\nconclusion, for the person(s) indicated by the negotiator. \nArticle 3\nThe Protocol shall be applied on a provisional basis from the date\r\nof its signing, in accordance with Article 10, pending the completion of\r\nthe procedures necessary for its conclusion.\nThe\r\ndate of signing the Protocol will be published in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union by the General Secretariat of the Council.\nArticle 4\nThe Commission is\r\nauthorised to determine, on behalf of the Community, the specific terms\r\nand conditions applicable to the participation of Tunisia in any given programme, including the financial contribution payable.
