The Joint\r\nUndertaking will also support the global leadership of the European rail\r\nindustry, thereby creating jobs and increasing exports. \nIn accordance with Articles 1(4) and 2(a)\r\nof Annex I to the S2R Regulation the Shift2Rail Joint Undertaking should\r\nestablish, develop and ensure the effective and efficient implementation of a\r\nMaster Plan. This Master Plan should be a forward-looking document defining the\r\npriority research and innovation activities to drive innovation in the rail\r\nsector in the long term.\nIn accordance with Article 1(3) of Annex I\r\nto the S2R Regulation, the Shift2Rail Master Plan should be structured around\r\nthe five following thematic areas or 'Innovation Programmes\u2019 (\u2018IPs\u2019):\n\u00b7                        \r\nIP1: Cost-efficient and Reliable Trains,\r\nincluding high capacity trains and high speed trains;
