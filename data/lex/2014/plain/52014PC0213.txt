These shortcomings relate to different actors: companies\u2019 and their\r\nboards, shareholders (institutional investors and asset managers) and proxy\r\nadvisors. Identified shortcomings related mainly to two problems: insufficient\r\nengagement of shareholders and lack of adequate transparency.\nStakeholders were\r\nconsulted on two Green Papers (\"Corporate governance in financial\r\ninstitution\"[2]\r\nand \"The EU corporate governance framework\"[3]) In\r\nrelation to what they considered to be the most important issues to be tackled\r\nat European level.\nBased on these\r\nconsultations and further analysis, the Commission's Action Plan: European\r\ncompany law and corporate governance - a modern legal framework for more\r\nengaged shareholders and sustainable companies[4] provides the Commission\u2019s roadmap in\r\nthe area, based the two objectives of enhancing transparency and engaging\r\nshareholders. This Action Plan announces a number of initiatives, amongst\r\nother, a potential revision of the Shareholder Rights Directive.\nAgainst this\r\nbackground, the overarching objective of the current proposal to revise the\r\nShareholder Rights Directive is to contribute to the long-term sustainability\r\nof EU companies, to create an attractive environment for shareholders and to\r\nenhance cross-border voting by improving the efficiency of the equity\r\ninvestment chain in order to contribute to growth, jobs creation and EU\r\ncompetitiveness. It also delivers on the commitment of the renewed strategy on\r\nthe long-term financing of the European economy[5]: it contributes to a more long-term\r\nperspective of shareholders which ensures better operating conditions for\r\nlisted companies.\nThis requires the\r\nrealisation of the following more specific objectives: 1) Increase the level\r\nand quality of engagement of asset owners and asset managers with their\r\ninvestee companies; 2) Create a better link between pay and performance of\r\ncompany directors; 3) Enhance transparency and shareholder oversight on related\r\nparty transactions; 4) Ensure reliability and quality of advice of proxy\r\nadvisors; 5) Facilitate transmission of cross-border information (including\r\nvoting) across the investment chain in particular through shareholder\r\nidentification.\nThis proposal is also\r\nconsistent with the existing regulatory framework. In particular, the new\r\nCapital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV package)[6] have, in\r\norder to tackle excessive risk taking, further strengthened the framework with\r\nregard to the requirements for the relationship between the variable (or bonus)\r\ncomponent of remuneration and the fixed component (or salary). These rules\r\napply to credit \u00a0institutions and investment firms, both listed and non-listed.\r\nThe rules in this proposal would however only be applicable to listed companies\r\nand aim at increasing transparency and ensuring that shareholders have a vote\r\non the remuneration policy and report. Existing rules regulating institutional\r\ninvestors and asset managers, for instance in the UCITS Directive[7], AIFM[8] and MIFID[9] are\r\nconsistent with this Directive.\nAt the date of adoption\r\nof this proposal the Commission also adopted a recommendation on the quality of\r\ncorporate governance reporting (\u2018comply or explain\u2019). The EU corporate\r\ngovernance framework is above all based on the comply or explain approach which\r\nallows Member States and companies to create a framework that is in line with\r\ntheir culture, traditions and needs. To support the good functioning of that\r\napproach the Commission adopted the recommendation. However, a number of\r\nelements of corporate governance should, in view of the cross-border relevance\r\nand importance be dealt with at European level in a more binding form to ensure\r\na harmonised approach across the EU (e.g. shareholder identification, the\r\ntransparency and engagement of institutional investors and board remuneration).\nThe proposed EU action\r\nprovides significant added value. Non-national shareholders hold some 44% of\r\nthe shares in EU listed companies. Most of these investors are institutional\r\ninvestors and asset managers. Only EU action can ensure that institutional\r\ninvestors and asset managers, but also intermediaries and proxy advisors from\r\nother Member States are subject to appropriate transparency and engagement\r\nrules. Moreover, a significant number of listed companies have activities in\r\nseveral EU Member States. Appropriate standards ensuring a well-functioning\r\ncorporate governance of these companies with a view to their long-term\r\nsustainability are thus in the interest not only of Member States where these\r\ncompanies are based but also of those Member States where they operate. Only\r\ncommon EU action can ensure such common standards. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\r\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of\r\nstakeholders and interested parties\nThe Commission held a\r\nnumber of public consultations that covered the different topics in this\r\nproposal. First, the 2010 Green Paper on corporate governance in financial\r\ninstitutions and remuneration policies and the 2011 Green Paper on the EU\r\ncorporate governance framework. Moreover, two consultation were held on legislation\r\non legal certainty of securities holding and dispositions which comprised\r\nquestions on shareholders identification and effective cross-border exchange of\r\ninformation, including voting, across the investment chain. Moreover, the\r\nCommission services have maintained regular and wide dialogues with\r\nstakeholders throughout the procedure leading to this proposal for amendment.\nIn its reflection on\r\nthe functioning of the European corporate governance framework the Commission\r\nhas benefited from the advice of the European Corporate Governance Forum.[10]\r\nAdditionally, the Commission sent a questionnaire to the Company Law Expert\r\nGroup which is composed of member State representatives.[11]\nFinally, some corporate\r\ngovernance problems have been discussed in the Green Paper on the long-term\r\nfinancing of the European economy[12]\r\nwhich has initiated a broad debate about how to foster the supply of long-term\r\nfinancing and how to improve and diversify the system of financial\r\nintermediation for long-term investment in Europe.\nStakeholders and\r\nrespondents overall expressed themselves in favour of increasing transparency\r\nas regards board remuneration and of granting shareholders a say on pay. They\r\nalso supported measures regarding monitoring of asset managers by asset owners,\r\nmore transparency from proxy advisors and reinforcing current rules on related\r\nparty transactions. They favoured disclosure of voting policies and records by\r\ninstitutional investors. Additionally, a strong call had been made to increase\r\nthe efficiency of the investment in transmitting information and facilitating\r\ncross-border voting by effective intermediary communication among themselves\r\nand with shareholders. Finally, clear support was shown for shareholder\r\nidentification.\nImpact assessment\nThe impact assessment\r\nundertaken by the Commission services identified five main issues: 1)\r\nInsufficient engagement of institutional investors and asset managers; 2)\r\nInsufficient link between pay and performance of directors; 3) Lack of\r\nshareholder oversight on related party transactions and 4) Inadequate\r\ntransparency of proxy advisors 5) Difficult and costly exercise of rights\r\nflowing from securities for investors.\nInsufficient\r\nengagement of institutional investors and asset managers\nThe financial crisis\r\nhas revealed that shareholders in many cases supported managers' excessive\r\nshort-term risk taking. Moreover, there is clear evidence that the current\r\nlevel of \u201cmonitoring\u201d of investee companies and engagement by institutional\r\ninvestors and asset managers is sub-optimal. Institutional investors and their\r\nasset managers do not sufficiently focus on the real (long-term) performance of\r\ncompanies, but often on share-price movements and the structure of capital\r\nmarket indexes, which leads to suboptimal return for the end beneficiaries of\r\ninstitutional investors and puts short-term pressure on companies. \nShort-termism appears\r\nto be rooted in a misalignment of interests between asset owners and asset\r\nmanagers. Even though large asset owners tend to have long-term interests as\r\ntheir liabilities are long-term, for the selection and evaluation of asset\r\nmanagers they often rely on benchmarks, such as market indexes. Moreover, the\r\nperformance of the asset manager is often evaluated on a quarterly basis. As a\r\nresult many asset managers\u2019 main concern has become their short term\r\nperformance relative to a benchmark or to other asset managers. Short-term\r\nincentives turn focus and resources away from making investments based on the\r\nfundamentals (strategy, performance and governance) and longer term perspectives,\r\nfrom evaluating the real value and longer-term value creative capacity of\r\ncompanies and increasing the value of the equity investments through\r\nshareholder engagement. \nInsufficient link\r\nbetween pay and performance of directors\nDirectors\u2019 remuneration plays a key role in aligning the interests of directors and shareholders\r\nand ensuring that the directors act in the best interest of the company. Shareholder control prevents directors from\r\napplying remuneration strategies\r\nwhich reward them personally, but that\r\nmay not contribute to\r\nthe long-term performance of the company. Several\r\nshortcomings have been detected in the current framework. First, the\r\ninformation disclosed by companies is not comprehensive, clear nor comparable.\r\nSecondly, shareholders often do not have sufficient tools to express their\r\nopinion on directors\u2019 remuneration. As a result, there is currently an\r\ninsufficient link between pay and performance of directors of listed companies.\nLack of\r\nshareholder oversight on related party transactions\nRelated party\r\ntransactions (RPTs), i.e. transactions between a company and its management,\r\ndirectors, controlling entities or shareholders, create the opportunity to obtain\r\nvalue belonging to the company to the detriment of shareholders, and in particular\r\nminority shareholders. Currently, shareholders do not have access to sufficient\r\ninformation ahead of the planned transaction and do not have adequate tools to\r\noppose to abusive transactions. As institutional investors and asset managers\r\nare in most cases minority shareholders, more control rights over RPTs would\r\nimprove their ability to protect their investments.\nInadequate\r\ntransparency of proxy advisors\nThe current equity\r\nmarket with its large number of (cross-border) holdings of shares and the complexity\r\nof the issues to be considered make the use of proxy advisors in many cases\r\ninevitable and thus proxy advisors have considerable influence on the voting\r\nbehaviour of these investors. Two shortcomings have been observed: 1) the\r\nmethodologies used by proxy advisors to make their recommendations do not\r\nalways sufficiently take into account local market and regulatory conditions\r\nand 2) proxy advisors provide services to issuers who may affect their\r\nindependence and ability to provide an objective and reliable advice.\nDifficult and\r\ncostly exercise of rights flowing from securities for investors\nInvestors face\r\ndifficulties in exercising the rights flowing from their securities, especially\r\nif the securities are held cross-border. In intermediated holding chains,\r\nespecially when they involve many intermediaries, information is not passed to\r\nshareholders from companies or shareholders' votes get lost. There is also a\r\ngreater likelihood of misuse of the voting rights by intermediaries. Three main\r\ncauses affect the systems: the lack of investor identification, a lack of\r\ntimely transmission of information and rights in the investment chain and price\r\ndiscriminations of cross-border holdings.\nOverall the described shortcomings\r\nlead to sub-optimal corporate governance and a risk of suboptimal and/or\r\nexcessively short-term focused managerial decisions which result in lost\r\npotential for better financial performance of listed companies and lost\r\npotential for cross-border investment.\nA range of options,\r\nincluding no policy change, have been considered to address each of the\r\npresented problems. In light of the careful assessment of these policy options,\r\nit appeared that the following preferred option would best fulfil the\r\nobjectives without imposing disproportionate burdens:\n1) Mandatory\r\ntransparency of institutional investors and asset managers on their voting and\r\nengagement and certain aspects of asset management arrangements;\n2) Disclosure of the\r\nremuneration policy and individual remunerations, combined with a shareholder\r\nvote;\n3) Additional\r\ntransparency and an independent opinion on more important related party\r\ntransactions and submission of the most substantial transactions to shareholder\r\napproval;\n4) Binding disclosure\r\nrequirements on the methodology and conflicts of interests of proxy advisors;\n5) Creating a framework\r\nto allow listed companies to identify their shareholders and requiring\r\nintermediaries to rapidly transmit information related to shareholders and to\r\nfacilitate the exercise of shareholder rights.\nFollowing an initial\r\nnegative opinion, the Impact Assessment Board adopted a positive opinion on the\r\nrevised Impact Assessment on 22 November 2013. It should be noted that the part\r\nof the impact assessment on shareholder identification, transmission of\r\ninformation and facilitation of the exercise of shareholder rights was\r\ninitially dealt with in a separate impact assessment that was cleared by the IAB and\r\nwas integrated only in the final impact assessment report at a later stage.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nLegal basis,\r\nsubsidiarity and proportionality\nThe proposal is based\r\non Article 50(2) (g) and 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion (TFEU) which is the legal basis\r\nfor Directive 2007/36/EC. Article\r\n50(2)(g) provides for the EU competence to act in the area of corporate\r\ngovernance. It provides in particular for coordination measures concerning the\r\nprotection of interests of companies\u2019 members and other stakeholders, such as\r\ncreditors, with a view to making such protection equivalent throughout the Union. Article 114 is the legal basis for the approximation of the\r\nprovisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member\r\nStates which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the\r\ninternal market.\nAccording to the\r\nprinciple of subsidiarity the EU should act only where it can provide better\r\nresults than intervention at Member State level and action should be limited to\r\nwhat is necessary and proportionate in order to attain the objectives of the\r\npolicy pursued. As regards this aspect it is important to note that there is\r\nstrong evidence that the EU equity market has to a very large extent become a\r\nEuropean/international market.\nIn view of the\r\ninternational nature of activities of institutional investors, asset managers\r\nand proxy advisors the objectives relating to engagement of these investors and\r\nthe reliability of the advice of proxy advisors cannot be sufficiently achieved\r\nby Member States. Action from Member States would only cover some of the\r\ninstitutions concerned and would most likely lead to different requirements,\r\nwhich could lead to an uneven level playing field on the internal market.\nOn the objectives to\r\nensure sufficient transparency and shareholder oversight on directors\u2019\r\nremuneration and related party transactions, the existing Member State rules in these areas are very different and as a result, they provide an uneven level of\r\ntransparency and protection for investors. In both cases, the result of the\r\ndivergence of rules is that investors are, in particular in case of\r\ncross-border investments, subject to difficulties and costs when they want to\r\nmonitor companies and engage with them, and have no effective tools to protect\r\ntheir investments.\nWithout EU norms, rules\r\nand their application would be different from Member State to Member State, which could be detrimental to the EU level playing field. Without action at EU\r\nlevel the problems are likely to persist and only partial and fragmented\r\nremedies are likely to be proposed at national level. It therefore results that\r\nthe objectives of this amendment are such that they cannot be fulfilled by\r\nunilateral action at the level of the Member States.\nTargeted further\r\ndevelopment of the EU legal framework for corporate governance would create a\r\nbetter framework for shareholder engagement. EU rules ensure that the same\r\ntransparency obligations will apply across the EU, which guarantees an EU level\r\nplaying field and facilitate cross-border investment. As one of the key\r\nunderlying problems is information asymmetry, this can only be dealt with\r\nthrough uniform transparency measures.\nHarmonisation of disclosure requirements at EU level would be\r\na remedy to asymmetry of\r\ninformation which is detrimental to shareholders and, therefore, plays a key\r\nrole for minimising agency costs. It would be beneficial for cross-border investment, since it would facilitate comparison of information\r\nand make engagement easier and thus less costly. Moreover, it would make\r\ncompanies more accountable to other stakeholders like employees. Common standards\r\nat EU level are necessary to promote a well-functioning internal market and\r\navoid the development of different rules and practices in the Member States.\nNevertheless, Member States should have a degree\r\nof flexibility as far as the transparency and information required in this\r\nproposal are concerned, in particular in order to allow the norms to adequately\r\nfit into the distinct corporate governance frameworks. To allow for such\r\nflexibility only some basic principles regarding shareholder identification,\r\ntransmission of information by intermediaries and facilitation of the exercise of\r\nrights should be ensured. Moreover, institutional investors and asset managers\r\nshould comply with certain of the obligations only on a comply or explain\r\nbasis, for remuneration of directors the provisions only ensure the necessary\r\ntransparency and a shareholders vote, while leaving the structure and level of\r\nremuneration to companies, while proxy advisors will only be subject to some\r\nbasic principles to ensure accuracy and reliability of their recommendations.\nTo this end, an amendment to the\r\nShareholders Right Directive is the most appropriate legal instrument as it\r\nallows a certain flexibility for Member States, while at the same time\r\nproviding the needed level of harmonization. Amending the Directive also\r\nensures that the content and form of the proposed EU action does not go beyond\r\nwhat is necessary and proportionate in order to achieve the regulatory\r\nobjective.\nIdentification of shareholders has\r\nan impact on fundamental rights recognised in particular in the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) and in the Charter of Fundamental\r\nRights of the European Union (Charter), notably the right to the protection of\r\npersonal data recognized in Article 16 TFEU and in Article 8 of the Charter. In\r\nview of this and of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil of 24 October 1995[13]it\r\nis necessary to strike a balance between the facilitation of the exercise of\r\nshareholders' rights and the right to privacy and the protection of personal\r\ndata. The identification information on shareholders is limited to the name and\r\ncontact details of the corresponding shareholders and can only be used for\r\nfacilitation of the exercise of shareholder rights.\nDetailed Explanation\r\nof the Proposal\nImproving engagement of institutional investors and asset\r\nmanagers\nArticles 3f until 3h will increase the transparency of\r\ninstitutional investors and asset managers. They will be required by these\r\narticles to develop a policy on shareholder engagement, which should contribute\r\nto managing actual or potential conflicts of interests with regard to\r\nshareholder engagement. They should in principle disclose to the public their\r\nengagement policy, how it has been\r\nimplemented and the results thereof.Where\r\ninstitutional investors or asset managers decide not to\r\ndevelop an engagement policy and/or decide not to disclose the implementation\r\nand results thereof, they shall\r\ngive a clear and reasoned explanation as to why this is the case. \nInstitutional investors will be required to disclose to the public how their equity\r\ninvestment strategy is aligned with the profile and duration of their\r\nliabilities and it contributes to the medium to long-term performance of their\r\nassets. Where they make use of an asset manager the institutional investor will\r\nhave to disclose to the public the main elements of the arrangement with the\r\nasset manager with regard to a number of important elements listed in the\r\narticle 3g. Where the arrangement with the asset manager does not contain such\r\nelements the institutional investor shall\r\ngive a clear and reasoned explanation as to why this is the case.\nAsset managers will be required to disclose on a half-yearly basis to institutional investors\r\nhow their investment strategy and implementation thereof is in accordance with\r\nthe arrangement and how the investment strategy and decisions contributes to\r\nmedium to long-term performance of the assets of the institutional investor.\r\nThey should moreover disclose to the institutional investor on a half-yearly\r\nbasis a number of important elements related to the execution of the\r\narrangement with the institutional investor.\nStrengthening\r\nthe link\r\nbetween pay and performance of directors\nThe\r\nproposal aims at creating more\r\ntransparency on remuneration policy and the actual remuneration awarded to\r\ndirectors and creating a better\r\nlink between pay and performance of directors by improving shareholder\r\noversight of directors\u2019 remuneration. The proposal does not regulate the level of\r\nremuneration and leaves decisions on this to companies and their shareholders.\nArticles 9a and 9b will require listed companies to publish detailed and\r\nuser-friendly information on the remuneration policy and on the individual\r\nremuneration of directors, and Article 9b empowers the Commission to provide\r\nfor a standardized presentation of some of this information in an implementing\r\nact. As is clarified in Article 9a\r\nparagraph 3 and 9b paragraph 1 all benefits of directors in whatever form will be\r\nincluded in the remuneration policy and report. The Articles give shareholders the right to approve the remuneration\r\npolicy and to vote on the remuneration report, which describes how the\r\nremuneration policy has been applied in the last year. Therefore, such report\r\nfacilitates the exercise of shareholder rights and ensures accountability of\r\ndirectors.\nBoard structures vary significantly between Member States.\r\nIn Member States with a two tier system the supervisory board plays a very\r\nimportant role and is responsible for the remuneration for the members of the\r\nmanagement board. This proposal would not affect the key role of the\r\nsupervisory board in two tier systems. It would still be the supervisory board\r\nthat would develop the remuneration policy to be submitted to shareholders for confirmation.\r\nMost importantly, it would still be for the board, on the basis of the policy, to\r\ndecide on the actual remuneration to be paid. The requirement of a shareholder\r\nvote will, in line with the general objectives of the proposal, increase the\r\nengagement that the board will seek with its shareholders.\nImproving shareholder oversight on related party\r\ntransactions\nThe new article 9c will require listed companies\r\nthat related party transactions\r\nrepresenting more than 5% of the companies\u2019 assets or transactions which can\r\nhave a significant impact on profits or turnover to submit these transactions\r\nto the approval of shareholders and may not unconditionally conclude it without\r\ntheir approval. For smaller related party transactions that represent more than\r\n1% of their assets, listed companies shall publicly announce such transactions\r\nat the time of the conclusion of the transaction, and accompany the\r\nannouncement by a report from an independent third party assessing whether\u00a0 the\r\ntransaction is on market terms and\r\nconfirming whether it is fair and reasonable from the perspective of the\r\nshareholders. In order to target only transactions that could\r\nbe most disadvantageous for minority shareholders and to keep administrative\r\nburden limited Member States should be allowed to exclude transactions entered\r\ninto between the company and members of its group that are fully owned by the\r\nlisted company. For the same reason, Member States should also be able to allow\r\ncompanies to request the advance approval by shareholders for certain clearly\r\ndefined types of recurrent transactions above 5 percent of the assets, and to\r\nrequest from shareholders an advance exemption from the obligation to produce\r\nan independent third party report for recurrent transactions above 1 percent of\r\nthe assets, under certain conditions. \u00a0According to the Impact\r\nassessment, the most significant costs would be linked to the fairness opinion\r\nby an independent advisor. However, depending on the complexity of the\r\ntransaction, an experienced advisor should be able to assess the fairness of\r\nthe given transaction within between approximately 5 and 10 hours. This could\r\nresult in a cost of maximum 2,500-5,000 \u20ac in case the opinion is made by an\r\nauditor.\nEnhancing transparency of proxy advisors\nArticle 3i will require\r\nproxy advisors to adopt and\r\nimplement adequate measures to guarantee that their voting recommendations are\r\naccurate and reliable, based on a thorough analysis of all the information that\r\nis available to them and are not\r\naffected by any existing or potential conflict of interest or business\r\nrelationship. Proxy advisors are\r\nrequired by this article to publicly disclose certain key information related\r\nto the preparation of their voting recommendations and, to their clients and\r\nthe listed companies concerned information on any actual or potential conflict\r\nof interest or business relationships that may influence the preparation of the\r\nvoting recommendations.\nFacilitating\r\nthe exercise of\r\nrights flowing from securities for investors\nArticles 3a \u00a0of the proposal requires Member\r\nStates to ensure that intermediaries offer to listed companies the possibility\r\nto have their shareholders identified. Intermediaries should, on the request of\r\nsuch a company communicate without undue delay the name and contact details of\r\nthe shareholders. Where there is more than one intermediary in a holding chain,\r\nthe request of the company and the identity and contact details of the\r\nshareholders shall be transmitted between intermediaries without undue delay. For\r\nlegal identities also their unique identifier, where available, should be\r\nshould be transmitted. Such identifier\r\nallows a legal person to be identified by a number that is unique\r\nat EU level. On international level the Legal Entity Identifier has been\r\nproposed by the Financial Stability\r\nBoard (FSB) and endorsed by the G20, to ensure consistent and comparable data.\r\nThis is a necessary component of this project making it easier to track\r\ncompanies in cross-border situations through centralised searches by electronic\r\nsystems. The Regulation on improving\r\nsecurities settlement in the European Union and on central securities\r\ndepositories (CSDs) and amending Directive 98/26/EC will ensure that the shares of listed companies shall be\r\nrepresented in book-entry form. In\r\norder to protect as much as possible the personal data of shareholders,\r\nintermediaries shall inform them that their name and contact details may be\r\ntransmitted for the purpose of identification, while the information may not\r\nuse this information for any other purpose than the facilitation of the\r\nexercise of the rights of the shareholder. Moreover, shareholders will be able\r\nto rectify or erase any incomplete or inaccurate data and the information\r\nshould not be conserved for longer than 24 months. \nArticle 3b provides\r\nthat if a listed company chooses not to directly communicate with its\r\nshareholders, the relevant information shall be transmitted to them by the\r\nintermediary. Listed companies are required to provide and deliver the\r\ninformation to the intermediary related to the exercise of rights flowing from\r\nshares in a standardised and timely manner. Where there is more than one\r\nintermediary in a holding chain, information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3\r\nshall be transmitted between intermediaries without undue delay.\nArticle 3c requires that intermediaries facilitate the\r\nexercise of the rights by the shareholder, including the right to participate\r\nand vote in general meetings and requires companies to confirm the votes cast\r\nin general meetings by or on behalf of shareholders. In case the intermediary\r\ncasts the vote, it shall transmit the voting confirmation to the shareholder. Articles\r\n3a until 3c empower the Commission to adopt implementing acts to ensure an\r\nefficient and effective system of shareholder identification, transmission of\r\ninformation and facilitation of exercise of shareholder rights.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\r\nIMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no\r\nimplications for the Union budget. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EXPLANATORY\r\nDOCUMENTS \nAccording to the Joint\r\nPolitical Declaration of 28 September \u00a02011, the Commission should only request\r\nexplanatory documents if it can \"justify on a case by case basis [\u2026] the\r\nneed for, and the proportionality of, providing such documents, taking into\r\naccount, in particular and respectively, the complexity of the directive and of\r\nits transposition, as well as the possible administrative burden\".\nThe Commission\r\nconsiders that in this particular case it is justified to ask Member States to\r\nprovide explanatory documents to the Commission due to the implementation\r\nchallenges that will arise in the context of this proposal. The proposal aims\r\nto regulate a number of aspects of corporate governance and would cover a\r\nnumber of different players in that area, such as listed companies,\r\ninstitutional investors and asset managers, proxy advisors and intermediaries.\r\nTherefore it is likely that the provisions of his Directive will be transposed\r\ninto several acts at national level.\nIn this context, the\r\nnotification of transposition measures will be essential to clarify the\r\nrelationship between the provisions of this Directive and national\r\ntransposition measures, and therefore to assess the conformity of national\r\nlegislation with the Directive.\nThe simple notification\r\nof individual transposition measures would not be self-explanatory and would\r\nnot allow the Commission to ensure that all the EU legal provisions were\r\nfaithfully and fully implemented. The explanatory documents are necessary to\r\nobtain a clear and comprehensive picture of the transposition. Member States\r\nare encouraged to present the explanatory documents in the form of easily\r\nreadable conformity tables.\nGiven the above, the\r\nfollowing recital is included in the proposed Directive: \"In accordance\r\nwith the Joint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission on\r\nexplanatory documents of 28 September 2011, Member States have undertaken to\r\naccompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures\r\nwith one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components\r\nof a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition\r\ninstruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the\r\ntransmission of such documents to be justified.\"\n2014/0121 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Directive 2007/36/EC as regards\r\nthe encouragement of long-term shareholder engagement and Directive 2013/34/EU\r\nas regards certain elements of the corporate governance statement\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN\r\nPARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular\r\nArticle 50 and 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the\r\nproposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of\r\nthe draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the\r\nopinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[14] \nAfter consulting the\r\nEuropean Data Protection Supervisor,\nActing in accordance\r\nwith the ordinary legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2007/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[15] establishes\r\nrequirements in relation to the exercise of certain shareholder rights\r\nattaching to voting shares in relation to general meetings of companies which\r\nhave their registered office in a Member State and whose shares are admitted to\r\ntrading on a regulated market situated or operating within a Member State.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nfinancial crisis has revealed that shareholders in many cases supported\r\nmanagers' excessive short-term risk taking. Moreover, there is clear evidence\r\nthat the current level of \u201cmonitoring\u201d of investee companies and engagement by\r\ninstitutional investors and asset managers is inadequate, which may lead to\r\nsuboptimal corporate governance and performance of listed companies.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the\r\nAction Plan on European company law and corporate governance[16] the Commission announced a number of actions in the area\r\nof corporate governance, in particular to encourage long-term shareholder engagement and to enhance transparency between companies and investors.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to further facilitate the exercise of shareholder rights and engagement\r\nbetween listed companies and shareholders, listed companies should have the possibility\r\nto have their shareholders identified and directly communicate with them.\r\nTherefore, this Directive should provide for a framework to ensure that\r\nshareholders can be identified. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\neffective exercise of their rights by shareholders depends to a large extent on\r\nthe efficiency of the chain of intermediaries maintaining securities accounts\r\nfor shareholders, especially in a cross-border context. This Directive aims at\r\nimproving the transmission of information by intermediaries through the equity\r\nholding chain to facilitate the exercise of shareholder rights.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nview of the important role of intermediaries they should be obliged to\r\nfacilitate the exercise of rights by the shareholder both when he would like to\r\nexercise these rights himself or wants to nominate a third person to do so.\r\nWhen the shareholder does not want to exercise the rights himself and has nominated\r\nthe intermediary as a third person, the latter should be obliged to exercise\r\nthese rights upon the explicit authorisation and instruction of the shareholder\r\nand for his benefit.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to promote equity investment throughout the Union and the exercise of\r\nrights related to shares, this Directive should prevent price discrimination of\r\ncross-border as opposed to purely domestic share holdings by means of better\r\ndisclosure of prices, fees and charges of services provided by intermediaries.\r\nThird country intermediaries which have established a branch in the Union should\r\nbe subject to the rules on shareholder identification, transmission of\r\ninformation, facilitation of shareholder rights and transparency of prices, fee\r\nand charges to ensure effective application of the provisions on shares held\r\nvia such intermediaries;\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effective\r\nand sustainable shareholder engagement is one of the cornerstones of listed\r\ncompanies\u2019 corporate governance model, which depends on checks and balances\r\nbetween the different organs and different stakeholders.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutional\r\ninvestors and asset managers are important shareholders of listed companies in\r\nthe Union and therefore can play an important role in the corporate governance\r\nof these companies, but also more generally with regard to the strategy and\r\nlong-term performance of these companies. However, the experience of the last\r\nyears has shown that institutional investors and asset managers often do not\r\nengage with companies in which they hold shares and evidence shows that capital\r\nmarkets exert pressure on companies to perform in the short term, which may\r\nlead to a suboptimal level of investments, for example in research and\r\ndevelopment to the detriment to long-term performance of both the companies and\r\nthe investor.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutional\r\ninvestors and asset managers are often not transparent about investment\r\nstrategies and their engagement policy and the implementation thereof. Public\r\ndisclosure of such information could have a positive impact on investor\r\nawareness, enable ultimate beneficiaries such as future pensioners optimise\r\ninvestment decisions, facilitate the dialogue between companies and their\r\nshareholders, encourage shareholder engagement and strengthen companies\u2019\r\naccountability to civil society.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore,\r\ninstitutional investors and asset managers should develop a policy on\r\nshareholder engagement, which determines, amongst others, how they integrate\r\nshareholder engagement in their investment strategy, monitor investee\r\ncompanies, conduct dialogues with investee companies and exercise voting\r\nrights. Such engagement policy should include policies to manage actual or\r\npotential conflicts of interests, such as the provision of financial services\r\nby the institutional investor or asset manager, or companies affiliated to\r\nthem, to the investee company.This policy, its implementation and the results thereof should be publicly disclosed on an annual\r\nbasis. Where institutional investors or asset managers decide not to\r\ndevelop an engagement policy and/or decide not to disclose the implementation\r\nand results thereof, they shall\r\ngive a clear and reasoned explanation as to why this is the case.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institutional\r\ninvestors should annually disclose to the public how their equity investment\r\nstrategy is aligned with the profile and duration of their liabilities and how\r\nit contributes to the medium to long-term performance of their assets. Where\r\nthey make use of asset managers, either through discretionary mandates\r\ninvolving the management of assets on an individual basis or through pooled\r\nfunds, they should disclose to the public the main elements of the arrangement\r\nwith the asset manager with regard to a number of issues, such as whether it\r\nincentivises the asset manager to align its investment strategy and decisions\r\nwith the profile and duration of the liabilities of the institutional investor,\r\nwhether it incentivises the asset manager to make investment decisions based on\r\nmedium to long-term company performance and to engage with companies, how it\r\nevaluates the asset managers performance, the structure of the consideration\r\nfor the asset management services and the targeted portfolio turnover. This\r\nwould contribute to a proper alignment of interests between the final\r\nbeneficiaries of institutional investors, the asset managers and the investee\r\ncompanies and potentially to the development of longer-term investment\r\nstrategies and longer-term relationships with investee companies involving\r\nshareholder engagement.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Asset\r\nmanagers should be required to disclose to institutional investors how their\r\ninvestment strategy and the implementation thereof is in accordance with the\r\nasset management arrangement and how the investment strategy and decisions\r\ncontributes to medium to long-term performance of the assets of the\r\ninstitutional investor. Moreover, they should disclose whether they make\r\ninvestment decisions on the basis of judgements about medium-to long-term\r\nperformance of the investee company, how their portfolio was composed and the\r\nportfolio turnover, actual or potential conflicts of interest and whether the\r\nasset manager uses proxy advisors for the purpose of their engagement\r\nactivities. This information would allow the institutional investor to better\r\nmonitor the asset manager, provide incentives for a proper alignment of\r\ninterests and for shareholder engagement.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to improve the information in the equity investment chain Member States\r\nshould ensure that proxy advisors\r\nadopt and implement adequate measures to guarantee that their voting\r\nrecommendations are accurate and reliable, based on a thorough analysis of all\r\nthe information that is available to them and are not affected by any existing or potential conflict of\r\ninterest or business relationship. They should disclose certain key information\r\nrelated to the preparation of their\r\nvoting recommendations and any actual or potential conflict of interest or\r\nbusiness relationships that may influence the preparation of the voting\r\nrecommendations.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\r\nremuneration is one of the key instruments for companies to align their interests\r\nand those of their directors and in view of the crucial role of directors in\r\ncompanies, it is important that the remuneration policy of companies is\r\ndetermined in an appropriate manner. Without prejudice to the provisions on\r\nremuneration of Directive\r\n2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council[17] listed companies and their shareholders should have the\r\npossibility to define the remuneration policy of the directors of their\r\ncompany.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure that shareholders have an effective say on the remuneration\r\npolicy, they should be granted the right to approve the remuneration policy, on\r\nthe basis of a clear, understandable and comprehensive overview of the\r\ncompany's remuneration policy, which should be aligned with the business strategy,\r\nobjectives, values and long-term interests of the company and should\r\nincorporate measures to avoid conflicts of interest. Companies should only pay\r\nremuneration to their directors in accordance with a remuneration policy that\r\nhas been approved by shareholders. The approved remuneration policy should be\r\npublicly disclosed without delay.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To\r\nensure that the implementation of the remuneration policy is in line with the\r\napproved policy, shareholders should be granted the right to vote on the\r\ncompany\u2019s remuneration report. In order to ensure accountability of directors the\r\nremuneration report should be clear and understandable and should provide a\r\ncomprehensive overview of the remuneration granted to individual directors in\r\nthe last financial year . Where the shareholders vote against the remuneration\r\nreport, the company should explain in the next remuneration report how the vote\r\nof the shareholders has been taken into account.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to provide shareholders easy access to all relevant corporate governance\r\ninformation the remuneration report should be part of the corporate governance\r\nstatement that listed companies should publish in accordance with article 20 of\r\nDirective 2013/34/EU of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013[18].\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transactions with related parties may cause\r\nprejudice to companies and their shareholders, as they may give the related\r\nparty the opportunity to appropriate value belonging to the company. Thus,\r\nadequate safeguards for the protection of shareholders\u2019 interests are of\r\nimportance. For this reason Member States should ensure that related party\r\ntransactions representing more than 5 % of the companies\u2019 assets or\r\ntransactions which can have a significant impact on profits or turnover should\r\nbe submitted to a vote by the shareholders in a general meeting. Where the\r\nrelated party transaction involves a shareholder, this shareholder should be\r\nexcluded from that vote. The company should not\r\nbe allowed to conclude the\r\ntransaction before the shareholders\u2019 approval of the transaction. For\r\ntransactions with related parties that represent more than 1% of their assets\r\ncompanies should publicly announce such transactions at the time of the\r\nconclusion of the transaction, and accompany the announcement by a report from\r\nan independent third party assessing\r\nwhether the transaction is on market terms and confirming that the transaction\r\nis fair and reasonable from the perspective of the shareholders, including\r\nminority shareholders. Member\r\nStates should be allowed to exclude transactions entered into between the\r\ncompany and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Member States should also be able to\r\nallow companies to request the advance approval by shareholders for certain\r\nclearly defined types of recurrent transactions above 5 percent of the assets,\r\nand to request from shareholders an advance exemption from the obligation to\r\nproduce an independent third party report for recurrent transactions above 1\r\npercent of the assets, under certain conditions, in order to facilitate the\r\nconclusion of such transactions by companies. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view\r\nof Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\r\nOctober 1995[19]it is necessary to strike a balance between the\r\nfacilitation of the exercise of shareholders' rights and the right to privacy and\r\nthe protection of personal data. The identification information on shareholders\r\nshould be limited to the name and contact details of the corresponding\r\nshareholders. This information should be accurate and kept up-to-date, and\r\nintermediaries as well as companies should allow for rectification or erasure\r\nof all incorrect or incomplete data. This identification information on\r\nshareholders should not be used for any other purpose than the facilitation of\r\nthe exercise of shareholder rights.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the provisions on\r\nshareholder identification, transmission of information, facilitation of the\r\nexercise of shareholder rights and the remuneration report, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council[20]\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the requirements set out\r\nin this Directive or the measures implementing this Directive are applied in\r\npractice, any infringement of those requirements should be subject to\r\npenalties. To that end, penalties should be sufficiently dissuasive and\r\nproportionate.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\r\nthe objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member\r\nStates in view of the international nature of the Union equity market and\r\naction by Member States alone is likely to result in different sets of rules,\r\nwhich may undermine or create new obstacles to the functioning of the internal\r\nmarket, the objectives can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be\r\nbetter achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance\r\nwith the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on\r\nEuropean Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out\r\nin that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order\r\nto achieve those objectives.'\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with the Joint Political Declaration of Member States and the\r\nCommission of 28 September 2011 on explanatory documents[21], Member\r\nStates have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of\r\ntheir transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the\r\nrelationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of\r\nnational transposition instruments.
