The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\r\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the\r\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and\r\nadministrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional\r\nand local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and\r\nproportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: Regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate because\r\nthe basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nUnion budget.\n2014/0001 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nof xx 2014\r\nrepealing the anti-dumping duty on imports of dicyandiamide originating in the\r\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2)\r\nof Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\r\ncountries not members of the European Community[1]\r\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Articles 11(2), 11(6) and 9 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) after consulting the Advisory Committee,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures in force\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council, following an\r\nanti-dumping investigation (\u2018the original investigation\u2019), imposed by\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1331/2007[2]\r\na definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of 1-cyanoguanidine (dicyandiamide)\r\noriginating in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u2018China\u2019 or \u2018the country\r\nconcerned\u2019) (\u2018the definitive anti-dumping measures\u2019). The measures took the\r\nform of an ad valorem duty at the level of 49,1 %.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Request for an expiry\r\nreview\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the publication\r\nof a notice of impending expiry of the definitive anti-dumping measures in\r\nforce[3],\r\nthe Commission received on 14 August 2012 a request for the initiation of an\r\nexpiry review of these measures pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic\r\nRegulation. The request was lodged by AlzChem AG (\u2018the applicant\u2019),\r\nrepresenting 100 % of the total Union production of dicyandiamide.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The application submitted\r\nwas based on the grounds that the expiry of the definitive anti-dumping\r\nmeasures would be likely to result in continuation of dumping and recurrence of\r\ninjury to the Union industry.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation of an expiry\r\nreview\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined, after\r\nconsulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed for the\r\ninitiation of an expiry review, the Commission announced on 15 November 2012,\r\nby a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union[4]\u00a0 (\u2018the Notice of\r\ninitiation\u2019), the initiation of an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of\r\nthe basic Regulation.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation\n1.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review investigation period\r\nand period considered\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ninvestigation of a continuation of dumping covered the period from 1 October\r\n2011 to 30 September 2012 (\u2018the review investigation period\u2019 or \u2018RIP\u2019). The\r\nexamination of the trends relevant for the assessment of the likelihood of recurrence\r\nof injury covered the period from 1 January 2009 to the end of the review\r\ninvestigation period (\u2018the period considered\u2019). \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure,\r\nthe applicant argued that the period considered should have started in 2008 because\r\n2009 would result in unrepresentative findings. It should firstly be noted that\r\nthe Commission enjoys a broad discretion when determining the period to be\r\ntaken into account for the purpose of verifying injury. Secondly, the applicant\r\nhas made this claim at a too late stage to change the period. The period\r\nconsidered was announced early in the process, but the applicant did not\r\ncontest it then. The period cannot be changed at such a late stage of the\r\nprocess for practical reasons and because a modification on the basis of the\r\ncollected evidence would be against the impartial conduct of an investigation. The\r\nclaim was, therefore, rejected. \n1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the\r\ninvestigation\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\r\nadvised the applicant, exporting producers in the country concerned, unrelated\r\nimporters, users in the Union known to be concerned, and the representatives of\r\nthe exporting country of the initiation of the expiry review. Interested\r\nparties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to\r\nrequest a hearing within the time limit set out in the Notice of initiation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the apparent\r\nlarge number of exporting producers in the country concerned and unrelated\r\nimporters, it was considered appropriate, in accordance with Article 17 of the\r\nbasic Regulation, to examine whether sampling should be used. In order to\r\nenable the Commission to decide whether sampling would be necessary and, if so,\r\nto select a sample, those parties were requested, pursuant to Article 17 of the\r\nbasic Regulation, to make themselves known within 15 days of the initiation of\r\nthe review and to provide the Commission with the information requested in the\r\nNotice of initiation.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Twelve\r\nknown exporting producers in China were contacted. As only one exporting producer from China came forward with the requested information it was not necessary to select a sample\r\nof exporting producers.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to importers, some\r\n10 unrelated importers of dicyandiamide in the Union were identified and invited\r\nto provide sampling information. Only two of them came forward and were willing\r\nto cooperate in the current review. Consequently, no sampling was necessary for\r\nunrelated importers.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sent\r\nquestionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to those who made\r\nthemselves known within the deadlines set in the Notice of initiation. Replies\r\nwere received from the Union producer, the co-operating exporting producer in China, two unrelated importers and one user in the Union. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Additional representations\r\nwere received from two unrelated importers/traders and three users in the Union. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sought and\r\nverified all the information it deemed necessary for a determination of the\r\nlikelihood of a continuation of dumping and likelihood of recurrence of injury\r\nand of the Union interest. Verification visits were carried out at the premises\r\nof the following interested parties:\na) Union producer:\n\u2013              \r\nAlzChem AG, Trostberg, Germany\nb) Exporting producer in China:\n\u2013              \r\nNingxia Jiafeng Chemicals Co., Ltd.

It is a solid substance in the form of a fine, white,\r\ncrystalline powder, usually odourless.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DCD is usually used as an\r\nintermediate to produce a broad range of other chemical intermediates, such as\r\npharmaceuticals, various industrial applications \u2014 water, pulp and paper,\r\ntextile, leather \u2014 and diverse fields of epoxy applications. It is a key\r\nelement of the nitrogen \u2014 carbon \u2014 nitrogen (NCN) chain, with niche end-products\r\nsuch as guanidine nitrate and other NCN derivatives.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the DCD sold on the\r\nUnion market is standard. Only a limited amount is of a smaller particle size (the\r\nso-called micro DCD). The co-operating Chinese exporting producer provided data\r\nfor the standard type only.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like product\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One user questioned whether\r\nUnion DCD and Chinese DCD were unlike products on the basis that the standard\r\ntype of DCD produced by the Union industry is, allegedly, of higher quality\r\nthan that produced by the Chinese exporting producers. In particular, this user\r\nclaimed that the water content of the Chinese DCD would be significantly higher\r\nand more volatile compared to the water content of the DCD produced in the Union. Moreover, Chinese DCD would also have a higher content of impurities.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As in the original\r\ninvestigation, the investigation showed, however, that while there may be\r\ncertain quality differences, these cannot be quantified and moreover, they do\r\nnot affect the basic chemical, physical and technical characteristics of DCD\r\nproduced and sold by the Union industry in the Union and the product concerned,\r\nwhich were found to be the same and to have the same end-uses.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another user argued that\r\nmicro DCD should be excluded from the product scope of the anti-dumping\r\nmeasures due to the alleged differences in physical characteristics, end-uses\r\nand prices from standard DCD. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed,\r\nhowever, that both types share the basic chemical, physical and technical\r\ncharacteristics. The further processing of standard DCD to produce micro DCD\r\ninvolves a straightforward physical process (milling), but no chemical\r\nprocessing. In addition, even though the prices of micro DCD are higher than\r\nthose of standard DCD, both types have the same basic end-uses and can normally\r\nbe interchanged.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation confirmed\r\nthat, as in the original investigation, the product concerned and the products\r\nmanufactured and sold on the domestic market in China, as well as those\r\nmanufactured and sold in the Union by the Union producer, have the same basic\r\nphysical and technical characteristics as well as the same uses and are,\r\ntherefore, considered to be like products within the meaning of Article 1(4) of\r\nthe basic Regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Likelihood of continuation\r\nof dumping\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n11(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether the expiry of the\r\nexisting measures would be likely to lead to a continuation of dumping.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital (9),\r\ndue to the fact that only one company co-operated, it was not necessary to\r\nselect a sample of exporting producers in China. This company covered more than\r\n35 % of the imports of product concerned from China to the Union during the RIP.\r\nThis company did not export during the IP of the original investigation and\r\ntherefore did not co-operate in the original investigation.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping\r\nof imports during the RIP\n3.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analogue country\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nprovisions of Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, normal value had to be\r\ndetermined on the basis of the prices or constructed value in an appropriate market\r\neconomy third country (the \u201canalogue country\u201d), or the price from such a third\r\ncountry to other countries, including the Union, or, where those are not\r\npossible, on any other reasonable basis, including the price actually paid or\r\npayable in the Union for the like product, duly adjusted if necessary to\r\ninclude a reasonable profit margin.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of\r\nproduction of the product concerned outside the Union and China, the Commission indicated in the Notice of initiation its intention to base the normal value,\r\non the prices actually paid or payable in the Union for the like product, as it\r\nwas also done in the original investigation. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The like product was sold\r\nby the Union industry in representative quantities. However, the Union\r\nindustry's domestic sales were loss-making, albeit close to break even.\r\nTherefore, the normal value was based on the Union industry's manufacturing\r\ncosts plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative costs (SGA)\r\nand profit. SGA and profit were determined using the same method as in the\r\noriginal investigation. Pursuant to Article 11(9), adjustments were made on the\r\nUnion industry's manufacturing costs so as to offset the additional transport\r\ncosts due to the physical separation between production units, no direct access\r\nto raw materials, which must be transported from remote production sites and\r\ndisposal of the by-product (black lime). These adjustments were also made in\r\nthe original investigation. \n3.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export price\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All export sales of the\r\ncooperating exporting producer to the Union were made directly to independent\r\ncustomers established in the Union. In accordance with Article 2(8) of the\r\nbasic Regulation the export price was established on the basis of the prices\r\nactually paid or payable.\n3.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison between\r\nnormal value and export price was made on an ex-works basis.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of ensuring\r\na fair comparison between the normal value and the export price of the\r\ncooperating exporting producer, and in accordance with Article 2(10) of the\r\nbasic Regulation, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made with regard\r\nto differences in transport, insurance, taxes and credit costs which affected\r\nprices and price comparability.\n3.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margin\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As provided for under\r\nArticle 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the dumping margin was established on\r\nthe basis of a comparison of the weighted average normal value with the\r\nweighted average export price.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the cooperating\r\nexporting producer this comparison showed the existence of dumping although significantly\r\nlower than the level of dumping established in the original investigation. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of imports\r\nshould measures be repealed\n3.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remark\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Further to the finding of\r\nthe existence of dumping during the RIP, the likelihood of continuation of\r\ndumping should measures be repealed was investigated and the following elements\r\nwere analysed: production capacity and spare capacity in China; \u00a0volume and\r\nprices of dumped imports from China; the attractiveness of the Union market in\r\nrelation to imports from China. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, it should\r\nbe noted that the cooperating exporting producer represented more than 30 % of\r\nthe total production of China during the RIP. \u00a0\n3.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production capacity and spare\r\ncapacity of the Chinese producers\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\r\nlittle public information is available about the Chinese DCD industry, conclusions\r\nin relation to spare capacity relied mainly on the information contained in the\r\nrequest for review and on information obtained from the single co-operating\r\nproducer, cross-checked where possible against publicly available information.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, it is\r\nassumed that total installed capacity in China increased between 2007 and 2012.\r\nActual production during the RIP was however limited to 80 000 tonnes,\r\nindicating that some spare capacity may be available. The Chinese installed\r\ncapacity during the RIP represents more than the global demand for DCD and\r\nspare capacity may represent more than the total Union consumption during the\r\nRIP while the domestic Chinese consumption during the RIP amounted only to 40 000\r\ntonnes, i.e. half of actual Chinese production.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In relation to spare\r\ncapacity, the information gathered on spot during the investigation shows that\r\nthe single co-operating producer, representing more than 20 % of the total installed\r\ncapacity of China in 2012, has been granted approval to expand its capacity by\r\n50 % in 2014. It is expected that this new capacity will, inter alia,\r\nfurther serve this producer\u2019s own production processes (captive use of DCD) and\r\nthe Chinese domestic market, which during the RIP absorbed around half of the\r\nDCD production of the single co-operating producer. Information obtained from the\r\nsingle co-operating producer showed that future investments in capacity will be\r\nused to supply, inter alia, the Chinese domestic market which is large\r\nand rapidly growing. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 China is thus in a position to produce large\r\nquantities for export, in particular because there are no indications that the\r\ndomestic market could absorb all the spare capacity. \u00a0\n3.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume and prices of dumped\r\nimports from China\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Eurostat and\r\nverified import data, the volume of imports from China sharply decreased when\r\nthe measures were introduced in 2007 and started increasing again slightly between\r\n2009 and the end of the RIP, but never reached the level of 2007. This is also\r\nreflected in the market share of the Chinese imports which dropped from 40-45 %\r\nin 2007 to 10-15 % in 2009 and reached again a level of 15-20% at the end of\r\nthe RIP, despite the increase in Chinese prices by 73 %. \n3.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the Union\r\nmarket\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The\r\nUnion market is a relatively large market reaching around 18% of the world\r\nconsumption of DCD but it is not necessarily the most attractive or the only\r\nattractive market in terms of sale segments and prices (see recital (74). Indeed,\r\nthe information available suggests that Chinese producers anticipate a growing\r\ndemand from the pharmaceutical industry, e.g. in India, that uses DCD for instance as an input for\r\nthe production of a diabetes medicine (metformin). Therefore, this new demand\r\nwill potentially be able to absorb a large part of Chinese spare capacity. Based on the above, it is considered that the Union market is not\r\nthe only attractive market for Chinese exporters.\n3.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion of the likelihood\r\nof continuation of dumping\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has\r\nconfirmed that Chinese imports continued to enter the Union market at dumped\r\nprices during the RIP. Given the continued dumping, the fact that the Union\r\nmarket is a large market which was quite interesting for the Chinese exporters in\r\nthe past, as well as the spare capacities available in China, going beyond the total Union consumption, it can be concluded there is a likelihood\r\nof continuation of dumping should measures be removed. It should however be\r\nnoted that the current level of dumping is significantly lower than the one\r\nestablished in the original investigation. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SITUATION iN THE UNION\r\nMARKET\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remark\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the analysis concerns\r\nonly one company, for reasons of confidentiality most indicators are given in\r\nindexed form or ranges.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union industry\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The production of the Union\r\nproducer AlzChem AG represents 100 % of the DCD produced in the Union.

Over the period considered it developed as follows: \nTable 1\n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RIP \n Union consumption (tonnes) || 11 042 || 13 712 || 14 338 || 14 146 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 124 || 130 || 128 \n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apart from the free market\r\nconsumption presented above, it is noted that over the period considered the\r\ncaptive use of DCD by the Union industry ranged between 10 and 20% of the Union\r\nproduction and developed as follows: \nTable 2\n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RIP \n Captive use - Index (2009=100) || 100 || 123 || 124 || 127 \n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports into the Union from\r\n  China\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bearing in mind that only\r\none exporter cooperated with the investigation, it was found that the Eurostat\r\ndata was the best information source for import volumes and prices. The\r\nEurostat data refers to EU27 and was cross-checked to other sources such as Chinese\r\nexports statistics, Article 14(6) database and co-operating importer/user data.\r\n\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deliveries of DCD from China were imported under two customs regimes. Under the normal regime both the normal\r\ncustoms tariff and the anti-dumping duty were payable. Under the inward\r\nprocessing regime none of these duties were payable because the material was\r\nused in the production of downstream products that were exported outside the Union. As shown in the table below, the inward processing regime covered around two thirds\r\nof imports in the RIP.\n4.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume and market share\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the imposition of\r\nthe anti-dumping measures in 2007, the volume of Chinese imports decreased\r\nsignificantly. Their overall market share was some 15-20 % during the RIP.\r\nNotwithstanding this, over the period considered the volume of imports under the\r\nnormal customs regime originating in China fluctuated, whereas Chinese imports\r\ncarried out under the inward processing relief more than doubled. Taking both\r\nregimes into account, import volumes increased over the period but they are\r\nwell below the levels seen prior to the imposition of measures (over 6 000\r\ntonnes).\nTable 3\n Imports from China || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RIP \n Volume of imports \u2013 normal regime (tonnes) || 881 || 1 251 || 1 781 || 730 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 142 || 202 || 83 \n Market share || \u00a05-10% || \u00a05-10% || \u00a010-15% || 5-10% \n Average import price \u2013 normal regime (EUR/tonne) || 1 218 || 1 267 || 1 826 || 2 101 \n Average import price \u2013 inward processing (EUR/tonne) || 1 677 || 1 463 || 1 674 || 2 069 \n Volume of imports \u2013 inward processing (tonnes) || 676 || 984 || 654 || 1 467 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 146 || 97 || 217 \n Market share \u2013 all regimes || 10-15% || 15-20% || 15-20% || 15-20% \n4.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Price\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As reflected in the table\r\nabove, over the period considered the prices of Chinese imports increased\r\nsubstantially. \n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry claimed\r\nthat the price development cannot be explained by the development of prices of\r\nthe main cost drivers, i.e. raw materials and energy costs.

The sales prices of the\r\nUnion industry were adjusted in particular for delivery costs and commissions\r\nto an ex-works level. The CIF prices of the exports from China were obtained from Eurostat and cross-checked with the Article 14(6) database and\r\nthey excluded those imports which were subject to inward processing. These CIF\r\nprices were adjusted to cover costs related to customs clearance, namely\r\ncustoms tariff and post-importation costs. Undercutting\r\nin respect of imports which were subject to inward processing is analysed in\r\nrecital (83).\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ncomparison showed that during the RIP the imports of the product concerned did\r\nnot undercut the Union industry\u2019s prices. \n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports into the Union from other third countries\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There were no major imports\r\nfrom other third countries.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the period considered\r\nthe volume of imports from the USA never held a market share of more than 2%.

Since 2009 the Union production capacity\r\nof DCD did not change. Over the period considered, the Union producer increased\r\nproduction largely because of increased demand on the Union market as\r\ndemonstrated at Table 1 above. \u00a0Since 2010 the Union producer has operated rather\r\nat full capacity.

As compared to the\r\noriginal investigation, the situation of the Union industry improved\r\nsignificantly - it was well on track of recovery from past dumping in\r\nparticular in terms of profitability, sales and market share.\n4.6.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion \n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even if some positive\r\ndevelopments referred to above are relatively recent, it is considered that the\r\nsituation of the Union industry improved significantly in the period considered.\r\nAll the financial indicators were positive or close to positive by the end of\r\nthe RIP. \n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The imposition of the anti-dumping\r\nmeasures in 2007 allowed the Union industry to steadily recover from the\r\ninjurious effects of the dumping, further exploiting its potential onto the\r\nUnion market and non-EU countries. The fact that the Union industry benefited\r\nfrom the measures is mostly illustrated by its high production levels, capacity\r\nutilisation and increased EU sales prices and profitability. During the RIP, no\r\nmaterial injury resulting from Chinese imports was taking place anymore. \n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, the\r\napplicant argued that the fact that in the framework of the original\r\ninvestigation certain injury indicators showed a positive trend did not prevent\r\nthe Commission from confirming the existence of material injury at the time.\r\nThe claim must be rejected. Regulation (EC) No 1331/2007 was a response to\r\ndifferent circumstances with namely a less profitable Union industry. Moreover,\r\nan expiry review completely differs from an investigation under Art. 5 basic\r\nRegulation. Whereas the latter focuses on whether the dumping causes injury to\r\nthe domestic industry, the former is a forward-looking exercise analysing what\r\nis likely to occur should the measures lapse. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Likelihood of Recurrence\r\nof Injury\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As demonstrated above, the\r\nUnion industry did not suffer material injury during the RIP. In accordance\r\nwith Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, it was therefore examined whether the\r\nexpiry of the measures in force would be likely to result in a recurrence of\r\ninjury.\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact of the spare\r\ncapacity in China \n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has\r\nrevealed that there are large production capacities in China (see recitals (34) to (37)). However, there are no reasonable grounds to conclude that the\r\nspare capacities in question are likely to lead to significant imports into the\r\n Union.\u00a0 \n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nUnion is one of many\r\nmarkets where the Chinese exporting producers sell. In terms of prices, data\r\nfrom the Union industry, the co-operating Chinese exporting producer and from\r\nthe Chinese export statistics confirm that several non-EU markets are at least\r\nas attractive as the Union one.\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As concerns the Union\r\nindustry export sales, these were often made at higher prices than those in the\r\n Union. Subsequent to disclosure, the applicant argued that its higher export\r\nprices had nothing to do with the relative attractiveness of such markets but\r\nshould rather be explained by the fact that these sales concerned small volumes\r\nsales only. This argument should be rejected as the EU industry\u2019s overall sales\r\nvolumes to export markets were still significant in the RIP (between 20 and 30%\r\nof the Union industry\u2019s production). It was also not substantiated that sales\r\ntransactions to customers were in significant lower volumes. \u00a0\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also\r\nstatistical data on Chinese export prices of DCD to the different markets do\r\nnot point at a distinguishing attractiveness of the EU market as compared to\r\nother export markets. Substantial spare capacity existed already during the RIP\r\nbut did not translate into an injurious pricing behaviour by the Chinese\r\nexporters. The fact that spare capacity will further increase is not in this\r\ncase an indication of a likelihood of recurring injury. India is, by far, the world\u2019s biggest market of\r\nDCD. Chinese export statistics show that Chinese sales volumes to the EU\r\nrepresented only around 10% of the sales volumes made to India and that Chinese average EU sale prices per tonne were rather equivalent to Chinese sales\r\nprices to India. In other words, the prevailing market prices in the important\r\nIndian market (which have increased over the period considered by 65% on\r\naverage) are equally interesting to the DCD producers. There is no indication\r\nthat spare capacities in China will translate into huge imports into the Union. For the time being it can be expected that at least part of such spare capacities\r\nwill not be used in the near future. This conclusion is based on the past\r\ndevelopments since data submitted by the applicant suggest that whereas between\r\n2008 and the RIP China increased its capacity by some 50%, it increased its\r\noverall production by some 20% only. Projections made by the applicant up to\r\n2016 demonstrate that Chinese capacities will be well in excess of global\r\ndemand and, therefore, will remain idle for the time being. The country-wide excess\r\ncapacity would be less if projections are made on the basis of sales data from the\r\nco-operating Chinese exporting producer. In any case, the fact that, different\r\nfrom the EU production, (see recital (55) above) Chinese DCD production is not part\r\nof a fully integrated production chain means that it is less costly to leave\r\ncapacities unused. \n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, certain growing demand\r\nin particular for the pharmaceutical industry in countries such as India (see recital (39)) will probably be able to absorb a further part of Chinese\r\novercapacity. Furthermore, the investigation concluded that AlzChem\u2019s DCD\r\nproducts were considered more attractive to EU users due to inter alia\r\ngeographical location and reliability of supply. This gives a certain advantage\r\nover Chinese producers in respect of key users in the EU which purchase\r\nsignificant amounts of DCD. Therefore, in view of this context, the large\r\nproduction capacities in China are not as such a reason to conclude that there\r\nis a likelihood of recurrence of injury. The mere fact\r\nthat the Union industry has lost share in terms of global production capacity cannot\r\noverturn such conclusion.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact of the projected market\r\ngrowth \n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties mentioned\r\nthe expected significant growth of the DCD market worldwide, mainly driven by\r\nwell-established applications in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industry. This\r\nis because of the increase in production of anti-diabetes medicine\r\npredominantly in India. This growth is already announced by the increase in EU\r\nconsumption in Table 1 above.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of the EU\r\nmarket, further growth is also expected but to a more limited degree. This is\r\nbecause a large pharmaceutical producer selling worldwide is located in the Union.\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, the\r\napplicant contested the extent of the growth. However, it is noted that its\r\nrepresentations are contradictory in this respect and that several sources\r\npoint at solid EU demand and a significant worldwide growth. Sales data from the\r\nco-operating Chinese exporting producer point at a rapidly increasing\r\nconsumption in the Chinese domestic market. Therefore, nothing on file could\r\nback that, as ultimately alleged by the applicant, demand is or will be flat.\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent to disclosure,\r\nthe applicant also emphasized that is had lost sales volumes and market share\r\non non-EU markets. In this respect, it should be noted that the EU industry has\r\nworked at almost full capacity with negligible stocks, while the EU consumption\r\nof DCD continued growing. Therefore, it is rather because of the fact that the\r\nEU industry had decided to focus more on the EU market without substantially\r\nincreasing its production capacity that it could not take full advantage of the\r\ngrowth in the other markets. This situation could change, however, if its\r\nexpansion plans materialise. It is therefore expected that even if import volumes\r\nof Chinese DCD into the Union increase in the near future, this would not automatically\r\nresult in a recurrence of injury. The Union industry will, like Chinese\r\nproducers, benefit from an increase in worldwide demand.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, as\r\nmentioned above the Union producer is very well rated in the market and appears\r\nto be the preferred supplier to several key customers, at least for certain DCD\r\napplications. The quality and reliability of its DCD products in the Union means\r\nthat it is able to secure large contracts with key EU customers and this\r\nsituation is expected to continue regardless of whether the measures are\r\nrepealed or not. Post disclosure, a significant EU user stated that it would\r\ncontinue to source the product covered by the proceeding from the Union\r\nindustry even if measures were repealed.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other considerations \n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nexplained at recitals (50) to (51) the Chinese import prices did not undercut\r\nthe prices of the Union industry during the RIP. Undercutting was not present\r\nin respect of the normal regime (around one third of import volumes). A very\r\nlow level of undercutting existed when the inward processing regime was also\r\ntaken into account (the other two thirds of imports during the RIP). This\r\nsituation differed from the substantial undercutting found in the original\r\ninvestigation and resulted from an overall gradual increase in import prices\r\nsince measures were imposed, although this increase did not occur steadily.\u00a0 In\r\nfact, the CIF EU border price of Chinese imports rose by 73% during the period\r\n2009 up to the end of the RIP. \n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EU industry has shown\r\nthat it remains competitive even in the absence of measures given its substantial\r\nexports (between 20 and 30% of production during the RIP) to non-EU countries\r\nwhere no measures are in force and where it has faced the Chinese competition\r\nwithout the support of anti-dumping measures. The decreasing export volume\r\ndepicted below has to be seen in conjunction with the increasing sales volume\r\ninto the Union and unchanged production capacity of the Union industry which\r\nhas in principle been fully utilized.\nTable 13\n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RIP \n Export volume - Index (2009=100) || 100 || 105 || 80 || 77 \n Export price (unrelated) - Index (2009=100) || 100 || 100 || 109 || 125 \n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prices of Chinese imports\r\nduring the 8 months following the RIP were also analysed in view of a\r\nsubmission made by the Union industry. The Union industry had submitted that severe\r\nprice pressure caused by Chinese imports had recommenced shortly after the RIP.\r\nBased on Article 6(1) in conjunction with Article 11(5) of the basic\r\nRegulation, information relating to a period subsequent to the RIP shall\r\nnormally not be taken into account. However, even if this information was to be\r\ntaken into account, at this stage no conclusions could be drawn from it as It is\r\nnot clear whether these changed prices, if confirmed, are of a lasting nature. For\r\ninstance although prices fell from the end of the RIP to May 2013 in June they\r\nrose again by 10%. \u00a0Given that these post RIP prices were still considerably\r\nhigher than those observed in the original investigation, the prospects that in\r\nthe nearer future they can significantly undermine the current situation of the\r\nUnion industry, which is not suffering from material injury, do not reach the\r\nlikelihood threshold. \n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, there is no\r\nindication that a repeal of the measures would have an impact on market prices in\r\nthe short-medium term. It should be noted that a big share of the DCD sold in\r\nthe Union is subject to contracts running for several years and for the user\r\nindustry a reliable and steady supply from a trusted producer seems to be of\r\nhigh importance. Moreover, two thirds of imports during the RIP were made under\r\nthe inward processing regime whereby no import or anti-dumping duties are\r\npayable. In summary, while it cannot be ruled out that some contracts will be\r\nrenegotiated and landed import prices may decrease, it is not likely that this\r\nwill occur to injurious levels if duties are repealed. \n5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on likelihood a recurrence\r\nof injury\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the foregoing,\r\nit is not likely that the Union industry, if measures were repealed, would have\r\nto decrease its sales and production volumes and/or prices of DCD to an extent\r\nsuch that its profitability and overall position would be materially affected. \n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the contrary, in view of\r\nthe world-wide growth in consumption, the Chinese import volumes and prices\r\nduring the RIP and the prices on other markets, it is expected that, in the absence\r\nof measures, the Union industry\u2019s DCD sales will continue to remain strong and\r\nalso to contribute positively to its DCD-chain and NCN-chain of activities.\n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry is\r\nexpected to remain at full capacity whether the measures are repealed or not.\r\nMoreover, the Union industry completed the preliminary work for an expansion\r\nprogramme this year. In autumn 2013 it agreed in principle to substantially\r\nincrease its DCD production capacity. The market, including important EU-based\r\ncustomers, welcomed this expansion plan[5].\r\nThe expansion plan suggests that the Union industry believes worldwide demand\r\nto be strong and that AlzChem should be benefitting from this growth.\n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even if the Union industry is\r\nsubject to some price pressure from Chinese imports in the near future, the\r\neffects in terms of prices and profitability are not expected to be major given\r\nthat the Union industry has a large market share, advantages in terms of\r\nquality and reliability of supply and the capability of securing large\r\ncontracts. They would therefore not meet a \"likelihood of injury\"\r\nthreshold within the meaning of Article 11.2 of the basic Regulation.\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission concludes\r\nthat there is no likelihood of recurrence of injury to the Union industry were\r\nthe existing measures to be repealed. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UNION INTEREST\n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As it has been concluded\r\nthat there is no likelihood of recurrence of injury, no findings on Union\r\ninterest are necessary.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 REPEAL OF ANTI-DUMPING\r\nMEASURES\n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All parties were informed\r\nof the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended\r\nto recommend that the existing measures be repealed. They were also granted a\r\nperiod to submit comments subsequent to that disclosure. The submissions and\r\ncomments were, where warranted, duly taken into consideration, but none could\r\nalter the conclusions set out above.\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from the above\r\nthat, as provided for by Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the\r\nanti-dumping measures applicable to imports of DCD originating in the China should be repealed and the proceeding terminated.\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given certain circumstances\r\ndescribed above, namely the existence of spare capacity in China and the possible existence of undercutting post RIP, the Commission will monitor the imports\r\nof the product concerned with a view to facilitating swift appropriate action\r\nshould the situation so require.
