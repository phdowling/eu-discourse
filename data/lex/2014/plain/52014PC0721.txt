The Budapest Convention has been adopted\r\nby the Diplomatic Conference organised jointly by the Central\r\nCommission for the Navigation of the Rhine and the Danube Commission in\r\ncollaboration with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.\nThe Budapest Convention, entered into force\r\non 1 April 2005, has proven to be a great success and contributes to the\r\ninternal market in the field of transport. It is\r\nintended to harmonize contractual and inland navigational standards among\r\nEuropean countries. Eleven of the Member States of\r\nthe Union, namely Belgium[1],\r\n Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia are already Contracting Parties to this Convention. Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom have indicated to the Commission that\r\nthey do not have inland waterways covered by the scope of the Budapest\r\nConvention. \nAustria and Poland have expressed on several occasions their interest in becoming Parties to the\r\nConvention; indeed their participation will foster the broad implementation of\r\nthis legal instrument with benefits for citizens and businesses.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe issue of the accession of Austria and Poland to the Budapest Convention has been discussed several times in the meetings of\r\nthe Working Party on Civil Law Matters (General Questions).\nEven those Member States which do not\r\nintend to become party to the Convention would support the Commission's\r\ninitiative aimed at allowing Austria and Poland to ratify or to accede to the\r\nBudapest Convention.\nThe present proposal was also strongly\r\npromoted by the European Associations representing the\r\ninland navigation industry (European Barge \u00a0Union and IVR-International Association for the representation of the mutual\r\ninterests of the inland shipping and the insurance and for keeping the register\r\nof inland vessels in Europe-).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 29 of the Budapest Convention\r\ncontains provisions on the choice of law by the parties to a contract of\r\ncarriage falling under the Convention. Those provisions affect the rules laid\r\ndown in Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 on the law applicable to contractual\r\nobligations (Rome I)[2].\r\nTherefore, the Budapest Convention is an agreement falling partly under\r\nexclusive European Union competence. Member States cannot ratify or accede to\r\nit without a Union authorization (Article 2(1) TFEU). \nThe Commission observes that Belgium has ratified the Budapest Convention on 5 August 2008, after the adoption and the\r\nentry into force of the Rome I Regulation on 24 July 2008. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to address the Union authorization also to Belgium, in order to\r\nrectify the current unlawful situation.\nThe Commission also notes that only some\r\nMember States have shown interest in being party to the Convention. Other\r\nMember States do not consider themselves to be concerned as they consider not\r\nhaving inland waterways which would be covered by the scope of the Budapest\r\nConvention. Moreover, the Convention does not provide for the possibility for\r\nthe Union to become a party and in any event the Commission does not intend at\r\nthis stage to propose to approve that the Union be bound by the Convention in\r\nany other way. \nThere is no uniform definition of inland\r\nwaterways in the EU legislation concerning inland navigation. The scope of\r\napplication of some directives or regulations with regard to waterways is\r\nregulated differently by each legal act. For example, Directive 2006/87/EC on\r\ntechnical requirements for inland waterway vessels[3] contains a list of\r\nwaterways to which the directive applies (Annex I). This list is based on\r\nnotifications from Member States which declare where the directive should be\r\napplicable on their territories. On the other hand, Directive 96/50/EC on the\r\nharmonization of the conditions for obtaining national boatmasters'\r\ncertificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterway in the\r\nCommunity[4]\r\nhas a different system for determining which waterways are covered by the scope\r\nof the directive. In principle the directive applies to all waterways in the EU\r\nwith the exemption of the Rhine and other water ways mentioned in Annex II to\r\nDirective 91/672/EEC.\nThe Union may exceptionally authorise one\r\nor several Member States to be party to the Convention. In this case the\r\nexclusive competence is limited to a single provision, and the authorisation does not constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the Union\u2019s external policy on judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters. The request of Austria and Poland is in particular justified since\r\nother Member States became a party to the Convention before Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 593/2008 was adopted. This authorization should be\r\nwithout prejudice to the exclusive competence of the Union, and tries to meet a\r\nvery specific situation. \nThe Council Decision shall be therefore\r\naddressed only to Austria, Belgium and Poland.\nUnder Article 30 of the Budapest\r\nConvention, Contracting States have the possibility to make declarations on the\r\nscope of application of the Convention. The Member States concerned may, when\r\nacceding to the Convention, make the appropriate declarations allowed under its\r\nprovisions which they deem necessary. The text of such declarations should be\r\nattached to the Council Decision. [\u2026]\n2014/0345 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nauthorising Austria, Belgium and Poland to ratify, or to accede to, the Budapest Convention on the Contract for the\r\nCarriage of Goods by Inland Waterways ( CMNI)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 2(1) and 81(2),\r\nin conjunction with point (a) of Article 218(6) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[5],\r\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union is working towards the establishment of a common judicial area\r\nbased on the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nBudapest Convention on the contract for the carriage of goods by inland\r\nwaterways (CMNI) (hereinafter \"the Budapest\r\nConvention\") is a valuable instrument to promote\r\ninland navigation across Europe. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union has exclusive\r\ncompetence at least with regard to Article 29 of the Budapest Convention on the\r\nContract for the Carriage of Goods by Inland Waterways (CMNI) in so far as\r\nthose provisions affect the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 593/2008\r\non the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I)[6].\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Budapest Convention is\r\nnot open to participation by regional economic integration organisations. As a\r\nresult, the Union is not in a position to become a Contracting Party to the\r\nBudapest Convention.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member States which\r\nhave navigable inland waterways coming in the scope of the Budapest Convention\r\nshould therefore be authorised to ratify or to accede to the Convention.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eleven of the\r\nMember States of the Union, namely Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia are Contracting Parties to the Budapest Convention.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Belgium has ratified the\r\nConvention on 5 August 2008, therefore after the adoption of the Rome I Regulation.\r\nIt is therefore necessary that the Council authorizes ex post Belgium to ratify the Budapest Convention.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Austria and Poland, which have navigable inland waterways coming in the scope of the Budapest\r\nConvention, expressed their interest in becoming Contracting Parties.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The remaining\r\nMember States of the Union indicated that they do not have inland\r\nwaterways covered by the Budapest Convention and thus they do not have an\r\ninterest in ratifying or acceding to the Convention.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The Budapest Convention\r\nprovides for a possibility for the Contracting States to make declarations with\r\nregard the scope of application of the Convention. Accordingly, Austria and Poland should, when acceding to the Convention, make the appropriate declarations\r\nallowed under its provisions which they deem necessary. The text of such\r\ndeclarations should be attached to this Decision.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The United Kingdom and Ireland are bound by Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of 17 June 2008 on the law\r\napplicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) and are therefore taking part in\r\nthe adoption of this Decision.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and\r\nis not bound by it or subject to its application. \nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1.

If the package or other\r\nshipping unit is a container and if there is no mention in the transport\r\ndocument of any package or shipping unit consolidated in the container, the\r\namount of 666.67 units of account\r\nshall be replaced by the amount of 1,500 units of account for the container without the goods it contains\r\nand, in addition, the amount of 25,000 units of account for the goods which are in the container.\n(2)                   \r\nWhere a container, pallet or similar article of\r\ntransport is used to consolidate goods, the packages or other shipping units\r\nenumerated in the transport document as packed in or on such article of\r\ntransport are deemed packages or shipping units. Except as aforesaid, the goods\r\nin or on such article of transport are deemed one shipping unit. In cases where\r\nthe article of transport itself has been lost or damaged, that article of\r\ntransport, if not owned or otherwise supplied by the carrier, is considered one\r\nseparate shipping unit.\n(3)                   \r\nIn the event of loss due to delay in delivery,\r\nthe carrier's liability shall not exceed the amount of the freight.

Where the carrier has no place\r\nof business on land and concludes the contract of carriage on board his vessel,\r\nit is to be presumed that the contract is most closely connected with the State\r\nin which the vessel is registered or whose flag it flies, if the port of\r\nloading or the place where the goods are taken over, or the port of discharge\r\nor the place of delivery or the shipper's principal place of business is also\r\nlocated in that State.\n(4)                   \r\nThe law of the State where the goods are located\r\ngoverns the real guarantee granted to the carrier for claims set out in article\r\n10, paragraph 1.\nCHAPTER IX\nDECLARATIONS\r\nCONCERNING THE SCOPE OF APPLICATION\nArticle 30\nCarriage by way of\r\nspecific inland waterways\n(1)                   \r\nEach State may, at the lime of signing this\r\nConvention or of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, declare that\r\nit will not apply this Convention to contracts relating to carriage by way of\r\nspecific inland waterways situated on its territory and to which international\r\nrules of navigation do not apply and which do not constitute a link between\r\nsuch international waterways.
