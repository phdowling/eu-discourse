Considerable research\r\nwork, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the\r\ncurrent rules.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For this reason a codification\r\nof rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to\r\nbe clear and transparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the Commission\r\ndecided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more\r\nthan ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that\r\ndepartments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for\r\nwhich they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and\r\nreadily understandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law\r\napplicable to a given matter at a given time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Codification must be undertaken\r\nin full compliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 625/2009 of 7 July 2009 on common rules for imports from certain third\r\ncountries[3]. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in\r\nit[4], fully preserving the\r\ncontent of the acts being codified. At the same time, it is also appropriate to\r\ndelete certain third countries from Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 625/2009, to\r\ncorrect an error contained in the act that amended that Regulation and to\r\nrepeal Regulation (EC) No 427/2003.\r\nTherefore, the proposal is being presented in the form of a recast.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The recast proposal was\r\ndrawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in\r\n22 official languages, of Regulation (EC) No 625/2009\r\nand the instrument amending it, carried out by the\r\nPublications Office of the European Union, by means of a data\u2011processing\r\nsystem. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation\r\nbetween the old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex IV\r\nto the recast Regulation.\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\n(adapted)\n2014/0168 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non common rules for imports from certain\r\nthird countries (recast)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00f2 new\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No 625/2009[6] has been substantially amended[7]. Since further amendments are to\r\nbe made, that Regulation\r\nshould be recast in the interests of clarity.\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\nrecital 2\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ncommon commercial policy should be based on uniform principles.\n\u00ea 625/2009 recital 5 (adapted)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Uniformity\r\nin the rules for imports should be \u00d6 assured \u00d5 by laying\r\ndown, as far as possible given the particular features of the economic system\r\nin the third countries in question, provisions similar to those applied under\r\nthe common rules for other third countries.\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\nrecital 6\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ncommon rules applicable to imports also apply to coal and steel products,\r\nwithout prejudice to any measures implementing an agreement relating\r\nspecifically to such products.\n\u00ea 625/2009 recital 7 (adapted)\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nliberalisation of imports, namely the absence of any quantitative restrictions,\r\nshould therefore form the starting point for the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 rules.\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\nrecital 8\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe case of some products, the Commission should examine import terms and\r\nconditions, import trends, the various aspects of the economic and commercial\r\nsituation, and the measures, if any, to be taken.\n\u00ea 625/2009 recital 9 (adapted)\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthose products, it may become apparent that there should be \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nover certain of these imports.\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\nrecital 10 (adapted)\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis for the Commission to adopt the safeguard measures \u00d6 required \u00d5 by the interests of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 with due\r\nregard for existing international obligations.\n\u00ea 625/2009 recital 11 (adapted)\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Surveillance\r\nor safeguard measures confined to one or more regions of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 may prove more\r\nsuitable than measures applying to the whole \u00d6 Union \u00d5 . However,\r\nsuch measures should be authorised only exceptionally and where no alternative\r\nexists. It is necessary to ensure that such measures are temporary and cause\r\nthe minimum of disruption to the operation of the internal market.\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\nrecital 12 (adapted)\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nis applied, release for free circulation of the products concerned should be\r\nmade subject to presentation of a surveillance document meeting uniform\r\ncriteria. That document should, on simple application by the importer, be\r\nissued by the authorities of the Member States within a certain period but\r\nwithout the importer thereby acquiring any right to import. The surveillance\r\ndocument should therefore be valid only during such period as the import rules\r\nremain unchanged.\n\u00ea 625/2009 recital 13 (adapted)\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe interests of good administrative management and to assist \u00d6 Union \u00d5 operators, the\r\ncontent and layout of the surveillance document should be aligned as far as possible\r\nwith the common import licence forms provided for in Commission Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 738/94[8], Commission Regulation (EC) No 3168/94[9], and Commission Regulation (EC) No 3169/94[10], bearing in mind the technical characteristics of the surveillance\r\ndocument.\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\nrecital 14 (adapted)\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis in the interests of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 that the Member States and the Commission should make as full as possible an exchange of information\r\nresulting from \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance.\n\u00ea 625/2009 recital 15\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis necessary to adopt precise criteria for assessing possible injury and to\r\nintroduce an investigation while still allowing the Commission to introduce\r\nappropriate measures in urgent cases.\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\nrecital 16 (adapted)\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To\r\nthis end, detailed provisions should be \u00d6 laid down \u00d5 on the opening of investigations, on the checks and inspections\r\nrequired, on the hearing of those concerned, the treatment of information\r\nobtained and the criteria for assessing injury.\n\u00ea 625/2009 recital 17 (adapted)\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nprovisions on investigations \u00d6 laid down\r\nin \u00d5 this\r\nRegulation \u00d6 are\r\nwithout \u00d5 prejudice \u00d6 to Union \u00d5 or national\r\nrules concerning professional secrecy.\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\nrecital 18\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis also necessary to set time-limits for the initiation of investigations and\r\nfor determinations as to whether, or not, measures are appropriate, with a view\r\nto ensuring that such determinations are made quickly, in order to increase\r\nlegal certainty for the economic operators concerned.\n\u00ea 625/2009 recital 19 (adapted)\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe interests of uniformity in rules for imports, the formalities to be carried\r\nout by importers should be \u00d6 simple \u00d5 and identical regardless of the place where the goods clear customs.\r\nIt is therefore desirable to provide that any formalities should be carried out\r\nusing forms corresponding to the specimen annexed to this Regulation.\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\nrecital 20 (adapted)\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Surveillance\r\ndocuments issued in connection with \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nmeasures should be valid throughout the \u00d6 Union \u00d5, irrespective\r\nof the Member State of issue.\n\u00ea 625/2009 recital 21 (adapted)\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ntextile products falling under Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94[11] are subject to specific treatment at \u00d6 Union \u00d5 and\r\ninternational levels. They should therefore be completely excluded from the\r\nscope of this Regulation.\n\u00f2 new\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The power to amend the list of third\r\ncountries in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 625/2009 was included\r\nin Council Regulation (EC) No 427/2003[12].\r\nSince the provisions of Title I of Regulation (EC) No 427/2003 on the\r\ntransitional product\u2011specific safeguard mechanism expired on 11 December 2013\r\nand the provisions of Title II of that Regulation are now obsolete, it is\r\nappropriate, in the interest of coherence, clarity and rationality, to\r\nincorporate Articles 14a and 14b of that Regulation into this Regulation. Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 427/2003 should therefore be repealed. \n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .9 (adapted)\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with\r\nArticle 290 of the Treaty for the purpose of amending Annex I to \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation, in\r\norder to remove countries from the list of third countries contained in that\r\nAnnex when they become members of the \u00d6 World Trade Organization \u00d5 (WTO).\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .20 (adapted)\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00d6 The \u00d5 implementation\r\n\u00d6 of this Regulation \u00d5 requires\r\nuniform conditions for adopting provisional and definitive safeguard measures,\r\nand for the imposition of prior surveillance measures. Those measures should be\r\nadopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[13].\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nadvisory procedure should be used for the adoption of surveillance and\r\nprovisional measures given the effects of such measures and their sequential\r\nlogic in relation to the adoption of definitive safeguard measures. Where a\r\ndelay in the imposition of measures would cause damage which would be difficult\r\nto repair, it is necessary to allow the Commission to adopt immediately\r\napplicable provisional measures.\n\u00f2 new\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Regulation (EC) No 625/2009\r\nwas amended, the second subparagraph of Article 18(2) was erroneously deleted.\r\nThat provision should be reinserted.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Armenia, Russia, Tajikistan and Vietnam have become members of the WTO, those third countries need to be deleted from\r\nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 625/2009 by means of a Commission\r\ndelegated act. In the interest of clarity and rationality, they are not\r\nincluded in the list of third countries now set out in Annex I to this\r\nRegulation,\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\n(adapted)\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\nArticle 1\n1. This Regulation applies to imports of\r\nproducts originating in the third countries referred to in Annex I, with\r\nthe exception of textile products covered by Regulation (EC) No 517/94.\n2. Imports into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 of the\r\nproducts referred to in paragraph 1 shall take place freely and so shall not be\r\nsubject to any quantitative restrictions, without prejudice to the measures\r\nwhich may be taken under Chapter V.\nCHAPTER II\n\u00d6 UNION \u00d5 INFORMATION AND CONSULTATION PROCEDURE\nArticle 2\nThe Commission\r\nshall be informed by the Member States if trends in imports appear to call for\r\nsurveillance or safeguard measures. This information shall contain the\r\navailable evidence on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 6.\r\nThe Commission shall pass on this information to all Member States forthwith.\nCHAPTER III\n\u00d6 UNION \u00d5 INVESTIGATION PROCEDURE\nArticle 3\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .20(3)\n1. Where it is apparent to the Commission\r\nthat there is sufficient evidence to justify an investigation, the Commission\r\nshall initiate an investigation within one month of the date of receipt of\r\ninformation from a Member State and publish a notice in the Official Journal\r\nof the European Union. That notice shall:\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\n(adapted)\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 give a summary of the information\r\nreceived, and \u00d6 require \u00d5 that all\r\nrelevant information is to be communicated to the Commission;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 state the period within which\r\ninterested parties may make known their views in writing and submit\r\ninformation, if such views and information are to be taken into account during\r\nthe investigation;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 state the period within which\r\ninterested parties may apply to be heard orally by the Commission in accordance\r\nwith paragraph 4.\nThe Commission shall commence the\r\ninvestigation, acting in cooperation with the Member States.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .20(3)\nThe Commission shall provide information to\r\nthe Member States concerning its analysis of the information normally within 21\r\ndays of the date on which the information is provided to the Commission.\n2. The Commission shall seek all\r\ninformation it deems necessary and, where it considers it appropriate,\r\nendeavour to check that information with importers, traders, agents, producers,\r\ntrade associations and organisations.\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\n(adapted)\nThe Commission shall be assisted in this\r\ntask by staff of the Member State on whose territory these checks are being\r\ncarried out, provided \u00d6 that \u00d5 this Member\r\nState so wishes.\nInterested parties which have made\r\nthemselves known in accordance with the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, as\r\nwell as the representatives of the exporting country, may inspect all\r\ninformation made available to the Commission within the framework of the\r\ninvestigation, as distinct from internal documents prepared by the authorities\r\nof the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or its Member\r\nStates, provided that it is relevant to the defence of their interests and not\r\nconfidential within the meaning of Article 5 and that it is used by the\r\nCommission in the investigation. To this end, they shall address a written\r\nrequest to the Commission indicating the information required.\n3. Member States shall supply the\r\nCommission, at its request and following procedures laid down by it, with the\r\ninformation at their disposal on developments in the market of the product\r\nbeing investigated.\n4. The Commission may hear the interested\r\nparties. Such parties must be heard where they have applied in writing within\r\nthe period laid down in the notice published in the Official Journal of\r\nthe European Union, showing that they are actually likely to be\r\naffected by the outcome of the investigations and that there are special\r\nreasons for them to be heard orally.\n5. Where information is not supplied within\r\nthe time-limits set by this Regulation or by the Commission \u00d6 pursuant\r\nto \u00d5 this\r\nRegulation, or the investigation is significantly impeded, findings may be made\r\non the basis of the facts available. Where the Commission finds that any\r\ninterested party or third party has supplied it with false or misleading\r\ninformation, it shall disregard the information and may make use of facts\r\navailable.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .20(3)\n6. Where it appears to the Commission that\r\nthere is insufficient evidence to justify an investigation, it shall inform the\r\nMember States of its decision within one month of the date of receipt of the\r\ninformation from the Member States.\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\n(adapted)\n\u00e81 37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .20(4)\nArticle 4\n1. At the end of the investigation, the\r\nCommission shall submit a report on the results to the Committee.\n\u00e81 2. Where the Commission considers, within nine\r\nmonths of the initiation of the investigation, that no Union surveillance or\r\nsafeguard measures are necessary, the investigation shall be terminated within\r\na month. The Commission shall terminate the investigation in accordance with\r\nthe advisory procedure referred to in Article 22(2). \u00e7 The decision\r\nto terminate the investigation, stating the main conclusions of the\r\ninvestigation and a summary of the reasons therefore, shall be published in the\r\nOfficial Journal of the European Union.\n3. If the Commission considers that \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nor safeguard measures are necessary, it shall take the necessary decisions in\r\naccordance with Chapters IV and V, no later than nine months from the\r\ninitiation of the investigation. In exceptional circumstances, this time-limit\r\nmay be extended by a further maximum period of two months. The Commission shall\r\nthen publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union\r\nsetting forth the duration of the extension and a summary of the reasons\r\ntherefore.\n4. The provisions of this Chapter shall not\r\npreclude the taking, at any time, of surveillance measures in accordance with\r\nArticles 7 to 12 or, where a critical situation, in which any delay would cause\r\ninjury which it would be difficult to remedy, calls for immediate intervention,\r\nsafeguard measures in accordance with Articles 13, 14 and 15.\nThe Commission shall immediately take the\r\ninvestigation measures it considers to be still necessary. The results of the\r\ninvestigation shall be used to re-examine the measures taken.\nArticle 5\n1. Information received \u00d6 pursuant to \u00d5 this Regulation shall be used only for the purpose for which it was\r\nrequested.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .20(5)\n2. The Commission and the Member States, including the officials of either, shall not reveal any information of a\r\nconfidential nature received pursuant to this Regulation, or any information\r\nprovided on a confidential basis, without specific permission from the supplier\r\nof such information.\n\u00ea 625/2009\r\n(adapted)\n3. Each request for confidentiality shall\r\nstate the reasons why the information is confidential.\nHowever, if it appears that a request for\r\nconfidentiality is unjustified and if the supplier of the information wishes\r\nneither to make it public nor to authorise its disclosure in general terms or\r\nin the form of a summary, the information concerned may be disregarded.\n4. Information shall in any case be\r\nconsidered to be confidential if its disclosure is likely to have a\r\nsignificantly adverse effect upon the supplier or the source of such\r\ninformation.\n5. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not preclude\r\nreference by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 authorities to\r\ngeneral information and in particular to reasons on which decisions taken in\r\npursuance of this Regulation are based. These authorities \u00d6 shall \u00d5, however, take\r\ninto account the legitimate interests of the legal and natural persons\r\nconcerned that their business secrets should not be divulged.\nArticle 6\n1. Examination of the trend in imports, of\r\nthe conditions in which they take place and of the serious injury or threat of\r\nserious injury to \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers\r\nresulting from such imports shall cover in particular the following factors:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the volume of imports, in\r\nparticular where there has been a significant increase, either in absolute\r\nterms or relative to production or consumption in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 ;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the price of the imports, in\r\nparticular where there has been a significant price undercutting as compared\r\nwith the price of a like product in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 ;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the consequent impact on the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 producers of\r\nsimilar or directly competitive products as indicated by trends in certain\r\neconomic factors such as:\n\u2013              \r\nproduction,\n\u2013              \r\n\u00d6 capacity \u00d5 utilisation,\n\u2013              \r\nstocks,\n\u2013              \r\nsales,\n\u2013              \r\nmarket share,\n\u2013              \r\nprices (i.e. depression of prices or prevention\r\nof price increases which would normally have occurred),\n\u2013              \r\nprofits,\n\u2013              \r\nreturn on capital employed,\n\u2013              \r\ncash flow,\n\u2013              \r\nemployment.\n2. In conducting the investigation, the\r\nCommission shall take account of the particular economic system of the\r\ncountries referred to in Annex I.\n3.
