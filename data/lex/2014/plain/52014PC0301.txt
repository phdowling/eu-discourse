An adaptation text to this effect has been\r\nincluded in the draft Joint Committee Decision (JCD). However, Norway intends to participate fully as of 1 January 2015 provided that the necessary\r\nbudgetary means are allocated. If so, a new draft JCD will be presented to the\r\nEU side, amending Article 5(8) of Protocol 31 by removing the adaptation text\r\nconcerning Norway.\nProtocol 31 to the EEA Agreement should\r\ntherefore be amended in order to allow for this extended cooperation to take\r\nplace from 1 January 2014.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF
