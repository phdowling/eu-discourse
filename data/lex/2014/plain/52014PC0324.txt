Denmark and the United Kingdom made use of their opt-out clauses\r\nand were not, therefore, assessed by the Council. Greece and Sweden were considered by the Council as Member States with a derogation. On 19 June 2000,\r\nthe Council decided that Greece fulfilled the necessary conditions to adopt the\r\neuro on 1 January 2001. The countries which joined the European Union on 1 May\r\n2004 (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia) became Member States with a derogation in accordance\r\nwith Article 4 of the respective Act of Accession. On 11 July 2006, the Council\r\ndecided that Slovenia fulfilled the necessary conditions to adopt the euro on 1\r\nJanuary 2007. Bulgaria and Romania, who joined the European Union on 1 January\r\n2007, became Member States with a derogation in accordance with Article 5 of\r\nthe respective Act of Accession. On 10 July 2007, the Council decided that Cyprus and Malta fulfilled the necessary conditions to adopt the euro on 1 January 2008. On 8 July\r\n2008, the Council decided that Slovakia fulfilled the necessary conditions for\r\nadopting the euro as of 1 January 2009. On 13 July 2010, the Council decided\r\nthat Estonia fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the euro as of 1\r\nJanuary 2011. Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 and became a Member State with a derogation in accordance with Article 5 of the Act of Accession. On 9\r\nJuly 2013, the Council decided that Latvia fulfilled the necessary conditions\r\nfor adopting the euro as of 1 January 2014.\nArticles 140(1) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union ('the Treaty') provides that at least once\r\nevery two years or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the\r\nCommission and the European Central Bank have to report to the Council on the\r\nprogress made in the fulfilment by Member States with a derogation of their\r\nobligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union. Based on\r\nits own report and that of the ECB, the Commission should submit to the Council\r\na proposal for a Council decision, in accordance to the procedure laid down in\r\nArticle 140(2) of the Treaty, to abrogate the derogation of the Member States\r\nfulfilling the necessary conditions.\nBoth the Commission and the ECB Convergence\r\nReports were released on 4 June 2014. The reports include an examination of the\r\ncompatibility between Lithuania's national legislation, including the statutes\r\nof its national central bank, with Articles 130 and 131 of the Treaty and the\r\nStatute of the ESCB and of the ECB. The reports also examine the achievement of\r\na high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment of the\r\nconvergence criteria and take account of several other factors required under\r\nthe final sub-paragraph of Article 140(1) of the Treaty.\nIn its Convergence Report, the Commission\r\nconcludes that Lithuania fulfils the conditions for the adoption of the euro.\nOn the basis of its report and that of the\r\nECB, the Commission has adopted the attached proposal for a Council decision to\r\nabrogate the derogation of Lithuania with effect from 1 January 2015.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nDiscussions with Member States on economic\r\npolicy challenges in Member States are held under various headings on a regular\r\nbasis in the Economic and Financial Committee and ECOFIN/Eurogroup. These\r\ninclude informal discussions on issues specifically relevant to the preparation\r\nof eventual euro area entry (incl. exchange rate policies). Dialogue with\r\nacademics and other interested groups takes place in the context of\r\nconferences/seminars and on an ad-hoc basis.\nEconomic developments in the euro area and\r\nthe Member States are assessed in the framework of the various procedures of\r\neconomic policy co-ordination and surveillance (notably under Art. 121 of the\r\nTreaty), as well as in the context of the Commission\u2019s regular monitoring and\r\nanalysis of country-specific and area-wide developments (incl. forecasts,\r\nregular publication series, input to EFC and ECOFIN/Eurogroup). In accordance\r\nwith the proportionality principle and in line with past practice, no formal\r\nimpact assessment was developed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe legal basis for the present proposal is\r\nArticle 140(2) of the Treaty, which lays down the procedure for a Council\r\ndecision on euro adoption and for abrogation of the derogation in the concerned\r\nMember States. \nThe Council shall act on a proposal from\r\nthe Commission, after consulting the European Parliament, after discussion in\r\nthe European Council and after having received a recommendation of a qualified\r\nmajority of those among its members representing Member States whose currency\r\nis the euro. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\nThe present initiative does not go beyond\r\nwhat is necessary to achieve its objective and, therefore, complies with the\r\nproportionality principle.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of the legal\r\ninstrument\nThe Decision instrument is the only\r\nappropriate legal instrument according to Article 140(2) of the Treaty. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implications for the\r\nbudget of the Union.\n2014/0170 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the adoption by Lithuania of the euro on 1 January 2015\r\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 140(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the report from the\r\nEuropean Commission[1],\nHaving regard to the report from the\r\nEuropean Central Bank[2],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament,\nHaving regard to the discussion in the\r\nEuropean Council, \nHaving regard to the recommendation of the\r\nmembers of the Council representing Member States whose currency is the euro,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The third stage of\r\neconomic and monetary union ('EMU') started on 1 January 1999. The Council,\r\nmeeting in Brussels on 3 May 1998 in the composition of Heads of State or\r\nGovernment, decided that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland fulfilled the necessary\r\nconditions for adopting the euro on 1 January 1999[3].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Decision 2000/427/EC[4] the Council decided\r\nthat Greece fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the euro on 1\r\nJanuary 2001. By Decision 2006/495/EC[5]\r\nthe Council decided that Slovenia fulfilled the necessary conditions for\r\nadopting the euro on 1 January 2007. By Decisions 2007/503/EC[6] and 2007/504/EC[7] the Council decided\r\nthat Cyprus and Malta fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the euro\r\non 1 January 2008. By decision 2008/608/EC[8]\r\nthe Council decided that Slovakia fulfilled the necessary conditions for\r\nadopting the euro. By decision 2010/416/EU[9]\r\nthe Council decided that Estonia fulfilled the necessary conditions for\r\nadopting the euro. By decision 2013/387/EU[10]\r\nthe Council decided that Latvia fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting\r\nthe euro.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to\r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland annexed to the Treaty\r\nestablishing the European Community ('EC Treaty'), the United Kingdom notified the Council that it did not intend to move to the third stage of\r\nEMU on 1 January 1999. This\r\nnotification has not been changed. In accordance with paragraph 1 of the\r\nProtocol on certain provisions relating to Denmark annexed to the EC Treaty and\r\nthe Decision taken by the Heads of State or Government in Edinburgh in December\r\n1992, Denmark has notified the Council that it will not participate in the\r\nthird stage of EMU. Denmark has not requested that the procedure referred to in\r\nArticle 140(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('the\r\nTreaty') be initiated.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\r\nvirtue of Decision 98/317/EC Sweden has a derogation as defined in Article 139(1)\r\nof the Treaty. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2003\r\nAct of Accession[11],\r\nthe Czech Republic, Lithuania, Hungary and Poland have a derogation as defined\r\nin Article 139(1) of the Treaty. In accordance with Article 5 of the 2005\r\nAct of Accession[12],\r\n Bulgaria and Romania have a derogation as defined in Article 139(1) of\r\nthe Treaty. In accordance with Article 5 of the Act of Accession[13], Croatia has a derogation as defined in Article 139(1) of the Treaty.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nEuropean Central Bank ('ECB') was\r\nestablished on 1 July 1998. The European Monetary System has been replaced by an exchange rate mechanism, the setting-up of\r\nwhich was agreed by a resolution\r\nof the European Council on the establishment of an exchange-rate mechanism in\r\nthe third stage of economic and monetary union of 16 June 1997[14]. The procedures for an\r\nexchange-rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union (ERM II)\r\nwere laid down in the Agreement of 16 March 2006 between the European Central\r\nBank and the national central banks of the Member States outside the euro area\r\nlaying down the operating procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in stage\r\nthree of economic and monetary union.[15]\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article\r\n140(2) of the Treaty lays down the\r\nprocedures for abrogation of the derogation of the Member States concerned. At least once every two\r\nyears, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the Commission\r\nand the ECB shall report to the Council in accordance with the procedure laid\r\ndown in Article 140(1) of the Treaty. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 National\r\nlegislation in the Member States including the statutes of national central\r\nbanks, is to be adapted as necessary with a view to ensuring compatibility with\r\nArticles 130 and 131 of the Treaty\r\nand the Statute of the European System of Central Banks\r\nand of the European Central Bank ('Statute of the ESCB and\r\nof the ECB'). The reports of the Commission and the ECB provide a detailed\r\nassessment of the compatibility of the legislation of Lithuania with Articles 130 and 131 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB and of the\r\nECB. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with Article 1 of the Protocol No 13 on the convergence criteria\r\nreferred to in Article 140 of the Treaty, the criterion on price stability\r\nreferred to in the first indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty means that a\r\nMember State has a price performance that is sustainable and an average rate of\r\ninflation, observed over a period of one year before the examination, that does not exceed by more than one\r\nand a half percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member\r\nStates in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criterion on price\r\nstability, inflation is measured by the harmonised indices of consumer prices\r\n(HICPs) defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95[16]. In order to assess\r\nthe price stability criterion a Member State's inflation is measured by the\r\npercentage change in the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices relative to\r\nthe arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices of the previous period. A\r\nreference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the inflation\r\nrates of the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability\r\nplus 1.5 percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission\r\nand the ECB. In the one-year period ending in April 2014, the inflation reference value was calculated to be 1.7 percent, with\r\nLatvia, Portugal and Ireland as the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability, with inflation rates of, respectively 0.1\r\npercent, 0.3 percent and 0.3 percent. It is warranted\r\nto exclude from the best performers Member States whose inflation rates could\r\nnot be seen as a meaningful benchmark for other Member States. Such outliers\r\nwere in the past identified in the 2004, 2010 and 2013 Convergence Reports. At\r\nthe current juncture, it is warranted to exclude Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus from the best performers[17].\r\nThey are replaced by Latvia, Portugal and Ireland, the Member States with the next-lowest average inflation rates, for the calculation of the reference\r\nvalue. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n2 of the Protocol No 13, the criterion on the government budgetary position\r\nreferred to in the second indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty shall mean\r\nthat at the time of the examination the Member State is not the subject of a Council\r\ndecision under Article 126(6) of the Treaty that an excessive deficit exists.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol No 13, the criterion on participation in the\r\nexchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System referred to in the\r\nthird indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has\r\nrespected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the\r\nexchange-rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System without severe\r\ntensions for at least the last two years before the examination. In particular,\r\nthe Member State must not have devalued its currency's bilateral central rate\r\nagainst the euro on its own initiative for the same period. Since 1 January\r\n1999 the ERM II provides the framework for assessing the fulfillment of the\r\nexchange rate criterion. In assessing the fulfillment of this criterion in\r\ntheir reports, the Commission and the ECB have examined the two-year period\r\nending on 15 May 2014.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol No 13, the criterion on the convergence of\r\ninterest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty\r\nmeans that, observed over a period\r\nof one year before the examination, a Member State has had an average nominal\r\nlong-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than two percentage points\r\nthat of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price\r\nstability. For the purpose of the\r\ncriteria on the convergence of interest rates, comparable interest rates on\r\n10-year benchmark government bonds were used. In order to assess the\r\nfulfillment of the interest-rate criterion a reference value calculated as the\r\nsimple arithmetic average of the nominal long-term interest rates of the three\r\nbest performing Member States in terms of price stability plus two percentage\r\npoints was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. The\r\nreference value is based on the long-term interest rates in Latvia (3.3 percent), Ireland (3.5 percent) and Portugal (5.9 percent) and in the one year period\r\nending in April 2014 was 6.2 percent. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with Article 5 of the Protocol No 13, the data used in the current\r\nassessment of the fulfillment of the convergence criteria will be provided by\r\nthe Commission. For the preparation of this proposal the Commission provided\r\ndata. Budgetary data were provided\r\nby the Commission after reporting by the Member States by 1 April 2014 in\r\naccordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009[18].\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the\r\nbasis of reports presented by the Commission and the ECB on the progress made\r\nin the fulfillment by Lithuania of its obligations regarding the achievement of\r\neconomic and monetary union, it is concluded that:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in Lithuania, national legislation,\r\nincluding the Statute of the national central bank, is compatible with Articles\r\n130 and 131 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 regarding the fulfillment by Lithuania of the convergence criteria mentioned in the four indents of Article 140(1)\r\nof the Treaty:\n\u2013              \r\nthe average inflation rate in Lithuania in the year ending in April 2014 stood at 0.6 percent, which is well below\r\nthe reference value, and it is likely to remain below the reference value in\r\nthe months ahead,\n\u2013              \r\nLithuania is not the\r\nsubject of a Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit, with a\r\nbudget deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP in 2013, \n\u2013              \r\nLithuania has been a\r\nmember of ERM II since 28 June 2004; upon ERM II entry, the authorities\r\nunilaterally commited to maintain the prevailing Currency Board within the\r\nmechanism. During the two years preceding this assessment, the litas exchange\r\nrate did not deviate from its central rate and it did not experience tensions,\n\u2013              \r\nin the year ending April 2014, the long-term\r\ninterest rate in Lithuania was, on average, 3.6 percent which is well below the\r\nreference value;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in the light of the assessment on\r\nlegal compatibility and on the fulfilment of the convergence criteria as well\r\nas the additional factors, Lithuania fulfils the necessary conditions for the\r\nadoption of the euro,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nLithuania fulfils\r\nthe necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro.
