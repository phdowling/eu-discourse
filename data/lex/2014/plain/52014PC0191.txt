At the end of the negotiations, a new draft protocol was\r\ninitialled by the negotiators on 19 December 2013. The new Protocol covers a\r\nperiod of four years from the date of the provisional application laid down in\r\nArticle 14, that being the date on which this new Protocol was signed.\nThe main purpose of the Protocol to the\r\nAgreement is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in S\u00e3o\r\nTom\u00e9an waters, in compliance with the best scientific opinions available and\r\nthe recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of\r\nAtlantic Tunas (ICCAT), within the limits of the available surplus. The\r\nCommission's negotiating position was based in part on the results of an\r\nex-post evaluation of the previous Protocol carried out by external experts.\nThe aim is also to strengthen cooperation\r\nbetween the European Union and the Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe\r\nwith a view to establishing a sustainable fisheries policy and sound\r\nexploitation of fisheries resources in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an fishing zone, in the\r\ninterests of both parties.\nThe Protocol provides for fishing\r\nopportunities in the following categories:\n28 tuna seiners\n6 surface longliners.\nThe method for allocating fishing\r\nopportunities among the Member States should be defined. The Commission\r\nproposes, on this basis, that the Council adopt the Regulation. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe interested parties were consulted\r\nduring the evaluation of the Protocol for the period 2011-14.
