It is\r\ntherefore proposed to confer implementing powers upon the Commission, in\r\naccordance with the examination procedure laid down in Article 5 of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 182/2011, with a view to adopting common quality standards and\r\nharmonising the content and periodicity of the quality reports. \n\u00b7      Streamlining of the European Statistical System\nRegulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil of 11 March 2009 on European statistics[4]\r\ndefined the European Statistical System (ESS) as the partnership between the Union\r\nstatistical authority, which is the Commission (Eurostat), and the national\r\nstatistical institutes (NSIs) and other national authorities responsible in\r\neach Member State for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics.\nThe European Statistical System Committee (ESSC), established by\r\nArticle 7 of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, is\r\nregarded as the umbrella committee within the ESS. It assists the Commission in\r\nexercising its implementing powers in certain statistical domains. These exclude the balance of payments,\r\ninternational trade in services and foreign direct investment. \nIn these domains, according to Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 184/2005,\r\nthe Balance of Payments Committee (BOP Committee) assists the Commission.\nThe Commission is proposing a new ESS\r\nstructure to improve coordination and partnership in a clear pyramid structure\r\nwithin the ESS, with the ESSC as the highest strategic body. One aspect of this\r\nstreamlining is to concentrate comitology powers in the hands of the ESSC. In\r\nFebruary 2012[5],\r\nthe ESSC supported this new approach.\nTherefore it is also proposed to amend\r\nRegulation (EC) No 184/2005 by replacing the references to the BOP committee\r\nby a reference to the ESSC. \n\u00b7        \r\nLegal basis\nArticle 338 (1) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union. \n\u00b7        \r\nChoice of instrument\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implications for the EU\r\nbudget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nNone\n\u00b7        \r\nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposed act concerns an EEA matter and\r\nshould therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n2014/0194 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 on\r\nCommunity statistics concerning balance of payments, international trade in\r\nservices and foreign direct investment as regards conferring of delegated and\r\nimplementing powers upon the Commission for the adoption of certain measures\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\r\nentry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\u201cthe Treaty\u201d),\r\nthe powers conferred upon the Commission should be aligned to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the adoption of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 182/2011 [6], the Commission has\r\ncommitted itself[7]\r\nto reviewing, in the light of the criteria laid down in the Treaty, legislative\r\nacts which currently contain references to the regulatory procedure with\r\nscrutiny. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should have\r\nthe power to adopt delegated acts under Article 290 of the TFEU to supplement\r\nor amend certain non-essential elements of particular legislative acts, notably\r\nto take account of economic, social and technical developments. The Commission\r\nshould ensure that these delegated acts do not impose a significant additional\r\nadministrative burden on Member States or on the respondent units.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 184/2005[8] concerning balance of\r\npayments (BOP), international trade in services (ITS) and foreign direct\r\ninvestment (FDI) contains references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny\r\nand should therefore be reviewed in the light of the criteria laid down in the\r\nTreaty.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of aligning\r\nRegulation (EC) No 184/2005\r\nto the new rules of the Treaty, implementing powers currently conferred upon the\r\nCommission should be provided for by conferring powers on the Commission to\r\nadopt delegated and implementing acts.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The power to adopt acts in\r\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission\r\nwhen, for reasons of economic and technical changes, data requirements need to\r\nbe updated, including submission deadlines as well as revisions, extensions and\r\neliminations of data flows set out in Annex I, and when the definitions set out\r\nin Annex II need to be updated. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is of particular\r\nimportance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its\r\npreparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and\r\ndrawing-up delegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission\r\nof relevant documents to the European Parliament and the Council.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 184/2005, implementing\r\npowers should be conferred on the Commission with a view to adopting common\r\nquality standards and harmonising the content and periodicity of the quality\r\nreports. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No\r\n182/2011.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Balance of\r\nPayments Committee (BOP Committee) referred to in Article 11 of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 184/2005 provide advice to and assist the Commission in exercising of\r\nits implementing powers.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the strategy for a\r\nnew European Statistical System (ESS) structure intended to improve coordination\r\nand partnership in a clear pyramid structure within the ESS, the European Statistical System\r\nCommittee (ESSC), established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009[9], should have an\r\nadvisory role and assist the Commission in exercising its implementing powers.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To that effect, Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 184/2005 should be amended with the references to the BOP Committeee being\r\nreplaced by a reference to the ESSC. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nexisting good operative cooperation between the National Central Banks (NCBs)\r\nand the National Statistical Institutes and between Eurostat and the European\r\nCentral Bank is an asset that should be continued and further developed in the\r\nlight of improving the overall harmonisation and quality of balance of payments\r\nstatistics, financial statistics, government finance statistics, macro-economic\r\nstatistics and national accounts. The NCBs would continue to be closely\r\ninvolved in the preparation of all the decisions related to BOP, ITS and FDI\r\nvia their participation in the relevant Commission expert group responsible for\r\nBOP, ITS and FDI. The strategic cooperation between the ESS and ESCB is\r\ncoordinated in the European Statistical Forum, established via a Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding on the cooperation between the members of the European\r\nStatistical System and the members of the European System of Central Banks[10] signed on 24\r\nApril 2013.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure legal certainty,\r\nprocedures for the adoption of measures which have been initiated but not\r\ncompleted before the entry into force of this Regulation should not be affected\r\nby this Regulation.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 184/2005\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 184/2005 is amended as follows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 2, the following\r\nparagraph is added:\n\u20183.
