Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the Commission\r\ndecided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more\r\nthan ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that\r\ndepartments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for\r\nwhich they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and\r\nreadily understandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law\r\napplicable to a given matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament,\r\nthe Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the\r\nfast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Regulation (EEC)\r\nNo 2843/72 of the Council of 19 December 1972 on the safeguard measures\r\nprovided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of   Iceland[3]. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in\r\nit[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by\r\nthe codification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was drawn up on the\r\nbasis of a preliminary consolidation, in 22 official languages, of Regulation (EEC) No 2843/72 and the\r\ninstruments amending it, carried out by the Publications Office of the European\r\nUnion, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have\r\nbeen given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is\r\nshown in a table set out in Annex II to the codified Regulation.\n\u00ea 2843/72\r\n(adapted)\n2014/0160 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the safeguard measures provided for in\r\nthe Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland (codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00ea \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\r\n(EEC) No 2843/72 of the Council[6]\r\nhas been substantially amended\r\nseveral times[7].
