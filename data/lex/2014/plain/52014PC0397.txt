In 2011, total waste production in the EU amounted to approximately\r\n2.5 billion tons. By way of example, only a limited share (40%) of the\r\nmunicipal waste generated in the Union was recycled, with the rest being\r\nlandfilled (37%) or incinerated (23%) of which around 500 million tons could\r\nhave been otherwise recycled or reused. The Union thus misses out on significant opportunities to improve resource\r\nefficiency and create a more circular economy leading to economic growth and\r\njobs which in turn would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and its dependency on\r\nimported raw materials. \nThe Union also faces an implementation gap\r\namongst its Member States. In 2011, while six Member States landfilled less\r\nthan 3% of their municipal waste, 18 lost resources by landfilling over 50%, with some exceeding 90% of landfilling. This\r\nshows large divergences in terms of waste management performances which need to\r\nbe redressed as a matter of urgency.\n1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for and objectives\r\nof the proposal\nRecent trends suggest that further progress\r\non resource efficiency is possible and that it can bring major economic and\r\nsocial benefits. Turning waste into a resource is an essential part of increasing\r\nresource efficiency and closing the loop in a circular economy.\nEuropean legislation and particularly the\r\nsetting of legally binding targets has been a key driver to improve waste\r\nmanagement practices, stimulate innovation in recycling, limit the use of\r\nlandfilling, and create incentives to change consumer behaviour. Taking waste\r\npolicy further can bring significant benefits coming from sustainable growth\r\nand job creation at relatively low cost, while contributing to a better\r\nenvironment.\nThis proposal responds to the legal\r\nobligation to review the waste management targets of three Directives:\r\nDirective 2008/98/EC on waste[1],\r\nDirective 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste[2],\r\nand Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste[3]. In doing so, it\r\naddresses the above-mentioned situation in line with the objectives of the\r\nResource Efficiency Roadmap[4]\r\nand the 7th Environment Action Programme[5], including full\r\nimplementation of the waste hierarchy[6]\r\nin all Member States, decline in absolute and per capita waste generation and the\r\ndevelopment of a comprehensive strategy to combat unnecessary food\r\nwaste, ensuring high quality recycling and the use of recycled waste as a\r\nmajor, reliable source of raw material for the Union, limiting energy recovery to\r\nnon-recyclable materials, and limiting landfilling to non-recoverable waste. It\r\nalso contributes to the implementation of the EU Raw Materials Initiative[7].\nIn addition, the proposal includes elements\r\nof simplification of the reporting requirements included in Directives 94/62/EC\r\non packaging and packaging waste, 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles[8], and 2006/66/EC on\r\nbatteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators[9].\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\r\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Studies\nThree main studies carried out over the\r\nlast two years underpinned the impact assessment and the legal proposal[10] by assessing the technological,\r\nsocio-economic and cost-benefit related to the implementation and further development\r\nof EU waste legislation.\n2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Internal consultation\nAn Impact Assessment Steering Group was\r\ncreated on 16 April 2012. The following DG\u2019s were invited to participate in 5\r\nmeetings of the Impact Assessment Steering Group: SG, ECFIN, ENTR, CLIMA, JRC, and\r\nESTAT. The Impact Assessment Steering Group followed the preparation of the\r\nImpact Assessment.\n2.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 External consultation\nAn indicative list of issues to be tackled\r\nwas developed by the Commission and the first interviews with key stakeholders\r\nstarted in February 2013. An online public consultation was launched in June\r\n2013, closing in September 2013 in line with the minimum standards for\r\nconsultation.\n670 responses were submitted, reflecting\r\nhigh public concern about the waste management situation in the EU and high\r\nexpectations for EU action in this area.\n2.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nAn impact assessment report and an\r\nexecutive summary are published together with the present proposal. The impact\r\nassessment evaluates the main environmental, social and economic impacts of\r\nvarious policy options to improve the waste management records in the EU.\r\nVarious levels of ambition are assessed and compared to a \"baseline\r\nscenario\" in order to identify the most appropriate instruments and\r\ntargets while minimizing costs and maximizing benefits.\nThe Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment Board\r\ndelivered a positive opinion on the impact assessment on 8 April 2014, while\r\nmaking a number of recommendations to fine-tune the report. The Board requested\r\nto further clarify the problem definition and the need for new mid-term\r\ntargets, strengthen the arguments in favour of a landfill ban from a\r\nsubsidiarity and proportionality point of view and of uniform targets for all\r\nMember States, and explain in more detail how the varying performances of\r\nMember States are taken into account in the proposal.\nFurther consideration of the policy options\r\nset out in the impact assessment has led to the conclusion that the combination of Options 2 and 3.7 will bring the following benefits:\r\n\n\u2013                        \r\nAdministrative burden reduction in particular\r\nfor small establishments or undertakings, simplification and better \u00a0implementation including by keeping\r\ntargets \u2018fit for purpose\u2019;\n\u2013                        \r\nJob creation \u2013 more than 180.000 direct jobs\r\ncould be created by 2030, most of them impossible to delocalize outside the EU;\r\n\n\u2013                        \r\nGHG emission reduction \u2013 around 443 millions of\r\ntons of GHG could be avoided between 2014 and 2030;\n\u2013                        \r\nPositive effects on the competitiveness of the\r\nEU waste management and recycling sectors as well as on the EU the\r\nmanufacturing sector (better EPR, reduced risks associated with raw material\r\naccess);\n\u2013                        \r\nReinjection into the EU economy of secondary raw\r\nmaterials which in turn will reduce the dependency of the EU on raw materials\r\nimports\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of the proposed\r\naction\nThe main amendments of\r\nthe proposal are: \n\u2013                        \r\nAlignment of definitions and removal of obsolete\r\nlegal requirements;\n\u2013                        \r\nSimplification and streamlining of reporting\r\nobligations;\n\u2013                        \r\nIntroduction of an Early Warning System for\r\nmonitoring compliance with the recycling targets;\n\u2013                        \r\nIntroduction of minimum operating conditions for\r\nExtended Producer Responsibility;\n\u2013                        \r\nIncrease of the preparing for re-use and\r\nrecycling target for municipal waste to 70% by 2030;\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u2013                        \r\nIncrease of the packaging waste re-use and recycling\r\ntargets;\n\u2013                        \r\nRestrict the landfilling of non-residual municipal\r\nwaste by 2030;\n\u2013                        \r\nAlignment to Articles 290 and 291 TFEU on\r\ndelegated and implementing acts.\nThe above would set the\r\nnecessary legal framework for Member States\u2019 policies and legislation to\r\ndevelop in the field of waste prevention and recycling. \n3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis and right to\r\nact\nThis Directive amends\r\nsix Directives addressing the management of different wastes. Four of these\r\nDirectives (Directive 2008/98/EC, Directive 1999/31/EC, Directive 2000/53/EC\r\nand Directive 2012/19/EU) were adopted on the basis of Article 192(1) TFUE,\r\nwhilst Directive 2006/66/EC was adopted on the basis of both Article 192(2) and\r\nArticle 114 TFUE and Directive 94/62/EC on the basis of Article 114 TFUE.\r\nTherefore, this Directive is based on Article 192(1) TFUE and on Article 114\r\nTFUE in relation to Article 2.\nArticle 11(2) of Directive\r\n2008/98/EC sets down a 50% target for preparing for re-use and recycling of\r\nhousehold and similar waste and a 70% target for preparing for re-use,\r\nrecycling and other material recovery of non-hazardous construction and\r\ndemolition waste by 2020. Pursuant to Article 11(4), by 31 December 2014 at the\r\nlatest, the Commission shall examine those targets with a view to, if\r\nnecessary, reinforcing them and considering the setting of targets for other\r\nwaste streams, taking into account the relevant environmental, economic and\r\nsocial impacts of setting the targets. According to Article 9(c), the\r\nCommission should set, by the end of 2014, waste prevention and decoupling\r\nobjectives for 2020, based on best available practices including, if necessary,\r\na revision of the indicators referred to in Article 29(4). Finally, pursuant to\r\nArticle 37(4), in the first report that intervenes by 12 December 2014, the\r\nCommission shall assess a number of measures including producer responsibility\r\nschemes for specific waste streams, targets, indicators and measures related to\r\nrecycling, as well as material and energy recovery operations that may\r\ncontribute to fulfilling the objectives set in Articles 1 and 4 more\r\neffectively.\nArticle 5(2) of Directive\r\n1999/31/EC sets down three targets for the diversion of biodegradable municipal\r\nwaste from landfills and bans the landfilling of certain waste streams. The\r\nlast target for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfills\r\nhas to be met by the Member States by 16 July 2016. Pursuant to Article 5(2),\r\nit shall be re-examined by 16 July 2014 with a view to confirming or amending\r\nit in order to ensure a high level of environmental protection and in light of\r\nthe practical experience gained by Member States in the pursuance of the two\r\nprevious targets.\nArticle 6(1) of Directive\r\n94/62/EC sets down targets for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste\r\nwhich, pursuant to Article 6(5), shall be fixed every five years based on the\r\npractical experience gained in Member States and the findings of scientific\r\nresearch and evaluation techniques such as life-cycle assessments and\r\ncost-benefit analysis.\n3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality principle\nThe proposal is in\r\nconformity with the subsidiarity and proportionality principle set out in\r\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on the European Union. It is limited to amending the abovementioned\r\nDirectives by providing a framework establishing shared objectives, while\r\nleaving Member States free to decide about precise implementation methods.\n3.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Explanatory documents\nThe Commission\r\nconsiders that explanatory documents are necessary in order to improve the\r\nquality of information on the transposition of the Directive for the following\r\nreasons.\nWaste legislation is\r\noften transposed in a highly decentralised manner in the Member States,\r\nincluding on the regional or local level and in multiple legal acts, depending\r\non the administrative structure of a Member State. As a result, in transposing\r\nthe amended Directives Member States may have to amend a wide variety of\r\nlegislative acts at national, regional and local levels.\nThis Directive amends six\r\ndifferent waste Directives and affects an important number of legally binding\r\nobligations, including a comprehensive amendment of the targets contained in\r\nthe Waste Framework Directive, the Landfill Directive, and the Packaging\r\nDirective and a simplification of the WEEE, ELV and Batteries Directives. This\r\nis a complex review of waste legislation that will potentially affect a number\r\nof pieces of national legislation.\nThe revised targets for\r\nwaste management contained in the amended Directives are inter-connected, and\r\nas such should be carefully transposed into national legislation and later on incorporated\r\ninto the national waste management systems.\nThe provisions of the\r\namended Directives will affect a wide range of private and public stakeholders\r\nin the Member States and will have an important impact on planned investments\r\nand future infrastructures in the waste management systems. The complete and\r\ncorrect transposition of the amended Directives is essential to guarantee that their\r\nobjectives (i.e. protecting human health and the environment, increased\r\nresource efficiency, and ensuring the functioning of the internal market and\r\navoiding obstacles to trade and restriction of competition within the EU) are\r\nachieved.\nThe above factors are\r\nlikely to increase the risks of incorrect transposition and implementation of\r\nthe Directive, and complicate the Commission\u2019s task of monitoring the\r\napplication of EU law. Clear information with respect to the transposition of\r\nthe revised waste Directives is instrumental in ensuring the conformity of\r\nnational legislation with their provisions.\nThe requirement to\r\nprovide explanatory documents may create an additional administrative burden on\r\nsome Member States. However, explanatory documents are necessary to allow\r\neffective verification of complete and correct transposition, which is\r\nessential for the reasons mentioned above, and there are no less burdensome\r\nmeasures to allow efficient verification. Moreover, the explanatory documents\r\ncan contribute significantly to reducing the administrative burden of\r\ncompliance monitoring by the Commission; without them, considerable resources\r\nand numerous contacts with national authorities would be required to track the\r\nmethods of transposition in all Member States. Hence, the possible additional\r\nadministrative burden of providing explanatory documents is proportionate to\r\nthe aim pursued, namely to ensure effective transposition and fully achieve the\r\nobjectives of the revised Directives.\nIn view of the above it\r\nis appropriate to ask Member States to accompany the notification of their\r\ntransposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship\r\nbetween the provisions of this Directive amending the waste legislation and the\r\ncorresponding parts of national transposition instruments.\n3.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delegated\r\nand implementing powers of the Commission\nParagraphs 2, 3, 5, 7,\r\n8, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21 of Article 1, paragraphs 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 of Article 2,\r\nparagraphs 6 and 7 of Article 3, the amendment proposed in Article 4, and\r\nparagraph 1 of Article 6 of this Proposal identify the delegated and\r\nimplementing powers of the Commission in Directives 2008/98/EC, 94/62/EC and\r\n1999/31/EC, respectively, and establish the corresponding procedures for\r\nadoption of these acts.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\r\nIMPLICATION\nThe proposal will not\r\nhave an impact on the European Union budget and is therefore not accompanied by\r\nthe financial statement provided for under Article 31 of the Financial\r\nRegulation (Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the\r\ngeneral budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom)\r\nNo1605/2002).\n2014/0201 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Directives 2008/98/EC on waste,\r\n94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste,\r\n2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles, 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators\r\nand waste batteries and accumulators, and 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and\r\nelectronic equipment \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE\r\nEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof and, in relation to Article 2 of this Directive, Article 114\r\nthereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[11],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[12],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Waste management in the Union should be improved, with the view to protecting, preserving and improving the quality\r\nof the environment, protecting human health, and ensuring prudent and rational\r\nutilisation of natural resources. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis is\r\ntherefore Article 192(2) of the Treaty for the amendments of the Directives 1999/31/EC,\r\n2000/53/EC, 2006/66/EC, 2008/98/EC and 2012/19/EU. Directive 94/62/EC however,\r\nbeing a measure of ensuring the functioning of the internal market, should be\r\namended on the basis of Article 114 of the Treaty. For reasons of\r\nsimplification and procedural economy it is appropriate to amend all those\r\nDirectives by a single amending act..\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has\r\nreviewed the targets laid down in Article 11(2) of Directive 2008/98/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[13],\r\nArticle 5(2) of Council Directive 1999/31/EC[14]\r\nand Article 6(1) of Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[15]. In its review, the\r\nCommission found that it was appropriate to amend these targets to make them\r\nbetter reflect the needs of the circular economy by increasing preparing for\r\nre-use and recycling of municipal and packaging waste and eliminating\r\nlandfilling of waste destined for landfills for non-hazardous waste.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many\r\nMember States have not yet completely developed the necessary waste management\r\ninfrastructure and are planning investments now. It is therefore essential to\r\nset clear policy objectives in order to avoid locking secondary raw materials\r\nat the bottom of the waste hierarchy.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Municipal waste\r\nconstitutes approximately between 7 and 10% of the total waste generated in the\r\n Union; however, this waste stream is amongst the most complex ones to manage,\r\nand the way it is managed gives a good indication of the quality of the overall\r\nwaste management system in a country. The challenges of municipal waste\r\nmanagement result from its highly complex and mixed composition, direct\r\nproximity of the generated waste to citizens, and a very high public\r\nvisibility. As a result, its management involves a need for a highly complex\r\nwaste management system including an efficient collection scheme, a need to\r\nactively engage citizens and businesses, a need for infrastructure adjusted to\r\nthe specific waste composition, and an elaborate financing system. Countries\r\nwhich have developed efficient municipal waste management systems generally\r\nscore better in overall waste management.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Packaging waste and\r\nbiodegradable municipal waste account for a large proportion of municipal waste\r\nand of household and similar waste. It is therefore necessary to examine the\r\nimpacts of setting targets for the management of these waste streams at the\r\nsame time.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Industrial, commercial,\r\nand mining waste is extremely diversified in terms of composition and volume,\r\nand very different depending on the economic structure of a Member State, the structure of the industry or commerce sector that generates the waste, or the\r\nindustrial or commercial density in a given geographical area. Hence, for most\r\nindustrial and mining waste, an industry-oriented approach using Best Available\r\nTechniques (BAT) reference documents (BREF) to address the specific issues\r\nrelated to the management of a given type of waste is a suitable solution[16]. However, industrial\r\nand commercial packaging waste will continue being covered by the requirements\r\nof Directive 94/62/EC and Directive 2008/98/EC, including their respective\r\nimprovements.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through a progressive\r\nincrease of the existing targets on preparing for re-use and recycling of\r\nmunicipal waste and the elimination of recyclable waste from landfilling corresponding\r\nto a maximum of 25% landfilling by 2025, it should be ensured that economically\r\nvaluable waste materials are progressively and effectively recovered through\r\nproper waste management and in line with the waste hierarchy. That way it\r\nshould be ensured that valuable materials found in waste are returned into the\r\nEuropean economy, thus making progress in the implementation of the Raw\r\nMaterials Initiative[17]\r\nand the creation of a circular economy.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Clear environmental,\r\neconomic and social benefits would be derived from further increasing the\r\ntargets laid down in Directives 2008/98/EC, 94/62/EC and 1999/31/EC for re-use\r\nand recycling of municipal and packaging waste, starting\r\nwith waste streams which can be easily recycled (e.g. plastics, metals, glass,\r\npaper, wood, bio-waste).\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compliance with the obligation\r\nto set up separate collection systems for paper, metal, plastic and glass is\r\nessential to increase preparing for re-use and recycling rates for municipal\r\nwaste in Member States. In addition, separate collection of bio-waste introduced\r\nby this proposal should contribute to preventing contamination of recyclable\r\nmaterials.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the combination of\r\nrecycling targets and landfill restrictions contained in this proposal, the\r\nUnion-wide targets for energy recovery and maximum recycling targets for packaging\r\nwaste laid down in Directive 94/62/EC are no longer necessary and should\r\ntherefore be deleted.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from the targets\r\nincluded in this proposal that Member States should support the use of\r\nrecovered materials, such as recovered paper and wood, in line with the waste\r\nhierarchy, with the aim of securing the supply of raw materials and moving the Union\r\ncloser to a \"recycling society\", and, whenever possible, should not\r\nsupport the landfilling or incineration of such materials. Member States should\r\nnot support the incineration of waste that can be recycled in a technically and\r\neconomically feasible way and under environmentally safe conditions. Recital 29\r\nof Directive 2008/98/EC should be interpreted in this context.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This proposal aims to set\r\nclear directions for the Union\u2019s waste management and in this way ensure\r\ninvestment security for the Member States and the industry. In developing their\r\nnational waste management strategies and planning investments in waste\r\nmanagement infrastructure, Member States should make a sound use of the European\r\nStructural and Investment Funds in line with the waste hierarchy by promoting\r\npreparing for re-use and recycling.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has set down\r\ntargets for the recycling of plastic packaging waste for 2025 taking into\r\naccount what was technically feasible at the time of the revision of the\r\nDirective; the Commission may propose new levels of the targets for plastics\r\nfor 2030 based on a review of progress made by Member States towards reaching\r\nthose targets, taking into account the evolution of the types of plastics\r\nplaced on the market and the development of new recycling technologies.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Separate collection and\r\nrecycling of ferrous metals and aluminium would have significant economic and\r\nenvironmental benefits since more aluminium would then be captured. The re-use\r\nand recycling target for metal packaging should therefore be split into\r\nseparate targets for those two types of waste.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Large\r\ndifferences exist between Member States in waste management, particularly as\r\nregards municipal waste. In order to ensure better, timelier, and more uniform\r\nimplementation of the waste legislation and anticipate implementation\r\nweaknesses, an early warning system should be established to detect\r\nshortcomings and allow taking action ahead of the deadlines for meeting the\r\ntargets.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2008/98/EC\r\nintroduces basic definitions regarding waste management. In order to ensure\r\ngreater coherence in waste legislation, the definitions in Directive 94/62/EC\r\nand 1999/31/EC should be aligned to those of Directive 2008/98/EC.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitions of municipal\r\nwaste, food waste, backfilling should be included in Directive 2008/98/EC and\r\nthe definition of residual waste in Directive 1999/31/EC in order to clarify\r\nthe scope of these concepts.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Statistical data reported\r\nby Member States are essential for the Commission to assess compliance with\r\nwaste legislation. Introducing a single entry point for all waste data, deleting\r\nobsolete reporting requirements and benchmarking national reporting\r\nmethodologies, accompanied by third party verification of data quality, should\r\nimprove the quality and reliability of statistics.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nproducers of goods and products should be responsible for the management of the\r\nresulting post-consumer waste. Extended Producer\r\nResponsibility schemes form an essential part of efficient waste management,\r\nbut their effectiveness and performance differ significantly between Member\r\nStates. Thus the setting of minimum operating requirements for extended producer\r\nresponsibility aiming at internalising the end-of-life management costs\r\naccording to high environmental standards and providing an incentive for\r\nproducers to take into account environmental considerations along the products'\r\nlife, from the design phase to their end-of-life is\r\nnecessary in order to reduce their cost and boost\r\nperformance, as well as to ensure a level-playing field and avoid obstacles to the functioning\r\nof the internal market.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proper management of\r\nhazardous waste still presents a problem in the Union, and data on its\r\ntreatment are partly missing. It is therefore necessary to strengthen the\r\nrecord keeping and traceability mechanisms through the establishment of\r\nelectronic registries for hazardous waste in the Member States. Electronic data\r\ncollection should be extended to other types of waste in order to simplify\r\nrecord-keeping for businesses and administrations and improve the monitoring of\r\nwaste flows in the Union.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure security\r\nof supply of critical raw materials and in line with the Raw Materials\r\nInitiative and the objectives and targets of the European Innovation\r\nPartnership on Raw Materials[18],\r\nMember States should take measures to achieve the best possible management of\r\nwaste containing significant amounts of critical raw materials[19] in line with the waste\r\nhierarchy, taking economic and technological feasibility and environmental\r\nbenefits into account. The measures contained in this Directive, e.g. the\r\nrecycling targets for municipal waste and the ban on the disposal of metals,\r\nincluding metals present in discarded products, in landfills for non-hazardous\r\nwaste will support the measures taken at national level.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To further support\r\neffective implementation of the Raw Materials Initiative, Member States should\r\ninclude in their waste management plans nationally appropriate measures\r\nregarding collection and recovery of waste containing significant amounts of\r\ncritical raw materials.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to the\r\nnegative effects of food wastage on the environment and\r\nits negative effect, a framework should be established for\r\nMember States to collect and report levels of food waste across all sectors in\r\na comparable way, and request developing national food waste prevention plans aimed\r\nat meeting an aspirational objective to reduce food waste by 30 % by 2025.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In defining national food\r\nwaste prevention programmes, Member States\u00a0 should set priorities based on the\r\nwaste management hierarchy: prevention, preparing for re-use, recycling,\r\nrecovery and disposal. In the case of food waste, it should be carefully\r\nassessed whether and for which categories of food waste, donation as well as\r\nthe possible use of former foodstuffs in animal feed should be given priority\r\nover composting, creation of renewable energy and landfill. This assessment\r\nshould take into account in particular economic circumstances, health, and\r\nquality standards, and always be in line with Union legislation regarding food\r\nand feed safety and animal health..\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Littering, especially of plastic,\r\nhas a direct and detrimental impact on the environment\r\nand high clean-up costs are an unnecessary economic burden. The introduction of\r\nspecific measures in waste management plans, financial support from producers\r\nwithin the extended producer responsibility schemes, and proper enforcement\r\nfrom the competent authorities should help eradicate this problem.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Communication on\r\nRegulatory Fitness and Performance (\u2018REFIT\u2019): Results and Next Steps[20] commits the Commission\r\nto evaluate, simplify or repeal Union legislative measures with a view to\r\nlightening the burden for business, encouraging growth and job creation. At the forefront of REFIT is the action to reduce regulatory burden\r\non small establishments or undertakings. The consultation on the TOP10 most burdensome EU legislative acts\r\nfor SMEs[21]\r\nhas identified the waste legislation as an area where possible burden reduction\r\nwas needed. In response to this call, and following a more detailed\r\nconsultation of small establishments or undertakings in a dedicated workshop held on 16 September 2013, simplification\r\nof permitting and registration requirements for small\r\nestablishments or undertakings should be introduced.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Implementation\r\nreports prepared by Member States every three years have not proved to be an\r\neffective tool for verifying compliance and ensuring good implementation, and\r\nare generating unnecessary administrative burden. It is therefore appropriate\r\nto repeal provisions obliging member States to produce such reports and instead\r\nexclusively use for compliance monitoring purposes the statistical data which\r\nMember States report every year to the Commission, showing when the targets are\r\nlikely to be met.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is\r\nnecessary to continue reporting on certain aspects of the implementation of\r\nDirective 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[22]. In order to be able\r\nto better monitor the implementation of that Directive, this reporting should\r\nbe done on an annual basis.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reliable reporting of statistical\r\ndata concerning waste management is paramount to efficient implementation and\r\nensuring a level playing field between Member States. Therefore, when preparing\r\nthe reports on compliance with the targets set out in waste legislation, Member\r\nStates shall use the most recent methodology developed by the Commission and the\r\nnational statistical offices of the Member States.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to supplement or\r\namend Directive 94/62/EC, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\r\n290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of Articles 3(1), 11(3), 19(2) and 20(1). It is\r\nparticularly important that the Commission should carry out appropriate\r\nconsultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The\r\nCommission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous,\r\ntimely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European\r\nParliament and the Council.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to supplement or\r\namend Directive 2008/98/EC, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\r\n290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of Articles 5(2), 6(2), 7(1), 27(1), 27(4), 38(1), 38(2) and 38(3). It is particularly important that the Commission should carry out\r\nappropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert\r\nlevel. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should\r\nensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\r\ndocuments to the European Parliament and the Council.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to supplement or\r\namend Directive 1999/31/EC, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\r\n290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of Article 16. It is particularly important that the\r\nCommission should carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory\r\nwork, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up\r\ndelegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\r\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and the Council. Any amendments to the Annexes should only be made in line with the\r\nprinciples laid down in this Directive as expressed in the Annexes. To this\r\nend, as regards Annex II, the Commission should take into account the general\r\nprinciples and general procedures for testing and acceptance criteria as set out\r\nin Annex II, specific criteria and/or test methods and associated limit values\r\nshould be set for each class of landfill, including if necessary specific types\r\nof landfill within each class, including underground storage. Proposals for the\r\nstandardisation of control, sampling and analysis methods in relation to the\r\nAnnexes should be considered for adoption by the Commission\u00a0 where appropriate\r\nwithin two years after the entry into force of this Directive\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of Directive 94/62/EC, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission in respect of Articles 12(3b) and 19(1). Those\r\npowers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[23].\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of Directive 1999/31/EC, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission in respect of Articles 3(3), 5(2), 5(2a),\r\n5(2b), Annex I, paragraph 3.5 and Annex II, paragraph 5. Those powers should be\r\nexercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council[24].\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of Directive 2008/98/EC, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission in respect of Articles 9(3), 11(3),\r\n24(2), 29(4), 33(2), 35(4), 37(4) and 38(4). Those powers should be exercised\r\nin accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council[25].\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the Joint\r\nPolitical Declaration of Member States and the Commission on explanatory\r\ndocuments of 28 September 2011, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in\r\njustified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or\r\nmore documents explaining the relationship between the components of a\r\ndirective and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.\r\nWith regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of\r\nsuch documents to be justified.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of this Directive,\r\nnamely to improve waste management in the Union,\r\nand thereby contributing to the protection, preservation and improvement of the\r\nquality of the environment and to the prudent and rational utilisation of\r\nnatural resources across\r\nthe Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can, by\r\nreason of the scale effects of the measures, be better achieved at Union level,\r\nthe Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity\r\nas set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the\r\nprinciple of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does\r\nnot go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nAmendment of Directive 2008/98/EC\nDirective 2008/98/EC is hereby amended as\r\nfollows:\n(1) Article 3 is amended as follows:\n(a) the following point (1a) is\r\ninserted:\n'(1a). \"municipal waste\" means waste as set out\r\nin Annex VI;';\n(b) the following points (4a) and (4b)\r\nare inserted:\n'(4a). \"food waste\" means food (including inedible parts) lost from the food supply chain,\r\nnot including food diverted to material uses such as\r\nbio-based products, animal feed, or sent for\r\nredistribution;\n(4b). \"construction and demolition waste\" means waste corresponding to the waste categories in Chapter 17 of the\r\nAnnex to Decision 2000/532/EC and any subsequent modifications, except for\r\nhazardous waste and naturally occurring material as defined in category 17 05\r\n04;';\n(c) the following point (15a) is\r\ninserted:\n'15(a). \"material recovery\" means any\r\nrecovery operation, excluding energy recovery and the reprocessing into\r\nmaterials which are to be used as fuel;';\n(d) the following point (17a) is\r\ninserted:\n'(17a). \"backfilling\" means any of the following types of recovery:\n(i) recovery where waste is used in excavated\r\nareas such as underground mines or gravel pits for the purpose of slope\r\nreclamation, safety, or for engineering purposes in landscaping;\n(ii) recovery where waste is used for the purpose\r\nof construction, stowage of mines and quarries, for re-cultivation, land\r\nreclamation, or landscaping and where the waste is substituting other non-waste\r\nmaterials which would otherwise have been used for that purpose;';\n(e) the following point (20a) is added:\n'(20a). \"small establishments or\r\nundertakings\" means establishments employing fewer than 250 persons and\r\nhaving an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million or an annual balance\r\nsheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million;';\n(2) Article 5 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 1, the following point\r\n(e) is added:\n'(e) any other\r\nconditions to be met for specific substances or objects laid down in accordance\r\nwith paragraph 2.';\n(b) paragraph 2 is replaced by the\r\nfollowing:\n'2.
