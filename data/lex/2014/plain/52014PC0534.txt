Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the Commission\r\ndecided[1] to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after\r\nno more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum\r\nrequirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter\r\nintervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that their\r\nprovisions are clear and readily understandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the importance of codification as it offers\r\ncertainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament, the\r\nCouncil and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the\r\nfast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999\r\nlaying down detailed rules for the application of Article 108 of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union[3].\r\nThe new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it[4]; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being\r\ncodified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such\r\nformal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal\r\nwas drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in 22 official\r\nlanguages, of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 and the instruments amending it, carried out by the Publications\r\nOffice of the European Union, by means of a data-processing system.\r\nWhere the articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old\r\nand the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex II to the\r\ncodified Regulation.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nArt. 1.1\n2014/0246 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nlaying down detailed rules for the\r\napplication of Article 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion (codification)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\n(adapted)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 109 \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[5],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[6],\nWhereas:\n\u00ea \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 659/1999[7] has been substantially amended several times[8]. In the interests of clarity and rationality, that Regulation should\r\nbe codified.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 1 (adapted)\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without\r\nprejudice to special procedural rules laid down in regulations for certain\r\nsectors, this Regulation should apply to aid in all sectors. For the purpose of\r\napplying Articles \u00d6 93 \u00d5 and \u00d6 107 \u00d5 of the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) \u00d5 , the\r\nCommission has specific competence under Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 thereof to\r\ndecide on the compatibility of State aid with the \u00d6 internal \u00d5 market when\r\nreviewing existing aid, when taking decisions on new or altered aid and when\r\ntaking action regarding non-compliance with its decisions or with the\r\nrequirement as to notification.\n\u00ea 734/2013 recital 1 (adapted)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe context of a \u00d6 modernised system \u00d5 of State aid rules, to contribute both to the implementation of the\r\nEurope 2020 strategy for growth[9] and to budgetary consolidation, Article 107TFEU should be applied\r\neffectively and uniformly throughout the Union. Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 \u00d6 consolidated \u00d5 and reinforced the Commission\u2019s previous practice of increasing\r\nlegal certainty and supporting the development of State aid policy in a\r\ntransparent environment.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 4 (adapted)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure legal certainty, it is appropriate \u00d6 that \u00d5 the\r\ncircumstances under which aid is to be considered as existing aid \u00d6 be defined \u00d5 . The completion and enhancement of the internal market is a gradual\r\nprocess, reflected in the permanent development of State aid policy. Following\r\nthese developments, certain measures, which at the moment they were put into\r\neffect did not constitute State aid, may since have become aid.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 5 (adapted)\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 (3) \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 , any plans to\r\ngrant new aid are to be notified to the Commission and should not be put into\r\neffect before the Commission has authorised it.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 6 (adapted)\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n\u00d6 4(3) \u00d5 of the Treaty \u00d6 on European Union (TEU) \u00d5, Member States\r\nare under an obligation to cooperate with the Commission and to provide it with\r\nall information required to allow the Commission to carry out its duties under\r\nthis Regulation.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 7\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nperiod within which the Commission is to conclude the preliminary examination\r\nof notified aid should be set at two months from the receipt of a complete\r\nnotification or from the receipt of a duly reasoned statement of the Member\r\nState concerned that it considers the notification to be complete because the\r\nadditional information requested by the Commission is not available or has\r\nalready been provided. For reasons of legal certainty, that examination should\r\nbe brought to an end by a decision.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 8 (adapted)\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nall cases where, as a result of the preliminary examination, the Commission\r\ncannot find that the aid is compatible with the \u00d6 internal \u00d5 market, the\r\nformal investigation procedure should be opened in order to enable the\r\nCommission to gather all the information it needs to assess the compatibility\r\nof the aid and to allow the interested parties to submit their comments. The\r\nrights of the interested parties can best be safeguarded within the framework\r\nof the formal investigation procedure provided for \u00d6 in \u00d5 Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 (2) \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 2 (adapted)\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to assess the compatibility with the internal market of any notified or\r\nunlawful State aid for which the Commission has exclusive competence under\r\nArticle 108 TFEU, it is appropriate to ensure that the Commission has the\r\npower, for the purposes of enforcing the State aid rules, to request all\r\nnecessary market information from any Member State, undertaking or association\r\nof undertakings whenever it has doubts as to the compatibility of the measure\r\nconcerned with the Union rules, and has therefore initiated the formal\r\ninvestigation procedure. In particular, the Commission should use this power in\r\ncases in which a complex substantive assessment appears necessary. In deciding\r\nwhether to use this power, the Commission should take due account of the\r\nduration of the preliminary \u00d6 examination \u00d5 .\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 3 (adapted)\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe purpose of assessing the compatibility of an aid measure after the\r\ninitiation of the formal investigation procedure, in particular as regards\r\ntechnically complex cases subject to substantive assessment, the Commission\r\nshould be able, by simple request or by decision, to require any Member State,\r\nundertaking or association of undertakings to provide all market information\r\nnecessary for completing its assessment, if the information provided by the\r\nMember State concerned during the course of the preliminary \u00d6 examination \u00d5 is not sufficient, taking due account of the principle of\r\nproportionality, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 4\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe light of the special relationship between aid beneficiaries and the Member State concerned, the Commission should be able to request information from an aid\r\nbeneficiary only in agreement with the Member State concerned. The provision of\r\ninformation by the beneficiary of the aid measure in question does not constitute\r\na legal basis for bilateral negotiations between the Commission and the\r\nbeneficiary in question.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 5\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission should select the addressees of information requests on the basis of\r\nobjective criteria appropriate to each case, while ensuring that, when the\r\nrequest is addressed to a sample of undertakings or associations thereof, the\r\nsample of respondents is representative within each category. The information\r\nsought should consist, in particular, of factual company and market data and\r\nfacts-based analysis of the functioning of the market.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 6\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission, as the initiator of the procedure, should be responsible for\r\nverifying both the information transmission by the Member States, undertakings\r\nor associations of undertakings, and the purported confidentiality of the\r\ninformation to be disclosed.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 7\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission should be able to enforce compliance with the requests for\r\ninformation it addresses to any undertaking or association of undertakings, as\r\nappropriate, by means of proportionate fines and periodic penalty payments. In\r\nsetting the amounts of fines and periodic penalty payments, the Commission\r\nshould take due account of the principles of proportionality and\r\nappropriateness, in particular as regards small and medium-sized enterprises.\r\nThe rights of the parties requested to provide information should be\r\nsafeguarded by giving them the opportunity to make known their views before any\r\ndecision imposing fines or periodic penalty payments is taken. The Court of\r\nJustice of the European Union should have unlimited jurisdiction with regard to\r\nsuch fines and periodic penalties pursuant to Article 261 TFEU.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 8\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking\r\ndue account of the principles of proportionality and appropriateness, the\r\nCommission should be able to reduce the periodic penalty payments or waive them\r\nentirely, when addressees of requests provide the information requested, albeit\r\nafter the expiry of the deadline.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 9 (adapted)\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fines\r\nand periodic penalty payments are not applicable to Member States, since they\r\nare under a duty to cooperate sincerely with the Commission in accordance with\r\nArticle 4(3)TEU, and to provide\r\nthe Commission with all information required to allow it to carry out its\r\nduties under \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 9\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After\r\nhaving considered the comments submitted by the interested parties, the\r\nCommission should conclude its examination by means of a final decision as soon\r\nas the doubts have been removed. It is appropriate, should this examination not\r\nbe concluded after a period of 18 months from the opening of the procedure,\r\nthat the Member State concerned has the opportunity to request a decision,\r\nwhich the Commission should take within two months.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 10\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to safeguard the rights of defence of the Member State concerned, it\r\nshould be provided with copies of the requests for information sent to other Member States, undertakings or associations of undertakings, and be able to submit its\r\nobservations on the comments received. It should also be informed of the names\r\nof the undertakings and the associations of undertakings requested, to the\r\nextent that these entities have not demonstrated a legitimate interest in the\r\nprotection of their identity.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 11\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission should take due account of the legitimate interests of undertakings\r\nin the protection of their business secrets. It should not be able to use\r\nconfidential information provided by respondents, which cannot be aggregated or\r\notherwise be anonymised, in any decision unless it has previously obtained\r\ntheir agreement to disclose that information to the Member State concerned.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 12 (adapted)\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\ncases where information marked as confidential does not seem to be covered by\r\nobligations of professional secrecy, it is appropriate to \u00d6 have \u00d5 a mechanism \u00d6 in place according to \u00d5 which the Commission can decide the extent to which such information\r\ncan be disclosed. Any such decision to reject a claim that information is\r\nconfidential should indicate a period at the end of which the information will\r\nbe disclosed, so that the respondent can make use of any judicial protection\r\navailable to it, including any interim measure.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 10\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure that the State aid rules are applied correctly and effectively,\r\nthe Commission should have the opportunity of revoking a decision which was\r\nbased on incorrect information.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 11 (adapted)\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure compliance with Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular with the notification obligation and the standstill clause in\r\nArticle  \u00d6 108 \u00d5 (3), the\r\nCommission should examine all cases of unlawful aid. In the interests of\r\ntransparency and legal certainty, the procedures to be followed in such cases\r\nshould be laid down. When a Member State has not respected the notification\r\nobligation or the standstill clause, the Commission should not be bound by time\r\nlimits.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 13 (adapted)\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission should be able, on its own initiative, to examine information on\r\nunlawful aid, from whatever source, in order to ensure compliance with Article\r\n108 TFEU, and in particular with the notification obligation and standstill\r\nclause laid down in Article 108(3) TFEU, and to assess the compatibility of an\r\naid with the internal market.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 12 (adapted)\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\ncases of unlawful aid, the Commission should have the right to obtain all\r\nnecessary information enabling it to take a decision and to restore\r\nimmediately, where appropriate, undistorted competition. It is therefore\r\nappropriate to enable the Commission to adopt interim measures addressed to the\r\n  Member State concerned. The interim measures may take the form of information\r\ninjunctions, suspension injunctions and recovery injunctions. The Commission\r\nshould be enabled, in the event of non-compliance with an information\r\ninjunction, to decide on the basis of the information available and, in the\r\nevent of non-compliance with suspension and recovery injunctions, to refer the\r\nmatter to the Court of Justice directly, in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 (2) \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 13 (adapted)\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\ncases of unlawful aid which is not compatible with the \u00d6 internal \u00d5 market,\r\neffective competition should be restored. For this purpose it is necessary that\r\nthe aid, including interest, be recovered without delay. It is appropriate that\r\nrecovery be effected in accordance with the procedures of national law. The\r\napplication of those procedures should not, by preventing the immediate and effective\r\nexecution of the Commission decision, impede the restoration of effective\r\ncompetition. To achieve this result, Member States should take all necessary\r\nmeasures ensuring the effectiveness of the Commission decision.\n\u00ea 659/1999 recital\r\n14 (adapted)\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nreasons of legal certainty it is appropriate to \u00d6 provide for \u00d5 a period of limitation of 10 years with regard to unlawful aid,\r\nafter the expiry of which no recovery can be ordered.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 16 (adapted)\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nreasons of legal certainty, it is appropriate to \u00d6 provide for \u00d5 limitation\r\nperiods for the imposition and enforcement of fines and periodic penalty\r\npayments.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 15\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Misuse\r\nof aid may have effects on the functioning of the internal market which are\r\nsimilar to those of unlawful aid and should thus be treated according to\r\nsimilar procedures. Unlike unlawful aid, aid which has possibly been misused is\r\naid which has been previously approved by the Commission. Therefore the\r\nCommission should not be allowed to use a recovery injunction with regard to\r\nmisuse of aid.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 17 (adapted)\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 (1) \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 , the\r\nCommission is under an obligation, in cooperation with Member States, to keep\r\nunder constant review all systems of existing aid. In the interests of\r\ntransparency and legal certainty, it is appropriate to specify the scope of\r\ncooperation under that Article.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 18 (adapted)\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure compatibility of existing aid schemes with the \u00d6 internal \u00d5 market and in\r\naccordance with Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 (1) \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 , the\r\nCommission should propose appropriate measures where an existing aid scheme is\r\nnot, or is no longer, compatible with the \u00d6 internal \u00d5 market and should\r\ninitiate the procedure provided for in Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 (2) \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 if the Member\r\nState concerned declines to implement the proposed measures.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 16 (adapted)\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis appropriate to \u00d6 set out \u00d5 all the possibilities which third parties have to defend their\r\ninterests in State aid procedures. \n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 14 (adapted)\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00d6 Complaints are an essential source of information for detecting\r\ninfringements of the Union rules on State aid. \u00d5 To \u00d6 ensure \u00d5 the quality of\r\nthe complaints submitted to the Commission, and at the same time transparency\r\nand legal certainty, it is appropriate to \u00d6 lay down \u00d5 the conditions\r\nthat a complaint should fulfill in order to put the Commission in possession of\r\ninformation regarding alleged unlawful aid and set in motion the preliminary\r\nexamination. Submissions not meeting those conditions should be treated as\r\ngeneral market information, and should not necessarily lead to ex officio\r\ninvestigations.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 15 (adapted)\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Complainants\r\nshould be required to demonstrate that they are interested parties within the\r\nmeaning of Article 108(2) TFEU and of Article 1(h) of \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation. They should also be required to provide a certain amount\r\nof information in a form that the Commission should be empowered to \u00d6 set out \u00d5 in an implementing provision. In order not to discourage prospective\r\ncomplainants, that implementing provision should take into account that the\r\ndemands on interested parties for lodging a complaint should not be burdensome.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 17 (adapted)\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure that the Commission addresses similar issues in a consistent\r\nmanner across the internal market, it is appropriate to \u00d6 provide for \u00d5 a specific legal\r\nbasis to launch investigations into sectors of the economy or into certain aid\r\ninstruments across several Member States. For reasons of proportionality and in\r\nthe light of the high administrative burden entailed by such investigations,\r\nsector inquiries should be carried out only when the information available\r\nsubstantiates a reasonable suspicion that State aid measures in a particular\r\nsector could materially restrict or distort competition within the internal\r\nmarket in several Member States, or that existing aid measures in a particular\r\nsector in several Member States are not, or are no longer, compatible with the\r\ninternal market. Such inquiries would enable the Commission to deal in an\r\nefficient and transparent way with horizontal State aid issues and to obtain an\r\nex ante overview of the sector concerned.\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 19 (adapted)\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to allow the Commission to monitor effectively compliance with Commission\r\ndecisions and to facilitate cooperation between the Commission and Member\r\nStates for the purpose of the constant review of all existing aid schemes in\r\nthe Member States in accordance with Article \u00d6 108 \u00d5 (1) \u00d6 TFEU \u00d5 , it is\r\nnecessary \u00d6 that \u00d5 a general reporting obligation with regard to all existing aid\r\nschemes \u00d6 be laid down \u00d5 .\n\u00ea 659/1999\r\nrecital 20 (adapted)\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where\r\nthe Commission has serious doubts as to whether its decisions are being complied\r\nwith, it should have at its disposal additional instruments allowing it to\r\nobtain the information necessary to verify that its decisions are being\r\neffectively complied with. For this purpose on-site monitoring visits are an\r\nappropriate and useful instrument, in particular for cases where aid might have\r\nbeen misused. Therefore the Commission \u00d6 should \u00d5 be empowered to undertake on-site monitoring visits and \u00d6 should \u00d5 obtain the cooperation of the competent authorities of the Member\r\nStates where an undertaking opposes such a visit.\n\u00ea 734/2013\r\nrecital 18\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency\r\nin the application of the State aid rules requires that arrangements be\r\nestablished for cooperation between the courts of the Member States and the\r\nCommission. Such cooperation is relevant for all courts of the Member States\r\nthat apply Article 107(1) and Article 108 TFEU. In particular, national courts\r\nshould be able to ask the Commission for information or for its opinion on\r\npoints concerning the application of State aid rules.
