"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n52014PC0359\n\nProposal for a COUNCIL DECISION on the Union\u2019s position in the Cooperation Council established by the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States on the one hand and the Republic of Moldova on the other, with regard to adopting a Recommendation on implementing the EU-Moldova Association Agenda /* COM/2014/0359 final - 2014/0181 (NLE) */\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\nA Partnership and Cooperation Agreement\r\nbetween the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova (thereinafter \u2018Moldova\u2019), of the other part (\u2018the Agreement\u2019), was signed\r\non 28 November 1994 and entered into force on 1 July 1998. It is based on a\r\ncommitment to shared values and effective implementation of political, economic\r\nand institutional reforms.\nA joint EU-Moldova European Neighbourhood\r\nPolicy Action Plan, based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement,\r\nsets out strategic objectives and encourages and supports Moldova\u2019s objective of further integration into European economic and social structures.\nMoldova is a\r\npartner country within the European Neighbourhood Policy. This has changed the\r\ncontext of relations between it and the European Union in a significant and\r\npositive way. The EU and Moldova have now finalised negotiations for an\r\nAssociation Agreement, which will replace the Partnership and Cooperation\r\nAgreement. These negotiations were substantively completed on 25 June 2013, and\r\nthe Agreement was initialled on 29 November 2013 during the Eastern Partnership\r\nSummit in Vilnius, Lithuania.\nThe Association Agreement will\r\nsignificantly deepen Moldova\u2019s political association with and economic\r\nintegration in the EU. It includes the gradual implementation of a deep and\r\ncomprehensive free-trade area.\nThe successful implementation of a visa\r\nliberalisation action plan has resulted in visa-free travel between the EU and Moldova, and is a fundamental element underpinning the Republic of Moldova\u2019s political association\r\nwith and economic integration in the EU. This substantial enhancement of\r\nmobility and people-to-people contacts was envisaged in the Association\r\nAgreement.\nThe EU Heads of State and Government\r\ninitially planned to sign the Association Agreement in the autumn of 2014.\r\nPrompted by worrisome developments in Ukraine, which could also impact other\r\ncountries in the region, signature of the agreement was brought forward to\r\nAugust, and then to June. The institutions are working hard to shorten the time\r\nneeded to finalise the Agreement texts, and to ensure that this objective is\r\nmet.\nThe Association Agreement can only enter\r\ninto force once it is ratified by all parties (i.e. the EU, its Member States and Moldova). This is likely to be a lengthy process, possibly lasting several\r\nyears. Therefore, the Agreement envisages the provisional application of\r\ncertain of its parts once Moldova has completed the necessary procedures (note\r\nthat the Constitution of Moldova allows for direct provisional application,\r\nwithout prior ratification) and once the EU has notified its readiness for\r\nprovisional application to start.\nThe aim of the Association Agenda is to\r\nprepare and facilitate implementation of the Association Agreement. It creates\r\na practical framework through which the overriding objectives of political\r\nassociation and economic integration can be achieved. It replaces the\r\nEU-Moldova European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan.\nBased on the structure of the Association\r\nAgreement, the Association Agenda sets out a list of priorities for joint work\r\nin the 2014-16 period. The fact that the Association Agenda focuses on a\r\nlimited number of priorities does not affect the scope or mandate of the\r\ncurrent dialogue held under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement or other\r\nagreements. It does not prejudge the implementation of commitments made under\r\nthe Association Agreement once it enters into force or is provisionally\r\napplied. Unlike the Association Agreement, the Association Agenda is not a\r\nlegally-binding instrument under international law.\nThe proposal for a Council Decision on the\r\nUnion position in the EU-Moldova Cooperation Council with regard to adopting\r\nthe Association Agenda follows.\nThe Commission requests that the Council\r\nadopts this draft Council Decision.\n2014/0181 (NLE)\nProposal for

The\r\nPresident\nANNEXES\nto the\nCommission Proposal for a \r\nCOUNCIL DECISION\r\non the Union's position in the Cooperation Council established by the\r\nPartnership and\u00a0 Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its\r\nMember States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other part,\r\nwith regard to adopting a Recommendation on implementing of the EU-Moldova\r\nAssociation Agenda\nANNEX 1\nDraft\nRECOMMENDATION\nOn\r\nimplementing the EU-Moldova Association Agenda\nTHE\r\nEU-MOLDOVA COOPERATION COUNCIL,\nHaving regard to the EU-Moldova Partnership\r\nand Cooperation Agreement, which established a partnership between the European\r\nCommunity and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova,\r\nof the other part (hereinafter \u2018the Agreement\u2019), and in particular Article 82\r\nthereof,\nWhereas:\nUnder Article 82 of the Agreement, a\r\nCooperation Council was established to supervise the Agreement\u2019s\r\nimplementation, and may make appropriate recommendations, by agreement between\r\nthe two parties.\nThe parties to the Agreement have agreed on\r\nthe text of the Association Agenda, which aims to prepare and facilitate the\r\nimplementation of the future Association Agreement by creating a practical\r\nframework to help achieve the overriding objectives of political association\r\nand economic integration.\nThe Association Agenda has a dual purpose:\r\nto set out specific steps to ensure that the parties meet their obligations\r\nunder the Association Agreement, and to provide a broader framework for further\r\nstrengthening EU-Moldova relations, and specifically to facilitate deeper\r\neconomic integration and political cooperation, in accordance with the overall\r\nobjectives of the Association Agreement.\nHAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATION:\nSole\r\nArticle\nThe Cooperation Council recommends that the\r\nparties implement the EU-Moldova Association Agenda set out in Annex, insofar\r\nas implementation aims to achieve the objectives of the EU-Moldova Association\r\nAgreement, which established an Association between the European Community and\r\nits Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other\r\npart.\nDone at [\u2026]\nFor the Cooperation Council\nThe President\nANNEX\r\n2\nAssociation Agenda\nbetween the European Union and the Republic of   Moldova\nThe European Union and the Republic of   Moldova (\u2018the parties\u2019) recognise that the context of their relations has\r\nchanged in a significant and positive way since they entered into the Eastern\r\nPartnership. The parties began negotiations on an Association Agreement in\r\n2010, and on a deep and comprehensive free-trade area that would be an integral\r\npart of that Agreement, in 2012. They have also developed and launched a visa\r\nliberalisation action plan, whose successful implementation is a fundamental\r\nelement underpinning the Republic of Moldova\u2019s political association with and\r\neconomic integration in the European Union. This substantial enhancement of\r\nmobility and people-to-people contacts was envisaged in the Association\r\nAgreement.\nNegotiations\r\non the Association Agreement were completed on 25 June 2013, and the Agreement\r\nwas initialled on 29 November 2013. Before the full Agreement enters into\r\nforce, measures must be put in place to ensure that the parties are able to\r\nenjoy its full benefits; the Agreement\u2019s partial provisional application is the\r\nfirst of these measures. The aim of the Association Agenda is to prepare and\r\nfacilitate the implementation of the Association Agreement, by creating a\r\npractical framework through which the overriding objectives of political\r\nassociation and economic integration can be achieved. It replaces the\r\nEU-Moldova European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan.\nThe Association Agenda sets out a list of\r\npriorities for joint work in the 2014-16 period, based on the structure of the\r\nAssociation Agreement.\nThe fact that the Association Agenda\r\nfocuses upon a limited number of priorities does not affect the scope or\r\nmandate of dialogue currently being carried out under the Partnership and\r\nCooperation Agreement, other relevant agreements or the multilateral track of\r\nthe Eastern Partnership. It does not prejudge the implementation of commitments\r\nmade under the Association Agreement once this enters into force or is\r\nprovisionally applied.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Principles, instruments and\r\nresources for implementing the Association Agenda\nThe following common principles will guide\r\nthe implementation of the Association Agenda:\nActions undertaken as part of the\r\nAssociation Agenda should be implemented in the spirit of the overall\r\nobjectives of political association and economic integration;\nThe priorities of the Association Agenda\r\nreflect the responsibility of the EU and the Republic of Moldova to fully\r\nimplement the provisions of their Association Agreement, once it enters into\r\nforce;\nThe Association Agenda should be\r\nimplemented in full respect of the principles of transparency, accountability\r\nand inclusiveness;\nBoth parties must be involved in\r\nimplementing the Association Agenda;\nThe Association Agenda aims to achieve\r\ntangible and defined results through the progressive implementation of\r\npractical measures;\nThe parties recognise the importance of\r\nsupporting the agreed priorities through appropriate and sufficient political,\r\ntechnical and financial means; and\nThe implementation of the Association\r\nAgenda will be subject to annual reporting, monitoring and assessment. Progress\r\nmade will be reviewed, including under the Partnership and Cooperation\r\nAgreement and other relevant agreements.\nThe European Union will support the Republic of   Moldova in implementing the objectives and priorities set out in the\r\nAssociation Agenda. To do this, it will: use all available sources of EU\r\nsupport; provide expertise and advice; facilitate the sharing of best\r\npractices, know-how, and information; and support capacity-building and\r\ninstitutional strengthening. It will also encourage and seek coordination of\r\nsupport from the Republic of Moldova\u2019s other partners. It will use its relevant\r\nfinancial instruments to help implement the Association Agenda. However, the\r\nAssociation Agenda is not a financial programming document and is not a\r\nsubstitute for the financial programming carried out by the parties.\nThe EU will provide support in the context\r\nof the overall priorities for assistance to the Republic of Moldova, as outlined in the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) Single Support Framework\r\n(SSF) and in the multi-country programming prepared for the Republic of Moldova through the ENI.\u00a0 It will do so in full compliance with the implementation\r\nrules and procedures governing EU external assistance.\nThe Association Agenda will be applicable\r\nfrom the moment of its adoption, for an initial period of three years, which\r\nmay be extended by mutual agreement. Once it is adopted, it will replace the\r\nEuropean Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) Action Plan as way of monitoring the Republic of   Moldova\u2019s progress within the ENP framework. Civil society will also be\r\nencouraged to focus their monitoring work on the Association Agenda. The EU\r\nwill be responsible for reporting on the implementation of the Association\r\nAgenda; it will be supported by the Republic of Moldova\u2019s own reporting\r\nsystems.\nIf necessary, the Association Agenda may be\r\namended or updated at any time, by agreement of the Cooperation Council\r\n(Association Council) of the European Union and the Republic of Moldova, in particular when the Association Agreement enters into force.\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Priorities of the Association\r\nAgenda\n2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Political dialogue and reform\nPolitical dialogue and cooperation on\r\nreforms to be carried out in the framework of this Association Agenda seek to\r\nstrengthen respect for democratic principles, the rule of law and good\r\ngovernance, human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the rights of\r\npersons belonging to minorities as enshrined in the\r\ncore UN and Council of Europe Conventions and related protocols. The Council of\r\nEurope Action Plan should be taken into account when pursuing political\r\ndialogue and implementing reforms in the following areas:[1]\r\n\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strengthening the stability,\r\nindependence and effectiveness of institutions guaranteeing democracy and the\r\nrule of law in the Republic of Moldova, and in particular:\nclarifying the competencies of the\r\nconstitutional court and the appointment procedures of its members, in close\r\ncooperation with the Venice Commission;\nreviewing the process of electing the\r\nPresident (Article 78 of the Constitution), to ensure that it is inclusive and\r\nguarantees a separation of powers. A more comprehensive revision of the\r\nconstitution is still needed in the long term, to prevent the resurgence of\r\ninstitutional deadlock;\nensuring that parliamentary and local\r\nelections are carried out in a democratic way, in accordance with European\r\nstandards, and that they address any shortcomings identified by the\r\nOrganisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe / Office for Democratic\r\nInstitutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR);\npursuing the implementation of the\r\ndecentralisation strategy, in compliance with the Council of Europe\u2019s European\r\nCharter of Local Self-Government (Council of Europe Treaty Series No 122);\nupgrading the legal framework for financing\r\npolitical parties and electoral campaigns in the light of the joint opinions of\r\nthe OSCE/ODIHR and the Venice Commission and the recommendation made by the\r\nGroup of States against Corruption (GRECO) on the transparency of party\r\nfunding.\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further\r\nreforming the justice sector, in particular ensuring the independence,\r\nimpartiality, professionalism and efficiency of the judiciary, the prosecution,\r\nand law enforcement agencies, which should be free from political or any other\r\nundue interference, and intensifying the prevention of and fight against\r\ncorruption in all its forms and at all\u00a0 levels.
