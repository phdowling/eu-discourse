It was\r\nsigned by the Community on 11 September 1998. The Rotterdam Convention\r\nrepresents a major step forward in the international regulation of certain\r\nhazardous chemicals, including pesticides. Its objective is to promote shared\r\nresponsibility and co-operative efforts among the Parties in the international\r\ntrade of such chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment\r\nfrom potential harm and to contribute to their environmentally sound use. \nThe Union has implemented the Convention\r\nthrough Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil of 4 July 2012 concerning the export and import of hazardous chemicals[1]. By its Decision 2006/730/EC of 25 September 2006[2], the Council decided to approve the Convention on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Community.\nThe Convention entered into force on 24\r\nFebruary 2004. The seventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP7) will\r\ntake place in Geneva from 4 to 15 May 2015. In addition to the Union, 27 of its Member States are Parties to the Convention.\nOn the basis of recommendations from the\r\nChemical Review Committee (CRC), a subsidiary body under the authority of the\r\nConference of the Parties (COP), COP is expected to take decisions on the\r\ninclusion of further chemicals in Annex III to the Convention, making them subject\r\nto the PIC procedure. \nThe chemicals recommended by the CRC for\r\ninclusion in Annex III to the Rotterdam Convention, namely chrysotile asbestos,\r\nmethamidophos, trichlorfon, fenthion (ultra low volume (ULV) formulations at or\r\nabove 640 g active ingredient/L) and liquid formulations (emulsifiable\r\nconcentrate and soluble concentrate) containing paraquat dichloride at or above\r\n276 g/L, corresponding to paraquat ion at or above 200 g/L, are already subject\r\nto restrictions on export under Union law, that are similar to those under the\r\nConvention. The Commission, therefore, is proposing to the Council a decision\r\nto support, on behalf of the Union, the amendments of Annex III to the\r\nConvention at COP7.\n2014/0356 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be adopted on\r\nbehalf of the European Union with regard to proposals for amendments of Annex\r\nIII to the Rotterdam Convention\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) and Article\r\n207, in conjunction with Article 218(9), thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union has\r\nratified the Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for\r\ncertain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade (the\r\n'Rotterdam Convention')[3].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 649/2012\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July\r\n2012 concerning the export and import of hazardous chemicals[4] implements the Rotterdam Convention in the Union.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\r\nimporting countries benefit from the protection offered by the Rotterdam\r\nConvention, it is necessary and appropriate to support the recommendation from\r\nthe Chemical Review Committee as regards the inclusion in Annex III to the\r\nRotterdam Convention of chrysotile asbestos, methamidophos, trichlorfon,\r\nfenthion (ultra low volume (ULV) formulations at or above 640 g active\r\ningredient/L) and liquid formulations (emulsifiable concentrate and soluble\r\nconcentrate) containing paraquat dichloride at or above 276 g/L, corresponding\r\nto paraquat ion at or above 200 g/L. These substances are already banned or\r\nseverely restricted in the Union and are therefore subject to export\r\nrequirements which go beyond what is required under the Rotterdam Convention.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The seventh meeting of the\r\nConference of the Parties (COP7) of the Rotterdam Convention is expected to\r\ntake decisions on the proposed amendments to Annex III. The Union should\r\nsupport these amendments.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nSole Article\nAt the seventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the\r\nRotterdam Convention, the Union shall support the adoption of the amendments to\r\nadd chrysotile asbestos, methamidophos, trichlorfon, fenthion (ultra low volume\r\n(ULV) formulations at or above 640 g active ingredient/L) and liquid\r\nformulations (emulsifiable concentrate and soluble concentrate) containing\r\nparaquat dichloride at or above 276 g/L, corresponding to paraquat ion at or\r\nabove 200 g/L, to Annex III to the Rotterdam Convention. Minor changes to the draft Decision of the Conference of the Parties may be agreed to by the representatives of the Union in the meeting without further decision of the Council.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 201, 27.7.2012, p. 60.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 299, 28.10.2006, p. 23.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 299, 28.10.2006, p. 23.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 201, 27.7.2012, p. 60.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
