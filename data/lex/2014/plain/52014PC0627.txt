The enhanced Programme of\r\nInspections during surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers or Enhanced Survey\r\nProgramme (ESP) specifies how to undertake such an intensified inspection. As\r\nthe CAS uses the ESP to achieve its aim, the CAS refers to the ESP as a tool to\r\ndo so. These amendments to the ESP Code aim to bring the ESP Code in line with International\r\nAssociation of Classification Societies (IACS) current practices and also to\r\nallow under certain conditions hydrostatic testing of cargo tanks by the ship's\r\ncrew, under the direction of the master, in lieu of carrying out such testing\r\nin the presence of a surveyor.\n1.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These changes are set out\r\nin Annex 22 in MSC 93/22/Add.3. Para 10.8 of the MSC 93 report (MSC 93/22)\r\nindicates that these amendments will be adopted at MSC 94.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADOPTION OF THE IMO\r\nAMENDMENTS\n2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of amendments to\r\nthe 2011 Enhanced Survey Programme Code\nThese amendments were approved at the 93rd\r\nsession of the Maritime Safety Committee meeting between 14-23 May 2014 and are\r\nto be submitted for adoption to the 94th session of that Committee\r\nmeeting between 17-21 November 2014.\n2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Acceptance and entry into\r\nforce. \nOnce approved and adopted by this Committee,\r\nthe above amendments will be submitted to the respective contracting parties in\r\norder for these to express their consent to be bound by the said amendments.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RELEVANT EU LEGISLATION AND EU COMPETENCE\n3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to the 2011\r\nEnhanced Survey Programme (ESP) Code\nRegulation (EU) No 530/2012[1] on the accelerated\r\nphasing-in of double hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil\r\ntankers aims to establish an accelerated phasing-in\r\nscheme for the application of the double-hull or equivalent design requirements\r\nof MARPOL 73/78, as defined in Article 3 of this Regulation, to single-hull oil\r\ntankers, and to ban the transport to or from ports of the Member States of\r\nheavy grade oil in single-hull oil tankers.\nThis Regulation makes mandatory the application\r\nof the IMO's Condition Assessment Scheme (CAS) to single hull oil tankers above\r\n15 years of age. Article 5 requires such tankers to comply with the CAS, which\r\nis then defined in Article 6 as the Condition Assessment Scheme adopted by\r\nResolution MEPC 94(46) of 27 April 2001 as amended by Resolution MEPC 99(48) of\r\n11 October 2002 and by Resolution MEPC 112(50) of 4 December 2003. The Enhanced\r\nProgramme of Inspections during surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers or\r\nEnhanced Survey Programme (ESP) specifies how to undertake this intensified\r\nassessment. As CAS uses ESP as the tool to achieve its aim, any changes to the\r\nESP inspections will be directly and automatically be applicable through\r\nRegulation (EU) No 530/2012. \nTherefore, the amendments due to be adopted at\r\nMSC 94, which would introduce changes to the ESP Code, would affect EU law,\r\nthrough the application of Regulation (EU) No 530/2012.\n3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary\nIn view of the relevant EU legislation above,\r\nthe Commission considers that the adoption of the above-cited amendments\r\nexpected to be adopted at MSC 94 comes under EU exclusive competence, which the\r\nUnion has acquired pursuant to Article 3(2) TFEU, in so far as the adoption of\r\nthe international instruments at stake affect common rules. \nConsistent with a well consolidated body of\r\ncase law, even if the Union is not a member of IMO, the Member States are not\r\nauthorised to assume obligations likely to affect EU rules promulgated for the\r\nattainment of the objectives of the Treaties, unless they are authorised to do\r\nso by means of a Council decision, on a proposal by the Commission \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONCLUSION\nThe Commission therefore proposes a Council\r\nDecision on the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union for the\r\namendments cited in paras 1.2 to 1.3 above to be adopted at the 94th\r\nsession of the Maritime Safety Committee respectively.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n2014/0291 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted on behalf of\r\nthe European Union at the International Maritime Organization during the 94th\r\nsession of the Maritime Safety Committee on the adoption of amendments to the\r\n2011 Enhanced Survey Programme Code\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) and Article\r\n218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Action by the European\r\nUnion in the sector of maritime transport should aim to improve maritime\r\nsafety.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMO Maritime Safety\r\nCommittee (MSC) meeting at its 93rd session approved amendments to\r\nthe 2011 Enhanced Survey Programme Code. Those amendments are expected to be\r\nadopted in the 94th session of the MSC, to be held in November 2014.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to the 2011\r\nEnhanced Survey Programme (ESP) Code bring it into line with the practices of\r\nclassification societies and also allow under certain conditions hydrostatic\r\ntesting of cargo tanks by the ship's crew, under the direction of the master,\r\nin lieu of carrying out such testing in the presence of a surveyor. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Articles 5 and 6 of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 530/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[2] make mandatory the\r\napplication of the IMO's Condition Assessment Scheme (CAS) to single hull oil\r\ntankers above 15 years of age. The Enhanced Programme of Inspections during\r\nsurveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil tankers or Enhanced Survey Programme (ESP)\r\nspecifies how to undertake this intensified assessment. As CAS uses ESP as the\r\ntool to achieve its aim, any changes to the ESP inspections will automatically\r\nbe applicable through Regulation (EU) No 530/2012. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union is neither a\r\nmember of the IMO nor a contracting party to the conventions and codes\r\nconcerned. It is therefore necessary for the Council to authorise the Member\r\nStates to express the position of the Union and express their consent to be\r\nbound by these amendments.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position of the Union\r\nat the 94th session of the IMO Maritime Safety Committee shall be to\r\nagree to the adoption of the amendments to the 2011 Enhanced Survey Programme\r\nCode as laid down in Annex 22 of the IMO document MSC 93/22/Add.3.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position of the Union\r\nas set out in paragraph 1 shall be expressed by the Member States, which are\r\nmembers of IMO, acting jointly in the interest of the Union.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Formal and minor changes\r\nto this position may be agreed without requiring that position to be amended.\nArticle 2\nMember States are hereby authorised to give\r\ntheir consent to be bound, in the interest of the Union, by the amendments\r\nreferred to in Article 1(1).\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member\r\nStates.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 172, 30.6.2012, p.3\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 530/2012 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council on the accelerated phasing-in of double hull or\r\nequivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers \n(OJ L 172,\r\n30.6.2012, p.3)\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
