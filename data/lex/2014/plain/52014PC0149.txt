On 10 May 2010, the\r\nCouncil authorised the Commission to open negotiations for a new comprehensive\r\nand ambitious Association Agreement, including its Deep and Comprehensive Free\r\nTrade Area (DCFTA) part. \nNegotiations of this\r\ncomprehensive and ambitious Agreement between the EU and Georgia were launched\r\nin July 2010. Negotiations on the DCFTA part of the Agreement were launched in\r\nFebruary 2012. On 29 November 2013 the European Union and Georgia initialled\r\nthe text of the Agreement.\nThe Association\r\nAgreement aims to accelerate the deepening of political and economic relations\r\nbetween Georgia and the EU, as well as to advance Georgia's gradual economic\r\nintegration with the EU Internal Market in selected areas, notably through\r\nestablishing a DCFTA.\nIn line with Article\r\n429 of the Association Agreement, it is foreseen to provisionally apply parts\r\nof the Agreement. The provisional application is foreseen in view of keeping\r\nmutual economic interests and shared values in equilibrium, and the common will\r\nof the EU and Georgia to start implementing and enforcing the eligible parts of\r\nthe Agreement in order to advance an early reform impact on sector specific\r\nissues before the conclusion of the Agreement. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\r\nOF THE NEGOTIATIONS\nThe Council has been\r\nregularly informed and consulted in the relevant Council Working Groups,\r\nnotably in COEST and the Trade Policy Committee (TPC), at all stages of the\r\nnegotiations. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council\r\nin its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft Association\r\nAgreement is acceptable to the Union.\nThe final content of\r\nthe Association Agreement can be summarised as follows:\nThe Agreement establishes\r\nan association between the Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and\r\ntheir Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part. This constitutes\r\na new stage in the development of EU-Georgia contractual relations, aiming at\r\npolitical association and economic integration and leaving open the way for\r\nfurther progressive developments. \nThe overall aims of the\r\nassociation focus on promoting a gradual rapprochement between the parties on\r\nthe basis of common values; strengthening the framework for enhanced political\r\ndialogue; promoting, preserving and strengthening peace and stability in both\r\nthe regional and international dimensions; promoting cooperation on peaceful\r\nconflict resolution, establishing conditions for enhanced economic and trade\r\nrelations leading towards Georgia's gradual economic integration with the EU internal\r\nmarket in selected areas; enhancing justice, freedom and security cooperation\r\nwith the aim of reinforcing the rule of law and respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, and establishing conditions for increasingly close\r\ncooperation in other areas of mutual interest. \nThe Association\r\nAgreement also foresees a wide range of sector cooperation, focusing on support\r\nto core reforms, economic recovery and growth, governance and sector\r\ncooperation in 28 areas, such as; energy, transport, environment protection and\r\npromotion, industrial and small and medium enterprise cooperation, agriculture\r\nand rural development, social policies, justice, civil society cooperation, consumer\r\npolicy, public administration reform, education, training and youth as well as\r\ncultural cooperation. In all of these areas, enhanced cooperation starts from\r\nthe basis of current frameworks, both bilateral and multilateral, with the aim\r\nof more systematic dialogue and exchange of information and good practice. Key\r\nto the sectoral cooperation chapters is a comprehensive menu of gradual\r\napproximation with the EU acquis set out in annexes to the Agreement.\r\nSpecific schedules for approximation and implementation by Georgia of selected parts of the EU acquis will provide a focus for on-going cooperation, and\r\nwill form the core of Georgia's domestic reform and modernisation agenda. \nThe Agreement includes\r\nan updated institutional framework encompassing cooperation and dialogue fora.\r\nSpecific decision-making roles are foreseen for an Association Council, and by\r\ndelegation for an Association Committee, which may also meet in a specific\r\nconfiguration to address trade issues. Fora for civil society and parliamentary\r\ncooperation are also foreseen. The Agreement also includes provisions on\r\nmonitoring, fulfilment of obligations and dispute settlement (including\r\nseparate provisions for trade-related issues). \nCloser economic integration through the DCFTA\r\nwill be a powerful stimulant to the country's economic growth. Approximation of\r\n  Georgia with EU legislation, norms and standards, will be the method. As a\r\ncore element of the Association Agreement, the DCFTA will create business\r\nopportunities in both the EU and Georgia and will promote real economic\r\nmodernization and gradual integration with the EU. Higher standards of\r\nproducts, better services to citizens, and above all Georgia's ability to\r\ncompete effectively in international markets should be the result of this\r\nprocess. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nOn the part of the Union, the legal basis for the\r\nconclusion of this Agreement is Article 217, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and the second\r\nsubparagraph of Article 218(8), as well as Article 218(7) of TFEU.\nThe attached proposal constitutes the legal instrument for\r\nthe conclusion of the Association Agreement on behalf of the Union.
