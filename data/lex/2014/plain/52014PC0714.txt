Such acts should\r\nbe removed from the law acquis of the European Union to improve transparency and give a\r\nhigher degree of certainty for all\r\ncitizens and all Member States.\nThis is in line\r\nwith the Commission's policy on Regulatory Fitness. In its Communication of\r\nJune 2014 on \"Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT): State\r\nof Play and Outlook\"[2],\r\nthe Commission stated that it was screening the acquis in respect of\r\npolice cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to\r\nidentify acts which could be repealed in the context of the expiry of the\r\ntransitional period set out in the Treaties. \nThe Commission has now completed its assessment on the\r\nlegal acts related to the area of freedom, security and justice, including the former\r\nthird pillar acquis. A number of acts adopted in recent decades have\r\nexhausted all their effects. They are no longer relevant because of their\r\ntemporary nature or because their content has been taken up by successive acts.\r\nFor reasons of legal certainty, the Commission proposes that the measures\r\nreferred to in this proposal are repealed by the European Parliament and the Council.\r\n\nI. Decision of the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex\r\n(93)14 on improving practical judicial cooperation for combating drug\r\ntrafficking[3]\r\nhas only addressed the situation when a Member State refused practical judicial cooperation in combating drug trafficking. That Decision became obsolete since entry\r\ninto force of the Convention on Mutual assistance in Criminal matters\r\nbetween the Member States of the European Union[4] that provides for a broader co-operation among Member States\r\nalso in the drug policy area.\nII. Declaration of the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex\r\n(97) decl. 13 rev 2[5] addressed the situations of the abductions of minors or the\r\nunlawful removal of a minor by one of the parents from the person to whom the\r\nright of custody has been attributed. That Declaration became obsolete after\r\nthe entry into force of Regulation 562/2006[6] and Commission\r\nImplementing Decision 2013/115/EU[7]\r\nproviding for new rules on the check of minors crossing an external border and in\r\nrelation to the corresponding activities of the SIRENE bureau. \nIII. Decision\r\nof the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (98) 52[8] adopted the Schengen handbook on cross-border\r\npolice cooperation assisting Member States in carrying out cross-border\r\noperations. That Decision became obsolete after the handbook's content has been\r\nincluded in the more recent Updated catalogue of recommendations for the\r\ncorrect application of the Schengen acquis and best practices: police\r\ncooperation[9],\r\nHandbook on cross-border operations[10]\r\nand Compendium on law enforcement liaison officers[11].\nIV. Council\r\nDecision 2008/173/EC[12]\r\nset out the detailed scope, organization, coordination and validation procedures\r\nfor certain Schengen Information System II (SIS II) tests with the aim to\r\nassess whether during the development phase the SIS II could work in accordance\r\nwith the technical and functional requirements as defined in the SIS II legal\r\ninstruments. That Decision exhausted its legal effect once the SIS II went live\r\non 9 April 2013.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\r\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nDialogue on identifying legal measures of the former third pillar acquis\r\nthat became obsolete took place during 2014 among the Commission and the\r\nrepresentatives of the Member States and of the Council Secretariat within the\r\nFriends of the Presidency Group that has been activated with a view to\r\nexamining all the issues linked to the end of the 5 year transitional period\r\nset out in Article 10 of Protocol 36 to the Treaties.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nSummary\r\nof the proposed measures\nThe\r\nproposal repeals a number of legal measures in the field of police cooperation\r\nand judicial cooperation in criminal matters that have been identified as\r\nobsolete. \nLegal basis\nThe\r\nlegal basis for repealing Decision of the Executive Committee of 14 December 1993 on improving practical judicial cooperation for combating drug\r\ntrafficking (SCH/Com-ex (93)14) is Article 82 (1) (d) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union.\nThe\r\nlegal basis for repealing Declaration of the Executive Committee of 9 February\r\n1998 on the abduction of minors (SCH/Com-ex (97) decl. 13 rev 2) is Article\r\n87(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe legal basis for\r\nrepealing Decision of the Executive Committee of 16\r\nDecember 1998 on cross-border police cooperation in the area of crime\r\nprevention and detection (SCH/Com-ex (98) 52) is\r\nArticle 87(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe legal basis for\r\nrepealing Council Decision 2008/173/EC of 18 February\r\n2008 on the tests of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) is Article 87(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union.\n   Principles of subsidiarity and proportionality   The measures concerned by this proposal are obsolete, either because their content has been taken up by successive acts or because they are no longer relevant due to their temporary nature. Therefore, it is in line with the principles of subsidiarity and of proportionality to repeal those measures. It is for the Union legislator to adopt the necessary measures to that effect. \n   Choice of instrument   \n Proposed instrument: European Parliament and Council decision. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe\r\nproposal has no budgetary impact.\n2014/0338 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nrepealing certain acts in the field of\r\npolice cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 82(1)(d) and Article\r\n87(2)(a) and (c) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Improving the transparency\r\nof Union law is an essential element of the better law-making strategy that the\r\ninstitutions of the Union are implementing. In that context it is appropriate\r\nto remove from the legislation in force those acts which no longer serve any\r\npurpose.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A number of acts adopted\r\nin the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters\r\nare no longer relevant due to their temporary nature or because\r\ntheir content has been taken up\r\nby successive acts, even though they have not\r\nbeen repealed.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision of the Executive\r\nCommittee SCH/Com-ex (93)14[13] aimed at improving practical judicial cooperation for combating\r\ndrug trafficking only for cases of refusal of cooperation by a Member State. That decision became obsolete since entry into force of the Convention on Mutual assistance in Criminal matters\r\nbetween the Member States of the European Union[14] that provides for a broader co-operation among Member\r\nStates in the drug policy.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Declaration\r\nof the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (97) decl. 13 rev 2[15] addressed the situations of the abductions of minors or the\r\nunlawful removal of a minor by one of the parents from the person to whom the\r\nright of custody has been attributed. That declaration became obsolete after\r\nthe entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council[16] and Commission\r\nImplementing Decision 2013/115/EU[17] providing for new rules on the check of minors crossing an external\r\nborder and in relation to the corresponding activities of the SIRENE bureaus.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision\r\nof the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (98) 52[18] adopted the Schengen handbook on cross-border police cooperation assisting\r\nMember States in carrying out cross-border operations. That decision became\r\nobsolete after the handbook's content has been included in the more recent\r\nUpdated catalogue of recommendations for the correct application of the\r\nSchengen acquis and best practices: police cooperation, Handbook on\r\ncross-border operations and Compendium on law enforcement liaison officers.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nDecision 2008/173/EC[19] set out the detailed scope, organization, coordination and\r\nvalidation procedures for certain tests aiming at assessing whether the\r\nSchengen Information System II (SIS II) complies with the technical and\r\nfunctional requirements as defined in the SIS II legal instruments. That decision\r\nexhausted its legal effect once the SIS II started operation on 9 April 2013.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For reasons of legal\r\ncertainty and clarity, those obsolete Decisions and Declarations should be\r\nrepealed.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of\r\nthis Decision, namely the repeal of a number of obsolete Union acts in the\r\nfield of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters cannot\r\nbe achieved by Member States but only at Union level, this Decision complies\r\nwith the requirements of the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5\r\nof the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out\r\nin that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\r\nachieve that objective.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n1 of the Protocol No 22 on the Position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on\r\nEuropean Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Decision constitutes a\r\ndevelopment of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland is taking\r\npart in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis\r\ninto the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European\r\nUnion and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and Article\r\n6(2) of Council Decision 2002/192/EC[20].\r\n\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 24 July 2013, the United Kingdom made the notification referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 10(4)\r\nof Protocol (No 36) on transitional provisions that it does not accept, with\r\nrespect to the acts referred to in Article 10(1) of that Protocol, the\r\npowers of the institutions referred to in Article 10(1) of Protocol.
