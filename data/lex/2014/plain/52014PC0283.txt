This proposal concerns a number of agricultural and industrial\r\nproducts. The suspension requests were examined in the light of the criteria\r\nset out in the Communication from the Commission concerning autonomous tariff\r\nsuspensions and quotas (OJ C 363, 13.12.2011, p. 6). Following this review, the\r\nCommission considers that the suspension of duties is justified for the\r\nproducts listed in Annex I of this proposal. Also, Annex I lists i) products\r\nfor which the wording of their description had to be changed and ii) products\r\nfor which a new CN or TARIC code became necessary.\nProducts for which tariff suspension is no\r\nlonger in the Union's economic interests have to be withdrawn. Accordingly,\r\nAnnex II lists the products removed from the Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013\r\nand products for which the wording of their description had to be changed, or\r\nproducts for which a new CN or TARIC code became necessary, which are replaced\r\nby new description and/or codes in Annex I.\nThe list of relevant supplementary units in\r\nthe Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 should be updated. Thus, Annex III\r\ncontains the list of codes of the supplementary units of the products listed in\r\nAnnex I of this proposal and Annex IV of the attached proposal lists codes of\r\nthe supplementary units of the products removed from the Annex I of the above\r\nmentioned Regulation.\nThe proposal is in line with the trade,\r\nenterprise, development and external relations policies.\nParticularly, this proposal is not at the\r\nexpense of countries enjoying a preferential trading agreement with the EU\r\n(e.g. GSP, ACP regime, candidate countries and potential candidates).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Economic Tariff Questions Group, in\r\nwhich the competent authorities of all Member State are represented, was\r\nconsulted. All listed suspensions correspond to agreements or compromises\r\nreached in the discussions of the group.\nThere was no mention of potentially serious\r\nrisks with irreversible consequences.\nFurthermore, the whole scheme of autonomous\r\nsuspensions was subject to an evaluation study which was carried out in 2013\r\nand completed beginning of December 2013 (http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/common/publications/studies/evaluation_suspensions_duties.pdf).\nThis proposal will follow an inter-service\r\nconsultation procedure and will be published after its adoption by the Council.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis of this regulation proposal\r\nis Article 31 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\nBy virtue of Article 31 of the TFEU\r\nautonomous tariff suspensions and quotas are fixed by the Council acting on qualified\r\nmajority on the basis of a Commission proposal, therefore a regulation is the\r\nappropriate instrument.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiary principle therefore does not apply.\nThe proposal complies with the principle of\r\nproportionality as this set of measures is in line with the principles set out\r\nto simplify the procedures for the operators engaged in foreign trade and in\r\naccordance with the Commission communication concerning autonomous tariff\r\nsuspensions and quotas (C 363, 13.12.2011 p.6).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nUncollected customs duties of a total\r\namount of approximately 91,8 Mio \u20ac/year. The effect on the\r\ntraditional own resources of the budget is -68,8 Mio \u20ac/year (75% x 91.8 Mio \u20ac/year).\n2014/0148 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013\r\nsuspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain agricultural\r\nand industrial products\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is in the interest of\r\nthe Union to suspend totally the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on 98 new\r\nproducts currently not listed in Annex I to Council Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013[1]. Those new products should therefore be inserted in that Annex.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is no longer in the\r\ninterest of the Union to maintain the suspension of autonomous Common Customs\r\nTariff duties for 7 of the products which are currently listed in Annex I to\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1387/2013. Those products should therefore be deleted from\r\nthat Annex.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to modify\r\nthe product descriptions of 75 suspensions included in Annex I to\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1387/2013 in order to take account of\r\ntechnical product developments, economic trends on the market or to carry out linguistic\r\nadaptations. Moreover, TARIC codes for four further products should be changed.\r\nIn addition, for three further products, multiple classification is necessary. The\r\nsuspensions for which modifications are necessary should be deleted from the\r\nlist of suspensions in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013,\r\nand the modified suspensions should be inserted in that list.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For four products it is\r\nnecessary, in the interest of the Union, to amend the date for their mandatory\r\nreview in order to allow duty free imports beyond that date. Those products have\r\nbeen reviewed and given revised dates for their next mandatory review.\r\nTherefore, they should be deleted from the list of suspensions in Annex I to\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1387/2013 and, after the necessary\r\nmodifications, reintroduced into that list.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to re-group\r\nfour products falling under four different product descriptions. Those four products\r\nshould now be covered by two product descriptions. Furthermore, the double\r\nclassification of those four suspensions has become superfluous and should therefore\r\nbe amended. The suspensions relating to the four products should therefore be\r\ndeleted from the list of suspensions in Annex I to\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1387/2013 and the modified suspensions should\r\nbe reinserted in that list.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the interest of\r\nclarity, the modified entries should be marked with an asterisk.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex II to Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1387/2013 should be completed with supplementary units for certain of\r\nthe new products for which suspensions are granted in order to allow an appropriate\r\nstatistical monitoring. For reasons of consistency, the supplementary units\r\nassigned to the products removed from Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013\r\nshould also be deleted from Annex II to that Regulation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the amendments laid\r\ndown in this Regulation have to take effect on 1 July 2014, this\r\nRegulation should apply from that date and enter into force on the day of its\r\npublication in the Official Journal of the European Union,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nAnnex I to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 is\r\namended as follows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 between the title and the\r\ntable, the following note is inserted:\n\u2018(*) Suspension relating to a product in this Annex\r\nwith regard to which the CN or TARIC code or the product description or the mandatory\r\nreview date were amended by Council Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2014 of \u2026 amending\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1387/2013 suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff\r\nduties on certain agricultural and industrial products (OJ \u2026)\u2019;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the rows for the products\r\nlisted in Annex I to this Regulation are inserted following\r\nthe order of the CN codes indicated in the first column of the table contained\r\nin Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013;\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the rows for the products\r\nfor which the CN and TARIC codes are set out in Annex II to this Regulation are\r\ndeleted.\nArticle 2\nAnnex II to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 is\r\namended as follows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the rows for the\r\nsupplementary units for which the CN and TARIC codes are set out in Annex III to\r\nthis Regulation are added;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the rows for the\r\nsupplementary units for which the CN and TARIC codes are set out in Annex IV to\r\nthis Regulation are deleted.\nArticle 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:\nCouncil Regulation amending Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013\r\nsuspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain agricultural\r\nand industrial products\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGET LINES:\nChapter and Article: Chapter 12, Article\r\n120\nAmount budgeted for the year 2014: \u20ac 16 185 600\r\n000 \u20ac (B 2014)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FINANCIAL IMPACT:\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial implications\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial impact on\r\nexpenditure but has a financial impact on revenue \u2013 the effect is as follows:\n(\u20ac\r\nmillion to one decimal place)\n Budget line || Revenue[2] || 6 month period, starting dd/mm/aaaa || [Year: 2/2014] \n Article 120 || Impact on own resources || 01/07/2014 || -34.4  \n(\u20ac\r\nmillion to one decimal place)\n Situation following action \n   || [2015 \u2013 2018] \n Article 120 || -

The\r\nuncollected duties corresponding to these suspensions, calculated on the basis\r\nof requesting Member State projections for the period 2013 to 2017, amount to\r\n53,7 Mio \u20ac/year.\nOn the basis of the existing statistics for\r\npreceding years, it would appear, however, necessary to increase this amount by\r\nan average factor, estimated at 1,8 to take account of imports into other\r\nMember States using the same suspensions. This means uncollected duties loss of\r\nrevenue of some 96,7 Mio \u20ac /year.\nWithdrawal:\n7 products have been withdrawn from this Annex\r\nreflecting the reintroduction of customs duties. This represents an increase\r\nof\u00a0 4,9 Mio \u20ac in resources, as estimated on the basis of 2013 statistics.\nEstimated cost of this operation\nOn the basis of the above, the impact on the\r\nloss of revenue resulting from this Regulation may be estimated at 96,7 \u20134,9  = 91,8 Mio\r\n\u20ac (gross amount, including collection costs) x 0,75 = 68,8 Mio\r\n\u20ac/year for the
