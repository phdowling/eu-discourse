Annex II to this Agreement provides for the coordination of\r\nsocial security schemes.\nUnder Article 18 of the Agreement, the\r\nJoint Committee on the free movement of persons may amend Annex II to the\r\nAgreement. Article 2 of Decision 2002/309/EC[1],\r\nprovides that the Council, following a proposal from the Commission, will lay\r\ndown the position to be taken by the Union on decisions by the Joint Committee.\nTo ensure the consistent and correct\r\napplication of EU legislation, and to avoid administrative and possible legal\r\ndifficulties, Annex II to the Agreement needs to refer to all relevant EU\r\nlegislation and decisions of the Administrative Commission for the Coordination\r\nof Social Security Systems. Annex II to the Agreement was therefore replaced by\r\nDecision No 1/2012 of the Joint Committee of 31 March 2012. This Decision\r\ncreated a modernised system to coordinate social security schemes, which had\r\nbecome applicable within the EU on 1 May 2010, under Regulation (EC) No\r\n883/2004 (as amended by Regulation (EC) No 988/2009), implementing Regulation\r\nNo 987/2009 and the decisions and recommendations of the Administrative\r\nCommission. These three Regulations were also applicable to Switzerland.\nAnnex II to the Agreement now needs to be\r\namended to take account of the EU legislation that has come into force since\r\nthen, in particular amendments made by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1244/2010\r\nof 9 December 2010[2],\r\nRegulation (EU) No 465/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22\r\nMay 2012[3]\r\nand Commission Regulation (EU) No 1224/2012 of 18 December 2012[4] to Regulation (EC) No\r\n883/2004[5]\r\nand Regulation (EC) No 987/2009[6].\nTo that end, the Commission presents this proposal\r\nfor a Council Decision on position that the Union should take in the Joint\r\nCommittee established by the Agreement. Following the Court of Justice ruling\r\nof 27 February 2014 in case C-656/11 concerning the legal basis for taking\r\ndecisions, this proposal for a new Council Decision is based on Article 48 of\r\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjunction with\r\nArticle 218(9) of the same Treaty. This proposal takes into account the text of\r\nthe draft Joint Committee decision, agreed at service level with the Swiss\r\nauthorities on 14 March 2013, and supports the consistent application of EU\r\nlegislation on the coordination of social security systems between the EU and\r\nSwitzerland.\nAnnex II to this Agreement should also be amended to\r\ntake account of the the Swiss Federal\r\nSupplementary Benefits Act of 6 October 2006. This legal act replaced the one from 19 March 1965. The reason for the new law was the general revision of the tasks\r\ndistribution between the Federal State and the Cantons and their financing.\r\nNeither the benefits nor the entitlement conditions were modified by it. The characteristics\r\nand purpose of the benefits remain exactly the same. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe version of Annex II in the attached\r\nproposal results from technical discussions involving social security experts,\r\nin particular experts from the Swiss social security administration and from\r\nthe European Union. Updating Annex II to the Agreement will simplify and\r\nmodernise the coordination of social security systems between Switzerland and\r\nEU Member States, particularly through the implementation of Regulation (EU) No\r\n465/2012. This will have a positive impact compared with existing legislation,\r\nand will improve administrative procedures for all users of the Regulations,\r\nincluding national social security authorities, employers (in particular small\r\nand medium-sized businesses) and individual citizens.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal does not have implications for\r\nthe EU budget.\n2014/0283 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be taken by the\r\nEuropean Union in the Joint Committee established under the Agreement
