The Convention entered into force in the European\r\nUnion on 20 June 1983.\nThe purpose of the proposed Decision is for\r\nthe European Union to adopt the latest amendments to the TIR Convention agreed\r\nby the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Working Party on\r\nCustoms Questions Affecting Transport and further adopted by the Administrative\r\nCommittee for the TIR Convention, subject to completion of the EU's internal\r\nprocedures.\nOn 6 February 2014 the Administrative\r\nCommittee for the TIR Convention adopted at its 57th session in Geneva proposals of amendments to Annex 1 and Annex 6 to the text of the Convention. On 12\r\nJune 2014 the Administrative Committee for the TIR Convention adopted at its 58th\r\nsession in Geneva a proposal of an amendment to Annex 9 to the text of the\r\nConvention. The proposals will be transmitted to the UN Secretary-General, in\r\naccordance with the provisions of Article 59 (1) and (2) and Article 60 of the\r\nConvention and shall enter into force on 1 January 2015, unless, by 1 October\r\n2014, at least five Contracting Parties notify the UN Secretary-General their\r\nobjections to the amendments.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General context\nThe TIR Convention, which is administered\r\nby the UNECE, has established a customs transit procedure for the international\r\nmovement of goods by road. The Convention enables goods, which are under\r\ncustoms and tax suspension, to cross international borders with a minimum of\r\nintervention en route by the customs authorities. By easing traditional\r\nimpediments to the international movement of goods, the TIR system encourages\r\nthe development of international trade. By reducing delays in transit, it\r\nenables significant economies to be made in transport costs. The most important\r\nadvantage of the system is the fact that the TIR Convention provides, through\r\nits international guarantee chain, relatively simple access to the required\r\nguarantees.\nThe UNECE Working Party on Customs\r\nQuestions Affecting Transport and the Administrative Committee for the TIR\r\nConvention agreed that some modifications of the TIR Convention are necessary.\r\nThese modifications concern:\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe amendment of Annex 1, Model of the TIR\r\nCarnet:VERSION 2, point 5 and Annex 6, Explanatory Note to Article 8, paragraph\r\n3, point 5 as a result of the amendments to the International Convention on the\r\nHarmonised Commodity Description and Coding system (HS Convention), in\r\nparticular a creation of a separate subheading in heading 24.03 for water pipe\r\ntobacco \n\u00b7                        \r\nthe amendment of Annex 6 introducing two new\r\nExplanatory Notes to Annex 9, Part II, paragraphs 4 and 5 regarding the\r\ntransmission of the data on authorised TIR operators using the International\r\nTIR Data Bank (ITDB) online+ application\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe amendment of Annex 6 introducing a new\r\nExplanatory Note to Article 38 paragraph 2 regarding transmission of data on\r\nexclusions to TIR Executive Board (TIRExB) using the ITDB online+ application \n\u00b7                        \r\nthe amendment of Annex 6 introducing two new\r\nExplanatory Notes to Annex 8, Article 9, paragraph 1 and 2 concerning the\r\nrepresentation and the election of a TIRExB replacement member\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe amendment of Annex 9, Part I, paragraph 3\r\n(vi) by replacing the existing wording on the deadline of 1 March by an\r\nimproved text. \n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing provisions in the\r\narea of the proposal\nThere are no existing provisions in the\r\narea of the proposal.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with the other\r\npolicies and objectives of the Union\nThe proposed Decision is consistent with\r\nthe common policy in trade and transport. The TIR system, providing\r\nfacilitation in road transport, allows goods to travel across 68 Contracting\r\nParties with a minimum of interference by customs administrations and provides,\r\nthrough an international guarantee chain, relatively simple access to the\r\nrequired guarantees. The simplifications achieved through the TIR Convention\r\nare in line with the revised Lisbon strategy.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of interested\r\nparties\nConsultation methods, main sectors\r\ntargeted and general profile of respondents\nConsultations with approval on the proposals\r\nwere carried out with the Member States within the Customs Legislation\r\nCommittee (Co-ordination Geneva) meetings. Consultations took place during sessions\r\nof the UNECE Working Party on Customs Questions Affecting Transport and the\r\nAdministrative Committee for the TIR Convention.\nSummary of responses and how they\r\nhave been taken into account\nFavourable opinion.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Collection and use of\r\nexpertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nThe proposed amendment to HS code 24.03.10\r\nis caused by the amendments to the codes of the Harmonised system and does not\r\nalter the original product coverage. It leads to an alignment of the provisions\r\nin the transit area.\nThe amendments introducing the possibility\r\nto transmit legaly required data on authorised TIR operators and data on\r\nexclusions using the ITDB online+ application instead of sending these data in\r\nany other form (on paper or by email) introduce a facilitation tool for customs\r\nauthorities using the ITDB online+ application. This web application, managed\r\nby the UNECE TIR Secretariat, facilitates the management of the national TIR\r\nCarnet holder's data. The transmission of data into ITDB using electronic means\r\ncould become mandatory at some point in the future. \nThe amendments in the procedure regarding\r\nthe by-election and representation of the TIRExB clarify the situation after a\r\nresignation of the TIRExB member and outline the profesional requirements for\r\nthe prospective TIRExB members.\u00a0 \nAll the proposed amendments to Annex 6 do\r\nnot change the substance of the TIR Convention as according to Article 43 of\r\nthe TIR Convention the explanatory notes interpret certain provisions of the\r\nTIR Convention and its Annexes and describe certain recommended practices.\u00a0 \nThe amendment on the wording on the\r\ndeadline in Annex 9, Part I, paragraph 3 (vi) will ensure proper understanding\r\nof the current obligation for the national association to provide the TIRExB\r\nannually with the prices of each type of TIR carnet it issues.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of the proposed\r\naction\nThe proposed Decision lays down the\r\nposition to be taken by the European Union concerning the proposal to amend the\r\nCustoms Convention on the International Transport of goods under cover of TIR\r\ncarnets.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nArticles 207 and 218 (9) of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls within an area of\r\nexclusive competence of the European Union (common commercial policy) and\r\ntherefore does not deserve an examination with regard to the principle of\r\nsubsidiarity (Article 5 (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion).\nThe proposed amendments were preliminarily\r\nadopted by the UNECE Working Party on Customs Questions Affecting Transport and\r\nAdministrative Committee for the TIR Convention.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\nThe proposal is in conformity with the\r\nprinciple of proportionality. It allows the implementation of an amendment to\r\nthe international agreement which as such respects the principle of\r\nproportionality.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instruments\nProposed instrument: Decision.\nInternational agreements and amendments to\r\nthese arrangements are normally introduced into the European Union's legal\r\norder by way of a Decision.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the European\r\nUnion budget.\n2014/0225 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf\r\nof the European Union, on the proposal to amend the Customs Convention on the\r\nInternational Transport of goods under cover of TIR carnets (TIR Convention\r\n1975)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207, in\r\nconjunction with Article 218 (9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Customs Convention on\r\nthe International Transport of goods under cover of TIR Carnets (TIR\r\nConvention) of 14 November 1975 was approved on behalf of the European Economic\r\n Community by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2112/78 of 25 July 1978[1]and entered into force in the European Union on 20 June 1983[2].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A consolidated version of\r\nthe TIR Convention was published as Annex to Council Decision 2009/477/EC of 28\r\nMay 2009[3],\r\naccording to which the Commission shall publish future amendments to the\r\nConvention in the Official Journal of the European Union indicating their date of\r\nentry into force.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Various amendments to the\r\nInternational Convention on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding\r\nsystem (HS Convention) have been agreed. These amendments entered into force\r\nfor all Contracting Parties to the HS Convention on 1 January 2012. The\r\namendments make it necessary to amend the Model of the TIR Carnet and a\r\nreference in the Explanatory note. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\r\nintroduction of ITDB online+, an international repository of information\r\nconcerning all persons authorised by Contracting Parties to use the TIR procedure,\r\nthe Administrative Committee for the TIR Convention agreed that using ITDB\r\nonline+ to transmit to ITDB the legally required data on authorized TIR\r\noperators makes submission of such data in any other form, for example, on\r\npaper or by e-mail, redundant. To clarify this principle in the text of the\r\nConvention, the Committee advocated the introduction of two new Explanatory\r\nNotes. A similar Explanatory Note is proposed regarding transmission of data on\r\nexclusions to TIR Executive Board (TIRExB). \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the discussion\r\nof the TIRExB on the professional requirements for the nomination of TIRExB\r\nmembers and on the intermediate election of replacement TIRExB members, including\r\nconsiderations how to amend the existing Rules of Procedures, the TIRExB transmitted\r\nto the Administrative Committee for the TIR Convention proposals for two new\r\nExplanatory Notes. The first proposed Explanatory Note aims to address the profesional\r\nrequirements of prospective TIRExB members, in order to signal to Contracting\r\nParties how to best proceed when nominating a candidate. The second new\r\nExplanatory Note recommends the practice to follow in case a member of the\r\nTIRExB resigns or is unable to complete his/her mandated term of office. It\r\nalso gives the Administrative Committee for the TIR Convention an opportunity\r\nto decide whether the by-election will take place.\u00a0 The amendment to Rules of\r\nProcedures of the TIRExB containing both modifications were adopted at its 49th\r\nand 50th sessions. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An amendment of the Annex\r\n9, Part I of the Convention entered into force on 1 January 2012 (OJ L66/1 from\r\n6 March 2012) and introduced, among others, a new obligation for the national\r\nassociations to provide the TIRExB with the prices of TIR Carnets. However the\r\ndeadline to fulfill this obligation was not very clear. The proposed amendment\r\nwill clarify this deadline.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its 57th and\r\n58th session in February 2014 the Administrative Committee for the\r\nTIR Convention adopted the proposed amendments of the TIR Convention, subject\r\nto the completion of the Union's internal procedures.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the Union\r\nposition concerning the proposed amendment should be determined,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe position to be taken by the European\r\nUnion in the Administrative Committee for the TIR Convention shall be based on\r\nthe draft amendments attached to this Decision.\nMinor changes to the draft amendments may\r\nbe agreed to by the representatives of the Union in the Administrative\r\nCommittee for the TIR Convention without further decision of the Council.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\nday of its adoption.\nThe\r\nCommission shall publish the amendment, once adopted, in the Official Journal\r\nof the European Union indicating its date of entry into force.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 252, 14.09.1978, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 31, 2.2.1983, p. 13.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 165, 26.6.2009, p. 1.\nAmendments to the Customs Convention on\r\nthe International Transport of Goods Under the Cover of TIR Carnets (TIR\r\nConvention 1975)\nAnnex 1, page 11, point (5) \nFor HS code:\r\n24.03.10 read HS code: 24.03.11 and 24.03.19 (ECE/TRANS/WP.30/AC.2/113,\r\npara. 35)\nAnnex 6, Explanatory Note 0.8.3, point\r\n(5)\nFor HS code:\r\n24.03.10 read HS code: 24.03.11 and 24.03.19 (ECE/TRANS/WP.30/AC.2/113,\r\npara. 35)\nAnnex 6, new Explanatory Note 0.38.2 \nAdd a new\r\nExplanatory Note to Article 38, paragraph 2 to read\nExplanatory Note to paragraph 2\n0.38.2  The legal requirement to notify the\r\nTIR Executive Board that a person has been temporarily or permanently excluded\r\nfrom the operation of the Convention is deemed to be fulfilled by means of the\r\nproper use of electronic applications developed to this end by the TIR\r\nsecretariat under the supervision of the TIR Executive Board.\r\n(ECE/TRANS/WP.30/AC.2/115, para. 43)\nAnnex 6, New Explanatory Notes 8.9.1\nAdd new\r\nExplanatory Note to Annex 8, Article 9, paragraph 1 to read\n8.9.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The members of the TIR Executive\r\nBoard shall be competent and experienced in the application of Customs\r\nprocedures, particularly the TIR transit procedure, both at national and\r\ninternational levels.
