It also (re)establishes the European network of Employment Services,\r\ncalled EURES, the purpose of which will be to provide assistance with job\r\nsearch and recruitment across Member States. A similar network is active today\r\non the basis of a Commission Decision adopted in 2012[2]. Therefore, upon\r\nadoption of this Regulation, the Commission will repeal the above Decision on\r\nthe functioning of the current EURES network. \nArticle 45 of the Treaty secures the\r\nfreedom of movement for workers within the Union while Article 46 sets out the\r\nmeasures to bring about this freedom, in particular by ensuring close\r\ncooperation between the Public Employment Services ('PES'). The Commission also\r\nrecently introduced a proposal to establish a network of PES[3] to deepen cooperation\r\nand mutual learning based on Article 149 of the Treaty. That network will cover\r\na wider range of objectives and initiatives in the form of incentives and is\r\ncomplementary to this proposal. \u00a0\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rationale for the proposal\r\n\nFreedom of movement is one of the four\r\nfundamental freedoms of the European Union and a core element of EU\r\ncitizenship. Article 45 TFEU enshrines the right of EU citizens to move to\r\nanother Member State for work purposes.\nMobility generates social and economic\r\nbenefits. Increased intra-EU labour mobility will widen employment\r\nopportunities for workers and help employers fill job vacancies better and\r\nfaster. This contributes to the development of a European labour market with a\r\nhigh level of employment (Article 9 TFEU). \nIntra-EU labour mobility is relatively low\r\nwhen compared to the size of the labour market and the active population of the\r\nEU. Annual mobility within the former EU27 is 0.29%, below the rates of Australia (1.5% between 8 states) and the United States of America (2.4% between 50 states)[4]. Only approximately 7.5\r\nmillion of the European labour force of around 241 million (i.e. 3.1%) is\r\neconomically active in another Member State[5].\r\nAt present high unemployment rates in some Member States coexist with high\r\nnumbers of open job vacancies in others. \nThere has been a significant increase in\r\nthe number of workers that indicate \"firm intentions\" (i.e.: the\r\nproportion of those planning to migrate in the following 12 months) to move to\r\nwork abroad[6].\r\nRegistrations with EURES indicate that there is an increase in the number of\r\npeople looking for a job across national borders. The number of job seekers\r\nregistered on the EURES portal has increased from 175.000 to 1.200.000 between\r\n2007 and December 2013 without a corresponding increase in job mobility.\nToday only about 700.000 persons on average\r\nmove annually to work in another Member State[7],\r\nwhilst extrapolations on the surveys show that about 2.9 million EU citizens\r\nwould like to move in the following 12 months[8].\r\nThis represents a significant mobility potential and a\r\nchallenge for the EURES network.\nThere are many reasons why the potential\r\nfor intra-EU labour mobility remains untapped and individual citizens do not\r\nrealise their intentions to become mobile workers. Surveys[9] show that the most common practical\r\ndifficulties expected or encountered are the lack of relevant language\r\nknowledge and the difficulties in finding a job. The EU can contribute to\r\naddressing the latter by raising awareness on employment opportunities across the Union and developing appropriate support\r\nservices to encourage intra-EU recruitments. This will be the task of the reinforced\r\nEURES network.\nWhereas the functioning of the EURES network\r\nwas subject to some changes at the initiative of the Commission through its\r\n2012 Decision, the Chapter II of Regulation 492/2011 which constitutes the\r\nEuropean regulatory framework for the clearance and information exchange\r\nbetween Member States on intra-EU labour mobility has not been amended since\r\n1992. \nA comprehensive revision is needed to\r\nreflect new mobility patterns, enhanced requirement for fair mobility, changes\r\nin the technology for sharing job vacancy data, the use of a variety of recruitment\r\nchannels by job seekers and employers and an increasing role of other labour\r\nmarket brokers next to the Public Employment Services (PES) in the provision of\r\nrecruitment services. Fair mobility is understood as mobility which takes\r\nplaces on a voluntary basis and which respects labour law and labour standards\r\nas well as workers' rights within the Union. \nThe conclusions of the 28 and 29 June 2012\r\nEuropean Council on the Compact for Growth and Jobs recognize the political\r\nurgency to enhance intra EU labour mobility against the background of high\r\nunemployment rates: \"the EURES portal should be developed into a true\r\nEuropean placement and recruitment tool (\u2026)\". The conclusions of the\r\nEuropean Council of 13 and 14 December 2012 on the 2013 Annual Growth Survey\r\nand youth employment invited the Commission to propose a new EURES \u00a0regulation.\r\n\nIn its 2013 EU Citizenship Report[10] the Commission\r\ncommitted to put forward an initiative in 2013 to modernise EURES to enhance\r\nthe role and impact of employment services at national level and improve the\r\ncoordination of labour mobility in the EU (action 2). Modernising EURES is also\r\nincluded in the Commission Communication \u201cFree movement of EU citizens and\r\ntheir families: Five actions to make a difference\u201d[11] of 25 November 2013 as\r\npart of the action aiming at helping local authorities apply EU free movement\r\nrules on the ground (action 5). \nIn line with the request in the above\r\nconclusions of the 28 and 29 June 2012 European Council, the EURES network will\r\nalso be gradually extended to cover apprenticeships and traineeships. Employment\r\nthrough intra-EU recruitments for young people is supported by Your first EURES\r\njob (YfEJ). This scheme combines customised job search assistance with\r\nfinancial support for travel expenses for job interviews, job settlement etc.\r\nThe Commission intends to continue to support such schemes. The proposal for a\r\nRegulation should also reinforce the capacity of employment services to develop\r\npartnerships to bring about more intra-EU recruitments for young people. To\r\nensure coherence with ongoing initiatives at EU level, such as the Grand\r\nCoalition for Digital Jobs and the European Alliance for Apprenticeships, the\r\nEURES network is also called upon to actively promote the development of those\r\ninitiatives.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shortcomings in the EURES\r\nnetwork \nIn\r\nline with the Employment Package[12],\r\nthe Commission adopted in 2012 a Decision to modernise and reinforce the EURES\r\nnetwork[13].\r\nThe Decision replaces the 2003 Commission Decision[14] and aims to create\r\nincentives to strengthen matching, placement and recruitment activities within\r\nthe current EURES network, inter alia by opening up to Private\r\nEmployment Services ('PrES'), in as far as possible, without modifying the\r\nlegal basis (Regulation 492/2011).\u00a0 Commission Implementing Decision\r\n2012/733/EU entered into force on 1 January 2014. \nEvidence shows that the EURES network, with\r\nabout 900 advisers and a common platform for European job vacancy clearance -\r\nthe EURES portal - has helped many job seekers and employers in realising mobility\r\nopportunities. Those who reach out to this instrument and can use the services\r\nit offers, generally appreciate it. \nYet it is evident that the instrument as it\r\nfunctions today is not sufficiently equipped to encourage further fair mobility\r\npatterns as part of the solutions for the imbalances on the European labour\r\nmarket, particularly given the size of the EU labour force and the nature of\r\nthe challenge in the current economic situation. The following shortcomings in\r\nthe functioning of the EURES network have been identified: \n\u2013                        \r\nAn incomplete pool of job vacancies and CVs\r\naccessible at EU level for all Member States (transparency of labour markets);\n\u2013                        \r\nA limited matching capability of the EURES\r\nportal that brings job vacancies and CV's together at EU level, due to the\r\nlimited degree of semantic interoperability of data coming from national job vacancy\r\nsystems (automated matching potential);\n\u2013                        \r\nAn uneven access to EURES services across the EU\r\nas job seekers and employers do not receive systematically all the necessary\r\ninformation on EURES nor receive an offer for further assistance at the first\r\nstage of recruitment (mainstreaming);\n\u2013                        \r\nA limited availability to assist with matching,\r\nrecruitment and placement for those job seekers and employers who have\r\nindicated their interest in intra-EU labour mobility, including in gaining\r\naccess to both active labour market measures and information and advice on\r\nsocial security (support services); \n\u2013                        \r\nAn inefficient information exchange between Member States on labour shortages and surpluses, hampering a more targeted practical\r\nco-operation in the EURES network (information exchange and cooperation). \n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objectives of the proposal\r\n\nThe general objective is to make the EURES\r\nnetwork an effective instrument for any job seeker or employer interested in\r\nintra-EU labour mobility. The specific objectives of the proposal address the\r\nabove shortcomings as follows: \n\u2013                        \r\nto achieve on the EURES portal a nearly complete\r\nsupply of job vacancies, with job seekers all over Europe having instant access\r\nto the same vacancies, in combination with an extensive pool of CV\u2019s available\r\nfrom which registered employers can recruit; \n\u2013                        \r\nto enable the EURES portal to carry out a good\r\nautomated matching between job vacancies and CV\u2019s across Member States,\r\ntranslating in all EU languages and understanding skills, competences, qualifications\r\nand occupations acquired at national and sectoral level; \n\u2013                        \r\nto make available basic information about the\r\nEURES network throughout the Union to any job seeker or employer seeking client\r\nservices for recruitment and to consistently offer any person interested access\r\nto the EURES network; \n\u2013                        \r\nto assist any such person interested with\r\nmatching, placement and recruitment through the EURES network;\n\u2013                        \r\nto support the functioning of the EURES network\r\nthrough information exchange on national labour shortages and surpluses and the\r\ncoordination of actions across Member States.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultations with Member\r\nStates \nThe starting point for the 2012 Decision\r\nwas the 2010 evaluation of the EURES network[15].\r\nIn the context of the preparation towards the 2012 Decision, consultations have\r\ntaken place with Member States on current shortcomings and possible future\r\norientations for the EURES network. The Advisory Committee on 'Freedom of\r\nMovement of Workers' was formally consulted on the draft Decision in the autumn\r\nof 2012. The main aim of the Decision, to reorient the EURES services from\r\ngeneral information and guidance towards more matching, placement and\r\nrecruitment, was generally welcomed. All Member States have also supported the\r\nidea of a programming cycle and common indicators on EURES activities to\r\nincrease transparency on performance, enhance information exchange and improve\r\nthe coordination of actions. \nSince then individual Member States in\r\nexpert meetings have clarified their positions on the scope of possible\r\nimplementation measures in light of national practices and constraints. As a\r\nresult of these meetings, it was agreed to adjust the approach towards opening\r\nup the network to service providers other than the PES to allow Member States\r\nmore time and leeway on how to develop partnerships at national level.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultations with\r\npractitioners\nBuilding on the above consultations on the\r\nEURES network in general, questionnaires were sent out in 2013 to review\r\npractices on the access to job vacancies at national level, the access for job\r\nseekers and employers to the EURES network, and the organisation of matching,\r\nplacement and recruitment activities across the EURES network. The replies to\r\nthese questionnaires confirm the shortcomings identified by the Commission, as\r\nthey show a wide diversity in Member States on (a) which job vacancies are made\r\nsubject to European clearance (transparency of labour markets), (b) their\r\nstarting position for enabling automated matching, (c) how to gain access to\r\nthe EURES network in practice (mainstreaming) and (d) the actual provision of\r\nsupport services. \n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment \nIn line with its policy on better\r\nregulation, the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy\r\nalternatives for addressing the shortcomings identified. \nThe different policy alternatives were (1)\r\nmaintaining the status quo, (2) amending Regulation 492/2011 as regards the\r\npowers of the Commission on the implementation of its provisions, (3)\r\nintroducing a new Regulation with new provisions altogether and (4) introducing\r\na new Regulation with a specific Commission mandate to increase the\r\nco-operation between public and private employment services. All options were\r\nanalysed against the general objective to make the EURES network an effective\r\ninstrument for any job seeker or employer interested in intra-EU labour\r\nmobility.\nThe impact assessment demonstrated that the\r\nfirst option would result in delays in the reform launched with the 2012\r\nDecision. The second option would enable the Commission to bring forward\r\nappropriate measures and to continue the process towards a more effective\r\ninstrument, but, in light of the constraints in some Member States, was not\r\nexpected to secure the desired outcome of the Decision without changes in\r\nRegulation 492/2011 itself. The second option would also not fully resolve\r\nshortcomings on automated matching, mainstreaming, support services and information\r\nexchange and co-operation. The preferred option is therefore replacing\r\nRegulation 492/2011 and the 2012 Decision with a stand-alone instrument\r\ncombining the provisions of the two instruments as well as addressing all\r\nshortcomings. Within this option, a number of specific alternatives were\r\ndiscarded as not being proportionate to the specific objectives. The fourth\r\noption which would add to option 3 a mandate for the Commission to autonomously\r\nestablish partnerships with new employment services in the interest of the\r\nEURES network as a whole was considered to go beyond what is strictly necessary\r\nat this stage. \nThe Impact Assessment Board (\u2018IAB\u2019) gave an\r\nopinion on the draft impact assessment on 5 December 2013. The opinion of the\r\nIAB as well as the final Impact Assessment and its executive summary are\r\npublished together with this proposal. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis \nThis proposal is based on Article 46 TFEU,\r\nthe same legal basis as Regulation (EU) No 492/2011, which allows for the\r\nadoption of Regulations or Directives under the ordinary legislative procedure.\r\n\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality principles \nThe intentions of the proposed Regulation are\r\nclosely connected to the objectives set out in Article 3(3) TEU, under which\r\nthe European Union established an internal market based on a highly competitive\r\nsocial market economy, aimed at full employment and social progress, Article 9\r\nTFEU, the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate\r\nsocial protection and Article 45 TFEU (\u201cthe right to accept offers of\r\nemployment actually made (\u2026) within the territory of Member States for this\r\npurpose\u201d). \nThe individual specific measures in this\r\nproposal are closely interconnected. They reinforce each other and should together\r\nmake the EURES network a preferred instrument of choice for any job seeker or\r\nemployer interested in intra-EU labour mobility. Insofar as these measures\r\nentail expanding current transparency obligations, enabling automated matching,\r\nensuring equal access throughout the Union to the EURES network, defining more\r\nclearly practical support services and extending current information exchange\r\narrangements, they are deemed to be a comprehensive but balanced response to\r\nthe different shortcomings in the current framework for cooperation. Those\r\nmeasures are also adequate in light of the situation of unemployed people on\r\nthe labour markets, the needs of job seekers (\u201cfirm intentions\u201d) and the\r\n(technological) evolutions on the job vacancy and recruitment markets.\nEach individual measure is justified per se\r\nas a measure bringing about freedom of movement for workers identified under\r\nArticle 46 of the Treaty. Each measure either aims at improving \u201cthe close\r\ncooperation between national employment services\u201d (Article 46(a) TFEU) and/or at\r\nredesigning \u201cthe appropriate machinery\u201d to bring job vacancies in touch with\r\njob applications (Article 46(d) TFEU). \nAs clearance of job vacancies, job\r\napplications and CV\u2019s across borders and the resultant placement of workers both\r\npresuppose a common framework for co-operation between organisations in\r\ndifferent Member States, the objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently\r\nachieved by Member States alone and action at EU level is therefore required. \nIn line with the principle of\r\nproportionality, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order\r\nto achieve the objectives. For transparency, the Member States will only make\r\navailable to the EURES portal those job vacancies and CV\u2019s already available\r\nnationally. Automated matching will be achieved using simple interoperability\r\ntools and not by imposing a common classification system for use at the\r\nnational level. Mainstreaming, i.e. the integration of EURES services into the\r\nactivity of front desks of employment services, can be achieved through\r\nstandard information (online and/or paper) and only comes into play in those\r\nsituations where direct contact at the explicit request of individuals in the\r\ntarget groups is made (i.e. in the case of a request for client services with\r\nemployment services). Support services can be delivered at national level\r\nthrough a range of options and channels and its intensity and scope can be\r\nconditioned depending on the individual situation of job seekers and employers.\r\nMember States will share more systematically national information on labour\r\nshortages and surpluses and related policies, but the decision on these\r\npolicies falls outside the scope of the Regulation. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS \nThe\r\npresent proposal will not result in any specific budgetary impact for the EU\r\nbudget. Any activities to be carried out by the European Commission for the\r\nEURES network which will result in the need for human and/or financial\r\nresources fall under the scope of the Regulation \u00a0establishing the Programme\r\nfor Employment and Social Innovation (\"EaSI\") (2014-2020)[16] and will be covered\r\nwithin the annual budgetary allocation of this programme. \nFor\r\nthe period 2014-2020, this EU programme will pay for horizontal measures such\r\nas the EURES portal, the common training programme, targeted mobility schemes like\r\nYour first EURES Job and the development of the European classification for\r\nskills/competences, qualifications and occupations (ESCO). For the same period,\r\nactivities in Member States on intra-EU labour mobility are eligible under the\r\nEuropean Social Fund. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DETAILED OUTLINE OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter I \u2013 general\r\nprovisions\nThis chapter defines the subject matter of\r\nthe proposal (Article 1) and its key concepts (Article 2). \nThe proposal integrates into a single\r\nframework the provisions of chapter II and Article 38 of Regulation 492/2011\r\nand the Commission Decision 733/2012/EU on the EURES network. \nThroughout the proposal reference is made\r\nto workers and employers as the target groups. Workers are defined with\r\nreference to the rights conferred on citizens under Article 45 TFEU. For the\r\npurpose of the provisions, they are citizens who are looking for a job and have\r\nthe right to take up an activity as an employed person and to pursue this\r\nactivity in the territory of another Member State. However, they may also be\r\nthird-country nationals legally residing in a Member State and having the right\r\nto work, provided that they may move to another Member State. \nThe proposal also covers these categories\r\nof citizens when they are seeking apprenticeship or work-based traineeship opportunities\r\ninvolving an employment contract. To address the request of the European\r\nCouncil of 28-29 June 2012, some members of the EURES network are already exploring\r\non an informal basis the possibilities to extend the scope of the EURES network\r\nto cover apprenticeships and traineeships. A pilot project will start in the course\r\nof 2014 allowing Member States to share offers and applications on a voluntary\r\nbasis. The aim should be to gradually develop the exchange of information,\r\noffers and applications in this area beyond situations covered by an employment\r\ncontract. \n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter II \u2013 Establishment\r\nof the EURES network \nThis Chapter re-establishes the EURES\r\nnetwork (Article 3). It lays down its composition (Article 4(1)) and the\r\nrespective roles and responsibilities of a) the Commission (the European\r\nCoordination Office, Article 6) b) the bodies designated by the Member States\r\nfor the application of this Regulation (the National Coordination Offices,\r\nArticle 7) and c) the organisations participating in the EURES network as\r\nservice providers (EURES Partners, Article 9). As this is a network of mutual\r\nassistance, all these organisations share joint responsibilities (Article 4(2)).\r\n\nThe EURES network shall contribute to broad\r\npolicy objectives (Article 5). As an instrument facilitating intra-EU labour\r\nmobility, it constitutes one among many solutions and policies fostering a high\r\nlevel of employment. \nArticle 8 establishes the framework on the\r\nbasis of which individual Member States will authorise organisations to join\r\nthe EURES network as EURES Partners, subject to the application of the minimum\r\ncommon criteria set out in the Annex (Article 8(4)). This provision is the main\r\nvehicle for broadening membership of the EURES network under this proposal. \nThe aim is to establish a flexible\r\nmechanism that enables Member States to (gradually) include in the EURES\r\nnetwork as many organisations as deemed useful to further the EURES network\u2019s\r\nobjectives: \n\u2013                        \r\nFirstly, no definition is provided for an\r\napplicant organisation, so that access could be granted to a wide range of\r\nrelevant organisations, including private or third sector employment services,\r\nemployers\u2019 organisations, trade unions, chambers of commerce and\r\nnon-governmental organisations supporting migrant workers. All these\r\norganisations could meaningfully contribute to fostering intra-EU labour\r\nmobility in one way or another. \n\u2013                        \r\nSecondly, as some of these organisations may be\r\nsubject to specific restrictions in their mandate, legal status or\r\nadministrative capacity, it is made possible for them to choose to participate\r\nto only certain parts of the activities of the EURES network (Article 9(1)).\n\u2013                        \r\nThirdly, these organisations can become EURES\r\nPartners in co-operation with other organisations (Article 8(6)). The framework\r\nthus allows for ample flexibility in building partnerships at national level\r\nand thereby for the progressive development of extensive geographical and\r\nthematic outreach and service provision at national level commensurate to the\r\nmobility patterns and needs. \nArticle 8(3) introduces for employment\r\nservices a right to apply. This right can only be exercised in the country in\r\nwhich the employment services concerned are lawfully operating (territoriality\r\nprinciple). While public employment services (PES) will continue to play a\r\nprominent role in the EURES network (Article 10), the review of applications by\r\nother types of employment services will be left to the individual Member State. A Member State may introduce criteria additional to those laid down in the\r\nAnnex if deemed necessary (Article 8(5)). \nArticle 11 introduces a single governance\r\nbody to facilitate practical co-operation between Commission and Member States for this Regulation. \n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter III \u2013 Transparency\r\n\nThis chapter introduces the specific\r\nmeasures on transparency and automated matching: \n\u2013                        \r\nto achieve on the EURES portal a nearly complete\r\nsupply of job vacancies, with job seekers all over Europe having instant access\r\nto the same vacancies, in combination with an extensive pool of CV\u2019s available\r\nfrom which registered employers can recruit (Articles 14, 15 and 17); \n\u2013                        \r\nto enable the EURES portal to carry out a good\r\nautomated matching between job \u00a0vacancies and CV\u2019s across Member States, translating\r\nin all EU languages and understanding skills, competences, occupations and\r\nqualifications acquired at national level (Article 16). \nThe provisions in this chapter explicitly\r\nsupport the extension of the principle of transparency to organisations other\r\nthan the PES, in principle through the voluntary participation in the EURES\r\nnetwork by EURES Partners. In addition, the PES are encouraged to develop\r\npartnerships with any other relevant organisations on the principle of easy\r\naccess to the EURES portal (Article 15(2)) and to facilitate information\r\ntransfer at national level through the creation of a national hub (Article\r\n15(5). \nA nearly complete supply of job vacancies\nCurrently, not all Member States make\r\navailable to the EURES portal all job vacancies published and available at\r\nnational level. Article 14(1), paragraph (a) will require Member States to make\r\navailable to the EURES portal all the job vacancies they publish nationally and\r\ntherefore extends the scope of Article 13 of Regulation 492/2011. \nFirstly, this means doing away with any general\r\nadministrative limitations in the transfer of job vacancies to the EURES portal\r\nto date, such as those related to the nature and duration of the contract or\r\nthe recruitment intentions of the employers (Article 14(2)). \nSecondly, it involves adding to the existing job\r\nvacancy pool the job vacancies (a) available with PES at local or regional\r\nlevel, but not shared centrally nor made available to the EURES portal so far;\r\n(b) from third parties, such as private employment services, where these are\r\nmade available to the PES on the basis of existing national agreements and (c)\r\nfrom EURES Partners. \nTaking into account the relatively recent\r\ntechnological developments on web crawling, the limited number of Member States\r\nwhich make use of such tools and possible data protection concerns, at this\r\nstage it is not proposed to require Member States to make available to the\r\nEURES portal any data harvested with web crawlers in accordance with national law.\r\n\u00a0\nAn extensive pool of job applications and\r\nCV's\nCurrently no automated electronic exchange\r\nof CVs or other job seeker profile information takes place at European level,\r\ndespite the formulation in Article 13 of Regulation 492/2011. Article 14(1)(b)\r\nwill require Member States to make available in the future to the EURES portal\r\njob applications and CV\u2019s available nationally, provided that the individual\r\nhas consented to their transmission to the EURES portal. \nThis will cover the transmission to the\r\nEURES portal of the data, made available by job seekers, (a) directly to the\r\nPES, (b) to the PES as a result of any agreements or arrangements on data\r\nsharing between the PES and other employment services and (c) to EURES\r\nPartners. This would allow employers registered on the EURES portal to directly\r\naccess a wider pool of CV's. \nSupporting mechanisms for online access\r\nfor job seekers and employers \nTo\r\nmake it easier for job seekers and employers to share job applications, CV\u2019s\r\nand job vacancies across borders, two obligations are introduced: (a) Article\r\n15 requires PES and other EURES Partners to improve access to the EURES portal\r\non the job search portals they manage, and (b) Article 17 provides that PES and\r\nother EURES Partners registering their data, must offer job seekers and employers\r\nadequate assistance when they would like to register also on the EURES portal. \nAutomated matching \nThe European Commission is developing a\r\nEuropean classification of skills, competences, qualifications and occupations.\r\nWhile its first function is to serve as an automated skills-based matching engine\r\nfor the EURES portal, it will allow for full interoperability of data between\r\nnational job search portals across Europe. \nFrom a technical point of view, no\r\nharmonisation of classifications systems is required to achieve\r\ninteroperability for the purpose of automated matching. To introduce in Union law\r\nan appropriate mechanism enabling all Member States to develop automated\r\nmatching across borders on national job search portals, Article 16 provides\r\nmerely that Member States will make an initial inventory to map all\r\nclassifications to and from this European classification. Article 16(3) sets a\r\ndate for delivery for all Member States after which all data shared would be\r\ninteroperable, provided that technical standards and templates are used\r\n(Article 16(5)).\nResponsibilities for the quality of the\r\ndata \nThe responsibility for the quality of the\r\njob vacancy, the correctness of the information it provides and its compliance\r\nwith national law and standards lies with the organisation that makes this\r\ninformation available to the EURES portal. In order to inform the users of the\r\nportal about this responsibility, there is a corresponding disclaimer from the\r\nCommission on the portal. Article 14 refers to the need for such national law\r\nand standards in paragraph 4, while paragraph 5 lays down the principle of\r\ncooperation and exchange on information in this field and paragraph 6 provides\r\nthat the source of job vacancy data must be traceable (to the organisation that\r\nmakes it available). \n5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter IV \u2013 support\r\nservices \nThis chapter introduces the specific\r\nmeasures on mainstreaming and support services: \n\u2013                        \r\nto make available basic information on the EURES\r\nnetwork throughout the Union to any job seeker or employer seeking client\r\nservices for recruitment and to consistently offer any person interested access\r\nto the EURES network (Articles 19 and 20(1)); \n\u2013                        \r\nto assist any such person interested in matching,\r\nplacement and recruitment through the EURES network (Articles 20(2)-(4), 21 to\r\n23).\nThe provisions in this chapter explicitly\r\nsupport the extension of the delivery of support services by organisations other\r\nthan the PES, in principle through the voluntary participation in the EURES\r\nnetwork by EURES Partners. In addition, PES are encouraged to develop\r\npartnerships to promote a coherent service package to employers as regards\r\nintra-EU labour mobility (Article 21(4)). \nPrinciples \nParagraphs 1 and 2 of Article 18\r\nrespectively enshrine the principles that Member States must ensure effective\r\naccess to the EURES network on their territory and that they develop a\r\ncoordinated approach to support services, taking into account their\r\nresponsibility for the authorisation system for EURES Partners, the smooth\r\nfunctioning of the National Coordination Office and the role of the PES in\r\nserving the public interest in this area. Article 18(3) identifies the menu of\r\noptions for service provision on the territory of each Member State. \nArticle 18(5) enshrines the principle that\r\nsupport services to workers must be free of charge, while for most support\r\nservices to employers fees can be charged in accordance with national practices\r\n(Article 18(6)). \nMainstreaming \nArticles 19 and 20 (1) provide respectively\r\nthat (a) every worker and employer registering for client services with an\r\nemployment service in the EU must receive the necessary basic information on\r\nwhat EURES can do for them and (b) that every worker interested is made\r\nproactively aware of a \"EURES offer\" for further assistance. \nSupport services \nUnder current practice, organisations in\r\nthe EURES network are invited to provide information services, counselling and\r\nadvice to respectively job seekers and employers as follows: \n\u2013                        \r\n(\u2026) help and adviser job seekers interested in\r\nworking abroad about suitable job vacancies and provide help and assistance\r\nwith the drawing up of applications and CVs, in conformity with the recommended\r\nEuropean CV format. Job seekers shall be given the opportunity to register\r\ntheir CVs in the EURES database; \n\u2013                        \r\n(\u2026) provide information and recruitment services\r\nto employers who wish to recruit from other countries, including advice and\r\nhelp to specify the profile of the potential candidates. They shall promote the\r\nEURES CV database as a tool to give employers access to a pool of those\r\ninterested in working abroad. \nWith the 2012 Decision, Member States were\r\ninvited to focus more on matching, placement and recruitment.\nTo support a more consistent implementation\r\nwithin the EURES network, EU law should specify the support services to be\r\nprovided to those job seekers and employers interested in assistance with\r\nintra-EU labour mobility. Articles 20-23 cover the whole range of services;\r\nfrom basic information and guidance, to more personalised assistance, including\r\non social security, and post-recruitment assistance. \nSpecific support services \nFrontier workers face specific issues as\r\nregards social security, taxation and insurance and require therefore specific\r\nassistance. \nThe concerned Member States may decide to\r\nset up co-operation and service structures in cross-border regions and where\r\nthey do so, support services to frontier workers must include a) one stop shop\r\nsolutions for communication on job vacancies, job applications and CV\u2019s\r\n(Article 15(6); b) targeted basic information (Article 19(2) and c) as regards\r\nsocial security, an integrated on line access (Article 23(2)) and assistance\r\nand referral to competent authorities on social security (Article 23(3)). \nOne specific form of these support\r\nstructures are cross-border partnerships. Under the guidance of the PES of\r\nMember States, they may bring together, in various partnership constellations,\r\ndepending on the regional cross-border labour market needs, the public\r\nemployment services, employers and trades union organisations, local authorities\r\nand other institutions dealing with employment and vocational training problems\r\nin the border regions. Cross-border regions qualifying for a specific support\r\nstructure are employment catchment areas in which there are significant levels\r\nof cross-border commuting or a clear potential for it.\nNon-discriminatory access to Active\r\nLabour Market Policies (ALMP\u2019s) \nArticle 24 lays down the principle that\r\nthere shall be no discrimination in the access to ALMP\u2019s between nationals moving\r\nwithin the territory of the own country and nationals moving to other Member\r\nStates (equal treatment in case of outbound mobility). It is the corollary of\r\nArticle 5 of Regulation 492/2011, which provides that workers who seek\r\nemployment in a Member State shall receive the same assistance as that afforded\r\nto the own nationals in that Member State (equal treatment in case of inbound\r\nmobility). \n5.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter V \u2013 relationship\r\nto mobility policies \nThis chapter introduces the specific\r\nmeasure: \n\u2013                        \r\nto support the functioning of the EURES network\r\nthrough information exchange on national labour shortages and surpluses and the\r\ncoordination of actions across Member States (Articles 25 to 30).\nThe provisions in this chapter explicitly\r\nsupport the extension of the collection and review of information, data and\r\nindicators by organisations other than the PES, through the participation in\r\nthe EURES network by EURES Partners. \nOverall purpose of information exchange\r\nand reporting\nThe overall purpose of this chapter is to\r\nreinforce the existing arrangements for sharing information in the EURES\r\nnetwork where it benefits the quality of concrete collective outputs or the\r\ncoordination of policies of Member States. \nActivities relating to information\r\nexchange\nArticle 25 takes over a provision agreed\r\nwithin the framework of the negotiations on the EU Programme Employment and\r\nSocial Innovation (EaSI). This should help integrate into the work of the EURES\r\nnetwork data analysis work on mobility flows and patterns. As this provision is\r\nbetter placed in the EURES Regulation it is proposed to repeal the\r\ncorresponding Article in the EaSI Programme (see Article 35).\nArticle 26 introduces an obligation on\r\nMember States to share labour market intelligence relevant for intra-EU labour\r\nmobility. This will help Member States to link the actions within the EURES\r\nnetwork to the broader picture of mobility policies. \nArticle 27 aims to encourage all the\r\norganisations within the EURES network, i.e. the Coordination Offices, the PES\r\nand other EURES Partners, to share openly and proactively available information\r\non the situation in the individual Member State likely to be of use for workers\r\ninterested in intra-EU labour mobility. To date, this information is only\r\ngathered by Coordination Offices and then put on the EURES portal. A more\r\ninclusive bottom-up approach process for compiling this kind of information\r\nwill be beneficial for the workers. The result could be consolidated in agreed\r\ntemplates (Article 27(3)). \nArticle 28 takes over the approach on\r\nprogramming from the 2012 Decision. Sharing information on planned activities,\r\nresources and monitoring among National Coordination Offices should strengthen\r\nthe effectiveness of the whole EURES network. It may reinforce synergies and\r\nthe development of specific joint recruitment projects. \nActivities relating to reporting\nArticle 29 establishes ways to measure the\r\noutcome of the EURES network. \nArticle 30 aims at continuing the approach\r\nestablished in Article 17 of Regulation 492/2011 to report every two years on\r\nthe implementation of Chapter II of the Regulation. \n5.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VI \u2013 final\r\nprovisions\nArticle 31 clarifies that all measures\r\nprovided for in this Regulation must be carried out in accordance with EU law\r\non protection of personal data and the national implementing measures thereto.\r\nAs the Commission in its role as European Coordination Office is one of the\r\nactors, Regulation 45/2001 must also be respected. \nArticle 32 provides for an ex post\r\nevaluation on the introduction of this Regulation. \nArticles 33 and 34 are standard provisions\r\nin secondary EU legislation relating to the application of Articles 290 and 291\r\nTFEU. \nArticle 35 identifies the provisions to\r\nrepeal. \nArticle 36 underscores the existence of\r\ntransitional arrangements in accordance with accession treaties. This provision\r\nis applicable to Croatia. \n2014/0002 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non a European network of Employment\r\nServices, workers' access to mobility services and the further integration of\r\nlabour markets\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 46 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[17],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[18],\r\n\nAfter consulting the European Data Protection\r\nSupervisor,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The free movement of\r\nworkers is a fundamental freedom of Union citizens and one of the pillars of\r\nthe internal market in the Union enshrined in Article 45 of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union ('the Treaty'). Its implementation is further\r\ndeveloped by Union law aimed at guaranteeing the full exercise of rights\r\nconferred on Union citizens and the members of their families.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The free movement of\r\nworkers is a key element to the development of a more integrated Union labour\r\nmarket which allows worker mobility from high unemployment areas to areas\r\ncharacterised by labour shortages. It also contributes to finding the right skills\r\nfor vacant positions and overcoming bottlenecks in the labour market. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of\r\nRegulation 492/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April\r\n2011 on freedom of movement for workers within the Union (codification)[19] established mechanisms\r\nfor clearance and for information exchange and the Commission Implementing\r\nDecision 2012/733/EU of 26 November 2012 has laid down provisions on the\r\nfunctioning of a network entitled EURES (European Employment Services) in\r\naccordance with that Regulation. This regulatory framework needs to be revised\r\nto reflect new mobility patterns, enhanced requirements for fair mobility,\r\nchanges in the technology for sharing job vacancy data, the use of a variety of\r\nrecruitment channels by job seekers and employers and the increasing role of\r\nother labour market brokers next to the Public Employment Services ('PES') in\r\nthe provision of recruitment services. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to help the\r\nworkers who enjoy the right to free movement to effectively exercise that\r\nright, assistance in accordance with the present Regulation is open to any Union national who has a right to take up an activity as an employed person and their\r\nfamily members, in accordance with Article 45 of the Treaty. Member States\r\nshall give the same access to any third-country national benefiting, as per Union or national law, from equal treatment with their own nationals in this field.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Growing interdependency\r\nbetween labour markets calls for reinforced cooperation between employment\r\nservices to bring about freedom of movement for all workers through voluntary\r\nand fair labour mobility within the Union in accordance with Article 46 (a) of\r\nthe Treaty, and therefore a common framework for cooperation should be\r\nestablished between Member States and the Commission on labour mobility within\r\nthe Union. This framework should bring together job vacancies from across the\r\nUnion and the possibility of applying for those job vacancies ('clearance'),\r\ndefine the provision of related support services to workers and employers and provide\r\nfor a common approach to share information necessary to facilitate said\r\nco-operation. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the \u2018Compact for Growth\r\nand Jobs\u2019, the European Council requested to explore the possibility of\r\nextending to apprenticeships and traineeships the EURES network, apprenticeships\r\nand traineeships can be covered under the present Regulation, provided that the\r\npersons concerned are considered workers with reference to the rights conferred\r\non citizens under Article 45 of the Treaty. An appropriate exchange of general\r\ninformation on mobility for apprenticeships and traineeships within the Union\r\nneeds to be introduced and adequate assistance to the candidates for those\r\npositions should be developed, based on a mechanism for clearance of offers,\r\nonce such a clearance is deemed feasible in accordance with the appropriate\r\nstandards and with due respect to the competences of the Member States. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A more coherent\r\napplication across the Union of clearance, support services and exchange of information\r\non labour mobility within the Union is needed. It is therefore required that the\r\nEURES network be established as an integral part of the common framework for\r\ncooperation between Member States and the Commission. The roles and\r\nresponsibilities of the different organisations participating in the network,\r\nsuch as the European Commission ('the European Coordination Office'), the\r\nbodies designated by the Member States to take action at national level ('the\r\nNational Coordination Offices') and the organisations assisting job seekers and\r\nemployers ('EURES Partners') should be determined. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The transnational and\r\ncross-border co-operation and the support to all organisations operating for\r\nEURES in Member States would be facilitated by a structure at Union level ('the\r\nEuropean Coordination Office') that should provide common information, training\r\nactivities, tools and guidance. That structure should also be responsible for\r\nthe development of the 'European Job Mobility portal' (EURES portal), the common\r\nIT platform. To guide its work, multiannual work programmes should be developed\r\nin consultation with Member States. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\r\nestablish Coordination Offices at national level to provide general support and\r\nassistance to all organisations on their territory operating for EURES and support\r\nthe cooperation with their counterparts in the other Member States and with the\r\nEuropean Coordination Office. Those Coordination Offices should in particular\r\nhave the task of dealing with complaints and problems with job vacancies, and verify\r\ncompliance issues as regards voluntary and fair labour mobility within the Union. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The social partners'\r\nparticipation in the EURES network contributes in particular to the analysis of\r\nobstacles to mobility as well as the promotion of fair and voluntary labour mobility\r\nwithin the Union, including in the cross-border regions. Social partners\r\nrepresentatives at Union level should therefore be involved in the overall\r\ngovernance structure of the EURES network, while national employers'\r\norganisations and trade unions may apply to become a EURES Partner. \u00a0\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The composition of the\r\nEURES network as regards other organisations than the ones above should be\r\nflexible to adjust to changing developments on the market for recruitment\r\nservices. The emergence of a variety of employment services coupled with the\r\nreshaped role of the PES relating to national recruitment services points\r\ntowards the need for a concerted effort by Member States and the European\r\nCommission to open up the EURES network, as the main Union tool delivering\r\nintra-Union recruitment services. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A broader membership of the\r\nEURES network has social, economic and financial benefits. It improves\r\nefficiency in service delivery by facilitating partnerships, enhancing\r\ncomplementarity and quality improvements. It increases the market share of the\r\nEURES network insofar as new members make available job vacancies, job\r\napplications and curriculum vitae ('CV\u2019s'). Transnational and cross-border\r\nco-operation, which is a key feature of the operation of the EURES network,\r\ncould generate innovative forms of learning and co-operation between employment\r\nservices, including on quality standards for job vacancies and support\r\nservices. The EURES network would therefore enhance its relevance as one of the\r\nkey Union tools available to Member States and the European Commission for\r\nsupporting concrete measures towards a high level of employment within the Union.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with their\r\ncompetences on the organisation of labour markets, Member States themselves should\r\nbe responsible for authorising the participation of organisations as EURES\r\npartners for the EURES network, each on their own territory. Authorisations\r\nshould be subject to minimum common criteria and a limited set of basic rules\r\non the process of authorisation, to ensure transparency and equal opportunities\r\nwhen joining the EURES network, without prejudice to the flexibility necessary\r\nto take into account the different national models and forms of co-operation\r\nbetween public employment services and other labour market actors in the Member\r\nStates.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the EURES network\r\nobjectives is to support fair intra-Union labour mobility and therefore the\r\nminimum common criteria for authorising organisations to join should include\r\nthe requirement that those organisations commit themselves to fully respect\r\napplicable labour standards and legal requirements.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure a proper balance\r\nbetween the present functioning of the EURES network, which is based on a long\r\nstanding co-operation among PES, and the objective of opening up the EURES\r\nnetwork to new organisations, provisions should be made to recognise the\r\nspecific position of the PES in the EURES network. A transition period should\r\nbe introduced after which the PES\u2019 participation also becomes subject to full\r\napplication of the minimum common criteria. Member States should ensure that\r\nPES comply with the minimum common criteria and the obligations under the\r\nRegulation. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To communicate reliable and\r\nup to date information to workers and employers on the different aspects of\r\nlabour mobility within the Union, the EURES network should cooperate with other\r\nbodies, services and Union networks facilitating mobility and informing\r\ncitizens about their rights under Union law, such as Your Europe portal, the\r\nEuropean Youth portal and SOLVIT, the organisations responsible for the\r\nrecognition of professional qualifications and the bodies for the promotion,\r\nanalysis, monitoring and support of equal treatment of workers, designated in\r\naccordance with Directive ../2013 (EU) of [the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil on measures facilitating the exercise of rights conferred on workers in\r\nthe context of the freedom of movement for workers]. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right of freedom of\r\nmovement entails the necessity to set up the means to support clearance, that\r\nis to say, the exchange of job vacancies, job applications and CV's, in order\r\nto make the labour market fully accessible to both workers and employers in\r\naccordance with Article 46(d) of the Treaty, and therefore a common IT platform\r\nshould be established at Union level and run by the Commission. Securing this\r\nright means empowering workers to actually gain access to all employment\r\nopportunities throughout the Union. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The common IT platform\r\nwhich brings together job vacancies and the possibility of applying for those\r\nvacancies, while enabling job seekers and employers to automatically match data\r\naccording to various criteria and levels, should facilitate the achievement of\r\nequilibrium on the Union labour markets which would bring a high level of\r\nemployment and help avoid serious threats to the standard of living and levels\r\nof employment in the various regions and industries. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legal responsibility\r\nfor ensuring the intrinsic and technical quality of the information made\r\navailable to the common IT platform, in particular as regards job vacancy data,\r\nis with the organisations that make the information available in accordance\r\nwith the law of and/or within the standards set by the Member States. The\r\nCommission should facilitate cooperation to render possible an early detection\r\nof any fraud or abuse related to the exchange of information at European\r\nlevel.\u00a0 \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A common classification\r\nsystem of skills, competences, qualifications and occupations constitutes one\r\nof the most important tools for enabling online job application in the Union,\r\nit is therefore necessary to develop the cooperation between Member States and\r\nthe European Commission in order to achieve interoperability and meaningful\r\nautomated matching across borders, including by mapping to and from the common\r\nto national classification systems. Other established European formats and\r\ntools for comparability of and transparency on skills and qualifications, such\r\nas the European Qualifications Framework and the single framework for the transparency\r\nof qualifications and competences (Europass) should also be used in this\r\ncontext.\u00a0 \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A common approach to the\r\nservices delivered by the organisations ('support services') participating in\r\nthe EURES network should be established and the principle of equal treatment of\r\nworkers and employers seeking assistance on intra-Union labour mobility,\r\nregardless of their location in the Union, should be secured as much as\r\npossible, and therefore principles and rules should be established regarding\r\nthe availability of support services in the territory of the individual Member\r\nStates. This common approach also covers apprenticeships and traineeships\r\nconsidered as work. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A wider and more\r\ncomprehensive choice of assistance on intra-Union labour mobility opportunities\r\nbenefits workers, and it is needed to improve the EURES network's potential to\r\nprovide support to workers throughout their entire working life, securing their\r\ntransitions and careers. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Support services will help\r\nto decrease the obstacles faced by job seekers when exercising their workers'\r\nrights under Union law as well as to exploit more efficiently all job\r\nopportunities, thus securing better individual employment prospects. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A profound understanding of\r\nlabour demand in terms of occupations, sectors and needs of employers would\r\nbenefit the right of free movement of workers within the Union and therefore\r\nsupport services should include good quality assistance to employers, small and\r\nmedium sized enterprises in particular. Close working relationships between\r\nemployment services and employers will increase the pool of job vacancies and\r\njob matching of suitable candidates, secure pathways for job seekers in\r\nparticular those in vulnerable groups and improve labour market intelligence. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The support services common\r\nto all Member States should be defined on the basis of the emerging consensus\r\non successful Member State practices for information, counselling and advice to\r\njob seekers and employers. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Support services for\r\nworkers are connected to the exercise of their fundamental freedom of movement\r\nas workers under Union law, they should be free of charge. However, support\r\nservices for employers may be subject to a fee, in accordance with national practices.\r\n\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Particular attention should\r\nbe paid to supporting mobility in the cross-border regions for and providing\r\nservices to frontier workers who are living in one Member State and working in\r\nanother and have to cope with different national practices and legal systems\r\nand encounters specific administrative, legal or tax obstacles to mobility.\r\nMember States may choose to set up specific support structures to facilitate\r\nthis kind of mobility, such structures should, within the framework of the\r\nEURES network, address the specific needs for information, guidance, cross-border\r\nmatching between labour demand and supply and the resulting placements. \u00a0\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transparency of labour\r\nmarkets and adequate matching capabilities are pre-conditions for labour\r\nmobility within the Union. A better balance between labour supply and demand can\r\nbe achieved through an efficient system at Union level for exchanging of information\r\non national and sectoral labour surpluses and shortages that should be set up\r\nbetween Member States and the European Commission and used as a basis for\r\nMember States to develop their mobility policies and underpin the practical\r\ncooperation within the EURES network. \u00a0\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The freedom of movement for\r\nworkers and high levels of employment are closely linked and make it necessary\r\nfor Member States to develop mobility policies supporting a better functioning\r\nof labour markets in the Union. Member States' mobility policies should be\r\nconsidered as an integral part of their social and employment policies. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A programming cycle should\r\nbe established to support the coordination of action on mobility within the Union. To be effective, the programming of Member States' activity plans should take into\r\naccount data on mobility flows and patterns, the data analysis of existing and\r\nforecast labour shortages and surpluses, and recruitment experiences and\r\npractices under the EURES network and it should consist of a review of the\r\nexisting resources and tools at the disposal of the organisations in the Member\r\nState to facilitate intra-EU labour mobility.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sharing of draft\r\nactivity plans under the programming cycle among Member States should enable\r\nthe National Coordination Offices, acting on behalf of the Member States,\r\ntogether with the European Coordination Office, to direct the resources of the\r\nEURES network toward appropriate actions and projects, and thereby steer the\r\ndevelopment of the EURES network as a more result-oriented tool responsive to\r\nthe needs of workers according to the dynamics of labour markets. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to obtain adequate\r\ninformation for measuring the results of the EURES network, common indicators\r\nshould be established. Those indicators should guide the organisations\r\nparticipating in the EURES network in identifying their results and should help\r\nassess the progress made against the objectives set for the EURES network as a\r\nwhole, including its contribution towards the implementation of a coordinated\r\nstrategy for employment in accordance with Article 145 of the Treaty. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whenever the measures\r\nprovided for in this Regulation entail the processing of personal data, they\r\nmust be carried out in accordance with EU law on the protection of personal\r\ndata[20]\r\nas well as the national implementing measures thereto. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation respects\r\nthe fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by\r\nthe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as referred to in\r\nArticle 6 of the Treaty on European Union. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nRegulation - namely to establish a common framework for cooperation between\r\nMember States to bring together job vacancies and the possibility of applying\r\nfor those job vacancies and to facilitate the achievement of a balance between\r\nsupply and demand in the employment market - cannot be sufficiently achieved by\r\nthe Member States, and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effect of the\r\naction, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in\r\naccordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the\r\nTreaty of the European Union. In accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, as set out in said Article 5, this Regulation does not go\r\nbeyond what is necessary to achieve that objective. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The power to adopt\r\ndelegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in order to ensure\r\nthat the obligations imposed on the Member States for the authorisation of the\r\norganisations to join the EURES network as EURES Partners and to provide common\r\nindicators on the performance of those organisations can be amended in light of\r\nthe experiences gained with their application or to take into account evolving\r\nneeds on the labour market. It is of particular importance that the Commission\r\ncarry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at\r\nexpert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts,\r\nshould ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\r\ndocuments to the European Parliament and Council.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of the technical standards and formats\r\napplicable to clearance and automated matching as well as the models and\r\nprocedures for sharing information between Member States, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles\r\nconcerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission's\r\nexercise of implementing powers. \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\r\nGENERAL PROVISIONS \nArticle 1\r\nSubject matter \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The aim of this Regulation\r\nis to facilitate the exercise of the freedom of movement for workers within the\r\nUnion in accordance with Article 45 TFEU, by establishing a common framework\r\nfor cooperation between Member States and the Commission. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of the\r\nfirst paragraph, this Regulation provides for objectives, principles and rules\r\non \n(a)         \r\ncooperation between Member States and the\r\nCommission on sharing data on job vacancies, job applications and CV's and on\r\nthe resultant placement of workers in jobs;
