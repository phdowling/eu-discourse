Negotiations of this comprehensive\r\nand ambitious Agreement between the EU and Georgia were launched in July 2010.\r\nNegotiations on the DCFTA part of the Agreement were launched in February 2012.\r\nOn 29 November 2013 the European Union and Georgia initialled the text of the Agreement.\nThe\r\nAssociation Agreement is the most advanced agreement of this type ever\r\nnegotiated by the EU, in particular with regard to trade and economic\r\nintegration, going far beyond a simple market opening. The aim is to accelerate\r\nthe deepening of political and economic relations between Georgia and the EU,\r\nas well as to advance Georgia's gradual economic integration with the EU\r\nInternal Market in selected areas, notably through establishing a DCFTA.\nOn\r\n16 June 2014, the Council adopted its decision [1]\r\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union and the European Atomic Energy\r\nCommunity and their Member States, and provisional application of certain\r\nprovisions of the Association Agreement, including its Deep and Comprehensive\r\nFree Trade Area (DCFTA) part between the European Union and the European Atomic\r\nEnergy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the\r\nother part. Subsequently, the Agreement was signed in Brussels on Friday, 27\r\nJune 2014 in the margins of the European Council.\u00a0 \nGeorgia ratified the Agreement on 18 July 2014 and completed, in parellel\r\nwith the\u00a0 European Union, the requisite notification procedures within the same\r\nmonth. Consequently, in accordance with Article 431 of the Agreement certain\r\nprovisions thereof (specified in Article 3 of the Council Decision on the\r\nsigning and provisional application of the Agreement with Georgia of 16 June 2014) are applied on a provisional basis starting from 1 September 2014,\r\npending ratification by the EU Member States. \nThe\r\nprovisional application is foreseen in view of keeping mutual economic\r\ninterests and shared values in equilibrium, and the common will of the EU and\r\nGeorgia to start implementing and enforcing the eligible parts of the Agreement\r\nin order to advance an early reform impact on sector-specific issues before the\r\nconclusion of the Agreement.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\r\nOF THE NEGOTIATIONS\nTitle\r\nVIII of the Agreement with Georgia provides for the institutional framework\r\nthat is necessary for the proper function and the implementation of the\r\nAgreement. The Agreement establishes an Association Council (Article 407(1)) at\r\nministerial level to supervise and monitor the application and implementation\r\nof the Agreement. \nTo\r\nprepare the meetings and deliberations of the Association Council, implement\r\nthe decisions of the Association Council where appropriate and, in general,\r\nensure continuity of the association relationship and the proper function of\r\nthe Agreement an Association Committee is also established (as per Article\r\n407(1) of the Agreement). \nThe\r\nAssociation Council as well as the Association Committee may decide to set up\r\nany other\u00a0 sub-committee or body that can assist it in carrying out its duties,\r\nand shall determine the composition and duties of such committees or bodies and\r\nhow they shall function. Furthermore, the Association Council has the power to\r\namend or update the Annexes to the Agreement (Article 406(3) of the Agreement).\r\nIt may delegate any of its powers to the Association Committee, including the\r\npower to take binding decisions (Article 408(2) of the Agreement). \nThe\r\nAssociation Committee shall meet in a specific configuration to address all\r\nissues, deriving from Title IV (Trade and Trade-related matters) of the\r\nAgreement (Article 408(4) of the Agreement). The DCFTA part of the Agreement\r\nforesees specific subcommittees on sanitary & phytosanitary measures, on\r\ncustoms, on geographical indications, and on\u00a0 trade & sustainable\r\ndevelopment to assist the Association Committee in Trade configuration with its\r\nduties. \nFora\r\nfor civil society and parliamentary cooperation are also foreseen.\nWith\r\na view to ensuring smooth and timely implementation of the DCFTA part of the\r\nAgreement, in particular with regard to the updates or amendment of several\r\ntrade-related Annexes to the Agreement, it is suggested to delegate such powers\r\nby the Association Council to the Association Committee in Trade configuration.\r\nSuch delegation will ensure the necessary link between, and create conditions\r\nfor a timely follow-up to the technical discussions within that Committee on\r\nthe implementation of trade-related commitments, including those pertaining to\r\napproximation to the EU acquis by Georgia. \nWith\r\na view to completing the institutional framework and allowing for expert level\r\ndiscussions in the key areas falling within the scope of provisional\r\napplication of the Agreements, it is suggested to establish two subcommittees,\r\ndesignated as follows: \n(1)\r\nSubcommittee on Justice, Freedom & Security (JFS); \n(2)\r\nSubcommittee on Economic and other Sector cooperation;\nThe\r\npurpose of the subcommittees is to focus on those topics where concrete results\r\nare expected, rather than to necessarily cover the same agenda of topics year\r\nafter year. \nAdditional\r\nsubcommittees may be established at a later stage, following agreement of the\r\nParties.\nThe\r\nAssociation Agreement foresees a wide range of sector cooperation, focusing on\r\nsupport to core reforms, economic recovery and growth, governance and sector\r\ncooperation in 28 areas, such as justice, energy, transport, statistics, environment\r\nprotection and promotion, industrial and small and medium enterprise\r\ncooperation, agriculture and rural development, social policies, civil society\r\ncooperation, consumer policy, public administration reform, education, training\r\nand youth as well as cultural cooperation. \nIn\r\nall of these areas, enhanced cooperation starts from the basis of current\r\nframeworks, both bilateral and multilateral, with the aim of more systematic\r\ndialogue and exchange of information and good practice. Key to the sectoral cooperation\r\nchapters is a comprehensive menu of gradual approximation, where relevant, with\r\nthe EU acquis set out in annexes to the Agreement. Specific schedules\r\nfor approximation and implementation by Georgia of selected parts of the EU acquis\r\nwill provide a focus for on-going cooperation, and will form the core of Georgia's domestic reform and modernisation agenda. \nAny\r\n\"regular dialogues\" as frequently referred to in the Agreement may\r\ncover all of the aforementioned policy areas.\u00a0 The second subcommittee may thus\r\nmeet in different configurations as the need arises. This proposal draws on\r\nexperience with the Partnership & Cooperation Agreements with Georgia and aims to streamline the functioning of the subcommittee structure under the\r\nAssociation Agreement. \nBoth\r\nthe EU and Georgia have committed to a rapid and effective implementation of\r\nthe Agreement. The aim of this proposal is therefore to ensure that the\r\ninstitutional framework of the Agreement becomes operational as soon as\r\npossible. In order to facilitate this it will be crucial to proceed rapidly\r\nwith the adoption process of the Rules of Procedure for the Association\r\nCouncil, the Association Committee and the subcommittees so that these can soon\r\nstart functioning. It is intended to call the first meeting of the Association\r\nCouncil with Georgia on 17 November 2014, coinciding with the Foreign Affairs\r\nCouncil in Brussels. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nFor the Union, the legal basis for authorising the Union position to be adopted in the Association\r\nCouncil established by the Association Agreement between the EU and Georgia is\r\nthe Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, and in particular its\r\nArticles 217 and 218(9). For EURATOM, the legal basis for authorising the \u00a0position to be adopted in the Association Council established by\r\nthe Association Agreement between the EU and Georgia is the\r\nTreaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular\r\nArticle 101 thereof.\nIn light of the above-mentioned results of negotiations, on the\r\nbasis of Articles 217 and 218(9) TFEU and of Article 101 of the EURATOM Treaty,\r\nthe European Commission proposes that the Council adopts the Decision\r\nauthorising\r\nthe\r\nposition of the Union and the European Atomic Energy Community to be adopted in\r\nthe first EU-Georgia Association Council with regard to: \n\u2013                        \r\nthe\r\nrules of procedure for the Association Council and the Association Committee,\nthe\r\nestablishment of two subcommittees, \nand \n\u2013                        \r\nthe\r\ndelegation of certain powers by the Association Council to the Association\r\nCommittee in Trade configuration.\nProposal\r\nfor a \nCOUNCIL\r\nAND COMMISSION DECISION\nOn\r\nthe position to be adopted on behalf of the Union and the European Atomic\r\nEnergy Community in the Association Council established by the Association\r\nAgreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community\r\nand their Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part, in\r\nrelation to the adoption of the rules of procedure of the Association Council\r\nand of the Association Committee, to the establishment of two subcommittees,\r\nand to the delegation of certain powers by the Association Council to the\r\nAssociation Committee in Trade configuration\nTHE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nTHE EUROPEAN\r\nCOMMISSION,\nHaving regard to\r\nthe Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, and in particular its Article\r\n217 in conjunction with Article 218 (9) thereof,\nHaving regard to\r\nthe Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular\r\nArticle 101 thereof, \nHaving regard to\r\nthe proposal from the Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)              \r\nArticle\r\n431(3) and (4) of the Association Agreement (\u201dthe Agreement\u201d) between the\r\nEuropean Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member\r\nStates, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part provide for provisional\r\napplication of the Agreement in part.\n(2)              \r\nArticle\r\n4 of the Council Decision of 16 June 2014 on the signing and provisional\r\napplication of the Agreement specifies certain provisions of the Agreement to\r\nbe applied provisionally.\n(3)              \r\nArticle\r\n405(2) of the Agreement provides that the Association Council shall establish\r\nits own rules of procedure. \n(4)              \r\nArticle\r\n405 (3) of the Agreement provides that the Association Council shall be chaired\r\nin turn by a representative of the Union and a representative of Georgia.\n(5)              \r\nArticle\r\n407(1) of the Agreement provides that the Association Council shall be assisted\r\nin the performance of its duties by an Association Committee while Article\r\n408(1) provides that the Association Council shall determine in its rules of\r\nprocedure the duties and functioning of the Association Committee. \n(6)              \r\nArticle\r\n409(1) provides that the Association Council may decide to set up any other\r\nsub-committee or body in specific areas necessary for the implementation of the\r\nAgreement that can assist it in carrying out its duties. \n(7)              \r\nThe\r\nAssociation Council is responsible for supervising and monitoring the\r\napplication and implementation of the Agreement.
