The Scientific Committee for Food\r\nwas initially set up by Commission Decision 74/234/EEC[2] and subsequently\r\nreplaced by the Scientific Committee for Food established by Commission\r\nDecision 95/273/EC[3]\r\nand finally replaced by the Scientific Committee on Food established by\r\nCommission Decision 97/579/EC[4].\nFollowing Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[5],\r\nthe scientific tasks entrusted to the Scientific Committee on Food have been\r\ntaken over by the Scientific Committee and Panels of the European Food Safety\r\nAuthority (EFSA). Commission Decision 97/579/EC establishing the Scientific\r\nCommittee on Food was subsequently repealed by Commission Decision 2004/210/EC[6].\nPursuant to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, EFSA\r\nhas also become the competent body to promote scientific cooperation with the Member States and relevant national bodies operating in the fields falling within the\r\nAuthority's mission. \nTherefore, Council Directive 93/5/EEC has\r\nbecome obsolete and should be repealed. \nThe nature of the Council Directive does\r\nnot require the explanatory documents foreseen in the Joint Political\r\nDeclaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September 2011[7].\nThe Commission is invited to adopt this\r\nproposal and to transmit it forthwith to the European Parliament, the Council,\r\nthe European Economic and Social Committee, as well as to the national\r\nparliaments.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union\r\nbudget. \n2014/0132 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nrepealing Council Directive 93/5/EEC of 25\r\nFebruary 1993 on assistance to the Commission and cooperation by the Member\r\nStates in the scientific examination of questions relating to food\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\r\nEconomic and Social Committee[8],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the framework of the\r\nRegulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT) the Commission has\r\ncommitted to a simple, clear, stable and predictable regulatory framework for\r\nbusinesses, workers and citizens.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 93/5/EEC[9] aimed at ensuring the\r\nsmooth running of the Scientific Committee on Food by promoting the scientific\r\nsupport from the Member States to that Committee and by organising the\r\ncooperation with the relevant national bodies on scientific issues regarding\r\nthe safety of foodstuffs.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council[10], the tasks of the\r\nScientific Committee on Food referred to in Directive 93/5/EEC have been\r\ntransferred to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and are currently provided\r\nby Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Decision\r\n97/579/EC[11]\r\nestablishing the Scientific Committee on Food has been repealed by Commission\r\nDecision 2004/210/EC[12].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Regulation\r\n(EC) No 178/2002, EFSA has also become the competent body to promote scientific\r\ncooperation with the Member States and relevant national bodies operating in\r\nthe fields falling within EFSA\u2019s mission.
