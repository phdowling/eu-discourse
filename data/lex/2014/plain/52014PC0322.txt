Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the Commission\r\ndecided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more\r\nthan ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that\r\ndepartments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for\r\nwhich they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and\r\nreadily understandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law\r\napplicable to a given matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament,\r\nthe Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the\r\nfast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1061/2009 of 19 October 2009 establishing common rules for exports[3]. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in\r\nit[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by\r\nthe codification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal\r\nwas drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in\r\n22 official languages, of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1061/2009 and the instrument amending it,\r\ncarried out by the Publications Office of the European Union, by means of a\r\ndata-processing system. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the\r\ncorrelation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in\r\nAnnex III to the codified Regulation.\n\u00ea 1061/2009\r\n(adapted)\n2014/0167 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\n\u00a0\u00d6 on \u00d5 common rules for exports (codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\r\nEconomic and Social Committee[5], \nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No \u00d6 1061/2009[6] \u00d5 has been\r\nsubstantially amended[7]. In the interests of clarity and rationality, \u00d6 that \u00d5 Regulation\r\nshould be codified.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The common\r\ncommercial policy should be based on uniform principles.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Common\r\nrules should be \u00d6 provided \u00d5 for exports\r\nfrom the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 .\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exports\r\nare almost completely liberalised in all the Member States. It is therefore\r\npossible to accept as a \u00d6 Union \u00d5 principle that\r\nexports to third countries are not subject to any quantitative restriction,\r\nsubject to the exceptions provided for in this Regulation and without prejudice\r\nto such measures as Member States may take in conformity with the Treaty.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission should be informed if, as a result of unusual developments on the\r\nmarket, a Member State considers that protective measures might be necessary.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis essential that examination should take place at \u00d6 Union \u00d5 level, in\r\nparticular on the basis of any such information, of export terms and\r\nconditions, of export trends, of the various aspects of the economic and\r\ncommercial situation, and of the measures, if any, to be taken.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nmay become apparent from this examination that the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 should\r\nexercise surveillance over certain exports, or that interim protective measures\r\nshould be introduced as a safeguard against unforeseen practices.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any\r\nprotective measures necessitated by the interests of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 should be\r\nadopted with due regard for existing international obligations.\n\u00ea 1061/2009 recital 11 (adapted)\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis necessary to authorise Member States which are bound by international\r\ncommitments setting up, in cases of actual or potential supply difficulties, a\r\nsystem for the allocation of oil products between contracting parties to comply\r\nwith the resulting obligations vis-\u00e0-vis third countries, without prejudice to \u00d6 Union \u00d5 provisions\r\nadopted to the same end. This authorisation should apply until the adoption by \u00d6 the\r\nEuropean Parliament and \u00d5 the Council of\r\nappropriate measures pursuant to commitments entered into by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or all the Member States.\n\u00ea 1061/2009\r\nrecital 12 (adapted)\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\r\nRegulation should apply to all products, whether industrial or agricultural.\r\nIts operation should be complementary to that of the instruments establishing\r\ncommon organisation of agricultural markets, and to that of the special instruments\r\nadopted under Article \u00d6 352 \u00d5 of the Treaty\r\nfor processed agricultural products. Any overlap between the provisions of this\r\nRegulation and the provisions of \u00d6 those \u00d5 instruments,\r\nparticularly the protective clauses thereof, must however be avoided.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .21 (adapted)\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00d6 The \u00d5 implementation\r\n\u00d6 of this Regulation \u00d5 requires\r\nuniform conditions for the adoption of \u00d6 protective \u00d5 measures. Those measures should be adopted by the Commission in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[8],\n\u00ea 1061/2009\r\n(adapted)\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nBASIC PRINCIPLE\nArticle 1\nThe exportation of products from the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 to third\r\ncountries shall be free, that is to say, they shall not be subject to any\r\nquantitative restriction, with the exception of those restrictions which are\r\napplied in conformity with the provisions of this Regulation.\nCHAPTER II\n\u00a0\u00d6 UNION \u00d5 INFORMATION AND CONSULTATION PROCEDURE\nArticle 2\nIf, as a result of any unusual developments\r\non the market, a Member State considers that protective measures within the\r\nmeaning of Chapter III might be necessary, it shall so notify the Commission,\r\nwhich shall advise the other Member States.\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .21(2)\nArticle 3\n1. The Commission shall be assisted by the\r\nCommittee on Safeguards, established by Regulation (EU) No [\u2026/\u2026] of the European Parliament and of the Council[9].\r\nThat Committee shall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 182/2011.\n2. Where reference is made to this\r\nparagraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\n3. Where reference is made to this\r\nparagraph, Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, in conjunction with\r\nArticle 5 thereof, shall apply.\n\u00ea 1061/2009\nArticle 4\nFor the purpose of assessing the economic\r\nand commercial situation as regards a particular product, the Commission may\r\nrequest Member States to supply statistical data on market trends in that\r\nproduct and, to this end, acting in accordance with their national legislation\r\nand with a procedure to be specified by the Commission, to exercise\r\nsurveillance over exports of such product. Member States shall take whatever\r\nsteps are necessary in order to give effect to requests from the Commission and\r\nshall forward to the Commission the data requested. The Commission shall inform\r\nthe other Member States.\nCHAPTER III\nPROTECTIVE MEASURES\nArticle 5\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .21(3)\n1. In order to prevent a critical situation\r\nfrom arising on account of a shortage of essential products, or to remedy such\r\na situation, and where Union interests call for immediate intervention, the\r\nCommission, acting at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative,\r\nand taking account of the nature of the products and of the other particular\r\nfeatures of the transactions in question, may make the export of a product\r\nsubject to the production of an export authorisation, the granting of which\r\nshall be governed by such provisions and subject to such limits as the\r\nCommission shall lay down in accordance with the examination procedure referred\r\nto in Article 3(2), or, in cases of urgency, in accordance with Article 3(3).\n2.

Where the Commission has acted pursuant\r\nto paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall, not later than 12 working days\r\nfollowing the date of entry into force of the measure which it has taken,\r\ndecide whether to adopt appropriate measures as provided for in Article 6. If,\r\nat the end of six weeks following the date of entry into force of the measure,\r\nno measures have been adopted, the measure in question shall be deemed revoked.\n\u00ea 1061/2009\nArticle 6\n\u00ea 37/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .21(4)\n1. Where the interests of the Union so require, the Commission may, acting in accordance with the examination procedure\r\nreferred to in Article 3(2), adopt appropriate measures:\n\u00ea 1061/2009\r\n(adapted)\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to prevent a critical situation\r\nfrom arising owing to a shortage of essential products, or to remedy such a\r\nsituation;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to allow international\r\nundertakings entered into by the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 or all the Member States to be fulfilled, in particular those relating to trade in primary products.\n2.
