They are distributed on the continental slopes or associated with seamounts. Most of these species are slow-growing and long-lived, which makes them particularly vulnerable to fishing activity. Another imporant element in a deep-sea species' vulnerability to fishing is whether it can be targeted in local aggregations, particularly at the time of spawning. This is the case for orange roughy, blue ling and alfonsinos. As for all wild fish stocks, leaving deep-sea fisheries unrestricted leads to a race by fishing undertakings to take possession of a free resource, without having sufficient regard to the sustainable level of exploitation. This has been clearly the case for some deep-sea species before the European Union started regulating these stocks in 2003. For example, the valuable stocks of orange roughy in North-Western waters and red seabream in the Bay of Biscay are now depleted. Therefore, limiting the fishing activity is a necessary public intervention in order to prevent the erosion of income for fishermen, to develop exploitation towards higher long-term yields, and to reduce the impact on the ecosystem and the food web as a consequence of sudden reductions in the size of certain fish populations. In the case of deep-sea species, public intervention is of particular importance due to the fact that the recovery from depletion might take a very long time or might even fail. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) provides a thorough review of the biological status of deep sea stocks every two years. The latest ICES advice was published in May 2014. This proposal for fixing fishing opportunities is based on the further review undertaken by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) in June 2014, following the work of ICES. Advice from both ICES and STECF indicates that most deep-sea stocks are still harvested unsustainably and that fishing opportunities for those stocks, in order to assure their sustainability, should be further reduced until the evolution of the stocks shows a positive trend. \u00a0This provides the groundwork for fixing fishing opportunities for deep sea stocks in accordance with the principle embodied in Article 3(c) of the Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, whereby decision-making under the Common fisheries Policy must be guided, among others, on scientific advice. \n General context Fishing for deep-sea species has been regulated in the EU since 2003 in terms of total allowable catches (TACs) per species and area, and in terms of maximum fishing effort deployable in the North-East Atlantic. For 2013 and 2014 the total allowable catches of certain deep sea species were established in Council Regulation (EU) No 1262/2012 of 20 December 2012 fixing for 2013 and 2014 the fishing opportunities for Union vessels for fish stocks of certain deep-sea fish species[1]. The fixing and sharing of fishing opportunities falls exclusively within the competence of the Union. The obligations concerning sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources are set out in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. In particular, Article 2(2) of that Regulation establishes a precautionary approach to fisheries management (as defined in \u00a0Article 4(1)(8) thereof) and provides that the Common Fisheries Policy shall aim at restoring and maintaining maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Furthermore, in accordance with Article 16(4) of that Regulation, fishing opportunities must be fixed in accordance with the objectives of Article 2(2). Furthermore, deep-sea fishing opportunities should be established in accordance with international agreements, inter alia the 1995 United Nations agreement concerning the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks (\"the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement\"). In particular, caution is important when information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate. Pursuant to Article 6(2) of the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement the absence of adequate scientific information is not to be used as a reason for postponing or failing to take conservation and management measures. The TACs proposed also follow the 2008 International Guidelines for the Management of Deep-sea Fisheries in the High Seas of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, which have been confirmed by successive Resolutions of the UN General Assembly (Resolutions 61/105 in 2007, 64/72 in 2009, and most recently, 66/231 in 2011). While a number of deep-sea stocks are exploited also by other fishing nations, in particular Norway, Iceland, the Faroes Islands and Russia, and while it is necessary to seek agreement on harmonised management measures together with those fishing nations or, as far as stocks inhabit international waters, within the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), unilateral measures applicable to vessels of the European Union are needed until those agreements are reached. These will avoid the negative consequences of unregulated fisheries and the depletion of stocks, as described above. \n Existing provisions in the area of the proposal The existing provisions in the area of the proposal are established in Council Regulation (EU) No 1262/2012 and applicable until 31 December 2014. They are linked to Council Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002 establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks[2]. \n Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union The measures proposed are designed in accordance with the objectives and the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and are consistent with the Union's policy on sustainable development. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nThe proposal has been developed based on\r\nthe principles and guidance set out in the Communication from the Commission\r\nconcerning a Consultation on Fishing Opportunities for 2015 (COM(2014)388\r\nfinal), in which the Commission explained its views and intentions concerning\r\nits proposals for fishing opportunities in 2015 for all stocks. In the context\r\nof that Communication, the Commission carries out a wide consultation of\r\nstakeholders, civil society, Member States and the public at large. \nDetailed explanation of the proposal\nIn all stocks covered in this proposal,\r\nwith the exception of one stock of roundnose grenadier, available information\r\ndoes not allow scientists to fully assess the stock status, neither in terms of\r\npopulation size nor fishing mortality. There are several reasons for this:\r\nthese species are often very long-lived and slow-growing, making it extremely\r\ndifficult to structure the stock into age classes and to assess the effect of\r\nfishing on the stock through changes in the length or age structure of catches.\r\nThe frequency of recruitment of young fish to the stocks is not known. The stocks\r\nare widely distributed in depths that are difficult to examine for practical\r\nreasons. Data from scientific surveys are often not available due to the\r\nreduced commercial importance of these stocks, or do not cover the whole\r\ndistribution area. Fishing activities are sometimes only partly focusing on\r\nthese species and some have a relatively short history.\nThe catch limits proposed are in accordance\r\nwith the Communication from the Commission on implementing sustainability in\r\nUnion fisheries through maximum sustainable yield (COM(2006)360final).\u00a0 They\r\nare also coherent with the principles for the so called frontloading process\r\nwhich are set out in the Communication from the Commission on improving\r\nconsultation on Community fisheries management (COM(2006)246final) and in the\r\nCommunication from the Commission concerning a Consultation on Fishing\r\nOpportunities for 2015 mentioned above. This last Communication sets out the\r\nCommission's views on how to fix fishing opportunities, and such rules have\r\nbeen followed in the development of this proposal in respect of the 22 TAC\r\nentries it contains, as follows: \n\u00b7                        \r\nWhere scientific advice is provided based on\r\ncomprehensive data and quantitative analysis and forecasts according to the\r\nICES \"MSY framework\" TACs should be set according to scientific\r\nadvice. This is the case for the TAC entry proposed for roundnose grenadier in\r\nNorth-Western Waters.\n\u00b7                        \r\nWhere indicative scientific advice is provided\r\nbased on qualitative analysis of available information (even if this is\r\nincomplete or incorporates expert judgement) this should be used as a basis for\r\nTAC decisions. Accordingly, the proposal contains 5 TAC cuts, 4 TAC increases\r\nand 2 TAC rollovers.\n\u00b7                        \r\nWhere scientific advice is limited and no\r\nquantitative advice on catches can be given, there is a need to follow the\r\nprecautionary approach: this affects 6 TAC entries in this proposal, including\r\n3 with precautionary zero TACs. \n\u00b7                        \r\nFinally, for one stock of black scabbardfish\r\nSTECF still needs to provide advice. For deep-sea sharks, ICES will only release\r\nscientific advice by October 2014. Therefore, 3 TAC entries for deep-sea sharks\r\nand one stock of black scabbardfish are marked as \u201cpm\u201d in this proposal, and\r\nwill be updated after its adoption by the Commission. In addition, STECF advises\r\nthat appropriate management\r\nmeasures for the conservation of deep-sea sharks should be extended to cover\r\nthe full distribution of these stocks,[3]\r\nand therefore it is proposed that the TAC area for deep-sea sharks in Union and\r\ninternational waters of V, VI, VII, VIII and IX be extended to cover waters of\r\nCECAF (Committee for Eastern and Central Atlantic Fisheries) around Madeira,\r\ni.e. Union waters of CECAF 34.1.1, 34.1.2 and 34.2.\nFinally, scientific advice and recent\r\ndiscussions in NEAFC indicate that significant catches of roundnose grenadier may\r\nhave been misreported as other grenadier species, mostly roughhead grenadier. There\r\nis no catch limit for roughhead grenadier in force. In this context, it is\r\nappropriate to expand the coverage of the roundnose grenadier TACs to cover also\r\ncatches of roughhead grenadier, along with an obligation to report catches of\r\neach species separately. This will improve knowledge on actual catches of both\r\nspecies and enable more appropriate catch limits to be set in further\r\namendments to this draft regulation or in future regulations.\nLEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe TFEU establishes under Article 43(3)\r\nthat the Council shall adopt measures \"on the fixing and allocation of\r\nfishing opportunities\" on a proposal from the Commission. This proposal is\r\nlimited to the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities and conditions\r\nfunctionally linked to the use of those fishing opportunities.\nTherefore, this proposal puts forward, by\r\nway of a Council Regulation \u00a0the catch limitations for Union fishing fleets concerning\r\nthe commercially most important deep-sea species in Union and international\r\nwaters of the North-East Atlantic, in order to achieve the objective of the\r\nCommon Fisheries Policy of ensuring fisheries at levels that are environmentally,\r\neconomically and socially sustainable. The proposal falls under the Union\r\nexclusive competence as referred to in Article 3(1)(d) TFEU. The subsidiarity\r\nprinciple therefore does not apply.\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reason: the Common Fisheries Policy\r\nis a common policy. According to Article 43(3) TFEU it is incumbent upon the\r\nCouncil to adopt the measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing\r\nopportunities. \nHaving regard to Article 16(6) of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1380/2013 Member States are free to allocate fishing opportunities,\r\nwhen they are not subject to a system of transferable fishing concessions, among\r\nregions or operators in line with Article 16(7) and the criteria set out in\r\nArticle 17. Therefore, Member States have \u00a0room for manoeuvre on decisions\r\nrelated to the social/economic model of their choice to exploit their allocated\r\nfishing opportunities.\nThe proposal has no new financial\r\nimplications for Member States. This Regulation is adopted by Council every two\r\nyears, and the public and private means to implement it are already in place.\n2014/0284 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nfixing for 2015 and 2016 the fishing\r\nopportunities for Union fishing vessels for certain deep-sea fish stocks\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 43(3) of the\r\nTreaty provides that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, is to\r\nadopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013 of 11 December 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on\r\nthe Common Fisheries Policy[4]\r\nrequires that conservation measures be adopted taking into account available\r\nscientific, technical and economic advice, including, where relevant, reports\r\ndrawn up by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries\r\n(STECF). \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is incumbent upon the\r\nCouncil to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing\r\nopportunities, including certain conditions functionally linked thereto, as\r\nappropriate. Fishing opportunities should be distributed among Member States in\r\nsuch a way as to assure each Member State relative stability of fishing\r\nactivities for each stock or fishery and having due regard to the objectives of\r\nthe Common Fisheries Policy established by Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The total allowable\r\ncatches (TACs) should be established on the basis of available scientific\r\nadvice, taking into account biological and socioeconomic aspects whilst\r\nensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the\r\nopinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders, and in particular\r\nthe Regional Advisory Councils concerned. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fishing opportunities\r\nshould be in accordance with international agreements and principles, such as\r\nthe 1995 United Nations agreement concerning the conservation and management of\r\nstraddling stocks and highly migratory fish stocks[5], and the detailed\r\nmanagement principles laid down in the 2008 Inter-national Guidelines for the\r\nManagement of Deep-sea Fisheries in the High Seas of the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganisation of the United Nations, according to which, in particular, a\r\nregulator should be more cautious when information is uncertain, unreliable or\r\ninadequate. The absence of adequate scientific information should not be used\r\nas a reason for postponing or failing to take conservation and management\r\nmeasures. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The latest scientific\r\nadvice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and\r\nfrom STECF indicates that most deep-sea stocks are still harvested\r\nunsustainably and that fishing opportunities for those stocks, in order to\r\nassure their sustainability, should be further reduced until the evolution of\r\nthe stocks shows a positive trend. The ICES has further advised that no\r\ndirected fishery should be allowed for orange roughy in all areas and for\r\ncertain stocks of red seabream and roundnose grenadier. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the four stocks\r\nof roundnose grenadier, scientific advice and recent discussions in the North\r\nEast Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) indicate that catches of this\r\nspecies may be misreported as catches of roughhead grenadier. In this context,\r\nit is appropriate to establish a TAC covering both species while enabling a\r\nseparate reporting for each of them. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the migratory\r\nnature of deep-sea sharks and their wide distribution throughout the North East\r\nAtlantic, STECF has recommended that management measures for these species be\r\nextended to Union waters of CECAF (Committee for Eastern and Central Atlantic\r\nFisheries) around Madeira.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fishing opportunities\r\nfor deep-sea species as defined in Article 2(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n2347/2002 of 16 December 2002 establishing specific access requirements and\r\nassociated conditions applicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks[6] are decided on a bi-annual\r\nbasis. Nevertheless, an exception is made for the stocks of greater silver\r\nsmelt and the stocks of blue ling. As regards the latter, the main fishery of\r\nblue ling is linked to the annual negotiations with Norway; in the interest of\r\nsimplification, all blue ling TACs should be established along that one and\r\nwithin the same legal text. Therefore, fishing opportunities for the stocks of\r\ngreater silver smelt and of blue ling mentioned above should be set in another\r\nrelevant annual regulation fixing fishing opportunities.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for\r\nyear-to-year management of TACs and quotas[7]\r\nthe stocks that are subject to various measures referred to therein should be\r\nidentified. Precautionary TACs should apply for stocks for which no\r\nscientifically-based evaluation of fishing opportunities is available\r\nspecifically for the year in which the TACs are to be set; analytical TACs\r\nshould apply otherwise. In view of ICES and STECF advice for deep-sea stocks,\r\nthose for which a science-based evaluation of the relevant fishing\r\nopportunities is not available should be subject to precautionary TACs in this\r\nRegulation.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid the\r\ninterruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihood of the\r\nfishermen of the Union, this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2015. For\r\nreasons of urgency, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after\r\nits publication,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\r\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation fixes for the years
