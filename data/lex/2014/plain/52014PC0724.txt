They must be sufficiently detailed and be able to be\r\nproduced within a reasonable timeframe. The inflation figures calculated from\r\nconsumer price indices must constitute an objective and unbiased basis for\r\ndecision making.\nIn addition,\r\ncomparable and reliable consumer price indices are, together with other\r\nsources, a valuable input for deflating economic values such as salaries,\r\nrents, interest rates and National Accounts data. These estimated volume time\r\nseries show the evolution of a given economic phenomenon without the impact of\r\ninflation and are an essential input for political and economic decisions.\nIn October 1995,\r\na Council Regulation on harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP) was\r\ndrafted and adopted, followed by 20 implementing regulations in the following\r\n17 years.\nStandardised\r\nrules ensuring maximum comparability remain important for the main users of\r\nHICP, in particular the Commission and the European Central Bank, but certain\r\nparameters have changed since the adoption of the original framework:\n\u00b7          \r\nThe development of the European Statistical\r\nSystem (ESS) has led to a much greater acceptance of the need for a harmonised\r\napproach to many of the methodological aspects relating to consumer price\r\nindices.\n\u00b7          \r\nThe technical aspects of data collection and\r\nindex compilation have changed dramatically due to the rapid rate of\r\ntechnological progress in recent years. Powerful information technology systems\r\nmake it possible to adopt methods that would not have been considered as little\r\nas two decades ago: the advent of scanner data is revolutionising data\r\ncollection practices and the use of various internet sources for prices is\r\nconstantly developing.\n\u00b7          \r\nThe Lisbon Treaty established a new comitology\r\nset-up, introducing delegated and implementing acts. This needs to be reflected\r\nin the legal framework.\nThese various changes\r\nall necessitate redrafting of the legislation on HICP so as to modernise and rationalise\r\nthe legal basis and adapt it to today\u2019s needs, both actual and potential.\r\nReviewing the HICP Regulation gives stakeholders the chance to reflect on the\r\nexisting rules and recommendations, to rationalise them and to focus on\r\nparticular aspects according to their current relevance and the best interests\r\nof various types of users.\nMany policy\r\nareas in which the EU plays an active role require information on events and\r\ndevelopments affecting consumer price indices so that operational objectives\r\ncan be formulated and progress evaluated. EU legislation also requires Eurostat\r\nto provide deflators of the highest possible quality, for which HICP are a\r\nvaluable input. The indices must be timely, accurate, complete, coherent and\r\ncomparable at EU level and between different product groups. Only by\r\nmodernising the European legislation on HICP can these requirements be met.\nThe proposed\r\nHICP Regulation enshrines the principles of the European Statistics Code of\r\nPractice relating to commitment to quality, sound methodology,\r\ncost-effectiveness, relevance, accuracy, reliability, coherence and\r\ncomparability.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED\r\nPARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe draft HICP Regulation\r\nwas discussed by expert groups made up of both producers of statistics, in\r\nparticular national statistical institutes, and users of statistics, including\r\nthe European Commission, the European Central Bank and national central banks.\r\nThe European Statistical System Committee was consulted.\nAn impact\r\nassessment was not deemed necessary.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe objective of\r\nthis proposal is to establish a common legal framework for the production of\r\nharmonised indices by Member States, which involves collecting, compiling,\r\nprocessing and submitting harmonised consumer price indices. These are\r\nnecessary for the systematic production of inflation measures in the European\r\nUnion.\nThis proposal\r\nsimplifies and clarifies the requirements for the compilation of these indices.\r\nIn particular, it:\n\u00b7          \r\nprovides a new general framework applying to\r\nwell-defined categories of product groups;\n\u00b7          \r\nestablishes a clear and well-defined scope of application;\n\u00b7          \r\nmaintains specific measures for specific domains\r\nsuch as health, education, social protection and insurance;\n\u00b7          \r\naddresses possible differences in interpretation\r\nand difficulties for data suppliers in applying the rules;\n\u00b7          \r\nensures that similar product groups are treated\r\nin the same way across the EU;\n\u00b7          \r\neliminates provisions that have become\r\nredundant; and\n\u00b7          \r\nclarifies provisions that have led to\r\nmisinterpretations in the past.\nWhere further\r\nspecification or uniform conditions for implementation are needed, the\r\nRegulation provides for the possibility of adopting delegated or implementing\r\nacts in accordance with Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union (TFEU).\nIn particular,\r\nin order to ensure full comparability of consumer price indices, uniform\r\nconditions are needed for:\n\u00b7          \r\nthe breakdown of HICP by European classification\r\nof individual consumption according to purpose (ECOICOP) categories;\n\u00b7          \r\nthe methodology used in producing harmonised indices;\n\u00b7          \r\nthe meaning and use of statistical units;\n\u00b7          \r\nthe weights used in calculating harmonised\r\nindices and metadata on the weights;\n\u00b7          \r\nthe annual calendar for transmitting harmonised indices\r\nand sub-indices;\n\u00b7          \r\ndata and metadata exchange standards;\n\u00b7          \r\nconditions for revising data;\n\u00b7          \r\nbasic information and methods to be used, based\r\non the evaluation of pilot studies; and\n\u00b7          \r\ntechnical quality assurance requirements relating\r\nto the content of annual quality reports, the deadline for providing these\r\nreports to Eurostat and the structure of the inventory.\nIn accordance with\r\nArticle 291 of the TFEU, the proposed Regulation therefore confers implementing\r\npowers on the Commission.\nIn accordance\r\nwith Article 290 of the TFEU, the proposed Regulation delegates to the\r\nCommission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to\r\nsupplement or amend non-essential parts of the Regulation. This will allow the\r\nCommission to:\n\u00b7          \r\nensure comparability at international level of\r\nthe classification of individual consumption according to purpose (COICOP) used\r\nfor the breakdown of HICP;\n\u00b7          \r\nestablish a threshold below which there is no\r\nobligation to provide sub-indices of harmonised indices; and\n\u00b7          \r\nestablish a list of sub-indices that Member\r\nStates are not obliged to produce.\nThe Commission\r\nshould ensure that these delegated acts do not impose a significant additional\r\nadministrative burden on Members States.\nThe proposal for\r\na revised HICP Regulation seeks to create a single legal measure covering all\r\nuniform conditions. There are currently 20 different implementing regulations.\r\nUnder the new Regulation these would be combined into a single one, which would\r\ngive stakeholders and Member States greater clarity and make administration easier\r\nand more effective. Simplifying requirements and their implementation in this\r\nway is one of the main objectives of the proposed strategy for a new legal\r\nframework for HICP.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nNone for the EU\r\nbudget.\n2014/0346 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non harmonised indices of consumer prices\r\nand repealing Regulation (EC) No 2494/95\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE\r\nEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to\r\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\r\n338(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to\r\nthe proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter\r\ntransmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to\r\nthe opinion of the European Central Bank [1],\nActing in\r\naccordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harmonised\r\nindices of consumer prices (HICP) are designed to measure inflation in a\r\nharmonised manner across Member States. The Commission and the European Central\r\nBank use the HICP in their assessment of price stability in Member States under\r\nArticle 140 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the Treaty).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nEuropean System of Central Banks (ESCB) uses the HICP as an index in order to\r\nmeasure the achievement of the ESCB\u2019s price stability objective under Article\r\n127(1) of the Treaty, which is of particular relevance for the definition and\r\nimplementation of the monetary policy of the Union under Article 127(2) of the\r\nTreaty.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 2494/95[2]\r\nestablished a common framework for setting up harmonised indices of consumer\r\nprices. This legal framework needs to be adapted to current needs and technical\r\nprogress.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\r\nRegulation takes into account the Commission's better regulation programme and,\r\nin particular, the Commission Communication on smart regulation in the Union[3]. In the statistical field, the Commission\r\nhas set as a priority the simplification and improvement of the regulatory\r\nenvironment in statistics[4].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 HICP\r\nshould be broken down by categories of the European classification of\r\nindividual consumption according to purpose (ECOICOP). This classification\r\nshould ensure that all European statistics relating to private consumption are\r\nconsistent and comparable. The ECOICOP should also be consistent with the UN\r\nCOICOP, which is the international standard classifying individual consumption according\r\nto purpose, and should therefore be adapted to changes of the UN COICOP.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nregular HICP are based on observed prices, which also include taxes on\r\nproducts. Hence, inflation is affected by changes to tax rates on products. For\r\ninflation analysis and for convergence assessment in Member States, information\r\nalso needs to be collected on the impact of tax changes on inflation. To this\r\nend, HICP should additionally be calculated on the basis of constant tax rate\r\nprices.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Establishing\r\nprice indices for dwellings and in particular for owner-occupied housing (OOH\r\nindices) is an important step towards improving the relevance and comparability\r\nof HICP. House price indices are a necessary basis for compiling OOH indices.\r\nIn addition, house price indices are important indicators in their own right.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nreference period of price indices should be updated at regular intervals. Rules\r\nfor common index reference periods of harmonised indices and their sub-indices\r\nintegrated at different points in time should be established in order to ensure\r\nthat the resulting indices are comparable and relevant.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to enhance the gradual harmonisation of consumer price indices, pilot\r\nstudies should be launched to assess the feasibility of using additional basic\r\ninformation or applying new methodological approaches.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Guidance\r\non the various stages of producing high-quality harmonised indices should be\r\ngiven in a methodological manual in order to help Member States to produce\r\ncomparable indices of consumer prices. The methodological manual should be established\r\nby the Commission (Eurostat) in close cooperation with Member States within the\r\nEuropean Statistical System and regularly updated. In the annual HICP inventory\r\nreferred to in Article 9(2)(b) of this Regulation, Member States should inform\r\nthe Commission (Eurostat) about divergences, if any, between the statistical\r\nmethods used and those recommended in the methodological manual.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission (Eurostat) should verify the sources and methods used by Member\r\nStates to calculate harmonised indices and should monitor the implementation of\r\nthe legal framework by Member States. For this purpose the Commission\r\n(Eurostat) should maintain a regular dialogue with the Member States\u2019 statistical\r\nauthorities.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Background\r\ninformation is essential for assessing whether the detailed harmonised indices\r\nprovided by the Member States are sufficiently comparable. In addition,\r\ntransparent compilation methods and practices used in Member States help all\r\nstakeholders to understand the harmonised indices and further improve their\r\nquality. A set of rules for reporting harmonised metadata should therefore be\r\nestablished.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure the quality of harmonised indices, confidential data and metadata\r\nshould be exchanged between the Commission (Eurostat), national central banks\r\nand the European Central Bank in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council.[5].\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\r\nthe objective of the present Regulation, namely the creation of common\r\nstatistical standards for harmonised indices, cannot be sufficiently achieved\r\nby the Member States but can be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in\r\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, as set out in the same Article, this Regulation does not go\r\nbeyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure comparability at international level of the classification of\r\nindividual consumption according to purpose used for the breakdown of HICP and\r\nto assure adaptation to changes of UN COICOP, to establish a threshold below\r\nwhich there is no obligation to provide sub-indices of harmonised indices and\r\nto establish a list of sub-indices that need not be produced by the Member\r\nStates, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in\r\nrespect of harmonised indices. It is of particular importance that the\r\nCommission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work,\r\nincluding at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up\r\ndelegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission\r\nof relevant documents to the European Parliament and the Council.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure full comparability of consumer price indices, uniform\r\nconditions are needed for the breakdown of the HICP by ECOICOP categories, for\r\nthe applied methodology in producing harmonised indices, for the information\r\nprovided by statistical units, for providing weights and metadata on the\r\nweights, for the establishment of an annual calendar for the transmission of\r\nthe harmonised indices and sub-indices, for the data and metadata exchange standards,\r\nfor the uniform conditions for revisions, for improved basic information or\r\nimproved methods based on the evaluation of pilot studies and for technical\r\nquality assurance requirements regarding the content of annual quality reports,\r\nthe deadline for providing the report to the Commission (Eurostat) and the\r\nstructure of the inventory. In order to ensure such uniform conditions for the\r\nimplementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on\r\nthe Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation\r\n(EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.[6]\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nadopting implementing measures and delegated acts in accordance with this\r\nRegulation, the Commission should take the utmost account of\r\ncost-effectiveness.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe context of Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, the European\r\nStatistical System Committee has been asked to provide its professional\r\nguidance.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\r\n(EC) No 2494/95 should be repealed.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\r\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays\r\ndown a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of\r\nharmonised indices of
