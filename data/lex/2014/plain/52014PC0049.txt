The IOTC is a Regional Fisheries Management\r\nOrganisation (RFMO) responsible for the management of\r\ntuna and tuna-like species in the Indian Ocean and adjacent seas. The\r\nEuropean Union became a contracting party to the IOTC in 1995. \nPursuant to Article 218(9) of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union, the position to be adopted on behalf of the Union in RFMOs such as\r\nwhen they are called upon to adopt acts having legal effects, with the\r\nexception of acts supplementing or amending their institutional framework, must\r\nbe adopted by Council Decision, on a proposal from the Commission.\nSuch position within the RFMO is currently\r\nestablished according to a two tier approach. A Council Decision sets out the\r\nguiding principles and orientations of the Union's position on a multiannual\r\nbasis, whereas it is thereafter adjusted for each annual meeting by Commission\r\nnon-papers to be discussed in the Council Working Party.\nAs regards the IOTC, Council Decision 7537/09\r\nof 23 March 2009, provides for a review of the Union's position before the 2014\r\nannual meeting. Therefore, this proposal aims at setting out the Union's position within the IOTC for the period 2014-2019 and thereby replacing Council\r\nDecision 7537/09 which is covering the period 2009-2014.\nThis revision aims\r\nat incorporating the principles and orientations of the new Common Fisheries\r\nPolicy (CFP), taking also into account the objectives of the Commission\r\nCommunication on the external dimension of the CFP[2]. Moreover, the Union's position has been adjusted to the Lisbon Treaty. At last, the position has been\r\naligned to the extent possible taking into account the specificities of the\r\ndifferent RFMOs. \nAs it is the case for the current\r\npositions, the following position contains principles and orientations. In\r\naddition, the standard process for the year to year specification of the Union\r\nposition has been incorporated as requested by Member States for positions\r\naligned more recently.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe external dimension of the CFP was part\r\nof the impact assessment for the CFP reform proposals. The principles and\r\norientations agreed for the new CFP are simply being transposed into the\r\nrevised positions. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe following Decision is based on the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\r\n43(2), in conjunction with Article 218(9) which provides that the Council, on a\r\nproposal from the Commission shall adopt a decision establishing the positions\r\nto be adopted on the Union's behalf in a body set up by an agreement, when that\r\nbody is called upon to adopt acts having legal effects. This shall apply to the\r\nposition to be adopted by the Commission, on behalf of the Union, in the IOTC.\nRegulation (EU) XXX (new basic regulation) is the legal basis setting up the principles to be reflected in this\r\nnegotiating mandate. \nThe following Decision shall replace\r\nCouncil Decision 7537/09 which is covering the period 2009-2014, and shall\r\ncover the period 2014-2019. \n2014/0024 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf\r\nof the European Union, in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 38 of the Treaty\r\non the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article 39\r\nthereof, provides that one of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy is\r\nto assure the availability of supplies. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) XXX (new\r\nbasic regulation) provides that the Union shall ensure that fishing and\r\naquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long-term and are\r\nmanaged in a way that is consistent with the objectives of achieving economic,\r\nsocial and employment benefits, and of contributing to the availability of food\r\nsupplies. It also provides that the Union shall apply the precautionary\r\napproach to fisheries managements, and shall aim to ensure that exploitation of\r\nliving marine biological resources restores and maintains population of\r\nharvested species above levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield.\r\nIt also provides that the Union shall aim to take management and conservation\r\nmeasures based on best available scientific advice, to promote fishing methods\r\nthat contribute to more selective fishing and the avoidance and reduction, as\r\nfar as possible, of unwanted catches, to fish with low impact on marine\r\necosystem and fishery resources and to gradually eliminate discards. Besides,\r\nthe regulation specifically provides that these principles shall be applied by\r\nthe Union in its external policy. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision 95/399/EC[3]\r\nthe Union approved the Agreement, which established the Indian Ocean Tuna\r\nCommission (IOTC). Within that Organisation, the IOTC Commission is responsible\r\nfor the adoption of conservation and management measures designed to ensure the\r\nlong-term conservation and sustainable use of the fishery resources in the IOTC\r\nArea of Competence and to safeguard the marine eco-systems in which these\r\nresources occur. Such conservation and management measures may become binding\r\nupon the Union.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 218(9)\r\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\r\nthe position to be adopted on behalf of the Union in\r\nRegional Fisheries Management Organisations when they are called upon to adopt\r\nacts having legal effects, with the exception of acts supplementing or amending\r\ntheir institutional framework, must be adopted by Council decision, on a\r\nproposal from the Commission.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the evolving\r\nnature of fishery resources in the IOTC Area of Competence and the consequent\r\nneed for the position of the Union to take account of new developments, including\r\nnew statistical, biological and other information presented before or during\r\nthe annual Meeting of the IOTC Commission, procedures must be established, in\r\nline with the principle of sincere cooperation among the Union institutions\r\nenshrined in Article 13(2) TEU, for the year-to-year specification of the Union\r\nposition;\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe position to be taken by the European Union in the annual Meeting\r\nof the Commission of the IOTC when that body is called upon to adopt decisions\r\nhaving legal effects is set out in Annex I to this Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe\r\nyear-to-year specification of the Union position to be taken in the annual\r\nMeeting of the Commission of the IOTC shall be conducted in accordance with\r\nAnnex II to this Decision.\nArticle 3\nThe Union position set out in Annex I to the present Decision shall\r\nbe assessed and, where appropriate, revised by the Council upon a proposal from\r\nthe Commission, at the latest for the annual Meeting of the Commission on the\r\nIOTC in 2019.\nArticle 4\nThis Decision replaces Council Decision 7537/09 of 23 March 2009.\nArticle 5\nThis Decision shall enter into force on XXX\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\u00a0\u00a0 \n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 236 of 05/10/1995,\r\np.24.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2011) 424 of 13.7.2011.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 236 of 05/10/1995,\r\np.24\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
