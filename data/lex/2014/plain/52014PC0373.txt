This\r\nagreement, which was in addition to the 1980 bilateral fisheries agreement\r\nbetween the European Union and Norway, allowed for reciprocal access between\r\nthose three countries to fish up to 4 nautical miles from their respective\r\nbaselines in the Skagerrak and Kattegat, which are the waters between the North\r\nSea and the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, the Agreement established that, for the\r\npurposes of such fishing, the area in question was deemed to constitute the\r\nhigh seas. Thus the Agreement regulated the relationship between the flag\r\nStates, on the one hand, and the respective Coastal States, on the other.\nThe 1966 Agreement was a simple Agreement,\r\nwhich took into account the particular geography of the Skagerrak and Kattegat area in respect of fisheries and recognised that there were practical reasons to\r\nallow for a simple access regime for what is essentially a very small area of\r\nseas. For that reason, the 1966 Agreement consisted of only three Articles, the\r\nfirst of which defined the area concerned, with the second defining the rights\r\nof access and the desire to harmonise technical regulations.\nWith the accession of Denmark and Sweden to the EU in 1973 and 1995 respectively, the Commission became responsible for\r\nthe management of this Agreement on behalf of those two Member States.\r\nConsultations on the arrangements resulting from this Agreement have been held\r\nin parallel with consultations held under the 1980 bilateral fisheries\r\nagreement.\nThe 1966 Agreement remained in force for\r\nan initial period of 35 years until 2002 and was subsequently extended for two\r\nfive-year periods until 2012. Termination of the agreement was possible through\r\ngiving three years notice by one or other Party prior to the date of expiry of\r\nany five-year period.\nIn view of more recent developments in\r\ninternational fisheries law and, in particular, with the introduction of the UN\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 1982 and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement of\r\n1995, Norway considered that the existing agreement was not in conformity with\r\nthe current provisions of the Law of the Sea. Norway was particularly concerned\r\nwith regard to the provisions on control. Moreover, they considered that the\r\nAgreement was not in harmony with the principles of normal Coastal State jurisdiction pursuant to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and did not\r\ncorrespond with modern conservation and management principles.\nOn 29 July 2009, the Norwegian Foreign\r\nMinistry formally informed the Danish authorities, the Depositary Government of\r\nthe Agreement, that they wished to terminate the Agreement with a formal\r\ndenunciation in accordance with Article 3(3) of the Agreement. Consequently,\r\nthe 1966 Agreement expired on 7 August 2012.\nSubsequently, Norway entered into formal\r\nnegotiations with the Commission, on behalf of the European Union, with the aim\r\nof establishing a new Agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the\r\nSkagerrak and Kattegat area. An Agreement was initialled on 24 October 2013,\r\nwhich is in conformity with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea as well as\r\nsubsequent related provisions in other agreements.\nThis new Agreement will maintain the\r\nexclusive access granted to vessels from Denmark, Norway and Sweden to each other's waters outside 4 nautical miles from the baselines. It will ensure\r\ncontinued reciprocal access for the two Member States and Norway to the respective waters of the other Parties in the Skagerrak area, whilst at the same time,\r\nensuring sound conservation and management measures for fisheries in the area.\r\nFurthermore, it will allow for control measures in harmony with the principles\r\nof normal Coastal State jurisdiction, as is already the case for fisheries in\r\nthe North Sea.\nIn order to guarantee the continuation of\r\naccess by EU vessels for fishing activities, the new Agreement should, pending\r\nits entry into force, be applied provisionally up to two years from the date of\r\nits signature.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND
