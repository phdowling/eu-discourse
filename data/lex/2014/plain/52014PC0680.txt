The original series will incorporate an\r\nexemption with reduced test severity for very narrow cars. The amended series\r\nabolishes the exemption for Contracting Parties that have no intrinsic need to\r\napply it in a first step.\nThe established provisions of Global\r\nTechnical Regulation No 14 on Pole Side Impact, as adopted through the Council\r\nDecision 14675/13[4],\r\nare effectively transposed into the draft new UNECE Regulation and the draft\r\namendment to the draft new UNECE Regulation.\nThe present proposal aims at defining the\r\nUnion's position in the voting of the draft UNECE regulation on Pole Side\r\nImpact, as well as the draft amendment thereto, submitted for vote in the\r\nNovember 2014 WP29 meeting that will take place on 11 to 14 November 2014. \n\u00b7                        \r\nGeneral context\nRegulation (EC) No 661/2009 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning type-approval\r\nrequirements for the general safety of motor vehicles, their trailers and systems,\r\ncomponents and separate technical units intended therefor[5] lays down basic requirements for the type-approval of motor vehicles with respect to\r\nSide Impact Protection through direct reference to UNECE Regulation No 95 \u2013\r\nUniform provisions concerning the approval of vehicles with regard to the\r\nprotection of the occupants in the event of a lateral collision[6]. It is however\r\nrecognised that the aspect of Pole Side Impact is not covered by EU\r\nlegislation.\nHowever, it is still envisaged for the\r\nUnion to vote in favour of the related draft new UNECE Regulation on Pole Side\r\nImpact, as well as the draft amendment thereto, in order to promote common\r\nharmonised requirements at international level which will facilitate\r\ninternational trade. This will enable European vehicle manufacturer and\r\nsupplier industry to follow one set of requirements recognised worldwide, i.e.\r\nin the respective territories of the Contracting Parties to the \u2018Revised 1958\r\nAgreement\u2019 that will implement provisions for Pole Side Impact.\n\u00b7                        \r\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nThere are no existing provisions in the\r\narea of the proposal\n\u00b7                        \r\nConsistency with the other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nIf implemented on EU level, the proposal would\r\nbe in line with the objectives of Directive 2007/46/EC on the approval of motor\r\nvehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical\r\nunits intended for such vehicles. On this basis, the proposal would be consistent\r\nwith the EU objective to provide for a high level of road safety concerning\r\nmotor vehicles.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n \u00b7                         Consultation of interested parties \n In developing the proposal the European Commission has consulted stakeholders. There has been general consultation through the UNECE informal working group on Pole Side Impact under the Working Party on Passive Safety (GRSP) as well as dissemination of information and subsequent discussions in the Technical Committee \u2013 Motor Vehicles during the ongoing development of the Global Technical Regulation on Pole Side Impact and the subsequent draft new UNECE Regulation, and the draft amendment thereto, based on the Global Technical Regulation. \u00b7                         Impact assessment As there are no existing provisions in the area of the proposal that are relevant at this point in time, an impact assessement shall be carried out if the proposed measures are to be implemented on EU level on an obligatory basis. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \r\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal defines the Union's position\r\nin the voting of the draft new UNECE Regulation concerning the approval of\r\nvehicles with regard to their Pole Side Impact performance, as well as the\r\ndraft amendment to that draft new UNECE Regulation.\n\u00b7                        \r\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis for this proposal is\r\nArticle 114, in conjunction with Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union.\n\u00b7                        \r\nSubsidiarity principle\nGeneral requirements for motor vehicle\r\nsafety are already harmonised at Union level. The new provisions may be\r\nintroduced in addition to the existing rules in the future, as decided by the European\r\nParliament and the Council. The vote in favour of international instruments\r\nlike draft UNECE Regulations and their possible incorporation into the Union\r\nsystem for the type-approval of systems used in motor vehicles can only be done\r\nby the Union. This does not only prevent fragmentation of the Internal Market,\r\nbut also ensures an equal level of safety standards across the Union. It also\r\noffers advantages of economies of scale: products can be made for the entire\r\nUnion market and even the international market, instead of being customised to\r\nobtain national type-approval for every single Member State.\nThe proposal therefore complies with the\r\nsubsidiarity principle.\n\u00b7                        \r\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle as it does not go beyond what is necessary in order\r\nto achieve the objectives of ensuring the proper functioning of the Internal\r\nMarket while at the same time enabling a high level of public safety and\r\nprotection.\n\u00b7                        \r\nChoice of instruments\nThe use of a Council Decision is required\r\nby Article 218(9) TFEU in order to establish the positions to be adopted on the\r\nUnion's behalf in a body set up by an international agreement.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nUnion budget.\n2014/0314 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be adopted on\r\nthe Union's behalf in the Administrative Committee of the United Nations\r\nEconomic Commission for Europe on the draft new Regulation on pole side impact\r\nand on the draft amendment to the new Regulation on pole side

Side Impact performance[9] are intended to remove\r\ntechnical barriers to the trade in motor vehicles and their components between\r\nthe Contracting Parties to the \u2018Revised 1958 Agreement\u2019 and to ensure that such\r\nvehicles and components offer a high level of safety and protection.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to establish\r\nthe position to be taken on
