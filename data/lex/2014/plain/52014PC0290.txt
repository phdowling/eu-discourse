Among these Parties are the Union, the Member States and Iceland. \nArticle 4 of the Kyoto Protocol allows\r\nParties to fulfil their commitments jointly. The Union and the fifteen Parties\r\nthat were Member States when the Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997 chose to do\r\nso for the first commitment period (2008-12), and agreed on/set out the terms\r\nof their joint fulfilment for the first commitment period when they ratified\r\nthe Protocol in 2002.[2]\r\nThe Doha Amendment[3],\r\nand the statement made by the Union, the Member States and Iceland upon its adoption,[4]\r\nexpress the intention of these Parties to fulfil their reduction targets under\r\nthe second commitment period jointly. The Commission proposed a Council\r\nDecision on the conclusion of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to the\r\nUNFCCC and the joint fulfilment of commitments thereunder in November 2013.[5] This proposal is\r\ncurrently under discussion.\nThe intention to jointly fulfil the\r\ncommitments in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol with the\r\nEuropean Union, its Member States and Iceland dates back to 2009. In a letter\r\nto the Presidency of the Council of the European Union dated 3 June 2009, Iceland requested formal talks on announcing a joint fulfilment of their commitments with the\r\nEuropean Union and its Member States in a second commitment period of the Kyoto\r\nProtocol. The Council, at its meeting on 15 December\r\n2009, welcomed this request and invited the Commission to 'present a\r\nrecommendation for the opening of the necessary negotiations with Iceland that is in line with the principles and criteria set out in the EU's Climate and\r\nEnergy Package'.[6]\nThe Commission presented its recommendation\r\nfor a Council Decision authorising the opening of negotiations with Iceland to the Council in June 2013. In December 2013, the Council gave the Commission a\r\nmandate to open, on behalf of the Union, negotiations with Iceland on an agreement that establishes the terms of joint fulfilment concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the Union, the Member States and Iceland. The representatives of the Member States in the Council also gave a mandate to the\r\nCommission to negotiate this agreement, on behalf of the Member States, with\r\nregard to areas falling in the competence of Member States. These negotiations\r\nhave been conducted, in line with the negotiating directives, on the basis of\r\nArticle 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and resulted\r\nin the agreement attached to this proposed Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement with Iceland\nThe agreement with Iceland attached to this proposed Decision sets out the terms governing Iceland's participation in\r\nthe joint fulfilment of commitments by the Union, its Member States and Iceland. It does not establish any obligations for the Union or its Member States.\nIceland's\r\nparticipation in the joint fulfilment\nIceland's participates\r\nin the joint fulfilment on the same basis as that of the Member States. Iceland's emission level, identical to its assigned amount, will relate to Iceland's emissions from gases and sectors covered under the Kyoto Protocol's second\r\ncommitment period but that are not covered under the EU's greenhouse gas\r\nemissions trading system (Directive 2003/87/EC[7]).\n[insert text on Iceland's assigned amount,\r\nonce determined]\nThe agreement with Iceland will, in its\r\nAnnex II, contain the same terms of joint fulfilment that are also laid down in\r\nan annex Annexed to the Council Decision on the conclusion of the Doha\r\nAmendment to the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC and the joint fulfilment of\r\ncommitments thereunder.\nApplication of relevant EU legislation\r\nto Iceland\nAs Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, the Union\r\nand the Member States are subject to a number of monitoring, reporting and\r\nverification requirements under the Kyoto Protocol. For Parties that have\r\nagreed to fulfil their commitments jointly, some of this information needs to\r\nbe submitted jointly. As a consequence, the Commission will require information\r\nfrom Iceland to enable the Union to fulfil its reporting commitments. Moreover,\r\n Iceland will need to participate in the registry system of the Union and its Member States that are relevant for the fulfilment of obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nThis requires Iceland to apply Union legislation that is not applicable to third\r\ncountries (including the Parties to the European Economic Area) , especially in\r\nrelation to the monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions as well as with\r\nregard to the operation of a registry and the accounting for transactions\r\nrelated to the implementation of commitments of the Union, its Member States\r\nand Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol in line with\r\nthe terms of joint fulfilment and the internationally agreed rules.\nThe agreement contains, in its Annex I, a\r\nlist of Union legislation that shall be binding upon Iceland. It also provides\r\nfor a procedure to amend this list, to ensure that Iceland's participation in\r\nthe joint fulfilment and follows the same rules and responsibilities as that of\r\nMember States, in line with internationally agreed requirements.\nJoint Fulfilment Committee\nThe agreement with Iceland provides for the establishment of a Joint Fulfilment Committee, which ensures the\r\neffective implementation and operation of the agreement. This committee\r\nconsists of representatives of the Union, the Member States and Iceland and takes decisions by consensus. It may take decisions on the application of\r\nrelevant Union legislation to Iceland and carries out exchanges of views and\r\ninformation related to the implementation of the terms of the joint fulfilment.\r\nIts meetings will be arranged, whenever possible, adjacent to those of the\r\nClimate Change Committee, established in accordance with Article 26 of\r\nRegulation 525/2013[8].\nDuration and termination of the\r\nagreement with Iceland\nThe agreement with Iceland is concluded for a limited time period, until all matters related to the\r\nimplementation of the second commitment period will have been completed. This\r\nis in line with Article 4 of the Kyoto Protocol which requires any Parties'\r\nagreement to jointly fulfil their commitments to remain in operation for the\r\nduration of the respective commitment period.\nIn case of a breach by Iceland, or objection by Iceland to amend the list of legal acts with application in Iceland according to this agreement, Iceland will be individually responsible to account for all of\r\nits greenhouse gas emissions covered by the Kyoto Protocol, including those\r\nunder the scope of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions trading system.\nThis agreement has no budgetary implications\r\nfor the Union.\n2014/0151 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, of the agreement between the European Union and its Member\r\nStates and Iceland concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment\r\nof commitments of the European Union, its Member States and Iceland in the\r\nsecond commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 192(1), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(6) (a), thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[9],\r\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Kyoto Protocol to the\r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (\u201cthe Protocol\u201d) entered\r\ninto force on 16 February 2005 and contains legally binding emission reduction\r\ncommitments for its first commitment period, from 2008 to 2012, for Parties\r\nlisted in its Annex B. The Union and the Member States ratified the Protocol on\r\n31 May 2002, and agreed to fulfil its commitments under the first commitment\r\nperiod jointly.[10]\r\n  Iceland ratified the Protocol on 23 May 2002.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the Doha Climate\r\nConference in December 2012, all Parties to the Protocol agreed on the Doha\r\nAmendment which establishes a second commitment period of the Protocol (starting\r\non 1 January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2020). The Doha Amendment amends\r\nAnnex B of the Protocol, setting out further legally-binding mitigation\r\ncommitments for Parties listed in that Annex for the second commitment period, and\r\namending and further elaborates provisions on the implementation of Parties\u2019\r\ncommitments during the second commitment period.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The targets for the\r\nEuropean Union, its Member States and Iceland are inscribed in the Doha Amendment\r\nwith a footnote stating that these targets are based on the understanding that\r\nthese will be fulfilled jointly, in accordance with Article 4 of the Kyoto\r\nProtocol.[11]\r\nThe Union, the Member States and Iceland also issued a joint declaration upon\r\nthe adoption of the Doha Amendment[12],\r\nexpressing their intention to fulfil their commitments in the second commitment\r\nperiod jointly. The declaration was agreed during an ad hoc meeting of EU Ministers\r\nin Doha and endorsed by the Council on 17 December 2012.[13]\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the same declaration,\r\nthe Union, the Member States and Iceland also stated, in line with Article 4(1)\r\nof the Kyoto Protocol, which allows Parties to fulfil their commitments under\r\nArticle 3 of the Protocol jointly, that Article 3(7ter) of the Protocol will be\r\napplied to the joint assigned amount pursuant to the agreement on joint\r\nfulfilment by the European Union, its Member States, Croatia and Iceland and\r\nwill not be applied to Member States, Croatia or Iceland individually.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCouncil, at its meeting on 15 December 2009, welcomed a request by Iceland to\r\nfulfill its commitments under a second commitment period jointly with the\r\nEuropean Union and its Member States and invited the Commission to present a\r\nrecommendation for the opening of the necessary negotiations on an agreement with\r\nIceland that is in line with the principles and criteria set out in the Union's\r\nClimate and Energy Package.[14]\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 4(1) of the\r\nProtocol requires Parties that agree to fulfil their commitments under Article\r\n3 of the Protocol jointly to set out the respective emission level allocated to\r\neach of the Parties to the agreement in that agreement. Article 4(2) of the\r\nProtocol requires the Parties to a joint fulfilment agreement to notify the\r\nSecretariat of the Protocol of the terms of this agreement on the date of\r\ndeposit of their instruments of ratification or approval.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The terms of the agreement\r\nto fulfil jointly the commitments of the European Union, its Member States and\r\nIceland under Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol are laid down in an annex to the\r\nCouncil Decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the\r\nDoha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC and the joint fulfilment of\r\ncommitments thereunder.[15]\r\nThese same terms are also laid down in an annex to the agreement with Iceland.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure that Iceland's\r\nobligations in the joint fulfilment are laid down and applied in a\r\nnon-discriminatory manner, treating Iceland and Member States alike, the\r\nemission level for Iceland was determined in a way that is consistent both with\r\nthe quantified emissions reduction commitment inscribed in the third column of\r\nAnnex B to the Kyoto Protocol (as amended by the Doha Amendment) and with EU\r\nlegislation, including the 2009 Climate and Energy Package and the principles\r\nand criteria on which objectives in that
