The European\r\nParliament and the Council will then both exercise their legislative\r\ncompetences, taking into account the best interests of the child.\"\nThe Commission agreed, through the same\r\nDeclaration, with the suggested approach:\n\"The Commission, in a spirit of\r\ncompromise and in order to ensure the immediate adoption of the proposal,\r\naccepts to consider this invitation, which it understands as being limited to\r\nthese specific circumstances and not creating a precedent.\"\nOn 6 June 2013, the Court of Justice of the\r\nEuropean Union delivered its judgment in the case C-648/11, ruling that:\n\"The second paragraph of Article 6 of\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 of 18 February 2003 establishing the\r\ncriteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for\r\nexamining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a\r\nthird-country national must be interpreted as meaning that, in circumstances\r\nsuch as those of the main proceedings, where an unaccompanied minor with no\r\nmember of his family legally present in the territory of a Member State has\r\nlodged asylum applications in more than one Member State, the Member State in\r\nwhich that minor is present after having lodged an asylum application there is\r\nto be designated the \u2018Member State responsible\".\n\u00b7                        \r\nObjectives of the proposal\nThis proposal takes highest account of the\r\nCourt of Justice's ruling in case C-648/11. It is aimed at addressing the\r\ncurrent ambiguity of the provision on unaccompanied minors who have no family,\r\nsiblings or relatives on the territory of the Member States, by providing legal\r\ncertainty in respect of responsibility for examining the application for\r\ninternational protection in such cases.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nSpecific consultations and impact\r\nassessments in preparation of the current proposal were not necessary since this\r\nnarrowly targeted proposal constitutes a follow-up to the comprehensive\r\nconsultation and impact assessments already undertaken by the Commission in\r\npreparation of its proposal COM(2008)820 final to recast Council Regulation\r\n(EC) No 343/2003/EC. Therefore, the consultations carried out by the Commission\r\nin preparation of that proposal apply to the present proposal. \nThe Commission considers that the proposal\r\nto amend Article 8(4) should be put forward as soon as possible, in order to\r\nensure legal certainty as regards the provisions on unaccompanied minors in the\r\n'Dublin procedure'. Moreover, it is indispensable to have a final version of\r\nthis Article before proceeding to providing supplementary rules on\r\nunaccompanied minors on the basis of Article 290 of the Treaty of the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \r\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe present proposal addresses the issue of\r\nresponsibility for examining the asylum application of an unaccompanied minor\r\nwith no family, siblings or relatives on EU territory. The proposed provision covers\r\nthe two possible cases of unaccompanied minors found in such a situation:\nParagraph 4a covers the situation similar\r\nto that described in case C-648/11, i.e. an unaccompanied minor with no family,\r\nsibling or relatives on EU territory and who lodged multiple asylum\r\napplications, including in the Member State where he or she is currently\r\npresent. In this case, the Member State responsible is established according to\r\nthe Court of Justice's judgment, i.e. responsibility belongs to the Member State where the minor lodged an application and is currently present. The purpose of\r\nthis rule is to ensure that the procedure for determining the Member State responsible is not unnecessarily prolonged, and that unaccompanied minors have\r\nprompt access to the procedures for determining international protection status.\r\nThe reference to the minor's best interests is introduced in order to allow\r\nexceptions from this rule in cases where individual circumstances might\r\nindicate that remaining in the territory of the Member State where he or she is\r\npresent might jeopardize the minor's best interests.\nParagraph 4b addresses the situation where\r\na minor who is an applicant for international protection is present in the\r\nterritory of a Member State without having lodged an application there. The\r\nproposal is that the Member State should provide the minor with the opportunity\r\nto lodge an application there, after having informed him or her of such a right\r\nand its implications. The minor has therefore two options: either to apply for\r\ninternational protection in that Member State or not to apply. Where an\r\napplication is lodged with the authorities of that Member State, the\r\ncircumstances of paragraph 4a apply, i.e. that Member State becomes responsible\r\nfor examining that application. Thus, the minor will remain in the Member State where he/she is present and have his or her application examined there,\r\nprovided that this corresponds to the minor's best interests. The alternative\r\nis that the minor should be transferred to the Member State which the\r\nconsideration of the minor's best interests indicates as most suitable (which\r\ncan include, though it cannot be limited to, the fact that a procedure for\r\nexamining the application for international protection might be on-going or\r\nclosed with a final decision, etc.).\nThe case of a minor who decides not to lodge\r\na new application in the Member State where he/she is present is not addressed\r\nby case C-648/11. However, this situation needs to be covered in the\r\nRegulation, in order to avoid loopholes in the responsibility criteria. The\r\nsolution proposed is that the Member State responsible should be the one where\r\nthe minor has lodged his or her most recent application. This rule aims to\r\nensure that there is certainty in establishing the Member State responsible, by\r\nintroducing a rule that is certain and predictable. The reference to the\r\nminor's best interests is added in order to ensure, as in paragraph 4a, that\r\ntransfers contrary to his or her best interests are avoided.\nParagraph 4c aims at ensuring that the\r\nassessment of the minor's best interests is made in cooperation between the\r\nrequested and the requesting Member States, in order to establish in common the\r\n  Member State responsible for the minor and avoid conflicts of interest.\nThe guarantees for minors provided in\r\nArticle 6 of Regulation 604/2013 apply to all minors that are subject to the\r\nprocedures of this Regulation. Therefore, an explicit reference to the\r\nprovisions of Article 6 in respect of unaccompanied minors found in one of the\r\nsituations described in Article 8(4) was not considered necessary.\nParagraph 4d does not contain a criterion\r\nfor establishing responsibility, but provides a rule allowing Member States to\r\ninform each other of a newly assumed responsibility. This allows the Member State previously responsible for carrying out a 'Dublin procedure' to close the case in\r\nits internal administration. This is particularly relevant in order to avoid\r\nsituations of abuse of the system, where the minor moves on to another Member State for no other reason than to prolong his or her stay on EU territory. The\r\nprovision is similar to that in Article 17(1)(2) of Regulation 604/2013, where\r\nthe same information rule is introduced in respect of the sovereignty clause. \n\u00b7                        \r\nVariable geometry\nThis proposal amends Regulation (EU) No 604/2013\r\nand uses the same legal base as that act, namely Article 78, second paragraph,\r\npoint (e) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nTitle V of the TFEU is not applicable to\r\nthe United Kingdom and Ireland, unless those two countries decide otherwise, in\r\naccordance with the provisions set out in the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and to the TFEU.\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland are bound by Regulation 604/2013, following their notice of their wish to take part\r\nin the adoption and application of that Regulation based on the above-mentioned\r\nProtocol. The position of these Member States with regard to Regulation\r\n604/2013 does not affect their possible participation with regard to the\r\namended Regulation.\nUnder the Protocol on the position of\r\nDenmark, annexed to the TEU and the TFEU, Denmark does not take part in the\r\nadoption by the Council of the measures pursuant to Title V of the TFEU (with\r\nthe exception of \"measures determining the third countries whose nationals\r\nmust be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the\r\nMember States, or measures relating to a uniform format\r\nfor visas\").\r\nHowever, given that Denmark applies the current Dublin Regulation,\r\non the basis of an international agreement that it concluded with the EC in\r\n2006[3], it shall, in\r\naccordance with Article 3 of that agreement, notify the Commission of its\r\ndecision whether or not to implement the content of the amended Regulation.\n\u00b7                        \r\nImpact of the proposal on non EU Member States\r\nassociated to the Dublin system\nIn parallel to the association of several\r\nnon-EU Member States to the Schengen acquis, the Community concluded several\r\nagreements associating these countries also to the Dublin/Eurodac acquis:\n\u2013                        \r\nthe agreement associating Iceland and Norway, concluded in 2001[4];\n\u2013                        \r\nthe agreement associating Switzerland, concluded on 28 February 2008[5];\n\u2013                        \r\nthe protocol associating Liechtenstein, signed on 28 February 2008[6].\nIn order to create rights and obligations\r\nbetween Denmark \u2013 which as explained above has been associated to the\r\nDublin/Eurodac acquis via an international agreement \u2013 and the associated\r\ncountries mentioned above, two other instruments have been concluded between the\r\nCommunity and the associated countries[7].\nIn accordance with the three above-cited\r\nagreements, the associated countries shall accept the Dublin/Eurodac acquis and\r\nits development without exception. They do not take part in the adoption of any\r\nacts amending or building upon the Dublin acquis (including therefore this proposal)\r\nbut have to notify to the Commission within a given time-frame of their\r\ndecision whether or not to accept the content of that act, once approved by the\r\nCouncil and the European Parliament. In case Norway, Iceland, Switzerland or\r\nLiechtenstein do not accept an act amending or building upon the Dublin/Eurodac\r\nacquis, the \"guillotine\" clause is applied and the respective\r\nagreements will be terminated, unless the Joint/Mixed Committee established by\r\nthe agreements decides otherwise by unanimity.\n2014/0202 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 as\r\nregards determining the Member State responsible for examining the application\r\nfor international protection of unaccompanied minors with no family member,\r\nsibling or relative legally present in a Member State\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 78(2(e) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[8],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[9],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[10] determines the Member State where the unaccompanied minor has lodged the application for international\r\nprotection as the Member State responsible for examining that application. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After adoption of the Regulation\r\n(EU) No 604/2013 the Court of Justice ruled in case C-648/11 that, where an\r\nunaccompanied minor with no family member legally present in the territory of a\r\nMember State has lodged asylum applications in more than one Member State, the\r\nMember State in which that minor is present after having lodged an asylum\r\napplication there is to be designated as the Member State responsible.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The situation of an\r\nunaccompanied minor with no family member legally present in the territory of a\r\nMember State, who has lodged asylum applications in one or more Member States,\r\nand who is present in the territory of a Member State without having lodged an\r\napplication there, has not been addressed by the judgment. In order to ensure a\r\ncoherent provision on unaccompanied minors in this Regulation and avoid legal uncertainty,\r\nthe criterion for establishing the Member State responsible in such a situation\r\nshould equally be provided for.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the judgment,\r\nthe Member State responsible should inform accordingly the Member State with which the first application has been lodged. Since the asylum application is\r\nrequired to be examined only by a single Member State, the Member State responsible\r\nshould inform of its decision the Member State previously responsible, the Member\r\nState conducting a procedure for determining the Member State responsible or the\r\nMember State which has been requested to take charge or take back the minor, as\r\nthe case may be.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [In accordance with\r\nArticle 3 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United\r\nKingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice,\r\nannexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, those\r\nMember States have notified their wish to take part in the adoption and\r\napplication of this Regulation.] \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\r\nArticles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to\r\nits application.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 604/2013\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nIn Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 paragraph 4 of\r\nArticle 8 is replaced by the following:\n\"4a. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the unaccompanied\r\nminor has no family member, sibling or relative legally present in a Member State as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Member State responsible shall be the\r\none where the unaccompanied minor has lodged an application for international\r\nprotection and is present, provided that this is in the best interests of the\r\nminor. \u00a0\n4b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where an applicant as referred\r\nto in paragraph 4a is \u00a0present in the territory of a Member State without\r\nhaving lodged an application there, that Member State shall inform the unaccompanied\r\nminor of the right to make an application and give him or her an effective\r\nopportunity to lodge an application in that Member State. \nWhere the unaccompanied minor referred to in\r\nthe first subparagraph lodges an application in the Member State where he or she is present that Member State shall become responsible for examining that application,\r\nprovided this is in the best interests of the minor. \nWhere the unaccompanied minor referred to in\r\nthe first subparagraph does not lodge an application in the Member State where he or she is present, the Member State responsible shall be the one where\r\nthe unaccompanied minor has lodged his or her most recent application, unless\r\nthis is not in the best interests of the minor.\n4c.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member State requested\r\nto take back an unaccompanied minor shall cooperate with the Member State where the unaccompanied minor is present in order to assess the best interests of\r\nthe minor. \n4d. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member State, which is\r\nresponsible pursuant to paragraph 4a, shall inform the following Member States,\r\nas applicable, thereof:\n(a)         \r\nthe Member State previously responsible;
