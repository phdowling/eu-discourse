This review is to take place in the fourth year of application of the Agreement. \n\n\n\n2.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\nSuch measures are laid down in Annex IV to the Agreement on the financial control of Faroese participants in the Programme covered by the Agreement.\n\n\nWhen the implementation of the Framework Programme calls for the use of external contractors or entails granting financial contributions to third parties, the Commission will carry out, where appropriate, financial audits, in particular if it has reason to doubt the realistic nature of work performed or described in the activity reports.\n\n\nThe Union's financial audits will be carried out either by its own staff or by accounting experts approved according to the law of the audited party. The Union will choose the latter freely, while avoiding any risks of conflicts of interest which might be indicated to it by the party subject to the audit. In addition, the Commission will make sure, in carrying out the research activities, that the financial interests of the Union are protected by effective checks and, where irregularities are detected, by deterrent and proportionate measures and penalties.\n\n\nIn order to achieve this aim, rules on checks, measures and penalties, with reference to Regulations No 2988/95, No 2185/96 and No 883/2013 will be incorporated in all contracts used in the implementation of the Framework Programme.\n\n\nIn particular, the following points will have to be provided for in the contracts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- the introduction of specific contractual clauses to protect the financial interests of the EU in carrying out checks and controls in relation to the work performed;\n\n\n- the carrying out of administrative checks as part of anti-fraud measures, in accordance with Regulations No 2185/96, No 883/2013;\n\n\n- the application of administrative penalties for all intentional or negligent irregularities in the implementation of the contracts, in accordance with the Framework Regulation No 2988/95, including a blacklisting mechanism;\n\n\n- The fact that decisions taken by the Commission in application of Art. 299 TFEU to enforce recovery of amounts due and unpaid by Faroese beneficiaries following to their participation to \u201cHorizon 2020\u201d will be enforceable in the Faroe Islands.\n\n\n- In addition and as a routine measure, a control programme in respect of scientific and budgetary aspects will be carried out by the responsible staff in the DG for Research and Innovation; an internal audit will be carried out by the Internal Audit unit of DG Research and Innovation; and local inspections will be undertaken by the European Court of Auditors.\n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected\u00a0\n\n\n\uf0b7Existing

The interest rate for amounts receivable not repaid on the due date shall be the rate applied by the European Central Bank to its principal refinancing operations, as published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union, in force on the first calendar day of the month in which the due date falls, increased by one and a half percentage points.\n\n\nIn case the delay in the payment of the contribution is such that it may significantly jeopardise the implementation and management of the programme, participation in the programme of the Faroes for the concerned financial year will be suspended by the Commission following the absence of payment 20 working days after a formal letter of reminder sent to the Faroes, without prejudice to the Union's obligations in accordance with grant agreements and/or contracts already concluded pertaining to the implementation of selected indirect actions.\n\n\n4.At the latest on 31 May of the year following a financial year, the statement of appropriations for\u00a0Horizon 2020 for that financial year shall be prepared and transmitted to the Faroes for information, in accordance with the format of the Commission's revenue and expenditure account.\n\n\n5.The Commission, at the time of the closure of the accounts relating to each financial year, within the framework of the establishment of the revenue and expenditure account, shall proceed to the regularisation of the accounts with respect to the participation of the Faroes. This regularisation shall take into consideration modifications which have taken place, either by transfer, cancellations, carryovers, de-commitments, or by supplementary and amending budgets during the financial year. This regularisation shall occur at the time of the second payment for the next financial year, and for the last financial year in July\u00a02021. Further regularisation shall occur every year until July\u00a02023.\n\n\n\n\nannex iv\n\n\nFinancial control of FAROESE participants in the Programmes covered by this Agreement \n\n\nI.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Direct Communication\n\n\nThe Commission shall communicate directly with the participants in the Programme established in the Faroes and with their subcontractors.

The non-provision of such rights would be regarded as a failure to substantiate costs and, consequently, as a potential breach of the grant agreements. \n\n\n3.The audits may be conducted after the Programme or this Agreement expire, on the terms laid down in the grant agreements and/or contracts in question.\u00a0\n\n\nIII.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On-The-Spot Checks\u00a0\n\n\n1.Within the framework of this Agreement, the Commission (OLAF) shall be authorised to carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections in the premises of participants and their subcontractors from the Faroes, in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96\n9\n.\n\n\n\n\n2.On-the-spot checks and inspections shall be prepared and conducted by the Commission in close collaboration with the National Audit Office (Landsgrannsko\u00f0anin).\u00a0The latter shall be notified a reasonable time in advance of the object, purpose and legal basis of the checks and inspections, so that they can provide assistance. To that end, the officials of the competent Faroese authorities may participate in the on-the-spot checks and inspections.\n\n\n3.If the Faroese authorities concerned so wish, the on-the-spot checks and inspections may be carried out jointly by the Commission and them.\n\n\n4.Where the participants in the Programme resist an on-the-spot check or inspection, the Faroese authorities, acting in accordance with national rules and regulations, shall assist the Commission inspectors, to a reasonable extent as needed to allow them to fulfil their duty in carrying out an on-the-spot check or inspection.\n\n\n5.The Commission shall report as soon as possible to the competent Faroese authority any fact or suspicion relating to an irregularity which has come to its notice in the course of the on-the-spot check or inspection. In any case the Commission shall be required to inform the abovementioned authority of the result of such checks and inspections.\n\n\nIV.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Information and Consultation\n\n\n1.For the purposes of proper implementation of this Annex, the competent Faroese and Union authorities shall regularly exchange information, unless forbidden or unauthorised by national rules and regulations and, at the request of one of the Parties, shall conduct consultations.\n\n\n2.The competent Faroese authorities shall inform the Commission within reasonable time of any fact or suspicion which has come to their notice relating to an irregularity in connection with the conclusion and implementation of the grant agreements and/or contracts concluded in application of the instruments referred to in this Agreement.\n\n\nV.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Confidentiality\n\n\nInformation communicated or acquired in any form under this Annex shall be covered by professional secrecy and protected in the same way as similar information is protected by Faroese law and by the corresponding provisions applicable to the Union's institutions. Such information may not be communicated to persons other than those within the Union\u2019s institutions or in the Member States or the Faroes whose functions legally require them to know it, nor may it be used for purposes other than to ensure effective protection of the Parties' financial interests.\n\n\nVI.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Administrative Measures and Penalties\n\n\nWithout prejudice to application of Faroese criminal law, administrative measures and penalties may be imposed by the Commission in accordance with Regulations (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, (EU) No 1268/2012 and (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95\n10\n.\n\n\nVII.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recovery and Enforcement\n\n\nDecisions taken by the Commission under Horizon 2020 covered by this Agreement which impose a pecuniary obligation on persons other than States shall be enforceable in the Faroes. If so requested by the Commission, the authority designated by the Government of the Faroes shall commence proceedings for the enforcement of the decision on behalf of the Commission. In this case, the decision of the Commission shall be submitted to the Faroese Court, without other formality than verification of the authenticity of the decision, by the authority designated for this purpose by the Government of the Faroes, which shall inform the Commission thereof. Enforcement shall take place in accordance with the Faroese law and rules of procedure. The relevant enforcement provisions shall be incorporated in the grant agreements and/or contracts with participants from the Faroes. The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to review the legality of the decision of the Commission and suspend its enforcement. Moreover, the Faroese Court shall have jurisdiction over complaints that enforcement is being carried out in an irregular manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nRegulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing Horizon 2020 (OJ L347, 20.12.2013, p.104).\n\n\n\n(2)\nCouncil Decision establishing the Specific Programme implementing Horizon 2020 (OJ L347, 20.12.2013, p.965).\n\n\n\n(3)\nOJ L347, 20.12.2013, p.104.\n\n\n\n(4)\nOJ L347, 20.12.2013, p.81.\n\n\n\n(5)\nOJ L347, 20.12.2013, p.965.\n\n\n\n(6)\nRegulation (EU)No 1292/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 amending Regulation (EC) No 294/2008 establishing the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (OJ L347, 20.12.2013, p.174).\u00a0\n\n\n\n(7)\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the  (OJ L298, 26.10.2012).\u00a0\n\n\n\n(8)\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the  (OJ L362, 31.12.2012).\n\n\n\n(9)\n0J\u00a0L292, 15.11.1996, p. 2.\n\n\n\n(10)\nCouncil Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests (OJ L312, 23.12.1995).\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
