On 8 May 2013 the ESM Board of\r\nDirectors approved the financial assistance facility agreement. The macroeconomic\r\nadjustment programme aims at restoring financial market confidence,\r\nre-establishing sound macroeconomic balances and enabling the economy to return\r\nto sustainable growth. \nThe macroeconomic adjustment programme for Cyprus was initially adopted by the Council by Decision 2013/236/EU on 25 April 2013.\r\nFollowing the entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, the programme\r\nwas readopted on the basis of Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 by\r\nCouncil Implementing Decision 2013/463/EU. At the same time, Decision 2013/236/EU\r\nwas repealed.\nIn line with\r\nArticle 1(2) of Decision 2013/463/EU, the Commission, in liaison with the European\r\nCentral Bank (ECB), and, where appropriate, with the International Monetary\r\nFund (IMF), has conducted the third review to assess the progress on the\r\nimplementation of the agreed measures as well as their effectiveness and\r\neconomic and social impact. As a result, the programme should be updated in the\r\nareas of financial sector reform, fiscal policy, and structural reforms. For the financial sector, the revised MoU will stipulate that a\r\ncommunication strategy on the roadmap for the relaxation of the capital\r\ncontrols and on the implementation of the banking sector strategy is to be\r\ndesigned by a joint Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) and Ministry of Finance task\r\nforce. In addition, the revised MoU will call for the timely reporting of\r\nbanks' estimates of the potential impact of the newly introduced and upcoming European\r\nUnion (EU) rules on capital requirements and non-performing loans (NPLs) on\r\ncapital, profitability and coverage ratio. Finally, a new section on the reform\r\nof the legal framework of private debt restructuring is to be added. Under this\r\npolicy advice, a task force is to be established to assess the magnitude of\r\nregistered by untitled land sales contract, and to provide recommendations on\r\nthis issue. A comprehensive reform framework establishing appropriate corporate\r\nand personal insolvency procedures is to be established. Finally, the Civil\r\nProcedure Code and Court Rules will be reviewed to ensure a smooth and\r\neffective functioning of the revised foreclosure and insolvency frameworks. With\r\nregard to fiscal policy, the general government primary deficit target in 2014\r\nis revised to 1.8% of GDP. In the area of structural reforms, the revised MoU will\r\ninclude a committement to implement a first stage of the National Health System\r\n(NHS), having first defined and adopted a full roadmap to NHS. It is also\r\nrequired that the policies on pricing and reimbursement of medical goods and\r\nservices, including those related to pharmaceutical expenditure, are to be\r\nrevised. Morevoer, it is required that a Privatisation Unit is established. In\r\naddition, the revised MoU will contain a commitment that Cyprus presents an action plan for addressing the shortcoming identified in Phase 2 of the\r\npeer review by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\r\nGlobal Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. Lastly,\r\nthe new MoU includes a requirement to develop a growth strategy based on Cyprus' competitive advantages to help the Cypriot authorities to kick-off the economy.\nThe proposed decision will ensure full\r\nconsistency between the Union multilateral surveillance framework established\r\nby the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the policy\r\nconditionality underpinning the financial assistance. Notably, Article 10 of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 472/2013 provides for consistency in reporting and\r\nmonitoring obligations. \n2014/0063 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\namending Implementing Decision 2013/463/EU\r\non approving the macroeconomic adjustment programme for Cyprus\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Regulation (EU) No\r\n472/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on the\r\nstrengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the\r\neuro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to\r\ntheir financial stability[1],\r\nand in particular Article 7(2) and (5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n472/2013 applies to Member States already in receipt of financial assistance,\r\nincluding those from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), at the time of its\r\nentry into force.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n472/2013 sets the rules for the approval of macroeconomic adjustment programme\r\nfor Member States in receipt of financial assistance, which need to be consistent\r\nwith the provisions of the Treaty of Establishing the ESM. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon a request of 25 June\r\n2012 by Cyprus for financial assistance from the ESM, the Council decided on 25\r\nApril 2013 by Decision 2013/236/EU[2]\r\nthat Cyprus was to rigorously implement a macroeconomic adjustment programme.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 24 April 2013 the ESM\r\nBoard of Governors decided to grant, in principle, stability support to Cyprus and approved the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy\r\nConditionality (hereinafter referred to as the \"MoU\") and its signing\r\nby the Commission on behalf of the ESM.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n1(2) of Implementing Decision 2013/463/EU, the Commission, in liaison with the\r\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB), and, where appropriate, with the International Monetary\r\nFund (IMF), has conducted the third review to assess the progress with the\r\nimplementation of the agreed measures as well as their effectiveness and\r\neconomic and social impact. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a result, Decision\r\n2013/463/EU should be updated in the areas of financial sector reform, fiscal\r\npolicy and structural reforms, notably with regard to (i)\r\nthe design of a communication strategy by a joint Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC)\r\nand Ministry of Finance task force on the roadmap for the relaxation of the\r\ncapital controls and on the implementation of the banking sector strategy; (ii)\r\nthe timely reporting of banks' estimates of the potential impact of the newly\r\nintroduced and upcoming EU rules on capital requirements and non-performing\r\nloans (NPLs) on capital, profitability and coverage ratio; (iii) the\r\nestablishment of a task force to assess the magnitude of registered by untitled\r\nland sales contract, and to provide recommendations on this issue; (iv) the reform\r\nof corporate and personal insolvency procedures; (v) the review of the Civil\r\nProcedure Code and Court Rules to ensure a smooth and effective functioning of\r\nthe revised foreclosure and insolvency frameworks; (vi) a revision of the\r\nprimary deficit target for 2014 to 1.8% of GDP; (vii) the implementation of a\r\nfirst stage of the National Health System (NHS), having first defined and\r\nadopted a full roadmap to NHS; (viii) the revision of policies on pricing and\r\nreimbursement of medical goods and services, including those related to\r\npharmaceutical expenditure; (ix) the establishment of a Privatisation Unit; (x)\r\nthe presentation of an action plan for addressing the shortcoming identified in\r\nPhase 2 of the peer review by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\r\n(OECD) Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax\r\nPurposes; (xi) the development of a growth strategy based on Cyprus'\r\ncompetitive advantages to help the Cypriot authorities to kick-off the economy.\r\nThe implementation of comprehensive and ambitious reforms\r\nin financial, fiscal and structural areas should safeguard the medium-term\r\nsustainability of the Cypriot public debt.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout the\r\nimplementation of Cyprus' comprehensive policy package, the Commission should\r\nprovide additional policy advice and technical assistance in specific areas.
