Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the Commission\r\ndecided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more\r\nthan ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that\r\ndepartments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for\r\nwhich they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and\r\nreadily understandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law\r\napplicable to a given matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports\r\nof textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral\r\nagreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community\r\nimport rules[3]. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in\r\nit[4], fully preserving the\r\ncontent of the acts being codified. At the same time, it is also appropriate to\r\nintroduce certain slight substantive amendments in Articles 4(2), 6(4) and 23\r\nof that Regulation. Therefore, the proposal is being\r\npresented in the form of a recast.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The recast proposal was\r\ndrawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation,\r\nin 22 official languages, of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 517/94 and the instruments amending it, carried\r\nout by the Publications Office of the European Union, by means of a\r\ndata-processing system. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the\r\ncorrelation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in\r\nAnnex VIII to the recast Regulation.\n\u00ea 517/94\r\n(adapted)\n2014/0177 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non common rules for imports of textile\r\nproducts from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements,\r\nprotocols or other arrangements, or by other specific \u00d6 Union \u00d5 import rules\r\n(recast)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 , and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00f2 new\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 517/94[6] has been substantially amended several\r\ntimes[7].\r\nSince further\r\namendments are to be made,\r\nthat Regulation should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n\u00ea 517/94\r\nrecital 1 (adapted)\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The common commercial\r\npolicy must be based on uniform principles.\n\u00ea 517/94\r\nrecital 4 (adapted)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Uniformity \u00d6 in the\r\nrules for imports should \u00d5 be \u00d6 ensured \u00d5 by laying\r\ndown, as far as possible given the particular features of the economic system\r\nin \u00d6 the \u00d5 third countries\r\n\u00d6 in\r\nquestion \u00d5 , provisions\r\nsimilar to those applied under the common rules for other third countries.\n\u00ea 517/94\r\nrecital 7 (adapted)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For a limited number of\r\nproducts originating in \u00d6 certain \u00d5 third\r\ncountries, owing to the sensitivity of the textile sector of the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nmeasures applicable at \u00d6 Union \u00d5 level should\r\nbe \u00d6 laid down \u00d5 in this\r\nRegulation.\n\u00ea 517/94\r\nrecital 8\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision should be made\r\nfor special rules for products re-imported under the arrangements for economic\r\noutward processing.\n\u00f2 new\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex III B to Regulation (EC) No 517/94\r\nas amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1398/2007[8] was\r\nemptied of its content. Therefore, it is appropriate to delete that Annex\r\nentirely. In the interest of clarity, the reference to that Annex in\r\nArticle 4(2) should also be deleted.\n\u00ea 517/94\r\nrecital 9 (adapted)\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some imports of certain\r\ntextile products from certain third countries may have to be subject to \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance,\r\nquantitative limits or other appropriate measures.\n\u00ea 517/94\r\nrecital 10 (adapted)\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If \u00d6 Union \u00d5 surveillance\r\nis applied, release for free circulation of the products concerned \u00d6 should \u00d5 be made\r\nsubject to presentation of an import document meeting uniform criteria.

For the purposes of paragraph 1, textile\r\nproducts falling within Section XI \u00d6 of Part Two \u00d5 of the\r\nCombined Nomenclature shall be classified in categories as set out in Section A\r\nof Annex I , with the exception of products covered by Combined Nomenclature\r\ncodes (CN codes) 56041000, 63090000 and 6310 which are listed in Section B of Annex\r\nI .\n3. For the purposes of this Regulation, the\r\nterm \u2018originating products\u2019 and the methods for controlling the origin of those\r\nproducts shall be as defined by the relevant \u00d6 Union \u00d5 rules in force.\nArticle 2\n\u00a0Imports into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 of products\r\nreferred to in Article 1 and originating in third countries other than those\r\nlisted in Annex II shall be free and therefore not subject to any quantitative\r\nrestriction, without prejudice to:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the measures that may be taken under\r\nChapter III;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the measures that may be taken\r\nunder specific common import rules for the duration of those rules. \nArticle 3\n1.

Such parties must be heard where they have applied\r\nin writing within the period laid down in the notice published in the Official\r\nJournal of the European \u00d6 Union \u00d5,\r\nshowing that they are actually likely to be affected by the outcome of the\r\ninvestigation and that there are special reasons for them to be heard orally.\n5. Where the information requested by the\r\nCommission is not supplied within a reasonable period, or the investigation is\r\nsignificantly impeded, findings may be made on the basis of the facts\r\navailable.\n6. Where the Commission has been asked to\r\nact by a Member State and it finds that there is insufficient evidence to\r\njustify an investigation, it shall inform the Member State of its decision\r\nfollowing consultations.\nArticle 8\n1. At the end of the investigation, the\r\nCommission shall submit a report on the results to the Committee referred to in\r\nArticle 25.\n\u00ea 38/2014\r\nArt. 1 and Annex .2(4) (adapted)\n2.

Information received \u00d6 pursuant\r\nto \u00d5 this\r\nRegulation shall be issued only for the purpose for which it was requested.\n2.

Information will in any case be\r\nconsidered to be confidential if its disclosure is likely to have a\r\nsignificantly adverse effect upon the supplier or the source of such\r\ninformation.\n4.

In conducting the investigation, the\r\nCommission shall take account of the particular economic system of the\r\ncountries referred to in Annex II.\n3. Where a\r\nthreat of serious injury is alleged the Commission shall also examine whether\r\nit is clearly foreseeable that a particular situation is likely to develop into\r\nactual injury.
