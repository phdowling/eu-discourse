This net balance available for EAGF expenditure for\r\n2015 will be set by the Commission Implementing Regulation in accordance with\r\nArticle 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 in the context of the adoption\r\nof Commission Delegated Regulation amending financial annexes to Regulation\r\n(EC) No 73/2009, Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013.\nIn drawing up the 2015 Draft Budget, the\r\nfirst budgetary estimates for direct payments and market related expenditure\r\nshowed that the sub-ceiling under heading 2 for financial year 2015, after\r\nfinancial transfers between EAGF and EAFRD[4],\r\nis not likely to be exceeded and thus there is no need for further financial\r\ndiscipline.\nOn the basis of the above, the Commission\r\npresents a proposal for setting the adjustment rate for direct payments in\r\nrespect of calendar year 2014, which in accordance with Article 26(3) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is to be adopted by the European Parliament and\r\nthe Council by 30 June 2014. If this adjustment rate has not been set by 30\r\nJune 2014, pursuant to the same Article the Commission will set that rate. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThis proposal implements the rules provided\r\nfor in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and Article 8 of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1307/2013. Prior consultation with the interested parties and\r\npreparation of an impact assessment were not applicable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThis proposal sets the percentage rate of\r\nthe financial discipline adjustment rate in respect of calendar year 2014. \nConsidering that Member States have the\r\npossibility to make late payments to farmers outside the regulatory payment\r\nperiod applicable to direct payments and that the financial discipline\r\nadjustment rate varies from one calendar year to another, the amounts of direct\r\npayments to be granted to farmers should not be affected by the financial\r\ndiscipline differently, depending on when the payment is made to farmers by the\r\nMember States. Therefore, in order to ensure equal treatment between farmers,\r\nthe adjustment rate should be applied to amounts of direct payments to be\r\ngranted to farmers for aid applications lodged in calendar year 2014 only,\r\nindependently of when the payment will actually be made to the farmer.\nArticle 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013\r\nestablishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within\r\nthe framework of the common agricultural policy[5]\r\nlays down that the adjustment rate applied to direct payments should only apply\r\nto direct payments in excess of EUR 2 000. Direct payments in Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia are in the process of phasing-in of direct payments in calendar year\r\n2014. As a consequence, the financial discipline will not apply in these Member\r\nStates.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe calculation of the financial discipline\r\nadjustment rate is part of the preparation of the 2015 Draft Budget. \nThe amount of the reserve for crises in the\r\nagricultural sector, foreseen to be included in the Commission 2015 Draft\r\nBudget, amounts to EUR 433 million in current prices. The first estimates of\r\nbudget appropriations for direct aids and market related expenditure showed that\r\nthe EAGF sub-ceiling for 2015 after financial transfers between EAGF and EAFRD is\r\nnot likely to be exceeded. The net balance available for EAGF expenditure for\r\n2015 used as a basis for this calculation is EUR 44 190 million.\nThus the total reduction resulting from the\r\napplication of financial discipline amounts to EUR 433 million. The percentage\r\nof the financial discipline adjustment rate is 1.301951%. It has been\r\ncalculated taking into account that it is to be applied only to amounts in\r\nexcess of EUR 2 000 and not in all Member States.\nThe application of this adjustment rate\r\nwill result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines\r\ncovering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in\r\nrespect of calendar year 2014 (financial year 2015). \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nFurther to determining the adjustment rate\r\nset by the present Regulation, Article 26(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013\r\nalso gives the possibility to the Commission, on the basis of new information\r\nin its possession, to adopt implementing acts adapting this rate. The\r\nCommission will review its forecasts for market related expenditure and direct\r\npayments when preparing the Amending Letter to the 2015 Draft Budget in October\r\n2014, and adopt the adaptation of the adjustment rate, if appropriate by 1\r\nDecember 2014.\n2014/0097 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non fixing an adjustment rate for direct\r\npayments provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in respect of\r\ncalendar year 2014\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[6],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[7],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 25 of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[8]\r\nlays down that a reserve intended to provide additional support for the\r\nagricultural sector in the case of major crises affecting the agricultural\r\nproduction or distribution has to be established by applying, at the beginning\r\nof each year, a reduction to direct payments with the financial discipline\r\nmechanism referred to in Article 26 of that Regulation.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 26(1) of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1306/2013 lays down that in order to ensure that the annual\r\nceilings set out in Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013[9] for the financing of\r\nthe market related expenditure and direct payments are respected, an adjustment\r\nrate for direct payments has to be determined when the forecasts for the\r\nfinancing of the measures financed under that sub-ceiling for a given financial\r\nyear indicate that the applicable annual ceilings will be exceeded.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of the reserve for\r\ncrises in the agricultural sector, foreseen to be included in the Commission\r\n2015 Draft Budget, amounts to EUR 433 million in current prices. To cover this\r\namount, the financial discipline mechanism has to apply to direct payments\r\nlisted in Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009[10] in respect of calendar\r\nyear 2014. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The preliminary forecasts\r\nfor the direct payments and market related expenditure to be determined in the\r\nCommission 2015 Draft Budget indicate that there is no need for any further\r\nfinancial discipline.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article 26(2)\r\nof Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 the Commission has to present a proposal\r\nto the European Parliament and to the Council concerning the adjustment rate no\r\nlater than 31 March of the calendar year in respect of which that adjustment\r\nrate applies. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a general rule, farmers\r\nsubmitting an aid application for direct payments for one calendar year (N) are\r\npaid within a fixed payment period falling under the financial year (N+1).\r\nHowever, Member States have the possibility to make late payments, within\r\ncertain limits, to farmers beyond this payment period without any time limits.\r\nSuch late payments may fall in a later financial year. When financial\r\ndiscipline is applied for a given calendar year, the adjustment rate should not\r\nbe applied to payments for which aid applications have been submitted in the\r\ncalendar years other than that for which the financial discipline applies.\r\nTherefore, in order to ensure equal treatment of farmers, it is appropriate to\r\nprovide that the adjustment rate is only applied to payments for which aid\r\napplications have been submitted in the calendar year for which the financial\r\ndiscipline is applied, irrespectively of when the payment to farmers is made.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 8(1) of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1307/2013 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council [11] lays down that the\r\nadjustment rate applied to direct payments determined in accordance with\r\nArticle 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is only to apply to direct payments\r\nin excess of EUR 2 000 to be granted to farmers in the corresponding\r\ncalendar year. Furthermore Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 provides that as a result of the gradual introduction of direct\r\npayments, the adjustment rate is only to apply to Bulgaria and Romania from 1 January 2016 and to Croatia from 1 January 2022. Thus the adjustment rate to be\r\ndetermined by the present Regulation should not apply to payments to farmers in\r\nthese Member States,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of applying\r\nthe adjustment provided for in Articles 25 and 26 of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1306/2013 and in\r\naccordance with Article 8(1)\r\nof Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013, the amounts of the payments within the meaning of\r\nArticle 2(d) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 to be granted to a farmer in excess\r\nof EUR 2 000 for an aid application submitted in respect of calendar year\r\n2014 shall be reduced by 1.301951%.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reduction provided for\r\nin paragraph 1 shall not apply in Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of\r\nthe European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the European Parliament\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\nThe President\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n FINANCIAL STATEMENT || FS/14/xxxxxxxxxx \n 6.15.2014.1 \n   || DATE: 07.03.2014   \n 1. || BUDGET HEADING: See budgetary forecast after financial discipline per item below: 05 03 01 01 (SPS) 05 03 01 02 (SAPS) 05 03 01 03 (Separate sugar payment) 05 03 01 04 (Separate F & V payment) 05 03 01 05 (Specific support Art 68 \u2013 decoupled payment) 05 03 01 06 (Separate soft fruit payment) 05 03 01 07 (Redistributive payment) 05 03 02 06 (Suckler cow premium) 05 03 02 07 (Additional national suckler cow premium) 05 03 02 13 (Sheep and goat premium) 05 03 02 14 (Sheep and goat supplementary premium) 05 03 02 28 (Aid for silkworms) 05 03 02 40 (Area aid for cotton) 05 03 02 44 (Specific support, Art 68 \u2013 coupled payment) 05 03 02 50 (POSEI \u2013 Community support programmes) 05 03 02 52 (POSEI \u2013 Aegean Islands) 05 03 10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Reserve for crises in agricultural sector)   || APPROPRIATIONS: in EUR million 29 932.0 7 898.0 282.0 12.0 511.0 12.0 p.m. 884.0 49.0 22.0 7.0 0.5 239.0 1 447.0 420.0 0.2 433.0 \n 2. || TITLE:   Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on fixing an adjustment rate for direct payments provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in respect of calendar year 2014 \n 3. || LEGAL BASIS:   Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union   \n 4. || AIMS: This regulation sets the financial discipline adjustment rate to be applied to the amounts of direct payments to be granted to farmers in excess of EUR 2 000 for aid applications lodged in respect of calendar year 2014. \n 5. || FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS || 12 MONTH PERIOD (EUR million) || CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR 2014 (EUR million) || FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR 2015 (EUR million) \n 5.0 || EXPENDITURE -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHARGED TO THE EU BUDGET (REFUNDS/INTERVENTIONS) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL AUTHORITIES -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OTHER || - 433.0 + 433.0 || n.a. || - 433.0 + 433.0 \n 5.1 || REVENUE -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OWN RESOURCES OF THE EU (LEVIES/CUSTOMS DUTIES) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 \n 5.0.1 || ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE ||   ||   ||   ||   \n 5.1.1 || ESTIMATED REVENUE ||   ||   ||   ||   \n 5.2 || METHOD OF CALCULATION: See Comments \n 6.0 || CAN THE PROJECT BE FINANCED FROM APPROPRIATIONS ENTERED IN THE RELEVANT CHAPTER OF THE CURRENT BUDGET? || n.a. \n 6.1 || CAN THE PROJECT BE FINANCED BY TRANSFER BETWEEN CHAPTERS OF THE CURRENT BUDGET? || n.a. \n 6.2 || WILL A SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET BE NECESSARY? || NO \n 6.3 || WILL APPROPRIATIONS NEED TO BE ENTERED IN FUTURE BUDGETS? || NO \n OBSERVATIONS:   The calculation of the financial discipline adjustment rate is part of the preparation of the 2015 Draft Budget. The amount of the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, foreseen to be included in the Commission 2015 Draft Budget, amounts to EUR 433 million in current prices. Based on the first estimates of budget appropriations for direct aids and market related expenditure the EAGF sub-ceiling for 2015 after financial transfers between EAGF and EAFRD is not likely be exceeded. Thus the total reduction resulting from the application of financial discipline amounts to EUR 433 million. The percentage of the financial discipline adjustment rate is 1.301951%. It has been calculated taking into account that it is to be applied only to amounts in excess of EUR 2 000 and and for each Member State, except Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia. Since direct payments in Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, are in the process of phasing-in in calendar year 2014, the financial discipline will not apply to these Member States as a consequence. The application of this adjustment rate will result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines covering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in respect of calendar year 2014 (financial year 2015).
