This exemption is meant to reduce the costs for legal\r\npersons registered to conduct demining activities and thus speed up these\r\nactivities and contribute to the implementation of humanitarian demining policy\r\nin Croatia. \nThe tax reduction will expedite the\r\ndemining activities which are taking place in accordance with the international\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer\r\nof Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (the Ottawa Treaty, 1998), the\r\ninternational Convention on Cluster Munitions signed in Oslo in 2008, which\r\nprohibits the use, transfer, stockpiling and destruction of stockpiled cluster\r\nmunitions within a period of eight years, and the 2005 Humanitarian Demining\r\nAct of the Republic of Croatia.\nThe aim of the measure to be applied by Croatia is to give an incentive for quicker clearance of suspected minefields, freeing-up\r\nof agricultural land and forests thus making them accessible again for economic\r\nactivities. The measure is also expected to have immediate positive effects on\r\nhuman life and health in the areas contaminated by mines and unexploded\r\nordnance. \nWithout the application of the measure\r\noperators of demining equipment authorised to perform demining operations on\r\nthe territory of Croatia will have to pay the national excise duty rate on gas\r\noil used as motor fuel which stands at HRK 2 860 (app.\r\nEUR 375.54) ([2])\r\nand which applies to propellant use as well as uses in stationary motors, heavy\r\nmachinery and in vehicles intended for use off the public roadway (Article\r\n8(2)(b), (c) and (d) of the Energy Taxation Directive). The time-limited tax\r\nexemption would allow operators to reduce their costs for the demining\r\nactivities and increase their profit margins for a limited period of time, thus\r\ncreating an incentive for intensifying their work for the period of application\r\nof the measure. This will speed up the process of demining.\nThe request and its general context \nBy letter dated 8 April 2014, the Croatian\r\nauthorities requested an authorisation decision which will allow Croatia to apply a tax exemption to gas oil used to operate machinery in humanitarian\r\ndemining in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC. Additional\r\ninformation and clarifications were provided by the Croatian authorities on 15 July\r\n2014.\nThe intention of the Croatian authorities\r\nis to apply a tax exemption to gas oil used to operate machinery in\r\nhumanitarian demining. The measure will be implemented by applying a system of\r\nrefund of excise duties paid, in order to speed up the demining of the\r\nremaining contaminated areas. Machines that will use gas oil exempted from\r\npayment of excise duties will be classified according to their purpose, their\r\nworking tools and their method of operation.\nAccording to the information provided by the\r\nCroatian authorities as at 1 January 2014, the total\r\nsuspected mined areas and areas contaminated solely by unexploded ordnance in\r\nCroatia covered 613.6 km2. Croatia estimates that the unused\r\nproduction potential of the mine-contaminated forest areas represents an annual\r\nloss of some EUR 30 million. 55 % of the contaminated agricultural\r\nareas constitute arable land while the rest are meadows and pastures. It is\r\nestimated that 900 000 people (approximately 20 % of the population)\r\nstill live in immediate proximity to suspected mined areas. Between 1991 and\r\n2013, there were 1 353 mine-related incidents and accidents in\r\nmine-contaminated areas, affecting 1 976 people and causing 510 deaths.\nCroatia has\r\nrequested for the exemption to be granted for a period of six years, which is\r\nthe maximum period indicated in Article 19(2) of the Directive.\nScope\nThe beneficiaries of the measure will be\r\nlegal persons who will be authorised by the Croatian Mine Action Centre and who\r\nwill be registered to engage in humanitarian demining in accordance with the\r\nHumanitarian Demining Act ([3]),\r\nthe Rules on the conduct of humanitarian demining ([4]) and the Rules on the\r\ntechnical requirements for determining the conformity of machinery used in\r\nhumanitarian demining ([5]).\r\nThe beneficiaries will carry out demining and land clearance using demining\r\nmachinery and create the conditions for pyrotechnicians to deactivate\r\nunexploded mines. The accredited machines will be defined according to their\r\ntype, purpose and fuel consumption, which will depend in turn on the depth of\r\nclearance, the speed of the machine, the density of clearance and the effect of\r\nthe machine on tracks with compacted local soil. The measure will be granted by\r\nrefunding the excise duty paid, by collecting invoices paid for such use. These\r\nrecords will contain purchasers\u2019 details, machine serial numbers, the number of\r\nmachine operating hours, the quantity of gas oil purchased and the date of\r\npurchase.\nAccording to the figures provided by the\r\nCroatian authorities, in Croatia there are 36 registered legal persons with 47\r\nmachines used in humanitarian demining. However, the measure is not meant to be\r\nrestricted only to these accredited operators but will apply to any new\r\naccredited operator and demining machinery that may be used for this purpose,\r\nin the future. The Croatian Mine Action Centre accredits and keeps a record of\r\nall new mine clearance machines intended to be used for humanitarian demining.\nAccording to\r\nthe Croatian Authorities the amount of the advantage per beneficiary brought by\r\nthe measure will depend on the size of the area to be demined by the demining\r\nmachinery and on the total consumption of gas oil used to operate the machinery\r\nwhen demining such area. Croatia estimates that the amount of the benefit resulting\r\nfrom the tax reduction calculated on the basis of average fuel consumption figures\r\nfor all operators involved in demining in 2013 is approximately\r\nHRK 2 907 038 (app. EUR 381 736.50), which means that\r\nthe average amount per machine is estimated at HRK 61 859.15 or EUR 8 123.01\r\nper annum. The Croatian authorities anticipate that for the six years that the\r\nmeasure will apply, the annual budgetary expenditure based on the estimated\r\naverage consumption will increase and they will be: HRK 2 965 179\r\n(app. EUR 389 371.23) for 2015, HRK 3 024 482 (app. EUR 397 158.66)\r\nfor 2016, HRK 3 084 971 (app. EUR 405 101.83) for\r\n2017, HRK 3 146 671 (app. EUR 413 203.87) for 2018, HRK 3 209 604\r\n(app. EUR 421 467.94)\r\nfor 2019, HRK 3 273 796 (app. EUR 429 897.30) for 2020\r\nand the total amount will be: HRK 18 704 706 (app. EUR 2 456 200.83).\nOperation of the measure\nThe competent Croatian Mine Action Centre\r\n(HCR) departments will oversee and keep records of the operation of the\r\nmachinery. Records will be kept per project (site). There will be a special\r\nform for each machine in which hours of operation, performance and fuel\r\nconsumption will be recorded for each day.\nWhen a project has ended, the demining\r\noperator will submit an excise tax return form for its machinery employed on\r\nthe site, accompanied by a log form for each machine. The forms will be\r\napproved by the site manager and verified by a HCR official responsible for monitoring\r\nthe project, who will be present at the demining site at all times for the\r\npurpose of carrying out on-the-spot checks.\nIn line with its general responsibility to\r\nmonitor the implementation of excise legislation, the Tax Administration of the\r\nMinistry of Finance will perform, on the basis of information about the site\r\nwhere demining activity is taking place, systematic checks of fuel used in\r\ndemining machinery in addition to carrying out its other monitoring duties. The\r\ntax exemption will be granted by refunding the excise duty paid.\nArguments of the Croatian authorities concerning the impact of the\r\nmeasure on the internal market\nThe measure\r\nwill not favour certain enterprises over others since it will apply to all\r\nenterprises involved in humanitarian demining, thus no economic advantage will\r\nbe given to any particular enterprise involved. Similarly Croatia assumes that the measure will not affect intra-EU trade given its specific nature and that\r\nit is limited to mine-contaminated areas of the Republic of Croatia. \nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nCouncil Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October\r\n2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products\r\nand electricity, in particular Articles 8(1), 8(2)(c) and (d).\nAssessment of the measure under\r\nArticle 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\nSpecific policy considerations\nArticle 19(1), first subparagraph, of the\r\nDirective reads as follows: \n\u2018In addition to\r\nthe provisions set out in the previous Articles, in particular in Articles 5,\r\n15 and 17, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission,\r\nmay authorise any Member State to introduce further exemptions or reductions\r\nfor specific policy considerations.\u2019\nBy means of the tax exemption in question\r\nthe Croatian authorities pursue the objective to speed up the demining of the\r\nremaining contaminated areas in various regions of Croatia. Without the measure\r\ngas oil used to propel machinery in humanitarian demining would be taxed at HRK 2 860\r\n(app. EUR 375.54) per 1 000 l. To be noted that Croatia applies the same rate of taxation to gas oil used as\r\npropellant and for the purposes laid down in Article 8(2)(c) and (d) of Directive 2003/96/EC. Also the\r\ntime-limited application of the requested tax exemption would create an incentive for\r\nthe economic operators involved in humanitarian demining activities to finalise\r\ntheir work before the expiration of the six year period of the measure and\r\ntherefore to contribute to the stated policy objective, which is to speed up the\r\ndemining of the remaining contaminated areas. In Croatia, except of the measure\r\nenvisaged there are no other subsidies that apply to economic operators\r\ninvolved in humanitarian demining of mine-contaminated areas.\nCroatia has pointed\r\nout that the application of the measure would have immediate positive effects\r\non human life and health in the areas contaminated by mines and unexploded\r\nordnance. In accordance to the above, the Commission notes that according to\r\nthe information provided by the Croatian authorities in the period between 1991\r\nand 2013, 1 976 people sustained mine-related injuries in Croatia, where 510 of those died. It also notes that the loss of revenues from the failure\r\nto cultivate mine-contaminated agricultural land could reach the amount of EUR 50\r\nmillion.\nIt can be concluded that the wish to apply a\r\ntax exemption to gas oil used to operate machinery in\r\nhumanitarian demining in various regions of Croatia is\r\nbased on specific policy considerations in particular as regards social,\r\nsafety, health and regional policy.\nConsistency with the other policies\r\nand objectives of the Union\nThe requested measure concerns mainly the\r\nEU's health regional and environment policy to the extent that it will partly\r\nhelp for the quicker reduction of the mine-contaminated areas of the Republic of   Croatia which present a threat to the life and health of humans, domesticated\r\nanimals and wildlife. It should be noted that it is\r\nestimated that 900 000 people in Croatia still live in proximity to\r\nsuspected mined areas putting their health and safety in danger.\nThe Commission notes that the measure is\r\nlimited to gas oil used in accredited special-purpose machines designed and\r\nbuilt specifically for clearing mined areas and that it is also limited to mine-contaminated areas of the Republic of Croatia. It should also be mentioned that these machines\r\ncannot be used for any kind of transportation on public roads.\nIt can thus be concluded that the measure\r\nis compatible with the health, environment, energy and transport policies of\r\nthe Union.\nUnder the circumstances described, it also\r\nappears acceptable in view of the proper functioning of the internal market and\r\nthe need to ensure fair competition. In particular, due to the fact will not\r\nfavour certain enterprises over others since it will apply to all enterprises\r\ninvolved in humanitarian demining in Croatia. Similarly, the measure will not\r\naffect intra-EU trade given its specific nature and that it is limited to\r\nmine-contaminated areas of the Republic of Croatia.\nPeriod of application of the measure\nThe Commission suggests that the period of\r\napplication is set to the maximum allowed by Directive 2003/96/EC, i.e. six\r\nyears. This period seems appropriate in order to allow\r\nthe Croatian authorities to gather information to assess the results of the\r\nmeasure and provide economic operators benefiting from the measure with a sufficient\r\ndegree of certainty and enough time to conclude the process of dimining of the\r\ncontaminated areas.\nState aid rules\nThe Croatian authorities envisaged to apply\r\ntax exemption to gas oil used to operate machinery in\r\nhumanitarian demining by refunding all the excise duty. The measure constitutes state aid and should be notified to the\r\nCommission pursuant to Article 108(3) of the TFEU. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation\r\nof interested parties\nThis proposal is based on a request made by\r\n Croatia and concerns only this Member State.\nCollection\r\nand use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact\r\nassessment\nThis proposal concerns an authorisation for\r\nan individual Member State upon its own request.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe field of indirect taxation covered by\r\nArticle 113 TFEU is not in itself within the exclusive competence of the\r\nEuropean Union within the meaning of Article 3 TFEU.\nHowever, the exercise by Member States of\r\ntheir competences in this field is strictly circumscribed and limited by\r\nexisting EU law. Pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC, only the\r\nCouncil is empowered to authorise a Member State to introduce further\r\nexemptions or reductions within the meaning of that provision. Member States\r\ncannot substitute themselves for the Council.\nThe proposal therefore respects the\r\nprinciple of subsidiarity.\nProportionality\r\nprinciple\nThe proposal respects the principle of\r\nproportionality. The tax exemption does not exceed what is necessary to attain\r\nthe objective in question (cf. the considerations on the Internal market and\r\nfair competition aspects, above).\nChoice of\r\ninstruments\nInstrument(s) proposed: Council decision.\nArticle 19 of Directive 2003/96 makes\r\nprovision for this type of measure only.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe measure does not impose any financial\r\nor administrative burden on the Union. The proposal therefore has no impact on\r\nthe budget of the Union.\n2014/0312 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nauthorising Croatia to apply tax exemption\r\nto gas oil used to operate machinery in humanitarian demining in accordance\r\nwith Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive 2003/96/EC\r\nof 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of\r\nenergy products and electricity ([6]),\r\nand in particular Article 19 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter dated 8 April 2014,\r\nthe Croatian authorities requested an authorisation decision which will allow Croatia to apply tax exemption to gas oil used to operate machinery in humanitarian\r\ndemining in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the tax exemption it\r\nintends to apply, Croatia aims at speeding up the demining of the remaining mine\r\ncontaminated areas in various regions.
