In adopting the Convention in 1930, the International\r\nLabour Conference (\u2018the Conference\u2019) called upon States to end the use of\r\nforced labour within the shortest possible period, and to criminalise the\r\noffence. Yet, more than 80 years later, despite almost universal ratification\r\nof the Convention, the practice still exists, albeit in different forms to\r\nthose that provoked such concern in the early twentieth century. The ILO\r\nestimates that at least 20.9 million people globally are victims of forced\r\nlabour.\nThe Protocol, adopted by the 103rd session\r\nof the Conference, seeks to address gaps in implementation and to make progress\r\non preventing trafficking for labour exploitation and protecting and\r\ncompensating victims of forced labour.\nThe European Union (EU) is committed to\r\npromoting human rights and decent work and to eradicating trafficking in human\r\nbeings, both internally and in its external relations. Of particular importance\r\nin the context of the Protocol is also the commitment of the EU to the\r\npromotion of the protection of the rights of the child and gender equality, as\r\nwomen may be particularly vulnerable to some forms of forced labour. Rights at\r\nwork are a key pillar of decent work. In ratifying ILO Conventions and related\r\nProtocols, EU Member States send an important signal on the coherence of the\r\nEU\u2019s policy in promoting fundamental principles and rights at work and\r\nimproving working conditions worldwide.\nIn addition, as part of the EU\u2019s strategy\r\non eradicating trafficking in human beings[1],\r\nthe Commission urged EU Member States to ratify all relevant international\r\ninstruments, agreements and legal obligations. This will help address\r\ntrafficking in human beings in a more effective, coordinated and coherent\r\nmanner. Strengthening victims' rights in the EU has also been a strategic\r\npriority of the Commission over the past few years. The horizontal Victims'\r\nRights Directive will ensure that victims of crime benefit from common minimum\r\nstandards of rights during police investigations and court proceedings. The\r\nProtocol should be seen as part of this work.\nIt is therefore necessary that any legal\r\nimpediments at EU level to ratification of the Protocol by EU Member States be\r\nremoved at EU level. The Protocol\u2019s substance does not cause any concern in the\r\nlight of the existing EU acquis.\nThe Protocol\u2019s provisions strengthen the\r\ninternational legal framework by establishing obligations to prevent forced\r\nlabour and to provide victims with protection and access to remedies, such as\r\ncompensation.\nThe Protocol, in its Articles 1 and 6,\r\nrequires ILO Member States to develop a national policy and plan of action for\r\nthe effective and sustained suppression of forced labour and to take measures\r\nto apply the Protocol\u2019s provisions, in consultation with employers\u2019 and\r\nworkers\u2019 organisations.\nArticle 2 of the Protocol sets out the\r\nmeasures that ILO Member States must take to prevent forced labour, namely:\n\u00b7              \r\neducating and informing people, especially those\r\nwho are particularly vulnerable, and employers;\n\u00b7              \r\nmaking efforts to ensure that the coverage and\r\nenforcement of legislation relevant to the prevention of forced labour apply to\r\nall workers and all sectors of the economy and that labour inspection services\r\nare strengthened;\n\u00b7              \r\nprotecting people, especially migrant workers,\r\nfrom potentially abusive and fraudulent recruitment and placement practices;\n\u00b7              \r\nsupporting due diligence by both the public and\r\nprivate sectors; and\n\u00b7              \r\naddressing the root causes heightening the risks\r\nof forced labour.\nAs regards the victims of forced labour,\r\nArticle 3 provides that effective measures are to be taken for their\r\nidentification, release, protection, recovery and rehabilitation and other\r\nforms of assistance and support. Article 4 requires ILO Member States to ensure\r\nthat all victims have access to remedies, such as compensation, and that\r\ncompetent authorities are entitled not to prosecute victims for unlawful\r\nactivities that they have been compelled to commit.\nIn addition, Article 5 provides for\r\ninternational cooperation to prevent and eliminate forced labour and Article 7\r\ndeletes the transitional provisions from the Convention.\nThe Protocol addresses areas of EU law that\r\nare already subject to an advanced degree of regulation.\nIn its provisions on preventing forced\r\nlabour, the Protocol deals with aspects covered by EU social policy, in respect\r\nof which EU law sets minimum rules on working conditions[2].\nIn its provisions on protection of victims\r\nand access to remedies, the Protocol deals with aspects relating to judicial\r\ncooperation in criminal matters, in respect of which EU law sets minimum\r\nstandards on anti-trafficking and victims\u2019 rights[3].\nParts of the Protocol also interplay with\r\nfreedom of movement for workers[4] and rules on asylum and immigration[5].\nIn addition, the Protocol interplays with\r\nrules under the common commercial policy, EU international agreements,\r\ndevelopment cooperation and trade instruments that make reference to core\r\nlabour standards and the ratification and effective implementation of\r\nfundamental ILO Conventions by third countries and in the EU.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot applicable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe Protocol is a binding international\r\nagreement, subject to ratification, and is linked to the Convention. It creates\r\nlegal obligations applicable to ratifying States and can only be ratified by\r\nStates that have ratified the Convention.\nAt the ILO, a Protocol is used to partially\r\nrevise or add to a Convention, allowing it to adapt to changing conditions, and\r\nmaking it more relevant. Article 19(4) of the ILO Constitution, on the adoption\r\nand ratification of Conventions, also applies to a Protocol.\nIn accordance with case law of the Court of\r\nJustice of the European Union (ECJ)[6],\r\nand more specifically on concluding and ratifying an ILO Convention[7], Member States are not able to decide to ratify the Protocol\r\noutside the framework of the EU\u2019s institutions, as parts of the Protocol fall\r\ninto areas of EU competence.\nHowever, the EU as such cannot ratify an\r\nILO Protocol, because under the ILO rules only States can be parties to such\r\nProtocols.\nAs the subject matter of this Protocol\r\nfalls partly within areas of EU competence and partly within those of Member\r\nStates, the EU institutions and Member States must take the necessary measures\r\nto cooperate in ratifying the Protocol and in implementing commitments\r\nresulting from that Protocol[8].\nOver the last decade, the Council has\r\nalready authorised Member States to ratify, in the interests of the EU, five\r\nILO Conventions, parts of which fell into areas of EU competence[9].\nWith reference to the Protocol, regulation\r\nis at an advanced stage in the various aspects of anti-trafficking, victims\u2019\r\nprotection and labour policies covered by the Protocol, to the point where\r\nMember States are no longer able to act as sovereign in dealing with external parties\r\nin this regard[10]. Article 82(2) and 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union (TFEU) constitute the main legal basis for the relevant EU\r\nlegislation, which is more detailed than the general principles established in\r\nthe Protocol.\nThere is no\r\nincompatibility between the provisions of the Protocol and the minimum\r\nrequirements in these areas laid down in the EU acquis.\nIn line with Article 19(8) of the ILO\r\nConstitution, the Protocol sets out minimum standards. The EU acquis\r\ntakes the same approach. This means that EU law may be more stringent than the\r\nILO standards, and vice versa[11].\nThe proposed Council Decisions will\r\ntherefore authorise Member States to ratify, in the interest of the EU, those\r\nparts of the Protocol that fall into areas of EU competence, and recommend them\r\nto make efforts to do so by the end of 2016.\nThe proposed Council Decisions are based on\r\nthe one hand on Article 218(6) TFEU, in conjunction with Article 82(2) TFEU,\r\nwhich provides the main legal basis for EU legislation on judicial cooperation\r\nin criminal matters relevant to addressing trafficking in human beings and\r\nvictims\u2019 rights, and on the other hand on Article 153(2) second subparagraph\r\nTFEU, in conjunction with Article 218(6) TFEU, which provides the main legal basis\r\nfor EU legislation on protecting and improving working conditions, relevant to\r\npreventing forced labour.\nThe Protocol pursues several objectives\r\nwhich are inseparably linked without one being secondary and indirect in\r\nrelation to the other. In particular, the Protocol aims at achieving decent\r\nworking conditions on the one hand and protecting the victims of forced or\r\ncompulsory work and sanctioning the perpetrators on the other. Therefore, it\r\nmust be founded both on Article 82(2) TFEU and 153(1) (a) and (b). A single\r\ndecision cannot be adopted on a dual legal basis where the procedures required\r\nby each legal basis are incompatible with each other.[12] Such is the case here in view of the fact that matters related to\r\njudicial cooperation in criminal matters do not bind Denmark, which leads to\r\ndiverging voting rights in the Council. Consequently, two separate Council\r\ndecisions are required. \nAs regards the objective of protecting the\r\nvictims of forced or compulsory work and sanctioning the perpetrators, Article\r\n82(2) TFEU is the single legal basis that the present proposal should be\r\nfounded on. It is true that the Protocol also touches upon the residence status\r\nof victims of forced or compulsory labour to the extent that this is required\r\nto enable these victims to have access to appropriate and effective remedies\r\n(see, in particular, Article 4 of the Protocol). However,\r\nthis purpose relating to Article 79 TFEU is merely incidental whilst the\r\nobjectives of preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting\r\nvictims relating to Article 82(2) TFEU[13]\r\nare identifiable as the predominant purpose and component.\nThe Commission recalls in that context that\r\non 14 April 2014, pursuant to Article 218(3) and (4) TFEU, it has submitted to\r\nthe Council a Recommendation for a Council Decision\r\nauthorising the opening of negotiations and negotiating directives at the 103rd\r\nsession of the International Labour Conference on a Protocol to supplement the\r\nforced labour Convention n\u00b029, 1930, of the International Labour Organisation\r\n(COM(2014)238 of 14.4.2014). The Commission further recalls that this\r\nrecommendation has been discussed in Council Working Party meetings of 5 May,\r\n14 May and 16 May 2014 and that, despite several attempts to reach an agreeable\r\nsolution, it was decided at the Coreper meeting of 23 May 2014 not to pursue\r\nthe matter further and, therefore, not to submit the draft decision to the\r\nCouncil for adoption. As a consequence, the Commission issued the following\r\ndeclaration which was recorded in Coreper minutes:\n\"The Commission recalls the\r\nobligation of sincere cooperation between Member States and the Commission in\r\nall circumstances. The absence of these decisions will lead to a situation\r\nwhich is not in compliance with the Treaties as Member States are legally not\r\nfree to make legal commitments on issues of Union competence in international\r\nnegotiations without the framework of Union decisions. The Commission will\r\nassess the appropriate measures to take in this regard. The Commission recalls\r\nthe need to respect Union competences, to avoid any incompatibility between the\r\nUnion acquis and the ILO instruments to be negotiated and for Member States to\r\nact in the interests of the EU at the ILO.\"\nThe Commission further notes that, despite\r\nthe absence of the adoption of the said draft decision, Member States have\r\nproceeded to the negotiation and adoption, within the ILO, of the Protocol 2014\r\nto the Forced Labour Convention. Given the importance of the Protocol 2014 to\r\nthe Forced Labour Convention, the Commission hereby proceeds to propose, on the\r\nbasis of Article 218(6) TFEU, that Member States are authorised to ratify the\r\nsaid Protocol, acting jointly in the interest of the Union. The Commission at\r\nthe same time highlights that this proposal cannot in\r\nany way be considered as an acceptation by the Commission of the legality of\r\nthe procedure which has led to the adoption of the said Protocol within the\r\nILO.\n2014/0258 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nauthorising Member States to ratify, in\r\nthe interest of the European Union, the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour\r\nConvention, 1930, of the International Labour Organisation with regard to\r\nmatters related to judicial cooperation in criminal matters\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union, and in particular Article 82(2) in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[14],\r\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union is\r\npromoting the ratification of international labour conventions that have been\r\nclassified by the International Labour Organisation as up-to-date, to\r\ncontribute to the European Union\u2019s efforts to promote human rights and decent\r\nwork for all as well as to eradicate trafficking in human beings both inside\r\nand outside the EU, of which the protection of fundamental principles and\r\nrights at work is a key aspect.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parts of the rules under\r\nthe Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, of the\r\nInternational Labour Organisation (ILO), hereinafter \u2018the Protocol\u2019, falls\r\nwithin the competences of the Union, as laid down in Article 82(2) TFEU.\r\nFurthermore some of the rules of the Protocol are already covered by EU acquis\r\nin the areas of judicial cooperation in criminal matters.[15] \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence, Member\r\nStates may not enter into commitments in relation to these parts outside the\r\nframework of the European Union\u2019s institutions[16].\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 19(4) of the ILO\r\nConstitution, on the adoption and ratification of Conventions, similarly\r\napplies to a Protocol, which is a binding international agreement, subject to\r\nratification and linked to a Convention.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union cannot\r\nratify the Protocol, as only States can be parties thereto.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore necessary\r\nthat Member States are authorised to ratify the Protocol, acting jointly in the\r\ninterests of the European Union, for the parts falling under European Union\r\ncompetence in accordance with Article 82(2) TFEU.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 82(2) TFEU is the\r\nsingle legal basis that the present decision should be founded on.
