The notified Member State shall inform the intercepting\r\n  Member State of the reasons justifying the said conditions;\n(iv)  \r\nrequiring a short\r\nextension, of up to a maximum period of eight days, to the original 96-hour\r\ndeadline, to be agreed with the intercepting Member State, in order to carry\r\nout internal procedures under its national law.
