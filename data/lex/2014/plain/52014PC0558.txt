Since then, numerous other directives and regulations\r\nhave been adopted to extend and refine the rules, and a harmonised framework\r\nhas gradually been established. In 2001, all the rules on production,\r\nmarketing, distribution and use were consolidated in a veterinary medicines\r\ncode (Directive 2001/82/EC);[2]\r\nthis was followed by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.[3] These two acts regulate\r\nthe authorisation, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, pharmacovigilance\r\nand use of veterinary medicinal products over their lifetime. The annex to the Directive\r\n2001/82/EC specifies the data to be submitted in applications for marketing\r\nauthorisations. Among other things, the Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 lays down\r\nthe EU procedures applying to medicinal products for human and veterinary use\r\nand establishes the European Medicines Agency (\u2018the Agency\u2019).\nIn the course of the co-decision procedure for\r\nits proposal for a regulation on residue limits of pharmacological active substances\r\nin foodstuffs, the Commission submitted a declaration[4] recognising the\r\nimportance of problems linked to the availability of veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts, the use of veterinary medicinal products in species for which they\r\nare not authorised, and disproportionate regulatory burden hampering\r\ninnovation. The present proposal is the Commission\u2019s follow-up to its\r\ndeclaration.\nStakeholders and Member States have\r\nexpressed concern that the current legislation does not fully deliver a single\r\nmarket in veterinary medicinal products and fails to meet the Union\u2019s needs as\r\nregards the regulation of medicines. In particular, the private and public\r\nsectors have indicated the following areas for improvement:\n\u00b7                        \r\nregulatory burden;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe lack of availability of veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts, especially for small markets such as that for bees; and\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe functioning of the internal market.\nIn this regard, it is important to recall\r\nthat needs of the veterinary sector differ substantially from those of the\r\nhuman sector in relation to medicines. In particular, the drivers for\r\ninvestment for the human and the veterinary medicines markets are different.\r\nFor example, in the veterinary sector there are many different animal species,\r\nwhich creates both a fragmented market and the need for major investments in\r\norder to extend the authorisation of medicines existing for one animal species\r\nto another. Moreover, the price-setting mechanisms in the veterinary sector\r\nfollow a completely different logic. Consequently, prices for veterinary\r\nmedicines are typically substantially lower than for medicinal products for\r\nhuman use. The size of the animal pharmaceutical industry is only a small\r\nfraction of the size of the pharmaceutical industry for human medicines. It is\r\ntherefore considered appropriate to develop a regulatory framework addressing\r\nthe characteristics and specificities of the veterinary sector, which cannot be\r\nconsidered as a model for the human medicines market.\nThe revision of Directive 2001/82/EC and\r\nother legislation on veterinary medicinal products is in line with the\r\nprinciples set out in the Commission\u2019s 2013 and 2014 work programmes. The\r\nproposal seeks to put in place, while safeguarding public health, animal\r\nhealth, food safety and the environment, an up-to-date, proportionate body of legislation\r\ntailored to the specificities of the veterinary sector, aiming in particular to:\n\u00b7                        \r\nincrease the availability of veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts;\n\u00b7                        \r\nreduce administrative burdens;\n\u00b7                        \r\nstimulate competitiveness and innovation;\n\u00b7                        \r\nimprove the functioning of the internal market;\r\nand\n\u00b7                        \r\naddress the public health risk of antimicrobial\r\nresistance (AMR).\nThese objectives are not only\r\ncomplementary, but also interlinked, as innovation will provide new and better\r\nmedicines to treat and prevent diseases in animals, while avoiding damage to\r\nthe environment.\nThe spread of AMR is a major threat to\r\npublic and animal health. In November 2011, the Commission launched a five-year\r\naction plan,[5]\r\nwhich seeks to mobilise all stakeholders in a joint effort to combat AMR; in\r\nparticular, Action 2 in the plan aims to strengthen the regulatory framework\r\nfor veterinary medicinal products. This proposal implements this action.\nThe Commission\u2019s Communication on honeybee\r\nhealth[6]\r\nstresses the importance of proactively protecting bee health, while taking into\r\naccount the particularities of beekeeping, and acknowledges the limited\r\navailability of medicines to treat the diseases that afflict bees. As regards\r\nmeasures to increase availability, the Communication refers to the revision of\r\nthe legislation on veterinary medicinal products.\nLegal basis\nThe legal bases for legislative measures on\r\nanimal health, which are essential to public and animal health, environmental\r\nprotection, trade and single market policy are:\n\u2013 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion (TFEU), which provides for the establishment and functioning of the\r\ninternal market and the approximation of relevant legal, regulatory and\r\nadministrative provisions; and\n\u2013 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 168(4)(b) TFEU, which covers measures in the\r\nveterinary field directly aimed at protecting public health.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nBetter regulation of veterinary\r\npharmaceuticals: how to put in place a simpler legal framework, safeguarding\r\npublic and animal health while increasing the competitiveness of companies, a public consultation on the key issues of the envisaged legal\r\nproposal, was launched on the Commission\u2019s website on 13 April 2010 and was\r\navailable through the interactive policy-making (IPM) tool until 15 July\r\n2010.[7]\nThe consultation and a study, An\r\nassessment of the impact of the revision of veterinary pharmaceutical\r\nlegislation, formed the basis of an impact assessment carried out for the\r\nCommission between November 2009 and June 2011.[8]\nThe Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment Board\r\n(IAB) released its final opinion in September 2013.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nChapter I: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subject matter, scope and definitions\nThis part contains provisions on the scope\r\nof the Regulation. It also sets out clear definitions reflecting the proposed\r\nchanges.\nChapter II: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Marketing authorisations \u2014 general provisions and\r\nrules on applications\nIn the Union, only veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts that meet standards of safety, quality and efficacy are authorised.\r\nThe proposal lays down rules for obtaining a marketing authorisation, specifying\r\nthat the product in question can be marketed for the approved indications only.\r\nThe indications are listed in the summary of product characteristics (SPC)\r\nincluded in the terms of the marketing authorisation. Those terms also contain\r\na description of the product\u2019s properties and the conditions attached to its\r\nuse. Before a marketing authorisation can be granted for a veterinary medicinal\r\nproduct for food-producing species, the Commission has to establish a maximum\r\nresidue limit for the pharmacologically active substance it contains.\nAn applicant has to provide certain details\r\non the packaging and labelling of the medicine. The proposal introduces a major\r\nsimplification of the rules by reducing the compulsory information and introducing\r\nharmonised pictograms and abbreviations. This should reduce translation and\r\npackaging costs and encourage multilingual packages and labelling. Member\r\nStates will have a degree of flexibility as to the languages used.\nIn principle, applicants must prove the\r\nquality, safety and efficacy of the veterinary medicinal product. In\r\nexceptional circumstances (e.g. in emergencies) and where limited markets\r\nare concerned, however, temporary authorisation may be granted without\r\ncomprehensive data in order to fill therapeutic gaps on the market. \nThis part of the proposal also includes\r\nprovisions for generic applications. If a product meets the conditions for a\r\ngeneric veterinary medicinal product, the applicant is not required to prove\r\nsafety and efficacy and the application will rely on the data provided for the\r\nreference product. The proposal contains a definition of generic veterinary\r\nmedicinal products.\nThis part also regulates the \u2018protection period\u2019\r\napplying to technical documentation submitted in order to obtain or amend a\r\nmarketing authorisation. It addresses the characteristics and specificities of\r\nthe veterinary sector. Experience has shown that the needs of the veterinary\r\nsector differ substantially from those of the human sector. Also the drivers for\r\ninvestment differ for the human and veterinary medicines market, for example in\r\nanimal health there is more than one species, creating a fragmented market and\r\nnecessitating major investments to add other animal species. Therefore, the\r\nprovisions in this proposal to stimulate innovation cannot be considered as a\r\nmodel for the human medicines market. The protection arrangements prevent applicants\r\nfor a generic product from referring to the documentation submitted for the\r\nreference product. Data provided to extend the generic product to another\r\nanimal species should also be protected according to the same principle.\nExtending the protection periods provided\r\nfor in Directive 2001/82/EC should create incentives and stimulate innovation\r\nin the animal health sector. The current ten\u2011year period would be\r\nmaintained for the initial marketing authorisation. In order to encourage\r\nindustry to extend already authorised products to other species, a further 1 year\r\nwould be added for any extension of the veterinary medicinal products to\r\nanother species (up to a maximum of 18 years). \nIn order to encourage the animal health\r\nindustry to develop products for minor species, increased protection will\r\napply: 14 years for the initial marketing authorisation for a minor species,\r\nand 4 additional years for an extension to a minor species. \nSo as to secure data protection, any application\r\nfor an extension must be submitted at least 3 years before expiry of the data\r\nprotection period. This ensures that companies can place a generic product on\r\nthe market immediately after expiry of the protection period for the reference\r\nproduct. Product developments for bee medicines will receive increased data\r\nprotection because of the small size of the market for bee medicines and the\r\nlack of effective medicines to treat diseases in bees. The protection applying\r\nto environmental data would be the same as that for safety and efficacy data.\nThe results of clinical trials comprise much\r\nof the data required to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of a\r\nproduct. A Union procedure for the authorisation of clinical trials is provided\r\nfor (this is currently not harmonised).\nIt is important to safeguard the\r\neffectiveness of certain antimicrobials that are essential for the treatment of\r\nhuman infections. Therefore, it is proposed that the Commission be empowered to\r\nestablish rules excluding or restricting the use of certain antimicrobials in\r\nthe veterinary sector.\nChapter III: \u00a0 Procedures for granting marketing authorisations\nVarious marketing authorisation procedures\r\nare provided for:\n\u00b7                        \r\na centralised procedure, in which the Commission\r\ngrants an authorisation;\n\u00b7                        \r\nprocedures in which Member States grant the\r\nauthorisation:\n\u00b7                        \r\na national procedure;\n\u00b7                        \r\na mutual recognition procedure; and \n\u00b7                        \r\na decentralised procedure.\nRegardless of whether the authorisation is\r\nobtained at Union or national level, the requirements for the safety, efficacy\r\nand quality of the product are the same. In all authorisation procedures, a key\r\npart of the assessment of an application is the benefit-risk analysis of a\r\nproduct.\nThe centralised procedure is\r\nmandatory for all veterinary medicinal products derived from biotechnology and\r\noptional with any other type of veterinary medicinal product. For products that\r\nare of interest in the majority of the Member States, access to the centralised\r\nprocedure can lead to savings for the marketing authorisation holder. \nThe mutual recognition procedure\r\napplies for veterinary medicinal products already authorised in one Member State for which authorisation is requested in respect of two or more Member States.\r\nThis procedure is based on the principle that a product authorised in one Member State should be recognised by another.\nThe decentralised procedure applies\r\nin cases where a medicine has not received a marketing authorisation in any Member State. It enables applicants to target their product to a limited group of Member\r\nStates. After a marketing authorisation has been granted for the group of\r\nMember States in the original application, marketing authorisation holders can\r\nobtain an authorisation for additional Member States without repeated\r\nscientific assessment. This should mean that unnecessary duplication of work by\r\ncompetent authorities can be avoided, ease the rolling\u2011out of national\r\nmarketing authorisations to other Member States and therefore increase the availability\r\nof veterinary medicinal products in the Union.\nFor the decentralised and mutual\r\nrecognition procedures, an arbitration mechanism applies if a Member State cannot agree with the scientific assessment. If an applicant cannot agree with the\r\noutcome of a Member State\u2019s assessment, it may request re-examination by the\r\nAgency. In such cases, the Agency will deliver a scientific opinion to the coordination\r\ngroup of Member States, which will act by consensus or by a majority of votes\r\ncast.\nCurrently, marketing authorisations have to\r\nbe renewed every five years. The proposal provides for unlimited validity,\r\nwhich will reduce the regulatory burden.\nChapter IV: \u00a0 Post-marketing authorisation measures\nThis part establishes a single product\r\ndatabase for all authorised veterinary medicinal products in the Union. Competent authorities will be obliged to upload data on national marketing\r\nauthorisations. Having a readily accessible, up-to-date database of all\r\nauthorised medicines will mean inter alia improved application of the\r\nprovisions on the use of veterinary medicinal products outside the terms of the\r\nmarketing authorisation, as veterinarians will be able to identify the products\r\nthey need from other Member States.\nPost-marketing authorisation measures include\r\namending marketing authorisations and monitoring products after they have been\r\non the market (pharmacovigilance). The terms of the authorisation may need to\r\nbe amended where, for example, a change to the SPC is proposed. The provisions\r\nof Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 should no longer apply to variations to\r\nveterinary medicinal products. The Regulation lays down a system for varying\r\nthe terms of marketing authorisations that takes account of the level of risk\r\ninvolved. Only changes that substantially affect product safety or efficacy\r\nwill still require prior authorisation by the competent authorities or the\r\nCommission before being implemented.\nVeterinary medicinal products tend to have\r\nunintended effects when actually brought into use. Pharmacovigilance involves identifying\r\nadverse events and determining what action, if any, is required. The objective\r\nis to ensure the continuous safety of products once they are authorised. This\r\nproposal introduces a risk-based approach to pharmacovigilance whereby certain\r\nrequirements that do not contribute effectively to public health, animal health\r\nor environmental protection (e.g. submitting periodic safety update reports)\r\nare relaxed. The Agency will manage a database of adverse events linked to\r\nmedicines authorised in the Union. It will work together with competent\r\nauthorities to monitor and evaluate collated data on adverse events linked to\r\nsimilar groups of veterinary medicinal products (signal management process).\nMany SPCs of nationally authorised products\r\nmay differ in some respects between Member States. As a result, dosage, uses\r\nand warnings may also differ. This lack of harmonisation could result in discrepancies\r\nbetween the SPCs of the originator and the generic product on the same national\r\nmarket. This part also seeks to harmonise the SPCs for products on the Union\r\nmarket that have been authorised at national level by means of a dual procedure:\r\n\n\u00b7                        \r\nproducts considered low-risk will be subject to\r\nan administrative procedure; and \n\u00b7                        \r\nproducts that are by nature more likely to\r\npresent a risk to animal or public health or the environment will be\r\nscientifically re-assessed. \nThis harmonisation should increase the\r\navailability of products in the Union.\nMember States or the Commission can request a re-evaluation of veterinary\r\nmedicinal products available on the market on the grounds that they may pose a\r\nrisk to animal or public health or the environment. Once this \u2018Union referral\r\nprocedure\u2019 is triggered, the Agency adopts an opinion on the case and the\r\nCommission adopts a decision that will apply throughout the Union. \nIn addition, a system will be set up to\r\nrecord and report the use of antimicrobials. This is one of measures in the\r\nCommission\u2019s AMR action plan.\nChapter V:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Homeopathic veterinary medicinal products\nThis part lays down requirements and a\r\nsimplified registration procedure for homeopathic veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts.\nChapter VI:\u00a0\u00a0 Manufacturing, import and export\nThis part covers the procedure and\r\nrequirements for obtaining an authorisation to manufacture, import or export\r\nveterinary medicinal products. It lays down the obligations of a manufacturing\r\nauthorisation holder. These rules will ensure the quality of the medicine\r\navailable on the Union market.\nChapter VII:\u00a0 Supply and use\nThis part covers the supply and use of\r\nveterinary medicinal products after a marketing authorisation has been granted.\r\nIt imposes new restrictions on the supply of antimicrobial veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts and lays down rules on prescriptions and online sales of veterinary\r\nmedicinal products.\nIn order to improve access to veterinary\r\nmedicinal products in the Union, retailers should be allowed to sell products\r\nvia the internet if they are authorised to supply them in the Member State in which the buyer is established. Online sales of veterinary medicinal products\r\nthroughout the Union must be harmonised and ring-fenced, as falsified or\r\nsubstandard veterinary medicinal products represent a threat to public and\r\nanimal health. Member States may impose conditions, for public health reasons, on\r\nsupplying veterinary medicinal products to the public via the internet.\nThe provisions on the use of veterinary\r\nmedicinal products for species or indications outside the terms of the\r\nmarketing authorisation are improved as follows:\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe ranking system is abolished and more\r\nflexibility introduced, enabling veterinarians to choose the best available\r\ntreatment for animals under their care;\n\u00b7                        \r\nwithdrawal periods are determined according to a\r\nmultiplication factor system which takes account of relevant available\r\ninformation;\n\u00b7                        \r\nspecific provisions are included for the use of\r\nproducts in an aquatic environment in order to better protect the environment;\r\nand\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe Commission is empowered to exclude or\r\nrestrict the use of certain antimicrobials.\nChapter VIII:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Controls\nInspections by Member States\u2019 competent\r\nauthorities should ensure that the Union rules are complied with and enforced\r\nat national level. The Agency should coordinate the controls of veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts authorised by the centralised procedure. The key change is that the\r\nCommission will be able to check Member States\u2019 inspection systems to ensure\r\nthat the legislation is enforced consistently. This brings the arrangements for\r\nveterinary medicinal products into line with those in the food sector.\nChapter IX: \u00a0 Restrictions and sanctions\nThis part deals with Member State and Union-level measures to tackle risks to public or animal health or the environment.\r\nIt provides for:\n\u00b7                        \r\na procedure for temporary safety restrictions;\r\nand\n\u00b7                        \r\nsuspending, withdrawing and varying marketing\r\nauthorisations; or\n\u00b7                        \r\nprohibiting the supply of veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts.\nChapter X: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulatory network\nThis part regulates the Union regulatory\r\nnetwork on veterinary medicinal products. Responsibility for veterinary\r\nmedicinal products is shared between the Member States and the Commission. The\r\nfully fledged European network between the competent authorities of the Member States, the Agency and the Commission should ensure that:\n\u00b7                        \r\nveterinary medicinal products are available on\r\nthe Union market;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthey are properly evaluated before being\r\nauthorised for use; and \n\u00b7                        \r\ntheir safety and efficacy is constantly\r\nmonitored. \nThis part of the proposal specifies the\r\nfunctioning and the tasks of the Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for\r\nVeterinary Use (CVMP) and the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and\r\nDecentralised Procedures (veterinary) (CMDv). The main changes are to clarify\r\nthe remit of the CMDv, which will have more responsibility under the new\r\narrangements and will take decisions by majority voting. These changes should\r\nimprove the functioning of the network. The CVMP\u2019s tasks are amended to reflect\r\nthe proposed changes to marketing authorisation procedures and post\u2011marketing\r\nmeasures.\nChapter XI: \u00a0 Final provisions\nThis proposal repeals and replaces\r\nDirective 2001/82/EC. To give those affected sufficient time to adapt to the\r\nnew legislation, the Regulation will apply as from two years after its publication.\nRegulation (EC) No 726/2004 must be amended\r\nto take account of the fact that centralised marketing authorisation for\r\nveterinary medicinal products is being decoupled from that for medicines for\r\nhumans. The amendments are proposed in a separate act accompanying this\r\nproposal.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nIt is planned that the costs for the Agency\r\nfor implementing and applying the new rules are entirely covered by fees\r\ncharged to industry. \nTherefore, the proposal is not expected to\r\nhave any financial impact on the budget of the EU.\nAs set out in the legislative financial\r\nstatement the additional resource needs for the European Medicines Agency are\r\napproximately 8 staff plus expenditure for meetings, translation, IT, etc. \nThe level of fees, their structure,\r\nmodalities and exceptions will be set at a later stage by the Commission by way\r\nof implementing acts. This holds not only for the fees for new tasks for the Agency\r\nset out in this proposal, but for all fees in general.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n2014/0257 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non veterinary medicinal products\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 114 and 168(4)(b)\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[9],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[10],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2001/82/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[11]\r\nand Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council[12] constitute the Union\r\nregulatory framework for the placing on the market, manufacture, import,\r\nexport, supply, pharmacovigilance, control and the use of veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the\r\nexperience acquired and following the assessment by the Commission of the\r\nfunctioning of the market for veterinary medicinal products, the legal\r\nframework for veterinary medicinal products should be adapted to scientific\r\nprogress, the current market conditions and economic reality. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legal framework should\r\ntake into account the needs of the businesses in the veterinary pharmaceutical\r\nsector and trade in veterinary medicinal products within the Union. It should\r\nalso integrate the major policy objectives set out in the Communication from\r\nthe Commission of 3 March 2010 \"Europe 2020 A Strategy for smart,\r\nsustainable and inclusive growth\"[13].\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience has shown that\r\nthe needs of the veterinary sector differ substantially from those of the human\r\nsector in relation to medicines. In particular, the drivers for investment for\r\nthe human and the veterinary medicines markets are different. For example, in\r\nthe veterinary sector there are many different animal species, which creates\r\nboth a fragmented market and the need for major investments in order to extend\r\nthe authorisation of medicines existing for one animal species to another.\r\nMoreover, the price-setting mechanisms in the veterinary sector follow a\r\ncompletely different logic. Consequently, prices for veterinary medicines are\r\ntypically substantially lower than for medicinal products for human use. The\r\nsize of the animal pharmaceutical industry is only a small fraction of the size\r\nof the pharmaceutical industry for human medicines.It is therefore appropriate\r\nto develop a regulatory framework addressing the characteristics and\r\nspecificities of the veterinary sector, which cannot be considered as a model\r\nfor the human medicines market. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of this act\r\naim to reduce administrative burden, enhance the internal market and increase\r\nthe availability of veterinary medicinal products, while guaranteeing the\r\nhighest level of public and animal health and environmental protection. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Animals may suffer from a\r\nbroad range of diseases which can be prevented or treated. The impact of animal\r\ndiseases and the measures necessary to control them can be devastating for\r\nindividual animals, animal populations, animal keepers and the economy. Animal\r\ndiseases transmissible to humans may also have a significant impact on public\r\nhealth. Therefore sufficient and effective veterinary medicinal products should\r\nbe available in the Union in order to ensure high standards of animal and\r\npublic health, and for the development of the agriculture and aquaculture\r\nsectors.\u00a0 \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should set\r\nhigh standards of quality, safety and efficacy for veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts in order to meet common concerns as regards the protection of public\r\nand animal health. At the same time, this Regulation should harmonise the rules\r\nfor the authorisation of veterinary medicinal products and the placing of them on\r\nthe Union market.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to harmonising\r\nthe internal market for veterinary medicinal products in the Union and\r\nimproving their free movement, rules should be established concerning the\r\nprocedures for authorisation of such products that ensure the same conditions\r\nfor all applications and a transparent framework for all interested parties.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scope of the mandatory\r\nuse of a centralised authorisation procedure under which the authorisations are\r\nvalid throughout the Union should cover inter alia products containing\r\nnew active substances and products which contain or consist of engineered\r\ntissues or cells. At the same time, in order to ensure the widest possible\r\navailability of veterinary medicinal products in the Union, the centralised\r\nauthorisation procedure should be extended to allow for applications for\r\nauthorisations under that procedure to be submitted for any veterinary\r\nmedicinal product, including for generics of nationally authorised veterinary\r\nmedicinal products. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The national procedure for\r\nauthorising veterinary medicinal products should be maintained because of\r\nvarying needs in different geographical areas of the Union as well as the\r\nbusiness models of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs).\u00a0 It should be\r\nensured that marketing authorisations granted in one Member State are recognised in other Member States. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to help\r\napplicants, and in particular SMEs, to comply with the requirements of this\r\nRegulation, Member States should provide advice to the applicants, for example\r\nby establishing helpdesks. This advice should be provided in addition to the\r\noperational guidance documents and other advice and assistance provided by the\r\nEuropean Medicines Agency.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid\r\nunnecessary administrative and financial burdens for applicants and competent\r\nauthorities, a full in-depth assessment of an application for the authorisation\r\nof a veterinary medicinal product should be carried out only once. It is\r\nappropriate therefore to lay down special procedures for the mutual recognition\r\nof national authorisations. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, rules should be\r\nestablished under the mutual recognition procedure to resolve any disagreements\r\nbetween competent authorities in a coordination group of the Member States\r\nwithout undue delay. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a Member State or the\r\nCommission considers that there are reasons to believe that a veterinary\r\nmedicinal product may present a potential serious risk to human or animal\r\nhealth or to the environment, a scientific evaluation of the product should be\r\nundertaken at Union level, leading to a single decision on the area of\r\ndisagreement, binding on the Member States concerned, being taken on the basis\r\nof an overall benefit-risk assessment.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No veterinary medicinal\r\nproduct should be allowed to be placed on the market or used in the Union unless it has been authorised, and its quality, safety and efficacy have been\r\ndemonstrated. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a veterinary\r\nmedicinal product is intended for food-producing animal species, a marketing\r\nauthorisation should only be granted if the pharmacologically active substances\r\nwhich the product contains are allowed in accordance with Commission Regulation\r\n(EU) No 37/2010[14]\r\nfor the species for which the veterinary medicinal product is intended.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, there may be situations\r\nwhere no suitable authorised veterinary medicinal product is available. In\r\nthose situations, by way of exception, veterinarians should be allowed to\r\nprescribe other medicinal products to the animals under their responsibility in\r\nconformity with strict rules and in the interest of animal health or animal\r\nwelfare only. In case of food-producing animals, veterinarians should ensure\r\nthat an appropriate withdrawal period is prescribed, so that harmful residues\r\nof those medicinal products do not enter the food chain.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should be\r\nable to allow exceptional use of veterinary medicinal products without a\r\nmarketing authorisation where it is necessary to respond to Union listed\r\ndiseases and where the health situation in a Member State so requires.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\r\nneed for simple rules on changes to the marketing authorisations of veterinary\r\nmedicinal products, only changes that may affect animal health, public health\r\nor the environment should require a scientific assessment.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2010/63/EU of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[15]\r\nlays down provisions on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes\r\nbased on the principles of replacement, reduction and refinement. Clinical\r\ntrials for veterinary medicinal products are exempted from that Directive. The\r\ndesign and performance of clinical trials, which provide essential information\r\non the safety and efficacy of a veterinary medicinal product, should be such as\r\nto provide the most satisfactory results whilst using the minimum number of\r\nanimals, the procedures should be the least likely to cause pain, suffering or\r\ndistress to animals and should take into account the principles established by\r\nDirective 2010/63/EU.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The principles of\r\nreplacement, reduction and refinement concerning the care and use of live\r\nanimals for scientific purposes should therefore be taken into account during\r\nthe design and performance of clinical trials. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recognised that\r\nimproved access to information contributes to public awareness, gives the\r\npublic the opportunity to express its observations and enables authorities to\r\ntake due account of those observations. Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[16]\r\ngives the fullest possible effect to the right of public access to documents\r\nand lays down the general principles and limits on such access. The European\r\nMedicines Agency should therefore give the widest possible access to the\r\ndocuments carefully balancing the right for information with existing data\r\nprotection requirements. Certain public and private interests, such as\r\nregarding the protection of personal data, or the protection of commercially\r\nconfidential information, should be protected by way of exceptions in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Companies have less\r\ninterest in developing veterinary medicinal products for markets of a limited\r\nsize. In order to promote the availability of veterinary medicinal products\r\nwithin the Union for those markets, in some cases it should be possible to\r\ngrant marketing authorisations without a complete application dossier having\r\nbeen submitted, on the basis of a benefit-risk assessment of the situation and,\r\nwhere necessary, subject to specific obligations. In particular, this should be\r\npossible in the case of veterinary medicinal products for use in minor species\r\nor for the treatment or prevention of diseases that occur infrequently or in\r\nlimited geographical areas. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Environmental risk\r\nassessments should be mandatory for all new applications for a marketing\r\nauthorisation and should consist of two phases. In the first phase the extent\r\nof environmental exposure of the product, its active substances and other constituent\r\nshould be estimated, while in the second phase the effects of the active\r\nresidue should be assessed. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tests, pre-clinical studies\r\nand clinical trials represent a major investment for companies which they need\r\nto make in order to submit the necessary data with the application for a\r\nmarketing authorisation or to establish a maximum residue limit for pharmaceutical\r\nactive substances in the veterinary medicinal product. That investment should\r\nbe protected in order to stimulate research and innovation, so that it is\r\nensured the necessary veterinary medicinal products are available in the Union. For that reason data submitted to a competent authority or the Agency should be\r\nprotected against use by other applicants. That protection should, however, be\r\nlimited in time in order to allow competition. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain particulars and\r\ndocuments that are normally to be submitted with an application for a marketing\r\nauthorisation should not be required if a veterinary medicinal product is a\r\ngeneric medicinal product of a veterinary medicinal product that is authorised\r\nor has been authorised in the Union. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recognised that the\r\npotential effect of a product on the environment may depend on the volume used\r\nand the resulting amount of the pharmaceutical substance that may reach the\r\nenvironment. Therefore, where there is evidence that a constituent of a\r\nmedicinal product for which a generic application for a marketing authorisation\r\nis submitted is a hazard for the environment, it is appropriate to require data\r\non the potential effect on the environment in order to safeguard the\r\nenvironment. In such cases applicants should endeavour to join efforts in\r\ngenerating such data in order to reduce costs and to reduce testing on\r\nvertebrate animals.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The protection of technical\r\ndocumentation should be applied to new veterinary medicinal products, as well\r\nas to data developed for supporting innovations of products with or referring\r\nto an existing\u00a0 marketing authorisation, for example in the case of extending use\r\nof an existing product to an additional animal species. In this case the\r\nvariation or marketing authorisation application may refer partly to data\r\nsubmitted in a former marketing authorisation or variation applications, and\r\nshould include new data specifically developed to support the required\r\ninnovation of the existing product.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Differences in the\r\nmanufacturing process of biological products or a change in the excipient used\r\nmay lead to differences in the generic product characteristics. In an\r\napplication for generic biological veterinary medicinal product the\r\nbioequivalence should be demonstrated in order to ensure, based on the existing\r\nknowledge, that quality, safety and efficacy are similar.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid\r\nunnecessary administrative and financial burdens both for the competent\r\nauthorities and for the pharmaceutical industry, as a general rule a marketing\r\nauthorisation for a veterinary medicinal product should be granted for an\r\nunlimited period of time. Conditions for renewing the approval of a marketing\r\nauthorisation should be imposed only exceptionally and should be duly\r\njustified. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recognised that, in\r\nsome cases, a scientific risk assessment alone cannot provide all the\r\ninformation on which a risk management decision should be based, and other relevant\r\nfactors should be taken into account including societal, economical, ethical,\r\nenvironmental and welfare factors and the feasibility of controls.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In certain circumstances\r\nwhere a significant animal or public health concern exists but scientific uncertainty\r\npersists, appropriate measures can be adopted taking into account Article 5(7)\r\nof the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures\r\nwhich has been interpreted for the Union in the Communication from the\r\nCommission on the precautionary principle[17].\u00a0\r\nIn such circumstances, Member States or the Commission should seek to obtain\r\nadditional information necessary for a more objective assessment of the\r\nparticular concern and should review the measure accordingly within a reasonable\r\nperiod of time. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Antimicrobial resistance to\r\nhuman and veterinary medicinal products is a growing health problem in the Union and worldwide. Many of the antimicrobials used in animals are also used in humans.\r\nSome of those antimicrobials are critical for preventing or treating\r\nlife-threatening infections in humans.\u00a0 In order to fight antimicrobial\r\nresistance a number of measures should be taken. It needs to be ensured that\r\nappropriate warnings and guidance are included on the labels of veterinary antimicrobials.\r\nUse not covered by the terms of the marketing authorisation of certain new or\r\ncritically important antimicrobials for humans should be restricted in the\r\nveterinary sector. The rules for advertising veterinary antimicrobials should\r\nbe tightened, and the authorisation requirements should sufficiently address\r\nthe risks and benefits of antimicrobial veterinary medicinal products.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to mitigate\r\nthe risk of development of antimicrobial resistance to human and veterinary\r\nmedicinal products. Therefore, an application for an antimicrobial veterinary\r\nmedicinal product should contain information about the potential risks that use\r\nof the product may lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance in\r\nhumans or animals or in organisms associated with them. In order to ensure a\r\nhigh level of public and animal health, veterinary antimicrobials should only\r\nbe authorised following a careful scientific benefit-risk assessment.\u00a0 If\r\nnecessary, conditions should be laid down in the marketing authorisation in\r\norder to restrict the use of the product. This should include restrictions on\r\nthe use of the veterinary medicinal product not in accordance with the terms of\r\nthe marketing authorisation, in particular the summary of product\r\ncharacteristics of the veterinary medicinal product. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The combined use of several\r\nantimicrobial active substances may represent a particular risk with respect to\r\nthe development of antimicrobial resistance. Combinations of antimicrobial\r\nsubstances should therefore only be authorised where evidence is provided that\r\nthe benefit-risk balance of the combination is favourable.\u00a0 \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The development of new\r\nantimicrobials has not kept pace with the increase of resistance to existing\r\nantimicrobials. Given the limited innovation in developing new antimicrobials\r\nit is essential that the efficacy of existing antimicrobials is maintained for\r\nas long as possible. The use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicinal products\r\nmay accelerate the emergence and spread of resistant micro-organisms and may\r\ncompromise the effective use of the already limited number of existing\r\nantimicrobials to treat human infections. Therefore the misuse of\r\nantimicrobials should not be allowed.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to preserve as\r\nlong as possible the efficacy of certain antimicrobials in the treatment of\r\ninfections in humans, it may be necessary to reserve those antimicrobials for\r\nhumans only. Therefore it should be possible to decide that certain\r\nantimicrobials, following the scientific recommendations of the Agency, should\r\nnot be available on the market in the veterinary sector. \n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If an antimicrobial is\r\nadministered and used incorrectly, this presents a risk to public or animal\r\nhealth. Therefore antimicrobial veterinary medicinal products should only be\r\navailable on veterinary prescription. Persons having the right to prescribe\r\nhave a key role in ensuring prudent use of antimicrobials and consequently they\r\nshould not be influenced, directly or indirectly, by economic incentives when\r\nprescribing those products. Therefore the supply of veterinary antimicrobials\r\nby those health professionals should be restricted to the amount required for\r\ntreatment of the animals under their care. \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important to consider\r\nthe international dimension of the development of antimicrobial resistance when\r\nassessing the benefit-risk balance of certain veterinary antimicrobials in the Union. Any measure restricting the use of those products may affect the trade of products\r\nof animal origin or the competitiveness of certain animal production sectors in\r\nthe Union. Moreover, antimicrobial resistant organisms can spread to humans and\r\nanimals in the Union through consumption of products of animal origin imported\r\nfrom third countries, from direct contact with animals or humans in third countries\r\nor by other means. Therefore, measures restricting the use of veterinary\r\nantimicrobials in the Union should be based on scientific advice and should be\r\nconsidered in the context of cooperation with third countries and international\r\norganisations addressing antimicrobial resistance in order the ensure\r\nconsistency with their activities and policies.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is still a lack of\r\nsufficiently detailed and comparable data at Union level to determine the\r\ntrends and identify possible risk factors that could lead to the development of\r\nmeasures to limit the risk from antimicrobial resistance and to monitor the\r\neffect of measures already introduced. Therefore it is important to\r\ncollect data on the sales and use of antimicrobials in animals, data on the use\r\nof antimicrobials in humans and data on antimicrobial resistant organisms found\r\nin animals, humans and food. To ensure that the information collected can be\r\nused effectively, appropriate rules should be laid down concerning the\r\ncollection and the exchange of data. The Member States should be responsible\r\nfor collecting data on the use of antimicrobials under the coordination of the\r\nAgency.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The majority of the\r\nveterinary medicinal products on the market have been authorised under national\r\nprocedures. The lack of harmonisation of summary of product characteristics for\r\nveterinary medicinal products authorised nationally in more than one Member State creates additional and unnecessary barriers for the circulation of veterinary\r\nmedicinal products within the Union. It is necessary to harmonise those\r\nsummaries of product characteristics. In order to avoid unnecessary costs and\r\nburdens for the Member States, the Commission and the pharmaceutical industry,\r\nand in order to increase the availability of veterinary medicinal products as\r\nfast as possible, it should be possible to harmonise summaries of the products\r\ncharacteristics for certain veterinary medicinal products in accordance with an\r\nadministrative procedure, while taking on board the risk to public and animal\r\nhealth and to the environment. This harmonisation exercise should cover\r\nveterinary medicinal products authorised before 2004.[18]. \n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reduce\r\nadministrative burden and maximise the availability of veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts in the Member States, simplified rules should be laid down as to how\r\ntheir packaging and labelling are to be presented. The textual information\r\nprovided should be reduced and, if possible, replaced by pictograms and\r\nabbreviations. Pictograms and abbreviations should be standardised across the Union. Care should be taken so that those rules do not jeopardise public and animal health\r\nand environmental safety.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, Member States\r\nshould be empowered to choose the language of the text used in the packaging\r\nand labelling of veterinary medicinal products authorised in their territory.\r\nThe package leaflet, however, should be provided in the official language or\r\nlanguages of the Member State.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to increasing\r\navailability of veterinary medicinal products in the Union it should be\r\npossible to grant more than one marketing authorisation for a specific\r\nveterinary medicinal product to the same marketing authorisation holder in the\r\nsame Member State. In that case all product-related characteristics of the\r\nproduct and data in support of the applications for the product should be\r\nidentical. However, multiple applications for a specific product should not be\r\nused to circumvent the principles of mutual recognition, and therefore this\r\ntype of applications in different Member States should take place inside the\r\nprocedural framework for mutual recognition.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pharmacovigilance rules are necessary for the protection of\r\npublic and animal health and the\r\nenvironment. Collection of information on adverse\r\nevents should contribute to the good usage of veterinary medicinal products. \n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the\r\nexperience acquired it has become clear that it is necessary to take measures\r\nto improve the operation of the pharmacovigilance system. It should integrate\r\nand monitor data at Union level. It is the interest of the Union to ensure that\r\nthe veterinary pharmacovigilance systems for all authorised veterinary\r\nmedicinal products are consistent. At the same time, it is necessary to take\r\naccount of changes arising as a result of international harmonisation of\r\ndefinitions, terminology and technological developments in the field of\r\npharmacovigilance. \n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Holders of marketing\r\nauthorisations should be responsible for continuously carrying out pharmacovigilance\r\nof the veterinary medicinal products they place on the market. They should\r\ncollect reports on adverse events relating to their products, including those\r\nconcerning use outside the terms of the granted marketing authorisation. \n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to increase\r\nthe shared use of resources between authorities, and to enhance efficiency of\r\nthe pharmacovigilance system. Data collected should be uploaded to a single\r\nreporting point to ensure that the information is shared. The competent\r\nauthorities should use those data to ensure the continuous safety and efficacy\r\nof the veterinary medicinal products that are on the market.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary, in\r\nspecific cases, or from a public health and animal health perspective, to\r\ncomplement the safety and efficacy data available at the time of authorisation\r\nwith additional information following the placing of the product on the market.\r\nTherefore the obligation to conduct post-authorisation studies should be\r\nimposed on the marketing authorisation holder.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A pharmacovigilance\r\ndatabase at Union level should be established to record and integrate\r\ninformation of adverse events for all veterinary medicinal products authorised\r\nin the Union. That database should improve detection of adverse events and should\r\nallow and facilitate the pharmacovigilance surveillance and work-sharing\r\nbetween the competent authorities.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to exercise\r\ncontrol over the entire chain of distribution of veterinary medicinal products,\r\nfrom manufacture or import into the Union through supply to the end-user.\r\nVeterinary medicinal products from third countries should comply with the same\r\nrequirements which apply to products manufactured in the Union, or with\r\nrequirements which are recognised to be at least equivalent thereto. \n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\r\nmovement of veterinary medicinal products and to prevent checks carried out in\r\none Member State being repeated in others, minimum requirements should be\r\napplied to veterinary medicinal products manufactured in or imported from third\r\ncountries. \n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The quality of veterinary\r\nmedicinal products manufactured within the Union should be guaranteed by\r\nrequiring compliance with the principles of good manufacturing practice for\r\nmedicinal products irrespective of the final destination of the medicinal\r\nproducts.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Companies should be in\r\npossession of an authorisation to be able to wholesale or retail veterinary\r\nmedicinal products, so as to guarantee that such medicines are appropriately\r\nstored, transported and handled. It should be the responsibility of the Member\r\nStates to ensure that those conditions are met. Those authorisations should be\r\nvalid throughout the Union.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\r\ntransparency, a database should be established at Union level for the purposes\r\nof publishing a list of wholesale distributors who have been found to comply\r\nwith applicable Union legislation following an inspection by the competent\r\nauthorities of a Member State.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The conditions governing\r\nthe supply of veterinary medicinal products to the public should be harmonised\r\nin the Union. Veterinary medicinal products should only be supplied by persons\r\nauthorised to do so by the Member State where they are established. At the same\r\ntime, in order to improve access to veterinary medicinal products in the Union,\r\nretailers that are authorised to supply veterinary medicinal products by the competent\r\nauthority in the Member State where they are established should be allowed to\r\nsell prescription and non-prescription veterinary medicinal products via the\r\nInternet to buyers in other Member States. \n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The illegal sale of\r\nveterinary medicinal products to the public via the Internet may represent a\r\nthreat to public and animal health, as falsified or substandard medicines may\r\nreach the public in this way. It is necessary to address this threat. Account\r\nshould be taken of the fact that specific conditions for supply of medicinal\r\nproducts to the public have not been harmonised at Union level and, therefore,\r\nMember States may impose conditions for supplying medicinal products to the\r\npublic within the limits of the Treaty.\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When examining the\r\ncompatibility with Union law of the conditions for the supply of medicinal\r\nproducts, the Court of Justice of the European Union has recognised, in the\r\ncontext on medicinal products for human use, the very particular nature of\r\nmedicinal products whose therapeutic effects distinguish them substantially\r\nfrom other goods. The Court of Justice has also held that health and life of\r\nhumans rank foremost among the assets and interests protected by the Treaty and\r\nthat it is for Member States to determine the level of protection which they\r\nwish to afford to public health and the way in which that level has to be\r\nachieved. Since that level may vary from one Member State to another, Member\r\nStates must be allowed some discretion as regards the conditions for the supply\r\non their territory of medicinal products to the public. Therefore Member States\r\nshould be able to subject the supply of medicinal products offered for sale at\r\na distance by means of information society services to conditions justified by\r\nthe protection of public health. Such conditions should not unduly restrict the\r\nfunctioning of the internal market.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure high\r\nstandards and safety of the veterinary medicinal products offered for sale at a\r\ndistance, the public should be assisted in identifying websites which are\r\nlegally offering such medicinal products. A common logo should be established,\r\nwhich is recognisable throughout the Union, while allowing for the\r\nidentification of the Member State where the person offering veterinary\r\nmedicinal products for sale at a distance is established. The Commission should\r\ndevelop the design for such a logo. Websites offering veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts for sale at a distance to the public should be linked to the website of\r\nthe competent authority concerned. The websites of the competent authorities of\r\nMember States, as well as that of the European Medicines Agency, should give an\r\nexplanation of the use of the logo. All those websites should be linked in\r\norder to provide comprehensive information to the public.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Collection systems for the\r\ntake-back of unused or expired veterinary medicinal products should continue to\r\nbe in place in the Member States in order to control any risk that such\r\nproducts might raise with regard to the protection of animal, human health or\r\nthe environment.\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Advertising, even on\r\nnon-prescription medicinal products, could affect public and animal health and\r\ndistort competition. Therefore, advertising of veterinary medicinal products\r\nshould satisfy certain criteria. Persons qualified to prescribe or supply can properly\r\nevaluate the information available in advertising because of their knowledge,\r\ntraining and experience in animal health. The advertising of veterinary\r\nmedicinal products to persons who cannot properly appreciate the risk\r\nassociated with their use may lead to medicine misuse or overconsumption which\r\nis liable to harm public or animal health, or the environment.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where medicinal products\r\nare authorised within a Member State and have been prescribed in that Member State by a member of a regulated animal health profession for an individual animal or\r\ngroup of animals, it should in principle be possible for that veterinary\r\nprescription to be recognised and for the medicinal product to be dispensed in\r\nanother Member State. The removal of regulatory and administrative barriers to\r\nsuch recognition should not affect any professional or ethical duty for\r\ndispensing professionals to refuse to dispense the medicine stated in the\r\nprescription. \n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The implementation of the\r\nprinciple of recognition of prescriptions should be facilitated by the adoption\r\nof a standard prescription, listing the essential information necessary to\r\nensure the safe and efficacious use of the product. Nothing should prevent\r\nMember States from having further elements in their prescriptions, as long as\r\nthis does not prevent prescriptions from other Member States from being\r\nrecognised. \n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information on veterinary\r\nmedicinal products is essential in order to enable health professionals,\r\nauthorities and undertakings to make informed decisions. A key aspect is the\r\ncreation of a European database that should collate information on marketing\r\nauthorisations granted in the Union. The database should enhance overall\r\ntransparency, streamline and facilitate the flow of information between\r\nauthorities and prevent multiple reporting requirements.\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The verification of\r\ncompliance with the legal requirements through controls is of fundamental\r\nimportance to ensure that the objectives of the Regulation are effectively\r\nachieved across the Union. Therefore the competent authorities of the Member\r\nStates should have the power to perform inspections at all stages of\r\nproduction, distribution and use of veterinary medicinal products. In order to\r\npreserve the effectiveness of the inspections, authorities should have the\r\npossibility to perform unannounced inspections. \n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The frequency of controls\r\nshould be established by the competent authorities having regard to the risk\r\nand to the level of compliance expected in the different situations. This\r\napproach should allow authorities to allocate resources where the risk is the\r\nhighest. In some cases, however, controls should be performed irrespective of\r\nthe level of risk or expected non-compliance, for example prior to granting\r\nmanufacturing authorisations.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In certain cases failures\r\nin Member States\u2019 control system can substantially hinder the achievement of\r\nthe objectives of this Regulation and may lead to the emergence of risks to\r\npublic and animal health and the environment. To ensure a harmonised approach\r\nto inspections throughout the Union, the Commission should be able to carry out\r\naudits in the Member States to verify the functioning of national control\r\nsystems. \n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure transparency,\r\nimpartiality and consistency in the level of enforcement activities by Member\r\nStates, it is necessary for Member States to set up an appropriate framework\r\nfor penalties with a view to imposing effective, proportionate and dissuasive\r\npenalties for non-compliance, as non-compliance can result in damage to animal\r\nand public health and the environment.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time, the power\r\nto adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated\r\nto the Commission in respect of laying down the\r\nprocedure for investigating the infringements and the imposition of fines to\r\nthe holders of marketing authorisations granted under this Regulation, the\r\nmaximum amounts of these penalties as well as the conditions and methods for\r\ntheir collection.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Companies and authorities\r\nare frequently confronted with the need to distinguish between veterinary\r\nmedicinal products, feed additives, biocidal products and other products. In\r\norder to avoid inconsistencies in the treatment of such products, to increase\r\nlegal certainty, and to facilitate the decision process by Member States, a\r\ncoordination group of Member States should be established, and among other\r\ntasks it should provide on a case-by-case basis a recommendation whether a\r\nproduct falls within the definition of a veterinary medicinal product. In order\r\nto ensure legal certainty the Commission may decide whether a specific product\r\nis a veterinary medicinal product.\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to the\r\nspecial characteristics of homeopathic veterinary medicinal products,\r\nespecially the constituents of these products, it is desirable to establish a\r\nspecial, simplified registration procedure and to provide specific provisions\r\nfor labelling for certain homeopathic veterinary medicinal products which are\r\nplaced on the market without therapeutic indications. Immunological homeopathic\r\nproducts cannot follow the simplified registration procedure as immunologicals\r\nmay initiate a response at a high dilution rate. The quality aspect of a\r\nhomeopathic medicinal product is independent of its use so no specific\r\nprovisions should apply with regard to the necessary quality requirements and\r\nrules.\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to follow the\r\nscientific developments of the sector, the power to adopt acts in accordance\r\nwith Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect\r\nof amending the rules on designation of homeopathic veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts for which registration procedure should be allowed.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to protect public\r\nhealth, animal health and the environment, the activities and tasks attributed\r\nto the Agency in this Regulation should be adequately funded. Those activities,\r\nservices and tasks should be funded through fees charged to enterprises. Those\r\nfees, however, should not affect the right of Member States to charge fees for\r\nactivities and tasks at national level.\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\r\nannexes to this Regulation are adapted to the technical and scientific\r\ndevelopments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the\r\nTreaty should be delegated to the Commission.\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to adapt this\r\nRegulation to the scientific developments of the sector, the power to adopt\r\nacts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the\r\nCommission in respect of the use of a product outside the terms of the granted\r\nmarketing authorisation, in particular regarding establishing a list of\r\nantimicrobial veterinary medicinal products for which such use should be\r\nprohibited.\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to adapt this\r\nRegulation to the scientific developments of the sector, the power to adopt\r\nacts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the\r\nCommission in respect of amending the list of groups of veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts for which the centralised authorisation procedure shall be compulsory.\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to adapt this\r\nRegulation to the scientific developments of the sector, the power to adopt\r\nacts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the\r\nCommission in respect of establishing detailed rules on the principles for the\r\nrefusal or restriction of marketing authorisations of antimicrobial veterinary\r\nmedicinal products, in particular with a view to preserving the efficacy of\r\ncertain active substances in treating infections in humans.\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to exercise its\r\nsupervisory powers effectively, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\r\nArticle 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of laying down the procedure for investigating the infringements and\r\nthe imposition of fines or periodic penalty payments to the holders of\r\nmarketing authorisations granted under this Regulation, the maximum amounts of\r\nthese penalties as well as the conditions and methods for their collection.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to introduce\r\nharmonised standards within the Union for the methods of gathering data on the\r\nuse of antimicrobials and the methods of transferring of these data to the\r\nCommission, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the\r\nTreaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of establishing rules\r\non these methods.\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council[19].\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\r\nmain changes that should be made to the existing rules, and aiming to improve\r\nthe functioning of the internal market, a regulation is the appropriate legal\r\ninstrument to replace Directive 2001/82/EC in order to lay down clear, detailed\r\nand directly applicable rules. Moreover, a regulation ensures that legal\r\nrequirements are implemented at the same time and in a harmonised manner\r\nthroughout the Union.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of\r\nthis Regulation, namely to establish rules on veterinary medicinal products\r\nensuring the protection of human and animal health and the environment as well\r\nas the functioning of the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by\r\nthe Member States, but can rather, by reason of its effects, be better achieved\r\nat Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle\r\nof subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In\r\naccordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article,\r\nthis Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those\r\nobjectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nChapter I \r\nSubject matter, scope and definitions\nArticle 1\r\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down rules for the placing\r\non the market, manufacture, import, export, supply, pharmacovigilance, control\r\nand use of veterinary medicinal products.\nArticle 2\r\nScope \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation shall\r\napply to veterinary medicinal products prepared industrially or by a method involving\r\nan industrial process and intended to be placed on the market.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to the\r\nproducts referred to in paragraph 1, Chapter VI shall also apply to active\r\nsubstances, intermediate products and excipients used as starting materials in\r\nveterinary medicinal products. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to the\r\nproducts referred to in paragraph 1, Chapter VII shall also apply to: \n(a)         \r\nsubstances that have anabolic, anti-infectious,\r\nanti-parasitic, anti-inflammatory, hormonal or psychotropic properties and that\r\nmay be used in animals;\n(b)         \r\nveterinary medicinal products prepared in a\r\npharmacy in accordance with a veterinary prescription for an individual animal\r\nor a small group of animals (\u2018magistral formula\u2019); \n(c)         \r\nveterinary medicinal products prepared in a\r\npharmacy in accordance with the directions of a pharmacopoeia and intended to\r\nbe supplied directly to the end-user (\u2018officinal formula\u2019).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation shall not\r\napply to: \n(a)         \r\ninactivated immunological veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts which are manufactured from pathogens and antigens obtained from an\r\nanimal or animals from a holding and used for the treatment of that animal or\r\nthose animals in the same locality;\n(b)         \r\nveterinary medicinal products containing\r\nautologous or allogeneic cells or tissues that have not been subjected to an industrial\r\nprocess;\n(c)         \r\nveterinary medicinal products based on\r\nradio-active isotopes;\n(d)        \r\nfeed additives as defined in\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council[20]; \n(e)         \r\nveterinary medicinal products intended for\r\nresearch and development.\nArticle 3\r\nConflict of laws\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a veterinary\r\nmedicinal product referred to in Article 2(1) also falls within the scope of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[21] or Regulation (EC) No\r\n1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and there is a\r\nconflict between the provisions of this Regulation and the provisions of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 528/2012 or Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, the provisions of\r\nthis Regulation shall prevail.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission may, by\r\nmeans of implementing acts, adopt decisions on whether a specific product or\r\ngroup of products is to be considered as a veterinary medicinal product.

These stakeholders have indicated that the current\r\nlegislation is disproportionate and burdensome, and not conducive to\r\ninnovation. This causes an overall problem regarding availability of veterinary\r\nmedicinal products in the Union, for minor species, for rare or emerging diseases and for the treatment and\r\nprevention of some diseases in major species. This lack of authorised\r\nveterinary medicinal products poses\r\nsignificant problems, e.g. poorer animal health and welfare, increased risk for\r\nhuman health, and economic and competitive disadvantage for EU farming. \nThe requirement is to review the legislation to modernise it and\r\nmake it tailor-made to the needs of the sector.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nThe current EU legislation on veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts provides the legal environment on\r\nauthorisation, production, marketing, distribution and use of veterinary\r\nmedicinal products . It brought some harmonisation to the procedures and rules\r\nrequired to place veterinary medicinal products \u00a0on the EU market but there is\r\nevidence that the existing provisions do not deliver a functioning internal\r\nmarket. Diverging or incomplete transposition of the rules and the existence of\r\nnumerous national requirements imply that companies are confronted with\r\ndifferent rules and interpretation in countries and have also led to different\r\nlevels of public and animal health protection. It is critically important to\r\nhave a single market for veterinary medicinal products \u00a0as the veterinary pharmaceutical\r\nsector is driven by commercial returns obtained through the sales of veterinary\r\nmedicinal products \u00a0on the resources spent. The current confined and fragmented\r\nmarkets do not allow the pharmaceutical sector to have a positive return on\r\ninvestments for developing new products for certain animal species. The\r\nambition to improve the availability of medicines in the Union and the\r\nfunctioning of the internal market and market competition can only be carried\r\nout at EU level.

In order to evaluate the implementation and\r\neffects of the new rules, the indicators as set out in 1.4.4 will be gathered\r\nand monitored at regular intervals.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\r\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThe Agency\r\nmay have insufficient fee income given the difficulty to predict the exact\r\nfrequency, scope and costs of all the veterinary activities at the Agency.\r\nMoreover, the required resources for the European Medicines Agency are foreseen\r\nby a review of the fees charged for veterinary medicinal products. It is\r\nnecessary that the new fee structure would be in place on time. \nThe updated EU databases for veterinary medicinal products and\r\npharmacovigilance may not meet the requirements of the users (authorities and\r\nmarketing authorisation holders).

The Commission will audit the control systems of the Member States.\nMoreover,\r\nmonitoring will take place to ensure that the fee resources correspond with the\r\nadditional tasks of the Agency and on an annual basis the required staff levels\r\nand resources will be reviewed.\nClose and\r\nregular contacts with the developers of the IT tools should ensure that\r\ndatabases meet the requirements of users.\n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimate of the costs and\r\nbenefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \nCosts of\r\naudits of the Commission will be limited as these will be integrated in the\r\naudits of the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) on the monitoring\r\nof residues in live animals and animal products in Member States. The objective\r\nof the audit will be the implementation by the competent authority of the\r\nresponsibility to ensure, by means of inspections, that the legal requirements\r\nrelating to veterinary medicinal products are complied with in the Member State.\u00a0 The audits will assess the performance of the competent authority and other\r\nofficially authorised entities involved in controls as well as the legal and\r\nadministrative measures put in place to give effect to the EU requirements. \nThe\r\nexpected level of risk of error is low because in the current legislation\r\nMember States already have the same responsibility. Audits of the Commission\r\nwill lead to further improvement and harmonisation of control systems in Member\r\nStates. \n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\r\nand irregularities \nSpecify existing or\r\nenvisaged prevention and protection measures.\n[In addition to the application of all\r\nregulatory control mechanisms, DG SANCO will devise an anti-fraud strategy in\r\nline with the Commission's anti-fraud strategy (CAFS) adopted on 24 June 2011\r\nin order to ensure inter alia that its internal anti-fraud related\r\ncontrols are fully aligned with the CASF and that its fraud risk management\r\napproach is geared to identify fraud risk areas and adequate responses.

Cost estimations and\r\ncalculations in this Annex are based on this principle and, therefore, the\r\nproposal is not expected to have any financial impact on the budget of the EU.\r\nThe proposal empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts to amend fees.\r\nThis would allow the Commission to adapt the fee structure in-time to the\r\nagreement of European Parliament and Council on this proposal.\nThe costs are based on a qualitative analysis\r\nof the expected change in seven areas of activity after implementation of the\r\nregulation: pre-authorisation activities (e.g. scientific advice), evaluation\r\nactivities (marketing authorisation applications) post-authorisation activities\r\n(variations), arbitration and referral, monitoring activities\r\n(pharmacovigilance), other specialised areas and activities (advice to the\r\nCommission, international cooperation, surveillance of the use of veterinary\r\nantimicrobials,\u00a0 transparency) and inspections and compliance. The table below\r\nprovides the estimate of the incremental costs and income of the implementation\r\nof the current legislative proposal. \nThe cost estimations comprise salary cost,\r\nevaluation cost, scientific meetings direct costs, translation costs and IT\r\none-off costs and IT maintenance costs, and is the balance of the anticipated\r\nchange in costs and loss of fee income to EMA after implementation of the\r\nrevised regulation. Salary costs do not take into account inflation, exchange\r\nrates and additional pension costs (applicable from 2016 for the\r\nAgency).Evaluation cost concern the services provided by the National Competent\r\nAuthorities (costs of rapporteurs' assessment activities). The direct costs for\r\nscientific meetings include the costs of travel and subsistence for delegates.\r\nTranslation costs are the direct costs to the Agency for translation of\r\nopinions and other product-related documents. \nFor the income the revised implementing\r\nrules to the Fee Regulation as of 1 April 2013 has been used. The estimations\r\ndo not take into account fee reductions that may be applied to stimulate the\r\ndevelopment of medicines for minor use and minor species or for SMEs. \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||

TERMINOLOGY\nThe Latin name of the homeopathic stock\r\ndescribed in the marketing authorisation application dossier shall be in\r\naccordance with the Latin title of the European Pharmacopoeia or, in absence\r\nthereof, of an official pharmacopoeia of a Member State. Where relevant the\r\ntraditional name(s) used in each Member State shall be provided. \n3.2.2. CONTROL OF STARTING MATERIALS \nThe particulars and documents on the\r\nstarting materials, i.e. all of the materials used from the first step of\r\nproduction of the homeopathic stock through to the final dilution to be\r\nincorporated into the finished homeopathic veterinary medicinal product,\r\naccompanying the application shall be supplemented by additional data on the\r\nhomeopathic stock. \nThe general quality requirements shall\r\napply to all of the starting and raw materials as well as intermediate steps of\r\nthe manufacturing process up to the final dilution to be incorporated into the\r\nfinished homeopathic product. Where a toxic component is present, this shall be\r\ncontrolled if possible in the final dilution. However, if this is not possible\r\nbecause of the high dilution, the toxic component shall normally be controlled\r\nat an earlier stage. Every step of the manufacturing process from the starting\r\nmaterials up to the final dilution to be incorporated into the finished product\r\nmust be fully described. \nIn case dilutions are involved, these\r\ndilution steps shall be done in accordance with the homeopathic manufacturing\r\nmethods laid down in the relevant monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia or,\r\nin absence thereof, in an official pharmacopoeia of a Member State. \n3.2.3. CONTROL TESTS ON THE FINISHED\r\nMEDICINAL PRODUCT \nAny exception to the general quality\r\nrequirements shall be duly justified by the applicant. \nIdentification and assay of all the\r\nconstituents that may have a toxicological effect shall be carried out. If it\r\ncan be justified that identification and/or an assay on all the toxicologically\r\nrelevant constituents is not possible e.g. due to their dilution in the\r\nfinished medicinal product the quality shall be demonstrated by complete\r\nvalidation of the manufacturing and dilution process. \n3.2.4. STABILITY TESTS \nThe stability of the finished product shall\r\nbe demonstrated. Stability data from the homeopathic stocks are generally\r\ntransferable to dilutions or potentisations obtained thereof. If no\r\nidentification or assay of the active substance is possible due to the degree\r\nof dilution, stability data of the pharmaceutical form may be considered. \n3.3. SAFETY\nThe requirements on safety set out in Part\r\n1 shall apply to the registration of homeopathic veterinary medicinal products\r\nreferred to in Article 88, without prejudice to the provisions of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 470/2009 for substances included in the homeopathic stocks intended for\r\nadministration to food-producing animal species. \nAny missing information must be justified,\r\ne.g. justification must be given why demonstration of an acceptable level of\r\nsafety can be supported although some studies are lacking. \nANNEX III\nRequirements for abridged and reduced\r\ndossiers for marketing authorisation applications \n1.
