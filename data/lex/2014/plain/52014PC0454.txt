An\r\nanchovy TAC needs to be set around July each year.\nUnder Council Regulation (EC) No 713/2013,\r\nthe Council established the TAC for the fishery exploiting this stock\r\napplicable from 1 July 2013 until 30 June 2014. The TAC and its allocation to\r\nthe Member States concerned must now be fixed for the following 12 months.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nHaving regard to the objectives of the\r\nCommon Fisheries Policy, laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of 11\r\nDecember 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, fishing\r\nopportunities should be established on the basis of the available scientific\r\nadvice and by taking into account the biological and socio-economic aspects\r\nwhilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors. \nFor the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay, scientific advice is based on a fishing season running from 1 July 2014\r\nuntil 30 June 2015. Preliminary advice from the International Council for the\r\nExploration of the Sea (ICES) estimates that the Bay of Biscay anchovy 2014\r\nspawning stock biomass, at the time of spawning, is 66,158 tonnes. \nIn 2009, the Commission presented a\r\nproposal for a Regulation establishing a long-term plan for the stock of\r\nanchovy in the Bay of Biscay and the fisheries exploiting that stock on which\r\nthe proposed TAC is based. It is therefore appropriate to fix a TAC of 20,100\r\ntonnes for the 2014/2015 fishing season corresponding to approximately an 18%\r\nincrease from the previous TAC.\nGiven that the fishing season starts on 1st\r\nJuly 2014, it is appropriate to adopt the TAC as soon as possible.\nFinally,\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 entered into force on 1st January\r\n2013.\u00a0 By virtue of Article 15 thereof, an obligation to land all catches (\u201cthe\r\nlanding obligation\u201d) will be applicable to the anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay as of 1st January 2015, therefore, no rules that have so far\r\nobliged fishermen to discard may apply to this fishery after that date.\n2014/0211 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nestablishing the fishing opportunities for\r\nanchovy in the Bay of Biscay for the 2014/15 fishing season\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[1] requires that\r\nconservation measures be adopted taking into account available scientific,\r\ntechnical and economic advice, including, where relevant, reports drawn up by\r\nthe Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is incumbent upon the\r\nCouncil to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing\r\nopportunities, including certain conditions functionally linked thereto, as\r\nappropriate. Fishing opportunities should be allocated to Member States in\r\nsuch a way as to ensure relative stability of fishing activities of each\r\nMember State for each fish stock or fishery and having due regard to the\r\nobjectives of the Common Fisheries Policy established in Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 1380/2013.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The total allowable catch\r\n(TACs) should be established on the basis of available scientific advice,\r\ntaking into account biological and socio-economic aspects whilst ensuring fair\r\ntreatment between fishing sectors.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary advice from\r\nthe International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) estimates that\r\nthe Bay of Biscay anchovy 2014 spawning stock biomass, at the time of spawning,\r\nis 66,158 tonnes.
