The NASCO is a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation\r\n(RFMO) responsible for the conservation and the management of salmon stocks in\r\nthe North Atlantic Ocean. The European Union became a contracting party to the\r\nNASCO in 1982. \nPursuant to Article 218(9) of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union, the position to be adopted on behalf of the Union in RFMOs such as\r\nwhen they are called upon to adopt acts having legal effects, with the\r\nexception of acts supplementing or amending their institutional framework, must\r\nbe adopted by Council Decision, on a proposal from the Commission.\nSuch position within the RFMO is currently\r\nestablished according to a two tier approach. A Council Decision sets out the\r\nguiding principles and orientations of the Union's position on a multiannual\r\nbasis, whereas it is thereafter adjusted for each annual meeting by Commission\r\nnon-papers to be discussed in the Council Working Party.\nAs regards the NASCO, Council Decision 9930/09\r\nof 28 May 2009, provides for a review of the Union's position before the 2014\r\nannual meeting. Therefore, this proposal aims at setting out the Union's position within the NASCO for the period 2014-2019 and thereby replacing Council\r\nDecision 9930/09 which is covering the period 2009-2014.\nThis revision aims\r\nat incorporating the principles and orientations of the new Common Fisheries\r\nPolicy (CFP) as laid down in Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[2], taking also into account the objectives of the Commission\r\nCommunication on the external dimension of the CFP[3]. Moreover, the Union's position has been adjusted to the Lisbon Treaty. At last, the position has been\r\naligned to the extent possible taking into account the specificities of the\r\ndifferent RFMOs. \nAs it is the case for the current\r\npositions, the following position contains principles and orientations. In\r\naddition, the standard process for the year to year specification of the Union\r\nposition has been incorporated as requested by Member States for positions\r\naligned more recently.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe external dimension of the CFP was part\r\nof the impact assessment for the CFP reform proposals. The principles and\r\norientations agreed for the new CFP are simply being transposed into the\r\nrevised positions. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe following Decision is based on the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\r\n43(2), in conjunction with Article 218(9) which provides that the Council, on a\r\nproposal from the Commission shall adopt a decision establishing the positions\r\nto be adopted on the Union's behalf in a body set up by an agreement, when that\r\nbody is called upon to adopt acts having legal effects. This shall apply to the\r\nposition to be adopted by the Commission, on behalf of the Union, in the NASCO.\r\n\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[4]\r\nis the legal basis setting up the principles to be\r\nreflected in this negotiating mandate. \nThe following Decision shall replace\r\nCouncil Decision 9930/09 which is covering the period 2009-2014, and shall\r\ncover the period 2014-2019. \n2014/0075 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf\r\nof the European Union, in the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation\r\n(NASCO)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 38 of the Treaty\r\non the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article 39\r\nthereof, provides that one of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy is\r\nto assure the availability of supplies. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[5] provides that the Union\r\nshall ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally\r\nsustainable in the long-term and are managed in a way that is consistent with\r\nthe objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits, and of\r\ncontributing to the availability of food supplies. It also provides that the Union shall apply the precautionary approach to fisheries managements, and shall aim to\r\nensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and\r\nmaintains population of harvested species above levels which can produce the\r\nmaximum sustainable yield. It also provides that the Union shall aim to take\r\nmanagement and conservation measures based on best available scientific advice,\r\nto promote fishing methods that contribute to more selective fishing and the\r\navoidance and reduction, as far as possible, of unwanted catches, to fish with\r\nlow impact on marine ecosystem and fishery resources and to gradually eliminate\r\ndiscards. Besides, the regulation specifically provides that these principles\r\nshall be applied by the Union in its external policy. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision (EC) No\r\n886/82[6]\r\nthe European Community approved the Convention for the Conservation of Salmon\r\nin the North Atlantic Ocean (the NASCO Convention), which established the North\r\nAtlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO). Within the NASCO, there are\r\nthree regional commissions which may adopt regulatory measures concerning\r\nsalmon stocks subject to the NASCO Convention. Such measures may become binding\r\nupon the Union.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 218(9)\r\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\r\nthe position to be adopted on behalf of the Union in\r\nRegional Fisheries Management Organisations when they are called upon to adopt\r\nacts having legal effects, with the exception of acts supplementing or amending\r\ntheir institutional framework, must be adopted by Council decision, on a\r\nproposal from the Commission.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the evolving\r\nnature of fishery resources in the NASCO Convention Area and the consequent\r\nneed for the position of the Union to take account of new developments,\r\nincluding new statistical, biological and other information presented before or\r\nduring the annual Meeting of the NASCO, procedures must be established, in line\r\nwith the principle of sincere cooperation among the Union institutions\r\nenshrined in Article 13(2) TEU, for the year-to-year specification of the Union\r\nposition;\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe position to be taken by the European Union in the annual Meeting\r\nof the NASCO when that body is\r\ncalled upon to adopt decisions having legal effects is set out in Annex I to\r\nthis Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe\r\nyear-to-year specification of the Union position to be taken in the annual\r\nMeeting of the NASCO shall be conducted in accordance with Annex II to this\r\nDecision.\nArticle 3\nThe Union position set out in Annex I to the present Decision shall\r\nbe assessed and, where appropriate, revised by the Council upon a proposal from\r\nthe Commission, at the latest for the annual Meeting of the NASCO in 2019.\nArticle 4\nThis Decision replaces Council Decision 9930/09 of 28 May 2009.\nArticle 5\nThis Decision shall enter into force on XXX\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 378, 31.12.1982, p. 24\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council on the Common Fisheries Policy, amending Council\r\nRegulations (EC) No 1954/2003 and (EC) No 1224/2009 and repealing Council\r\nRegulations (EC) No 2371/2002 and (EC) No 639/2004 and Council decision\r\n2004/585/EC (OJ L 354 of 28/12/2013, p.22).\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2011) 424 of 13.7.2011.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council on the Common Fisheries Policy, amending Council\r\nRegulations (EC) No 1954/2003 and (EC) No 1224/2009 and repealing Council\r\nRegulations (EC) No 2371/2002 and (EC) No 639/2004 and Council decision\r\n2004/585/EC (OJ L 354 of 28/12/2013, p.22).\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council on the Common Fisheries Policy, amending Council\r\nRegulations (EC) No 1954/2003 and (EC) No 1224/2009 and repealing Council\r\nRegulations (EC) No 2371/2002 and (EC) No 639/2004 and Council decision\r\n2004/585/EC (OJ L 354 of 28/12/2013, p.22).\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 378, 31.12.1982, p. 24\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
