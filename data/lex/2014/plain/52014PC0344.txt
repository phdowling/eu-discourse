In this context, the Communication refers in particular to the establishment\r\nof a possible regulatory initiative for the production and dissemination of\r\nhigh resolution satellite data for commercial purposes. The Council Conclusions\r\nof 30 May 2013 on the above mentioned Communication recognise the need to\r\nexamine existing legal frameworks with a view to promote the security, safety,\r\nsustainability and economic development of space activities and invite the\r\nCommission to assess the need for the development of a space legislative\r\nframework in the context of ensuring the proper functioning of the internal\r\nmarket.\nIn line with the above, this proposal for a\r\nDirective treats the subject of dissemination of Earth observation satellite\r\ndata within the Union for commercial purposes, and in particular the issue of\r\ndefining and controlling high resolutions satellite data (HRSD), as a distinct\r\ncategory of data requiring a differentiated regulatory regime when it is\r\ndisseminated for commercial purposes. The proposal seeks to secure the proper\r\nfunctioning and development of the internal market for high resolution\r\nsatellite data products and services by establishing a transparent, fair and consistent\r\nlegal framework across Member States. This Directive is necessary, as there are\r\nno express guarantees on the EU legal level that the dissemination of satellite\r\ndata by commercial operators should be free and unrestricted within the Union,\r\nexcept dissemination of data that could be defined as high resolution satellite\r\ndata, which should be controlled due to the higher potential risk that its unauthorized\r\nhandling can entail. Furthermore, there is no common approach on the national\r\nregulatory level for the treatment of high resolution satellite data and for\r\nservices and products deriving from this data. This leads to a fragmented\r\nregulatory framework across Europe, characterised by a lack of coherence,\r\ntransparency and predictability which therefore hinders the market from\r\ndeveloping to its full potential. In addition, as the number of Member States\r\nwith high resolution data capacities is increasing it is likely to aggravate\r\nfurther the problem of fragmentation of the applicable regulatory framework, thus\r\ncreating new barriers on the internal market and greater obstacles to\r\ncompetitiveness.\nTo overcome these problems this proposal will\r\nlead to an approximation of the Member States\u2019 legislation in the domain of the\r\ndissemination satellite data to ensure coherence. It will help to reduce\r\nbureaucratic barriers for the industry and ease the efforts necessary to comply\r\nwith legislative requirements. Business predictability will improve as there\r\nare clearer conditions for the establishment and operation of businesses.\r\nBusiness losses that may arise from the lack of clear and predictable\r\nconditions for data acquisition will be reduced and new business opportunities\r\ncan be realised. There will be significant positive effects for the\r\nestablishment and operation of high resolution satellite data providing\r\nbusinesses and for data sales.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\r\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nOver a period of almost two years, the\r\nCommission has, directly or through external consultants, consulted all\r\ninstitutional actors in the Member States, and a wide range of actors in the\r\nvalue chain involved in space and geospatial activities on issues related to\r\nthis proposal. \nTwo studies commissioned by the Commission\r\nfrom external consultants have analysed the existing regulatory framework\r\nregarding HRSD and were used as input to the Commission\u2019s impact assessment alongside\r\nother sources. The studies identified divergent rules and approaches to the\r\ndissemination of HRSD.\nExperts from Germany and France, the only\r\nMember States, who have enacted specific legislation in this domain for the\r\nregulation of their HRSD technical capabilities so far, provided the Commission\r\nwith details of the dedicated regulatory systems implemented in their countries.\r\nAt the same occasion, they were favourable the idea of a common EU framework. A\r\nworkshop with space legal experts was organised in March 2012 and confirmed that there is a fragmented regulatory framework for\r\nsatellite data across Europe. Between March 2012 and October 2013, the\r\nCommission presented its reflections on HRSD to the Space Policy Expert Group\r\n(SPEG) which is made up of national space experts, a number of times. The\r\nissues and the options for a regulatory intervention were discussed. \nA consultation of stakeholders consisting\r\nof an online questionnaire targeted to data resellers and a public hearing to\r\nsolicit the views of data providers and data resellers was carried out in June\r\nand July 2013. \nThe main conclusions of these consultations\r\ncan be summarised as follows:\n\u2013                        \r\nIndustry representatives and in particular data\r\nresellers confirm that the existing framework for the distribution of satellite\r\ndata and in particular HRSD lacks transparency, predictability and does not\r\nguarantee equal treatment and therefore prevents the market from developing to\r\nits full potential. A large majority consider that action to address this\r\nsituation would improve the business environment. \n\u2013                        \r\nOverall Member States are open to the adoption\r\nof a common EU approach dealing with dissemination of satellite data, providing\r\nexpress guarantees for the free circulation of low resolution one, and in\r\nparticular to ensure an effective and integrated treatment of security and\r\nmarket issues regarding high resolution satellite data. The measures employed should\r\nbe proportionate and ensure the necessary level of security. Member States have\r\nalso stressed that the ultimate responsibility for security related decisions\r\nmust stay with the national authorities.\nThe impact assessment accompanying this\r\nproposal identifies three policy options \u2013 in addition to the baseline scenario\r\n\u2013 that seek to achieve the objectives by setting up a framework for the handling\r\nand dissemination of Earth observation data in the European Union: Option 1 -\r\nBaseline scenario, Option 2 - Recommendations and guidelines, Option 3 - Basic\r\nlegislative instrument and Option 4 - Extended legislative instrument.\nThe problems identified, including a lack\r\nof transparency, predictability and equal treatment stem from the absence of a\r\ncommon definition of high resolution satellite data, framework criteria to\r\ndetermine whether high resolution satellite data should be considered\r\nsensitive, clear authorisation procedures, free circulation guarantees and\r\nclear requirements to become a HRSD data provider. All of these policy options,\r\nexcept the baseline scenario, would seek to address these issues. The\r\ndifference between options 3 and 4 concerns the scope, with option 4 including\r\na licensing element for acquiring a data provider's status that option 3 leaves\r\nto Member States.\nOption 3 is the preferred option combining\r\na good level of economic, strategic and social benefits with a high level of effectiveness\r\nand efficiency, while at the same time leaving as much room as possible for\r\nMember States for controlling the data-providing businesses in their territory.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nSince the initiative foresees harmonization\r\nin order to ensure the proper establishment and functioning of the internal\r\nmarket, the proper legal basis for the directive is Art. 114 TFEU. \nThat treaty provision is applicable in\r\ngeneral to two different types of situations:\n\u2013                        \r\nWhere the legislation contributes to the\r\nelimination of likely obstacles to the exercise of fundamental freedoms;\n\u2013                        \r\nWhere the legislation contributes to the removal\r\nof appreciable distortions of competition which are likely to arise from the\r\ndiverse national rules.\nThe jurisprudence has set the practical\r\nstandard for the scrutiny of the proposals under Art. 114 TFEU specifying that\r\nthe measures promoted must be genuinely intended to improve the conditions for\r\nthe establishment and functioning of the internal market, and could actually\r\nhave that effect.[2]\r\n\nThe present proposal is in line with the\r\nrequirements stemming from the use of Art. 114 TFEU, for the following reasons:\n\u2013                        \r\nFirst, with the express guarantees for the free\r\ncirculation of low resolution satellite data it is clarified that any data falling outside the definition will be considered \"business -\r\nready\", prone for free dissemination without delay enabling the unhindered\r\nbusiness cycles (Article 5);\n\u2013                        \r\nSecond, with the establishment of common\r\ntechnical parameters of HRSD (Article 4) it will be possible to set up a common\r\nscope of application of the advanced legal regime and to delimit the internal\r\nmarket of HRSD, as a specific component of the Earth Observation market. Further,\r\nthe clarification as to which kind or quality of satellite data could possibly\r\nharm security interests; and which therefore needs to be disseminated with\r\nrespect to certain conditions, allows the setting of the most appropriate\r\nprocedural requirements to safeguard the public;\n\u2013                        \r\nThird, by enhancing the coherence, transparency\r\nand predictability of the regulatory framework this directive aims to\r\nremove/prevent obstacles of national jurisdictional nature to the free\r\ncirculation of HRSD within the Union, in accordance with the screening, or\r\nauthorisation modalities. It is foreseen that the dissemination of HRSD\r\napproved\r\nin accordance with this directive cannot be reassessed,\r\nimpeded or restricted subsequently, as long as the dissemination is in\r\ncompliance with the screening or authorisation conducted (Article 6(3));\n\u2013                        \r\nFourth, aiming at positive integration, the\r\npresent proposal provides for the basic procedures for the dissemination of\r\nHRSD, promoting the equal and non-discriminatory treatment of all EU data\r\nresellers by data providers, preventing likely distortions of competition, and\r\nadditionally enhancing the market opportunities available in the domain of the\r\nHRSD (Article 7 and Article 8).\nThe regulatory approach chosen for the\r\nproposal is that of partial harmonization. It confirms the principle of free\r\ncirculation for satellite data with low resolution, but targets only a limited\r\nnumber of key regulatory elements of the national HRSD legislations which are\r\nsufficiently well elaborated to allow for alignment. \nTherefore the intended approximation of\r\nlaws is limited, respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality\r\n(Art. 5(3) and (4) TEU).\nMore\r\nspecifically, \n\u2013                        \r\nIn terms of subsidiarity, the proposal\r\nestablishes the Union dimension by a common approach towards satellite data\r\ndissemination within the Union, and a distinction between low resolution and\r\nhigh resolution satellite data, on the basis of the proposed technical definitions.\r\nThe proposal establishes as well a common, transaction- and metadata-based\r\napproach for the assessment of the dissemination of high resolution satellite\r\ndata and transparent procedures, while leaving all the unregulated issues to\r\nthe national MSs to settle in accordance with national regulatory traditions\r\n(like licensing and control of data providers for example);\n\u2013                        \r\nIn terms of proportionality \u2013 through the\r\ncareful selection of the regulatory elements to be aligned, the proposal\r\nensures that the Union action will be proportionate to the problems identified,\r\nand that the measures prescribed are in fact the most suitable for the\r\nachievement of the objectives laid down in Article 1 of the proposed Directive.\nTaking into account the fact that, for a\r\nnumber of operational issues the national legislation is adequate and that, at\r\nthe same time legitimate security interests of the Member States can allow for\r\nsome divergence in the national legislation, it has been reasoned that a\r\nregulation, completely replacing the existing national legislation with an\r\nall-encompassing Union regime is neither justified nor desired by the Member\r\nStates. \nConsequently, a directive would guarantee\r\nthe required legislative flexibility to limit the regulatory action to the\r\nharmonisation of only the most relevant and sufficiently articulated core\r\nregulatory elements of the regime for commercialization of the Earth\r\nobservation satellite data.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\r\nIMPLICATION\nThe\r\nproposal does not have implications on the operational budget. The enclosed\r\nFinancial Statement indicates the specific budgetary impact.\n2014/0176 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the dissemination of Earth observation\r\nsatellite data for commercial purposes\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[3],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission\r\nCommunication of 28 February 2013 \u2018EU Space Industrial Policy - Releasing\r\nthe potential for economic growth in the space sector\u2019[4] identifies as one of\r\nthe objectives for an EU space industrial policy the establishment of a\r\ncoherent regulatory framework in order to improve legal coherence and foster\r\nthe emergence of a Union market for space products and services. In this\r\ncontext, the Communication refers in particular to the establishment of a possible\r\nregulatory initiative for the production and dissemination of high resolution\r\nsatellite data for commercial purposes. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council Conclusions of\r\n30 May 2013 on the Communication on the EU Space Industrial Policy recognise\r\nthe need to examine existing legal frameworks with a view to ensuring the\r\nsecurity, safety, sustainability and economic development of space activities\r\nand welcomed the Commission\u2019s intention to assess the need for the development\r\nof a space legislative framework in the context of ensuring the proper\r\nfunctioning of the internal market, while respecting the principle of\r\nsubsidiarity.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission Delegated\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1159/2013[5]\r\nallows for this Directive to exclude GMES and Copernicus dedicated data from\r\nits scope.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The dissemination of high\r\nresolution satellite data by commercial operators has until now been regulated individually\r\nby the Member States where they are registered.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There has been no common\r\napproach at the national regulatory level for the treatment of high resolution\r\nsatellite data and for services and products deriving from these data. This\r\nleads to a fragmented regulatory framework across the Union, characterised by a\r\nlack of coherence, transparency and predictability, which was therefore preventing\r\nthe market from developing to its full potential.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The number of Member\r\nStates with high resolution satellite data capabilities is increasing, and national\r\nregulatory frameworks become more and more diverged. As a consequence, the\r\nfragmentation of the regulatory framework creates new barriers for the internal\r\nmarket and greater obstacles to competitiveness.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To overcome those problems,\r\nthis Directive should ensure the proper functioning and development of the\r\ninternal market for high resolution satellite data and derivative products and\r\nservices by establishing a transparent, fair and consistent legal framework\r\nacross the Union. The approximation of the Member States\u2019 legislation in the field\r\nof dissemination of high resolution satellite data to ensure coherence as\r\nregards of the procedures to control its dissemination should reduce\r\nbureaucratic barriers for industry and ease the compliance with legislative\r\nrequirements. This Directive will enhance business predictability as there would\r\nbe clearer conditions for the establishment and operation of businesses. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A functioning internal\r\nmarket for high resolution satellite data and derivative products and services would\r\nfoster the development of a competitive Union space and services industry,\r\nmaximise opportunities for Union enterprises to develop and provide innovative earth\r\nobservation systems and services, and promote the use of high resolution\r\nsatellite data. Therefore, a common Union standard for high resolution\r\nsatellite data is needed, which also reflects the risks from the inadvertent\r\nrelease of high resolution satellite data.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to introduce a\r\ncommon Union standard for high resolution satellite data a definition of high\r\nresolution satellite data should be provided for which is based on the\r\ntechnical capabilities of the Earth observation system, of its sensors and of\r\nthe sensor modes which are used to generate the Earth observation data. The\r\ntechnical capabilities of the Earth observation system, its sensors and sensor\r\nmodes that should be taken into account, are the spectral resolution, the\r\nspectral coverage, the spatial resolution, the radiometric resolution, the temporal\r\nresolution and the positional accuracy. The definition should be based on the\r\navailability of similar Earth observation data on the global markets and should\r\nbe based on the potential prejudice to the interests, including internal and\r\nexternal security interests, of the Union or of the Member States which can\r\nderive from the dissemination of the Earth observation data. This definition also\r\nallows the identification of Earth observation satellite data other than high\r\nresolution data and is the basis for guaranteeing the free circulation for this\r\ndata based on the fact that they do not have the potential to cause prejudice to\r\nthe afore-mentioned interests.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The possibility to assess\r\nall relevant variables in the dissemination of high resolution satellite data should\r\nallow for a precise assessment which promotes the use of high resolution\r\nsatellite data and thus creates maximum commercial advantages for the\r\nbusinesses involved. An assessment of the dissemination is more efficient in\r\nterms of security than an assessment based only on the high resolution\r\nsatellite data itself.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The screening of high\r\nresolution satellite data at its first entry on the market in a dedicated\r\nscreening procedure should guarantee the promotion of the use of high\r\nresolution satellite data and the strengthening of Earth observation markets in\r\nthe Union while preventing prejudice to the interests of the Union or of one or\r\nmore Member States. The criteria for the screening procedure should take into\r\naccount all relevant factors of the dissemination of high resolution satellite\r\ndata in order to ensure that the Member States can set up the most appropriate\r\nconditions by the specification of those criteria and by combining the\r\nresulting standards within the most suitable procedure. The criteria should describe\r\nthe metadata of the envisaged dissemination, which ensures, that the screening\r\ncan be done without assessing the high resolution satellite data itself and\r\ntherefore can be done prior to the generation and the dissemination of the data.\r\nIn particular through its transparency and its capacity to deliver clear\r\nresults allowing a fast and automatic implementation, thereby making it an\r\nefficient filtering system, the screening procedure should foster the\r\ncommercial use of the high resolution satellite data and the businesses\r\ninvolved.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\r\nbusiness and administrative needs can be met the most effective and efficient\r\nway, Member States may allow for the screening procedure to be carried out by\r\nthe data provider himself or by any other appropriate private entity.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While certain criteria and\r\noperational rules for the screening procedure should render possible\r\ndissemination of high resolution satellite data in the vast majority of cases,\r\nthere would still be a need for an authorisation procedure which should, on a\r\ncase-by-case basis, carry out an in-depth assessment considering all\r\ncircumstances of the individual case, in order to foster the dissemination of\r\nhigh resolution satellite data. This Directive lists the interests, on which a\r\nrefusal might be based.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the\r\nadministrative procedures established in the Member States to comply with this\r\nDirective and in particular in view of the authorisation procedure Member\r\nStates should respect the administrative due process.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure free circulation\r\nof high resolution satellite data which was generated from Earth observation\r\nsystems operated from third countries this Directive provides conditions under\r\nwhich Member States should not prohibit, restrict or impede free circulation of\r\nthat data.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to keep up with\r\ntechnological developments and the availability on the global markets of high\r\nresolution satellite data there is provision on the regular review of this\r\nDirective.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow the\r\nCommission to monitor the implementation process, Member States should be\r\nrequired to provide the Commission with the necessary information to assess the\r\nevolution of the Union market of high resolution satellite data. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive does neither\r\naffect the competence of Member States in the field of foreign policy and\r\nnational security, nor should it be interpreted in a way as to prevent Member\r\nStates from exercising their competence in this field and from taking into\r\naccount the security and foreign policy interests of the Union.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of this\r\nDirective should be without prejudice to the application of the general rules\r\non contractual law, and any other relevant law in other areas including\r\ncompetition law, intellectual or industrial property rights, confidentiality,\r\ntrade secrets, privacy and consumer rights.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2006/123/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[6]\r\nshould apply to the service of the dissemination of high resolution Earth\r\nobservation satellite data for commercial purposes. In the event of a conflict\r\nbetween a provision of Directive 2006/123/EC and this Directive, the provisions\r\nof this Directive shall prevail.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should not\r\napply to any service provided between the satellite operator and the data\r\nprovider that enables the latter to have access to high resolution satellite\r\ndata. As far as the data provider provides a service to Earth observation\r\nsystem, the award of the respective contract to the data provider has to comply\r\nwith applicable public procurement legislation.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union legislation\r\nconcerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of\r\npersonal data and on the free movement of such data, in particular Directive\r\n95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[7] and Regulation (EC) No\r\n45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council[8] of 18 December 2000 on\r\nthe protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by\r\nthe Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data are\r\napplicable.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nDirective, namely the ensuring of the functioning of the internal market of\r\nEarth observation data, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States,\r\nas evidenced by the divergences and fragmentation of the existing national\r\nregulation, but can rather, by reason of reducing bureaucratic barriers and improving\r\nconditions for businesses, be better achieved at Union level, it is\r\nproportionate to adopt Union level measures in accordance with the principle of\r\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In\r\naccordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article,\r\nthis Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that\r\nobjective.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nJoint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September\r\n2011 on explanatory documents[9],\r\nMember States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the\r\nnotification of their transposition measures with one or more documents\r\nexplaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the\r\ncorresponding parts of national transposition instruments.
