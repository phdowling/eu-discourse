Germany has requested the reduction to be\r\ngranted for six years.\nWith the requested measure Germany wants to\r\ncontinue to provide an incentive for the use of shore-side electricity which is\r\nconsidered a less polluting alternative to the generation of electricity on\r\nboard of vessels lying at berth in a port. If the measure is not authorised shore-side\r\nelectricity will have to be taxed at the general national rate of the\r\nelectricity tax, which is EUR 20.50 per MWh. \nOn the other hand, Article 14(1)(c) of the\r\nEnergy Taxation Directive obliges Member States to exempt energy products used\r\nas fuel by ships for navigation within EU waters. This exemption covers also\r\nthe energy products used to produce electricity on board ships at berth in\r\nports. Member States may also exempt energy products used by ships for\r\nnavigation on inland waterways according to Article 15(1)(f) thereof which also\r\ncovers the production of electricity on board. Thus in most cases the system of\r\ntaxation based on the Energy Taxation Directive does not affect the costs for\r\nproducing electricity on board a ship at berth in a port even though such\r\nproduction could have negative health and environmental effects by\r\ndeteriorating air quality and increasing noise levels in ports.\nGermany would like\r\nto continue to apply a reduced rate of EUR 0,50 per MWh to shore-side\r\nelectricity, thereby respecting the minimum rate of taxation for electricity as\r\nlaid down in Directive 2003/96/EC. The reduced rate of electricity taxation is\r\nto apply to all supplies of shore-side electricity in both EU waters as well as\r\ninland waterways, with the exception of private pleasure crafts. According to\r\nthe calculations of the German authorities for the three-year period of\r\napplication of the measure, the average annual tax expenditure was\r\napproximately EUR 2.2 million. According to the Federal Government\r\nestimates, during the next six years this hypothetical budgetary expenditure\r\ncan be expected to gradually increase to EUR 3\u20114 million per\r\nyear.\nWith the tax reduction Germany wants to continue to provide an incentive for vessel operators to use shore-side\r\nelectricity in order to reduce pollution from airborne emissions and noise from\r\nvessels at berth as well as CO2 emissions. The application of a\r\nreduced tax rate would strengthen the competitiveness of shore-side electricity\r\nrelative to the burning of bunker fuels on board, which is fully tax exempt.\nThe German authorities informed the\r\nCommission that at present of all German sea ports, only the port of L\u00fcbeck has facilities to provide shore-side electricity of higher electrical load. Besides\r\non-shore facilities, the port provides also \u2018power barges\u2019, i.e. floating\r\ninstallations for combined heat and power generation running on liquefied\r\nnatural gas. The building of static shore-side electricity supply facilities in\r\nthe port of Hamburg is planned for May 2014 and it includes equipping two\r\ncruise ship terminals with shore-side electricity facilities at the Altona\r\nterminal. There are also plans for providing power barges for the HafenCity\r\nterminal.\nAs regards inland ports, shore-side\r\nelectricity facilities are more widespread and there are plans for further\r\ndevelopment.\nGermany considers that this measure is in\r\nline with Commission Recommendation 2006/339/EC ([3]) on the promotion of\r\nshore-side electricity for use by ships at berth in EU ports and with the\r\nCommission Communication Strategic goals and recommendations for the EU's\r\nmaritime transport policy until 2018 ([4]).\r\nIn this regard, it is noted that from June 2011 on, Member States have an\r\nunconditional obligation to meet air quality standards for relevant pollutants\r\nlike particulate matter ([5]).\r\nThis requires Member States to find solutions to problems such as ship\r\nemissions at berth in ports where this is relevant and it is conceivable that\r\nin ports where these problems exist, the use of shore-side electricity will be\r\nencouraged as one element of an overall air quality strategy.\nArguments of the German authorities\r\nconcerning the impact of the measure on the internal market\nThe German authorities claim that the\r\nmeasure would not affect the proper functioning of the internal market and\r\nwould not lead to a distortion of competition. Germany allows the tax advantage\r\nto be provided both as a reduced tax rate charged at supply and as a tax\r\nrefund. In case of application of the reduction at supply, the electricity\r\nprovider might not pass on or pass on only part of the tax advantage to the\r\nfinal consumer, i.e. the ship operator. Still according to the German\r\nauthorities the tax advantage is normally passed on. But even in the cases\r\nwhere the tax reduction is fully passed on to the ship operators which receive\r\nshore-side electricity taxed at the minimum level provided for in Directive\r\n2003/96/EC, they do not actually gain an economic advantage over operators\r\ngenerating their own electricity on board because this electricity is exempted\r\nfrom taxation. According to the German authorities substitution of own\r\ngeneration on board by shore-side electricity taxed at the applicable minimum\r\nlevel would not lead to an overall cost advantage.\nThe German authorities informed the\r\nCommission that at this juncture they do not have figures on the number of ship\r\noperators using shore-side electricity facilities and cannot provide a full\r\nassessment of the trend of shore-side electricity use due to the short period\r\nof application of the measure. On the basis of the available information they\r\nconsider that there was a considerable increase in the use of shore-side\r\nelectricity in particular for vessels at berth in ports situated on the inland\r\nwaterways.\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nCouncil Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October\r\n2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products\r\nand electricity, in particular Articles 14(1)(c) and 15(1)(f).\nAssessment of the measure under\r\nArticle 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\nSpecific policy considerations\nArticle 19(1), first subparagraph, of the\r\nDirective reads as follows:\n\u2018In addition\r\nto the provisions set out in the previous Articles, in particular in Articles\r\n5, 15 and 17, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the\r\nCommission, may authorise any Member State to introduce further exemptions or\r\nreductions for specific policy considerations.\u2019\nBy means of the tax reduction in question\r\nthe German authorities pursue the objective to continue to promote an\r\nenvironmentally less harmful way for ships to satisfy their electricity needs\r\nwhile lying at berth in ports and thereby to improve local air quality. As\r\nGermany has pointed out, the Commission has in fact already recommended the use\r\nof shore-side electricity as an alternative to the generation of electricity on\r\nboard the vessels at berth and thereby recognised its environmental advantages ([6]).Without the measure electricity\r\nsupplied to vessels at berth will have to be taxed at EUR 20.50 per MWh in\r\nGermany. The requested reduction represents an additional incentive for the use\r\nof this technology equal to EUR 20 per MWh and therefore contributes to\r\nthe stated policy objective.\nThe Commission also notes that an important\r\nobstacle to a more widespread use of shore-side electricity is currently the\r\nalmost total absence of the necessary onshore infrastructure in ports and that\r\ntherefore additional initiatives addressing in particular the built-up of this\r\ninfrastructure are likely to be necessary to achieve the policy objective of\r\nthe tax exemption in question. According to the information provided by the\r\nGerman authorities, sea-going vessels demand facilities capable of supporting\r\nhigh electrical loads and at present only the port of L\u00fcbeck provides such\r\nfacilities. There are plans to construct facilities in the port of Hamburg. Shore-side electricity facilities are available in higher numbers at the\r\ninland waterway ports where vessels normally have smaller electrical load\r\nrequirements.\nAs regards the nature of the policy\r\nobjective pursued the Commission would point out that the promotion of\r\nshore-side electricity is in fact a common policy objective that should be\r\npursued by the Union as a whole. This is stated clearly in the Commission\r\nCommunication \u2013 An integrated maritime policy for the European Union ([7]) and the accompanying\r\nCommission staff working document ([8]).\r\nThe measure is in line with the Commission proposal for a directive on the\r\ndeployment of alternative fuels infrastructure which addresses the issue of\r\ninstalling shore-side electricity supply facilities in ports where this is\r\ncost-effective and presents environmental benefits ([9]).\nThe Commission suggested shore-side\r\nelectricity provided to ships while at berth in port to be exempted from energy\r\ntaxation in its proposal for revision of the Energy Taxation Directive ([10]).However the\r\nCommission proposal has not been adopted yet by the Council. In the meantime\r\neconomic operators in Germany and the German authorities should be provided\r\nwith legal certainty as regards the tax measures applied for the purpose of\r\npromoting the use of shore-side electricity. Currently the only possibility to\r\nintroduce a favourable tax treatment to shore-side electricity is provided by\r\nArticle 19. However its purpose is to react to specific circumstances in individual\r\nMember States that are not reflected in the Directive itself. A derogation on\r\nthe basis of Article 19 which pursues the policy objective of promoting\r\nshore-side electricity can therefore only be granted as a transitional measure\r\nbefore this objective has been addressed by the Council in the context of a\r\nrevision of Directive 2003/96/EC.\nConsistency with the other policies\r\nand objectives of the Union\nThe requested measure concerns mainly the\r\nEU's environmental policy. To the extent that it will help to reduce the\r\nburning of bunker fuels on board the vessels in ports the measure will in fact\r\ncontribute to the objective of improving local air quality. The measure might\r\nalso, to a limited extent, lead to a reduction of CO2 emissions,\r\nalthough the significance of this effect will depend on the source of the\r\nelectricity to be provided to the vessels ([11]). To indicate the\r\nscale of the environmental problem, Germany gives the example of the port of\r\nL\u00fcbeck-Travem\u00fcnde where ships account for 90 % of sulphur dioxide and\r\naround 80 % of nitrogen oxide emissions. The German authorities provide the\r\nfollowing comparison, based on annual electricity consumption of\r\n5 584 MWh, between the estimated annual emissions resulting from the use\r\nof shore-side electricity in the port of L\u00fcbeck and those from the use of\r\nmarine gas oil, meeting sulphur content limits set in the EU Sulphur Directive ([12]), used to generate\r\nelectricity on-board:\n   || NOx || SO2 || CO2 \n Green electricity from hydropower || 0.078 t || 0.056 t || 0 t \n Marine gas oil || 3.571 t || 6.026 t || 4251.9 t \nEstimates provided by the Hamburg port\r\nauthorities indicate that the planned shore-side electricity facilities should\r\nreduce on an annual basis emissions compared to the use of marine gas oil at the\r\nAltona terminal by about 39 t or by 74 % for NOx, about 1.1 t or\r\n62 % for SO2 and about 0.5 t or 5 % for fine\r\nparticulate matter. Running these facilities with the normal German electricity\r\nmix should result in a reduction in CO2 of approximately 1 050 t\r\nor 19 % per year. The planned supply of electricity from renewable sources\r\ncould lead to a much bigger reduction of CO2 emissions of 3 354 t\r\nper year, depending on the performance of the electricity generation\r\nfacilities. The reduction in air pollutant emissions through the use of power\r\nbarges running on liquefied natural gas supplying electricity for cruise liners\r\nat the HafenCity terminal should result in a reduction of 51 t or 73 %\r\nfor NOx emissions. After deducting 5 t of annual NOx emissions from the\r\nbarges the result in total is emission reduction of 46 t per year.\r\nEmissions should be reduced by 1.5 t or 58 % for SOx and 0.7 t\r\nor 48 % per year for fine particulate matter with no additional emissions from\r\nthe power barges. CO2 emissions should be reduced by 1 824 t\r\nor 26 % per year if liquefied natural gas were used instead of marine gas\r\noil. Residual emissions from the auxiliary boiler (for on-board heat) have been\r\ntaken into account in the estimations.\nIt has to be recalled at this point that\r\none important reason for the unfavourable competitive position of shore-side\r\nelectricity lies in the fact that the alternative, i.e. electricity produced on\r\nboard the vessels while in maritime ports, currently enjoys a full net tax\r\nexemption: not only is the bunker fuel burnt for generating the electricity exempted\r\nfrom taxation, which corresponds to the normal position under Article 14(1)(a)\r\nof Directive 2003/96/EC, but also the electricity produced on board the vessels\r\nis itself exempted (cf. Article 14(1)(c) of Directive 2003/96/EC). Although the\r\nlatter exemption could as such be considered difficult to reconcile with the\r\nenvironmental objectives of the Union, it mirrors considerations of\r\npracticability. In fact, taxation of the electricity produced on board would\r\nrequire a declaration by the ship owner - often established in a third country\r\n- or operator of the amount of electricity consumed. The declaration would\r\nfurthermore have to determine the share of the electricity consumed in the\r\nterritorial waters of the Member State where the tax is due. It would create a\r\nhuge administrative burden for ship-owners to have to make such declarations\r\nfor every Member States whose territorial waters are concerned. Under these\r\ncircumstances it can be justified not to penalize the less-polluting\r\nalternative of shore-side electricity by allowing Germany to apply a reduced\r\nrate of taxation.\nAs regards electricity consumed by vessels\r\nat berth in ports along inland waterways, and contrary to the situation\r\nobtaining in maritime ports, exemption of the electricity produced on board is\r\nmerely optional for Member States (Article 15(1)(f)). Therefore, no legal\r\nobstacle would prevent Member States from treating equally shore-side\r\nelectricity and on-board generation in ports along inland waterways. However,\r\nthe option offered by Article 15(1)(f) of the Directive not to tax electricity\r\ngenerated on board is again to be explained by considerations of practicability\r\non the part of the legislator and at the same time closely linked to the\r\noptional tax advantages for the purposes of navigation on inland waterways. The\r\nmajority of Member States, among which Germany, have decided not to tax fuels\r\nused for these purposes. As far as the Rhine and its tributaries are concerned,\r\nthis tax exemption is furthermore enshrined in an international agreement ([13]), which Germany has ratified. It is also considered impractical to tax separately the input fuel\r\nused for the generation of electricity on board ([14]) because this would\r\npresuppose, at the very least, a distinction between the fuel used for the\r\ngeneration of electricity and for navigation. Finally, in deciding whether to\r\nextend the tax exemption applicable to maritime shipping to fuels used for\r\nnavigation on inland waterways, Member States will take into consideration a\r\nnumber of aspects, including wider objectives of national transport policy such\r\nas environmental considerations, which may lead them not to tax fuels used for\r\nthese purposes.\nIt is therefore considered justified, at\r\nthe present stage, to keep the possibility for Germany to exempt shore-side\r\nelectricity to ports in inland waterways.\nInternal market and fair competition\nFrom the point of view of the internal\r\nmarket and fair competition the measure requested would reduce the existing\r\ndistortion between two competing sources of electricity for boats at berth,\r\ni.e. on board generation and shore-side electricity, caused by the tax\r\nexemption for bunker fuels.\nAs regards competition between vessel\r\noperators, it first has to be reiterated that according to the information\r\navailable to the Commission there are currently very few vessels which use\r\nshore-side electricity on a commercial basis. Second, even if the measure will\r\nprovide shipping companies with an advantage in the sense that they will be\r\nable to purchase electricity at lower costs compared to companies operating in\r\nother sectors, the examined measure is not expected to alter significantly the\r\ncompetitive situation within the shipping sector. Although precise cost\r\nprojections depend crucially on the development of the oil price and are therefore\r\nvery difficult, the available information ([15]) and the data provided\r\nby Germany indicate that overall even a full tax exemption would in most cases\r\nnot reduce operational costs of shore-side electricity below the costs of\r\non-board generation and would therefore not, in any event, represent a\r\nsignificant competitive benefit on vessel operators using shore-side\r\nelectricity as opposed to those using on-board generation. In the present case,\r\na significant distortion of the above mentioned kind can all the less be\r\nexpected since Germany will respect the minimum level of taxation prescribed by\r\nDirective 2003/96/EC.\nConcerning competition between ports, in a\r\nsituation where, as stated above, the use of shore-side electricity is, at\r\nleast in the short term, unlikely to become more economically feasible than\r\non-board generation in spite of the tax reduction, this tax reduction for\r\nshore-side electricity is also unlikely to significantly distort competition\r\nbetween ports by inducing vessels to change their itinerary according to the\r\navailability of this option. The German authorities stress that the use of\r\nshore-side electricity is restricted not only due to the lack of port\r\nfacilities or the higher costs but also because of lack of internationally\r\nagreed technical standards for connecting vessels to the electricity grid.\nFinally, it can be added that the timeframe\r\nfor which it is proposed to authorize the application of a reduced tax rate reflects\r\nto a large extent the timeframe in the Commission proposal of eight years for\r\nthe tax exemption for shore-side electricity. \u00a0\nPeriod of application of the measure\r\nand development of the EU framework on energy taxation\nIn principle, the period of application of\r\nthe derogation should be long enough in order not to discourage port operators\r\nfrom making the necessary investments. In this particular case the period of\r\napplication of the measure would have been prolonged and the scale of the tax\r\nreduction increased by the Commission proposal for revision of the Energy\r\nTaxation Directive which envisages an obligatory exemption for shore-side\r\nelectricity for a period of eight years after its entry into effect. Still the\r\nderogation should not undermine future developments of the existing legal\r\nframework and should take into account the possible adoption by the Council of\r\na legal act based on the Commission proposal for amendment of the Energy\r\nTaxation Directive. Under these circumstances, it appears appropriate to grant\r\nthe authorisation requested for the maximum period of six years allowed by the\r\nDirective, subject however to the entry into application of general provisions\r\nin the matter, at a point in time earlier than the expiry thus foreseen. This\r\nperiod of time will provide legal certainty to ship and port operators which\r\nhave to plan their investments in shore-side electricity facilities or on-board\r\nequipment. It will also allow the German authorities to collect more data for a\r\nfuture reassessment of the measure.\nState aid rules\nThe tax rate of EUR 0.50 per MWh\r\nenvisaged by the German authorities respects the minimum level of taxation\r\npursuant to Article 10 of Directive 2003/96/EC. The\r\nmeasure thus fulfils one of the conditions laid down in Article 44 of\r\nCommission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 ([16]),\r\nwhich stipulates the conditions under which such a measure is exempted from the\r\nState aid notification requirements. However it cannot be established at this\r\nstage whether all the conditions set in the Regulation are fulfilled and the\r\nproposal for a Council Implementing Decision does not prevent the Commission\r\nfrom requiring from Germany to comply with State aid rules.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nThis proposal is based on a request made by\r\n Germany and concerns only this Member State.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThis proposal concerns an authorisation for\r\nan individual Member State upon its own request.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe field of indirect taxation covered by\r\nArticle 113 TFEU is not in itself within the exclusive competence of the\r\nEuropean Union within the meaning of Article 3 TFEU.\nHowever, the exercise by Member States of\r\ntheir competences in this field is strictly circumscribed and limited by\r\nexisting EU law. Pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC, only the\r\nCouncil is empowered to authorise a Member State to introduce further\r\nexemptions or reductions within the meaning of that provision. Member States\r\ncannot substitute themselves for the Council.\nThe proposal therefore respects the\r\nprinciple of subsidiarity.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal respects the principle of\r\nproportionality. The tax reduction does not exceed what is necessary to attain\r\nthe objective in question (cf. the considerations on the Internal market and\r\nfair competition aspects, above).\nChoice of instruments\nInstrument(s) proposed: Council Decision.\nArticle 19 of Directive 2003/96 makes\r\nprovision for this type of measure only.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe measure does not impose any financial\r\nor administrative burden on the Union. The proposal therefore has no impact on\r\nthe budget of the Union.\n2014/0247 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nauthorising Germany to apply a reduced\r\nrate of taxation on electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port\r\nin accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive\r\n2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the\r\ntaxation of energy products and electricity ([17]), and in particular\r\nArticle 19 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Implementing Decision\r\n2011/445/EU Germany was authorised to apply a reduced rate of taxation to electricity\r\ndirectly provided to vessels at berth in a port (\u2018shore-side electricity\u2019) in\r\naccordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC until 16 July 2014.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter dated 26\r\nFebruary 2014, Germany sought the authorisation to continue to apply a reduced\r\nrate of electricity tax to shore-side electricity pursuant to Article 19 of\r\nDirective 2003/96/EC.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the tax reduction it\r\nintends to apply, Germany aims at continuing the promotion of a more widespread\r\nuse of shore-side electricity as an environmentally less harmful way for ships\r\nto satisfy their electricity needs while lying at berth in ports as compared to\r\nthe burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as the use of\r\nshore-side electricity avoids emissions of air pollutants associated with the\r\nburning of bunker fuels on board the vessels at berth, it contributes to an\r\nimprovement of local air quality in port cities. The measure is therefore\r\nexpected to contribute to the environmental, health and climate policy\r\nobjectives of the Union.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allowing Germany to apply a reduced rate of electricity taxation to shore-side electricity does not go beyond\r\nwhat is necessary to increase the use of shore-side electricity, since on-board\r\ngeneration will remain the more competitive alternative in most cases. For the\r\nsame reason, and because of the current relatively low degree of market\r\npenetration of the technology, the measure is unlikely to lead to significant\r\ndistortions in competition during its lifetime and will thus not negatively\r\naffect the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from Article\r\n19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC that each authorisation granted under that\r\nprovision must be strictly limited in time. Given the need for a period long\r\nenough to allow for the proper evaluation of the measure, but also the need not\r\nto undermine future developments of the existing legal framework, it is\r\nappropriate to grant the authorisation requested for a period of six years,\r\nsubject however to the entry into application of general provisions in the\r\nmatter, at a point in time earlier than the expiry thus foreseen.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to provide legal\r\ncertainty to port and ship operators and to avoid a potential increase in the\r\nadministrative burden for the distributors and redistributors of electricity\r\nwhich could result from changes to the rate of excise duty levied on shore-side\r\nelectricity, it should be ensured that Germany can apply the existing specific\r\ntax reduction to which this Decision relates without interruption. The\r\nauthorisation requested should therefore be granted with effect from 17 July\r\n2014, following seamlessly on from the prior arrangements under Council\r\nImplementing Decision 2011/445/EU.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This decision is without\r\nprejudice to the application of the Union rules regarding State aid,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nGermany is hereby authorised to apply a\r\nreduced rate of electricity taxation to electricity directly supplied to\r\nvessels, other than private pleasure craft, berthed in ports (\u2018shore-side\r\nelectricity\u2019), provided that the minimum levels of taxation pursuant to Article\r\n10 of Directive 2003/96/EC are respected.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall take effect on the day\r\nof its notification.\nIt shall apply from 17 July 2014.\nIt shall expire on 16 July 2020.\nHowever, should the Council, acting on the\r\nbasis of Article 113 TFEU, provide for general rules on tax advantages for\r\nshore-side electricity, this Decision shall cease to apply on the day on which\r\nthose general rules become applicable.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Federal\r\nRepublic of Germany.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n([1])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nDirective 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework\r\nfor the taxation of energy products and electricity (OJ L 283, 31.10.2003, p.\r\n51).\n([2])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ\r\nL 191, 22.07.2011, p. 22.\n([3])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission\r\nRecommendation 2006/339/EC of 8 May 2006 on the promotion of shore-side electricity\r\nfor use by ships at berth in Community ports (OJ L 125, 12.5.2006).\n([4])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2009)\r\n8 final of 21 January 2009.\n([5])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cf.\r\nDirective 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May\r\n2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (OJ L 152 of 11.6.2008).\n([6])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cf.\r\nnote 3 above.\n([7])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2007)\r\n575 final of 10 October 2007.\n([8])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SEC(2007)\r\n1278 final of 10 October 2007.\n([9])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2013)\r\n18 final of 24 January 2013.\n([10])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2011)\r\n169 final of 13 April 2011.\n([11])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At\r\nan earlier occasion, the Commission has estimated that switching to shore-side\r\nelectricity will lead to an average reduction in CO2 emissions of 50 %,\r\ncf. footnote 2.
