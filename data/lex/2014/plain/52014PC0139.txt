This would enable Seychelles flagged vessels to continue to have\r\naccess to Mayotte waters from 1 January 2014.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nSeychelles flagged vessels can currently fish in Mayotte waters on the basis\r\nof an agreement between the Prefet de Mayotte and the Seychelles flagged vessels owners. To date an average of 8 Seychelles purse-seine vessels\r\nhave operated in Mayotte waters under the private agreement, which foresees the\r\nvessels paying a licence fee directly to Mayotte. \u00a0\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThis agreement is of\r\nstrategic importance for the Seychelles fleet given the migratory nature of the\r\ntuna resource. It will also further underline and strengthen our relationship\r\nwith the Seychelles. This Agreement supplements and mirrors the existing\r\nAgreement that we have for EU vessels to have access to resources in Seychelles' waters, thereby reinforcing the political signal being given to the Seychelles as our most important partner in the region.\nThe Commission proposes, on this basis,\r\nthat the Council, with the consent of the Parliament, adopt by Decision the\r\nconclusion of this Agreement.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe European Council\r\nadopted on 11 July 2012, a Decision amending the status of Mayotte so that it\r\ncan become an outermost region on 1 January 2014 (OJ L 204 of 31.7.2012),\r\nrather than holding the current status of overseas country or territory. As a\r\nconsequence, the current EEZ of Mayotte will as of 1 January 2014, become EU\r\nwaters.\nA mandate for the\r\nCommission to undertake these negotiations was agreed on 14 October and\r\nnegotiations were held with the Seychelles shortly following this and concluded\r\non 15 November 2013.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nAs this is in relation to access of fishing\r\nvessels flying the flag of the Seychelles to waters falling under EU\r\njurisdiction, there are no financial implications by way of expenditure on the\r\nEU budget. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nThis agreement foresees access to a limited\r\nnumber of vessels for a period of six years to the Mayotte waters which will\r\nfall under the jurisdiction of the EU from 1 January 2014. This reflects the\r\ncurrent opportunities offered through the current Mayotte agreement with the\r\nshipowners. These opportunities would follow the guidance of the IOTC\r\nscientific advice regarding capacity and the conservation of the resources. \nFor this access Seychelles vessel owners\r\nwill have to pay for a fishing authorisation. The fees for these authorisations\r\nwould reflect the total rates that were recently agreed with the Seychelles in the new Protocol to the FPA between the EU and Seychelles. The payment of the licences\r\nwould be the only financial compensation to be foreseen under this new\r\nAgreement and will be paid directly to Mayotte to enable it to develop its\r\nmanagement and control capacity as well as developing fisheries governance and\r\ncapacity building. There would be no financial implication on the Seychelles\r\nGovernment.\n2014/0079 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of\r\nthe Seychelles on access for fishing vessels flying the flag of the Seychelles\r\nto waters and marine biological resources of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe European Union.\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) in conjunction\r\nwith Article 218 (6) (a) and (7) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[1],\r\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nEuropean Council adopted Decision (2012/419/EU) of 11\r\nJuly 2012[2]\r\namending, with the effect from 1 January 2014, the status of Mayotte with\r\nregard to the European Union,\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council authorised the\r\nCommission to negotiation, on behalf of the European Union, an Agreement with\r\nthe Republic of the Seychelles relating to the access, for fishing vessels\r\nflying the flag of the Republic of Seychelles, to waters and marine biological\r\nresources of the European Union, namely in the exclusive economic zone off the\r\ncoast of Mayotte.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a result of those\r\nnegotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 15 November 2013. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is in the interest of\r\nthe Union to implement the Agreement in the fisheries sector with the Republic\r\nof the Seychelles, setting out the fishing opportunities for the Seychelles and defining the conditions to promoting responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in\r\nthe waters of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of the European Union. It is\r\ntherefore appropriate to approve the Agreement on behalf of the Union.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement has\r\nestablished in its Article 8, a Joint Committee responsible for monitoring the\r\napplication of the Agreement. Furthermore, in accordance with the Agreement,\r\nthe Joint Committee may approve certain modifications to the Agreement. In\r\norder to facilitate the approval of such modifications, it is appropriate to\r\nempower the European Commission, subject to specific conditions, to approve\r\nthem under a simplified procedure.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order for the\r\nauthorities in Mayotte to implement the rules of the common fisheries policy,\r\nfrom the date on which Mayotte becomes an outermost region, it is necessary to\r\nset in place the appropriate administrative framework, control activities,\r\nphysical infrastructure and provide the appropriate capacity building. This\r\nwill also assist in the requirement to comply with the international reporting\r\nobligations of the Union. Therefore, the necessary financial means should be\r\nprovided to the fisheries authorities in Mayotte through the use of the funding\r\nprovided through the shipowners fees to be paid directly to Mayotte. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nfishing fleet flagged in Seychelles has operated in the Mayotte waters over\r\nseveral years through an arrangement between Mayotte and the vessel shipowners,\r\nwhereby the shipowners paid a licence fee to Mayotte to fish in its waters. As\r\na result, a strong relationship has developed between the Seychelles fleet and the local community of the French outermost region of Mayotte. Therefore, to\r\nmaintain this continuity of fishing operations and subsequent benefits to\r\nMayotte it is appropriate that all payments related to authorisations and\r\ncatches under this agreement benefit directly the local community in Mayotte.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement should be\r\napproved on behalf of the European Union.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe Agreement setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial\r\ncontribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Seychelles is hereby approved on behalf of the Union[3].\nArticle 2\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 France shall be empowered\r\nto collect, for the account of its outermost region Mayotte, the payments\r\nrelated to authorisations and catches and other fees due by operators of\r\nSeychelles vessels in consideration of the granting of access to fisheries\r\nwithin EU waters around Mayotte in accordance with the provisions of Chapter\r\nIII, Section 1, paragraphs 8 and 9 and Section 2 of the Annex of the Agreement.\r\nThese receipts shall be used by France for the setting in place of the\r\nappropriate administrative framework, control activities, physical\r\ninfrastructure and provide the appropriate capacity building in order for the\r\nadministration in Mayotte to meet the requirements of the CFP.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Details\r\nof that bank account shall be provided to the Commission by France.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At\r\nthe end of each year of implementation of this agreement, France shall send to the Commission a detailed report on the payments made by the vessels authorised\r\nto fish and the utilization of these payments. \nArticle 3\nThe President of the Council shall give, on behalf of the Union, the notification provided for in Article 19 of the Agreement.\nArticle 4\nSubject to the provisions and conditions set out in the Annex, the\r\nEuropean Commission shall be empowered to approve, on behalf of the Union, modifications to the Agreement in the Joint Committee.\nArticle 5\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its\r\npublication in the Official Journal of the European Union[4]. \nThis Decision is addressed to the Member\r\nStates.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 204 of 31.7.2012\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement has been published in OJ\u2026 reference\r\ntogether with the Decision on signing.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The date of entry into force of the Agreement will be\r\npublished in the Official Journal of the European Union by the General\r\nSecretariat of the Council.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
