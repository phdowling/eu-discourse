The Annex to that Decision contains a list of the products to\r\nwhich tax exemptions and reductions may be applied. The difference between the\r\ntaxation of locally manufactured products and the taxation of other products\r\nmay not exceed 10, 20 or 30 percentage points, depending on the product. \nDecision 2004/162/EC sets out the reasons\r\nfor adopting the specific measures: remoteness, raw material and energy\r\ndependence, the obligation to build up larger stocks, the small size of the\r\nlocal market combined with the low level of export activity, etc. The\r\ncombination of these handicaps means that production costs, and therefore the\r\ncost price of goods produced locally, are increased, so that without specific\r\nmeasures they would be less competitive than those produced elsewhere, even\r\ntaking into account the cost of transporting such goods to the DOMs. This would\r\nmake it harder to maintain local production. The specific measures contained in\r\nDecision 2004/162/EC were thus designed to strengthen local industry by\r\nmaking it more competitive.\nBy Decision 2012/419/EU amending the\r\nstatus of Mayotte with regard to the European Union, the European Council\r\ndecided that Mayotte would have the status of an outermost region within the\r\nmeaning of Article 349 TFEU from 1 January 2014, rather than\r\nthat of an overseas country or territory (OCT) within the meaning of\r\nArticle 355(2) TFEU. To this end, Mayotte was added to the\r\nlist of outermost regions in Article 349 TFEU by the above-mentioned\r\nEuropean Council Decision. The entire Treaty and all Community tax\r\nlegislation will therefore be applicable to Mayotte from the date of this\r\nchange in status. \nThe proposal for a Council Directive of\r\n7 August 2013[1]\r\nis intended to ensure that Mayotte is treated in the same way as the other\r\nFrench outermost regions with regard to VAT and excise duties, by excluding\r\nthis overseas department from the territorial scope of the VAT and excise duty\r\ndirectives from 1 January 2014.\nThe French authorities informed the Commission\r\nof their intention to introduce the dock dues tax in Mayotte, under similar\r\nconditions to those for Guyana, and requested authorisation from the Commission\r\nto apply a differentiated tax system according to whether or not products are\r\nproduced locally. In their request of 24 May 2013, the French\r\nauthorities therefore sent the Commission a list of around 100 products for\r\nwhich they were seeking authorisation to apply a differentiated tax system\r\naccording to whether or not the products are produced locally. The French authorities\r\nwere asked on several occasions to supply additional information and, for each\r\nof the products covered by the request, to provide proof of the existence of\r\nlocal production, the market share held by this local production, and the\r\nadditional costs of this local production in comparison to the same products\r\nproduced elsewhere.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe French authorities' request concerning Mayotte was a response to requests from the economic sectors concerned.\nThe Commission has not used an impact\r\nassessment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n Summary of the proposed measures The purpose of the proposal is to amend Council Decision 2004/162/EC in order to make it applicable to Mayotte. It also determines the lists of products in Mayotte for which France will be authorised to apply, within certain limits, exemptions or reductions in dock dues for particular products produced locally. The proposal makes provision for authorising the application of a differentiated tax system for 59 products produced locally in Mayotte. For all these products the French authorities were able to prove: firstly, the existence of local production; secondly, the existence of substantial imports (including from metropolitan France and other Member States) which could jeopardise the continuation of local production; and thirdly, the existence of additional costs relating to local production compared with 'imported' products, which compromise the competitiveness of locally produced products. The authorised tax differential must not exceed the proven additional costs. There are 11 products proposed for inclusion in Part A of the Annex to Council Decision 2004/162/EC (authorised tax differential of 10 percentage points), 32 products for inclusion in Part B (authorised tax differential of 20 percentage points), and 16 products for Part C (authorised tax differential of 30 percentage points). Details of the products concerned are given in recitals 5 to 7 of the proposal for a Council Decision. \n Legal basis Article 349 TFEU. \n Principle of subsidiarity Only the Council is authorised, on the basis of Article 349 TFEU, to adopt specific measures in favour of the outermost regions to adjust the application of the Treaties to those regions, including the common policies, because of the permanent handicaps which affect the economic and social conditions of the outermost regions. The proposal therefore complies with the principle of subsidiarity. \n Principle of proportionality The proposal complies with the principle of proportionality for the reasons below. \n The purpose of the Proposal is to amend Decision 2004/162/EC in order to make it applicable to Mayotte. It concerns only products for which evidence of the additional costs incurred by locally produced products has been provided. || \n Similarly, the maximum differential proposed for each product covered by this proposal is limited to what is necessary in view of the additional costs affecting the local production concerned in each case. In this way, the tax burden on products imported into the French overseas department of Mayotte will not exceed what is necessary to offset the lower competitiveness of products produced locally. \n Choice of instrument \n Proposed instrument: Council decision. \n Other instruments would not have been appropriate for the following reasons: The text to be amended is itself a Council Decision, adopted on the same legal basis (Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty at the time). \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPACT\nThe proposal has no impact on the European\r\nUnion budget.\n2014/0010 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\namending Decision 2004/162/EC with\r\nregard to its implementation in Mayotte from 1 January 2014\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 349 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\r\nParliament[2],\nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nDecision 2004/162/EC[3]\r\nauthorises the French authorities to apply exemptions or reductions to dock\r\ndues for products produced locally in the French overseas departments and\r\nlisted in the Annex to the Decision. These exemptions or reductions constitute\r\nspecific measures designed to offset the specific constraints facing the\r\noutermost regions which increase production costs for local companies and make\r\nit difficult for their products to compete with the same products imported from\r\nmetropolitan France and other Member States. Mayotte's situation is the same as\r\nthat of the other French outermost regions.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\r\nDecision 2012/419/EU[4],\r\nwith effect from 1 January 2014 Mayotte will become an outermost\r\nregion within the meaning of Article 349 of the Treaty. All provisions of\r\nthe Treaty will thus be applicable to Mayotte from this date.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The French authorities\r\nhave asked for Decision 2004/162/EC concerning dock dues to be applicable\r\nto Mayotte with effect from 1 January 2014, and have submitted a list\r\nof the products to which they wish to apply differentiated taxation according\r\nto whether or not the products are produced locally.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Decision should authorise\r\nthe French authorities to apply differentiated taxation to the products for\r\nwhich they have proven: firstly, that local production exists; secondly, that\r\nsignificant importation of goods (including from metropolitan France and other\r\nMember States) could jeopardise the continuation of local production; and\r\nthirdly, that additional costs exist which increase the cost price of local\r\nproduction in comparison with products produced elsewhere, compromising the\r\ncompetitiveness of products produced locally. The authorised tax differential\r\nshould not exceed the proven additional costs. Applying these principles will\r\nallow the provisions of Article 349 of the Treaty to be implemented\r\nwithout going beyond what is necessary and without creating an unjustified advantage\r\nfor local production.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The products for which the\r\nFrench authorities have provided these three types of proof are listed in\r\nParts A, B and C of the Annex to Council Decision 2004/162/EC. The\r\nproducts concerned that are listed in Part A of the Annex to the Decision\r\n(authorised tax differential of 10 percentage points) are pepper (products\r\n0904 11 and 0904 12[5]),\r\nvanilla (0905), chocolate (1806), certain plastic products\r\n(3925 10 10, 3925 90 80, 3926 90 90 and\r\n3926 90 97), bricks (6901 and 6902) and dental prostheses\r\n(9021 21 90).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The products concerned\r\nlisted in Part B of the Annex (authorised tax differential of 20 percentage\r\npoints) are fish (products 0301, 0302, 0303, 0304 and 0305), certain wood\r\narticles (4407, 4409, 4414, 4418, 4419, 4420 and 4421), certain paperboard and\r\npaper articles (4819 and 4821), certain products from the press and publishing\r\nsector (4902, 4909, 4910 and 4911), certain flat glass products (7003 and\r\n7005), certain iron articles (7210, 7301, 7312, 7314, 9406 00 31 and 9406 00 38),\r\ncertain aluminium articles (7606, 7610 10 and 8310), and certain seats\r\n(9401 69, 9401 90 30 and 9403 40).\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The products concerned\r\nlisted in Part C of the Annex (authorised tax differential of 30 percentage\r\npoints) are milk and dairy products (0401, 0403 and 0406), certain meat-based\r\nprocessed products (1601 and 1602), certain bakery products\r\n(1901 and 1905), ice-creams (2105), mineral water and sodas (2201 and\r\n2202), beer (2203), ylang-ylang (3301 29 11 and\r\n3301 29 31), soaps and detergents (3401 and 3402) and foam\r\nmattresses (9404 29 90).\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2004/162/EC\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the urgency, an\r\nexception should be made to the eight-week period laid down by Article 4\r\nof Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nDecision 2004/162/EC is amended as\r\nfollows:\n1) the first subparagraph of\r\nArticle 1(1) is replaced by the following:\n'By way of derogation from\r\nArticles 28, 30 and 110 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion, the French authorities shall be authorised, until 1 July 2014,\r\nto apply exemptions or reductions to the dock dues tax for the products listed\r\nin the Annex which are produced locally in the French overseas departments of\r\nGuadeloupe, Guyana, Martinique, Mayotte and R\u00e9union.'\n2) The Annex is amended as follows:\na) the following point 5 is added to\r\nPart A:\n'5.
