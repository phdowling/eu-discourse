This would\nenable Seychelles flagged vessels to continue to have access to Mayotte waters from 1 January 2014.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nSeychelles flagged vessels can\ncurrently fish in Mayotte waters on the basis of an agreement between the\nPrefet de Mayotte and the Seychelles flagged vessels owners. To date an average\nof 8 Seychelles purse-seine vessels have operated in Mayotte waters under the\nprivate agreement, which foresees the vessels paying a licence fee directly to Mayotte. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThis agreement is of\nstrategic importance for the Seychelles fleet given the migratory nature of the\ntuna resource. It will also further underline and strengthen our relationship\nwith the Seychelles. This Agreement supplements and mirrors the existing\nAgreement that we have for EU vessels to have access to resources in Seychelles' waters, thereby reinforcing the political signal being given to the Seychelles as our most important partner in the region.\nTherefore it is in the\ninterest of the EU to sign, provisionally apply and conclude this agreement\nwith the Seychelles.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe European Council\nadopted on 11 July 2012, a Decision amending the status of Mayotte so that it\ncan become an outermost region on 1 January 2014 (OJ L 204 of 31.7.2012),\nrather than holding the current status of overseas country or territory. As a\nconsequence, the current EEZ of Mayotte will as of 1 January 2014, become EU\nwaters.\nA mandate for the\nCommission to undertake these negotiations was agreed on 14 October and\nnegotiations were held with the Seychelles shortly following this and concluded\non 15 November 2013.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nAs this is in relation to access of fishing\nvessels flying the flag of the Seychelles to waters falling under EU\njurisdiction, there are no financial implications by way of expenditure on the\nEU budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nThis agreement foresees access to a limited number of vessels for a\nperiod of six years to the Mayotte waters which will fall under the\njurisdiction of the EU from 1 January 2014. This reflects the current\nopportunities offered through the current Mayotte agreement with the\nshipowners. These opportunities would follow the guidance of the IOTC\nscientific advice regarding capacity and the conservation of the resources.\nFor this access Seychelles vessel owners will have to\npay for a fishing authorisation. The fees for these authorisations would\nreflect the total rates that were recently agreed with the Seychelles in the new Protocol to the FPA between the EU and Seychelles. The payment of the licences\nwould be the only financial compensation to be foreseen under this new\nAgreement and will be paid directly to Mayotte to enable it to develop its\nmanagement and control capacity as well as developing fisheries governance and\ncapacity building. There would be no financial implication on the Seychelles\nGovernment.\n2014/0078 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the European\nUnion, and on the provisional application of the Agreement between the European\nUnion and the Republic of the Seychelles on access for fishing vessels flying\nthe flag of the Seychelles to waters and marine biological resources of\nMayotte, under the jurisdiction of the European Union.\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and\nin particular Article 43, in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission[1],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nEuropean Council adopted Decision (2012/419/EU) of 11\nJuly 2012[2]\namending, with the effect from 1 January 2014, the status of Mayotte with\nregard to the European Union,\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council authorised the\nCommission to negotiation, on behalf of the European Union, an Agreement with\nthe Republic of the Seychelles relating to the access, for fishing vessels\nflying the flag of the Republic of Seychelles, to waters and marine biological\nresources of the European Union, namely in the exclusive economic zone off the\ncoast of Mayotte.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a result of those\nnegotiations, a new Agreement was initialled on 15 November 2013.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is in the interest of\nthe Union to implement the Agreement in the fisheries sector with the Republic\nof the Seychelles, setting out the fishing opportunities for the Seychelles and defining the conditions to promoting responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in\nthe waters of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of the European Union. It is\ntherefore appropriate to approve the Agreement on behalf of the Union.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement has\nestablished in its Article 8, a Joint Committee responsible for monitoring the\napplication of the Agreement. Furthermore, in accordance with the Agreement,\nthe Joint Committee may approve certain modifications to the Agreement. In\norder to facilitate the approval of such modifications, it is appropriate to\nempower the European Commission, subject to specific conditions, to approve\nthem under a simplified procedure.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order for the\nauthorities in Mayotte to implement the rules of the common fisheries policy,\nfrom the date on which Mayotte becomes an outermost region, it is necessary to\nset in place the appropriate administrative framework, control activities,\nphysical infrastructure and provide the appropriate capacity building. This\nwill also assist in the requirement to comply with the international reporting\nobligations of the Union. Therefore, the necessary financial means should be\nprovided to the fisheries authorities in Mayotte through the use of the funding\nprovided through the shipowners fees to be paid directly to Mayotte. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fishing fleet flagged\nin Seychelles has operated in the Mayotte waters over several years through an\narrangement between Mayotte and the vessel shipowners, whereby the shipowners\npaid a licence fee to Mayotte to fish in its waters. As a result, a strong\nrelationship has developed between the Seychelles fleet and the local community\nof the French outermost region of Mayotte. Therefore, to maintain this\ncontinuity of fishing operations and subsequent benefits to Mayotte it is\nappropriate that all payments related to authorisations and catches under this\nagreement benefit directly the local community in Mayotte.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore the new\nAgreement should be signed on behalf of the Union, subject to its conclusion.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to guarantee the\ncontinuation of fishing activities by European Union vessels, the new Agreement\nshould be applied provisionally from the date of signature of the Agreement by\nboth Parties,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe signing of the Agreement setting out\nthe fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the\nAgreement between the European Union and the Republic of Seychelles is hereby\napproved on behalf of the Union, subject to the conclusion of the said\nAgreement.\nThe text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision.\nArticle 2\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 France shall be empowered to\ncollect, for the account of its outermost region Mayotte, the payments related\nto authorisations and catches and other fees due by operators of Seychelles\nvessels in consideration of the granting of access to fisheries within EU\nwaters around Mayotte in accordance with the provisions of Chapter III, Section\n1, paragraphs 8 and 9 and Section 2 of the Annex of the Agreement. These\nreceipts shall be used by France for the setting in place of the appropriate\nadministrative framework, control activities, physical infrastructure and\nprovide the appropriate capacity building in order for the administration in Mayotte to meet the requirements of the CFP.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Details of that bank account\nshall be provided to the Commission by France.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the end of each year of\nimplementation of this agreement, France shall send to the Commission a\ndetailed report on the payments made by the vessels authorised to fish and the\nutilization of these payments.\nArticle 3\nThe President of the Council is hereby\nauthorised to designate the person(s) empowered to sign the Agreement on behalf\nof the Union.\nArticle 4\nThe Agreement shall be applied\nprovisionally from the date of signature of the Agreement by both Parties,\npending its entry into force.\nArticle 5\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\nday of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ\nC , , p. \n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 204 of 31.7.2012\nANNEX\nAgreement between the European Union and\nthe Republic of the Seychelles on access for fishing vessels flying the flag of\nthe Seychelles to waters and marine biological resources of Mayotte, under the\njurisdiction of the European Union. \nTHE EUROPEAN UNION, hereinafter referred to\nas the 'EU',\nand\nTHE REPUBLIC OF THE SEYCHELLES, hereinafter\nreferred to as the 'Seychelles',\nHereinafter referred to as 'the Parties',\nCONSIDERING the close working relationship\nthat has developed between the EU and the Seychelles, particularly in the\ncontext of the Partnership Agreement between the\nMembers of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States of the one part,\nand the European Community and its Member States of the other part (Cotonou\nAgreement), and their mutual desire to intensify that relationship,\nNOTING that the EU and the Seychelles have enjoyed a strong relationship in fisheries following the Agreement between the\nEuropean Economic Community and the Republic of Seychelles on fishing off Seychelles adopted in 1987.

Daily catch\nreports (FAR) would be made available automatically and without delay to the\nSeychelles FMC.\n5.                      \nThe Seychelles shall ensure that its FMC is\nequipped with computer hardware and software necessary for the automatic transmission\nof ERS data in XML format available at\n[http://ec.europa.eu/cfp/control/codes/index_en.htm], and have a safeguard\nprocedure capable of registering and store the ERS data in a computer readable\nform for a period of at least 3 years.\n6.                      \nAny amendment or update of the format referred\nto in paragraph 5 above will be identified and dated and needs to be\noperational six months after its implementation.\n7.                      \nThe transmission of ERS data shall use\nelectronic means of communication managed by EU authorities, identified as DEH (data\nexchange highway).\n8.                      \nThe EU and the Seychelles shall each designate\none ERS correspondent which shall act as the contact point.\n(a)           \nThe corresponding ERS shall be appointed for a minimum\nperiod of six months;\n(b)          \nThe EU FMC and the Seychelles FMC shall\ncommunicate to each other the names, address, telephone, telex, e-mail of their\ncorresponding ERS;\n(c)           \nAny change in the details of that corresponding\nERS must be communicated without delay.\nSection 2\nPreparation\nand submission of ERS data\n1.                      \nThe Seychelles vessel shall:\n(a)         \nCommunicate daily the ERS data for each day\nspent in the EU fishing area,\n(b)         \nRecord for each seine haul the quantities of\neach species caught and retained on board as target species or by-catch, or\nrejected;\n(c)         \nFor each species identified in the fishing\nauthorisation issued by the EU, the discarded or spoiled catch must also be\ndeclared;\n(d)        \nIdentify each species by its FAO alpha 3 code;\n(e)         \nExpress the quantities in kilograms of live\nweight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish;\n(f)          \nRegister in the ERS data, for each species\nidentified in the fishing authorisation issued by the EU, the quantities which\nare transhipped and/or unloaded;\n(g)         \nRegister in the ERS data, message when entering\n(COE) and exit (message COX) the EU fishing area, a specific message containing\nfor each species identified in the fishing authorisation issued by the EU the\nquantities retained on board at the time of each piece;\n(h)         \nTransmit daily the ERS data to the FMC of the Seychelles, using the format referred to in paragraph 5 of Section 1 above, at the latest\nby 23: 59 UTC.\n2.                      \nThe master shall be responsible for the accuracy\nof the ERS data recorded and sent.\n3.                      \nThe Seychelles FMC shall send automatically and\nimmediately, the ERS data to the EU FMC.\n4.                      \nThe EU FMC shall confirm receipt of ERS data by\na feedback message and process all the ERS data as confidential.\nSection 3\nFailure\nof the ERS system on board the Seychelles vessel and/or transmission of ERS data\nbetween the vessel and the Seychelles FMC \n1.                      \nThe Seychelles shall immediately inform the\nmaster and/or the owner of the Seychelles vessel, or his representative, of any\ntechnical failure of the ERS system installed on board the vessel or\nnon-function of the ERS, data shall be transmitted between the vessel and the\nSeychelles FMC.\n2.                      \nThe Seychelles shall inform the EU authorities of\nthe malfunction and corrective measures taken.\n3.                      \nIn the event of a failure of the ERS system on\nboard the Seychelles vessel, the master and/or the owner shall provide for\nrepair or replacement of the ERS system within 10 days. If the Seychelles vessel is performing a port call in the 10-day-period, it may resume fishing\nactivities in the EU fishing area when the ERS system becomes fully functional\nagain without an authorisation issued by the EU.\n4.                      \nA Seychelles vessel shall not leave a port,\nfollowing a technical failure of the ERS unless:\n(a)         \nthe ERS system is fully functional to the\nsatisfaction of the Seychelles and the EU, or\n(b)         \n\u00a0the Seychelles vessel has no intention to\nresume its fishing activities in the EU waters, and it is authorised to leave\nport by the Seychelles competent authority. \n(c)         \nIn the latter case, the Seychelles shall inform the EU of its decision before allowing the Seychelles vessel to leave port.\n5.                      \nAny Seychelles vessel which operates in the EU\nfishing area with a defective ERS system shall send daily and at the latest by\n23: 59 UTC all the ERS data to the Seychelles FMC by any other available\nelectronic means of communication and to the EU until such time as the ERS\nsystem is repaired in the deadline referred to in paragraph 3\n6.                      \nThe ERS data which could not be made available\nto the EU authorities via the ERS system due to failure referred to in\nparagraph 1 shall be sent by the Seychelles FMC to the EU FMC by other mutually\nagreed electronic format. This alternative should be considered as a priority,\nit being understood that the transmission deadlines normally applicable may not\nbe respected.\n7.                      \nIf the EU FMC does not receive the ERS data of a\n Seychelles vessel for three consecutive days, the EU may instruct the Seychelles vessel to proceed immediately to a port designated by the EU for investigation.\nSection 4\nFailure\nof FMC \u2014 non-receipt of ERS data by the EU FMC \n1.                      \nWhen an FMCs of one of the Parties receives no\nERS data, it shall without delay inform the FMC of the other Party, and, if\nnecessary, contribute to the resolution of the problem.\n2.                      \nThe Seychelles FMC and the EU FMC shall mutually\nagree alternative electronic means of communication to be used for the\ntransmission of ERS data in the event of a failure of FMC and inform each other\nimmediately of any change.\n3.                      \nWhen the EU FMC indicates that ERS data have not\nbeen received and the Seychelles FMC identifies the causes of the problem, Seychelles shall take the appropriate measures to resolve the problem. The Seychelles FMC\nshall inform the EU FMC of the problem and the outcome and measures taken\nwithin 24 hours of the failure being identified.\n4.                      \nIf the problem requires more than 24 hours to\nresolve, the Seychelles FMC shall immediately send the missing ERS data to the EU\nFMC using one of the alternative electronic means referred to in Point 6 of\nSection 3.\n5.                      \nThe EU shall inform its competent control\nservices (MCS) of the malfunction so that Seychelles vessels are not suspected\nof having committed an infringement for the non-transmission of ERS data by the\nFMC of the Seychelles due to the failure of that FMC.\nSection 5\nMaintenance\nof a FMC\n1.                      \nPlanned maintenance operations of an FMC\n(maintenance programme) and which may affect transmission of ERS data should be\nnotified to the other FMC at least 72 hours beforehand, indicating if possible,\nthe date and length of the maintenance. Unforeseen interruptions, breakdowns or\nmaintenance, should be notified as soon as possible to the other FMC.\n2.                      \nDuring maintenance, the provision of ERS data may\nbe put on hold until the system is operational again. The ERS data concerned\nare then made available immediately after the end of the interruption.\n3.                      \nIf the maintenance operation is over 24 hours,\nthe ERS data shall be transmitted to the other FMC using one of the alternative\nelectronic means referred to in point 6 of Section 3.\n4.                      \nThe Seychelles and the EU shall inform its\ncompetent control services (MCS) of the maintenance, so that Seychelles vessels are not suspected of having committed an infringement for the non-transmission\nof ERS data due to maintenance of a FMC.\nAppendix\n4\nCommunication\nFormat Reports\nEntry Report (COE)[1] \n Content || Transmission \n Destination || FRA \n Action code || COE \n Vessel Name ||   \n IRCS ||   \n Position of entry ||

Chapter IV Section 4 of the Annex to the Agreement, all\nSeychelles\u00a0 vessels fishing, or intending to fish, in EU fishing area as\ndefined in Chapter I point 2 (a) of the Annex, hereinafter referred to as\nfishing area, shall comply with all the following provisions.\n2.                 \nA Seychelles vessel that is not equipped with an\nVMS Vessel Locator Device (VLD), or if the VLD installed on board is not\nfunctional, is not allowed to enter the EU fishing area to conduct fishing\nactivities.\n3.                 \nSeychelles vessels\npositions and movements shall be monitored, inter alia, by a VMS, without\ndiscrimination, in accordance with the provisions set out below. \n4.                 \nFor the purposes of VMS, the EU authorities\nshall communicate to the EU Fisheries Monitoring Centres (FMCs) the\ngeographical coordinates (Latitudes and Longitudes) of the EU fishing area.\n5.                 \nThe EU authorities will transmit this\ninformation in electronic format, expressed in degrees decimal in the WGS-84 datum\nto the Seychelles competent authorities. \n6.                 \nThe EU authorities and the Seychelles FMC will\nexchange information on their respective contact coordinates, namely electronic\naddresses in https format or, where appropriate, other secure communication\nprotocol, and the specifications to be used in their respective FMCs as well as\nany alternative means of communication to be used in case of failure. \n7.                 \nAll Seychelles vessels holding a fishing\nauthorisation must be equipped with a fully operational Vessel Location Device\n(VLD) installed on board, to enable automatic and continuous communication of\ntheir geographical coordinates, to the Seychelles FMC. \n8.                 \nThe frequency of transmission shall be on an\nhourly basis.\n9.                 \nIt is agreed that, at the request of either\nParty, there will be an exchange of information on the VMS equipment used, in\norder to ensure that the said equipment is fully compatible with the\nrequirements of the other Party for the purposes of these provisions.\n10.             \nThe Parties agree to review these provisions as\nand when appropriate, including the relevant analysis of cases of\nmalfunctioning or anomalies related to individual Seychelles vessels. All such\ncases will have to be notified by the EU authorities to the Seychelles competent authorities and to the European Commission at least 15 days before the\nreview which shall occurs in the framework of the Joint Committee (JC). \n11.             \nAny dispute concerning the interpretation or the\napplication of these provisions shall be subject to consultation between the\nParties within the framework of the Joint Committee provided for in Article 8\nof this Agreement.\nIntegrity\nof the VMS\n12.             \nThe Seychelles vessel Master is prohibited, or\nanyone authorised by him to switch off, obstruct its VLD, or interferes in any\nform with the data transmitted to the Seychelles\u00a0 FMC, when operating in EU\nfishing area .\n13.             \nThe master shall be responsible for the accuracy\nof the VMS data recorded and transmitted. \n14.             \nIn particular, the Master shall ensure that:\n(a)         \ndata are not altered in any way;\n(b)         \nthe antenna or the antennas connected to the\nsatellite tracking devices are not obstructed in any way; \n(c)         \nthe power supply of the satellite tracking\ndevices is not interrupted in any way;\n(d)        \nthe Seychelles vessel tracking device is not\nremoved from or the place where the device was first installed;\n(e)         \nAny replacement of a Seychelles vessel tracking\ndevice is immediately notified to the EU competent authority.\n(f)          \nAny breach of the above-mentioned obligations\nmay render the master liable for sanctions as provided under the applicable EU\nlaw. \n15.             \nThe VMS hardware and software components shall\nbe, as far as possible, tamper proof i.e. shall not permit the input or output\nof false positions and must not be capable of being manually over-ridden. \n16.             \nThe system shall be fully automatic and\noperational at all times regardless of environmental conditions. It shall be\nprohibited to destroy, damage, render inoperative or otherwise interfere with\nthe satellite tracking device.\n17.             \nThe position of the vessels will be determined\nwith a margin of error of less than 100 metres and with a confidence interval\nof 99%.\nVMS\ndata transmission\n18.             \nWhen a Seychelles vessel fishing under this\nAgreement enters into the EU fishing area, subsequent position reports shall be\nautomatically communicated by the Seychelles FMC\u00a0 to the EU FMC , in real time,\non a frequency set on paragraph 8 above. \n19.             \nThe VMS messages reported shall be identified by\nusing the following 3 letter codes:\n(a)         \n\"ENT\", first VMS data report\ntransmitted by each vessel upon entering the EU fishing area;\n(b)         \n\"POS\", every VMS data report\ntransmitted by each vessel while within the EU fishing area;\n(c)         \n\"EXI\", first VMS data report transmitted\nby each vessel after exiting the EU fishing area; \n20.             \nThe frequency of transmission can be changed up\nto a 30 minutes basis, when strong evidence is provided demonstrating that the Seychelles vessel is perpetrating an infringement.\n(a)         \nThis evidence shall be submitted by the EU FMC\nto the Seychelles FMC and to the European Commission, along with the request to\nalter frequency. The Seychelles FMC shall send the data to the EU FMC,\nautomatically, and in real time, immediately after receiving the request.\n(b)         \nThe EU FMC shall notify immediately the\nSeychelles FMC and the European Commission of the end of the monitoring\nprocedure. \n(c)         \nThe Seychelles FMC and the European Commission\nshall be informed of the follow up of any inspection procedure based on the\nspecial request under this point .\n21.             \nThe messages referred to in paragraph 19 shall\nbe transmitted electronically in https format, or other secure communication\nprotocols, subject to prior agreement between the relevant FMCs. \nMalfunction\nof the VMS equipment on board of the Seychelles vessel\n22.             \nIn the event of a technical problem or\nmalfunction of the VLD installed on board the Seychelles vessel, the master of\nthat vessel shall communicate the information specified in paragraph 19 above,\nby any of the communications form agreed in the paragraph 6 above, to the\nSeychelles FMC, starting from the time when the failure or malfunction was\ninformed by the EU competent authority.\n23.             \nAt least one global position report every four\nhours shall be transmitted while the Seychelles vessel stays in the EU fishing\narea. This global position report will include the hourly positions as\nregistered by the master of that vessel during those four hours and as\ndescribed in Appendix 5.\n24.             \nThe Seychelles FMC shall forward these messages\nto the EU FMC without delay. In case of necessity or doubts, the EU competent\nauthority may request a transmission of position report every hour from a given\n  Seychelles vessel.\n25.             \nDefective equipment shall be repaired or\nreplaced as soon as the Seychelles vessel concludes its fishing trip. Any new\nfishing trip shall not begin until the equipment has been repaired or replaced\nand duly authorised by the Seychelles\u00a0 competent authority, which will notify\nthe EU authorities of its decision.\nFMC\nfailure - Non-receipt of VMS data by the EU FMC\n26.             \nWhen one of the FMCs does not receive VMS data,\nthis FMC shall promptly inform the other FMC contact and, if necessary, work\ntogether to solve the problem.\n27.             \nThe Seychelles FMC and the EU FMC will,\nmutually, agree before the provisional application of the Agreement alternative\nelectronic means of communication to be used for the transmission of VMS data\nin case of failure of the FMC, and inform without delay of any changes to these\nmeans.\n28.             \nWhenever the EU FMC reports that the VMS data\nhave not been received, the Seychelles FMC shall identify the causes of the\nproblem and take appropriate measures to ensure that the problem is solved. The\nSeychelles FMC shall notify the EU FMC of the results and measures taken,\nwithin 24 hours from the acknowledgment of the failure.\n29.             \nIf the resolution of the problem requires more\nthan 24 hours, the Seychelles FMC shall forward the missing VMS data to the EU\nFMC, using the alternative means of communication referred to in paragraph 27\nabove.\n30.             \nEU shall inform its competent Monitoring Control\nand Surveillance (MCS) services so that Seychelles vessels are not subject to\nany infringement procedure for the non-reception of VMS data by the EU FMC due\nto the failure of the FMCs systems.\nMaintenance\nof an FMC\n31.             \nThe scheduled maintenance of an FMC (maintenance\nprogram) that is likely to affect the exchange of VMS data, must be notified to\nthe other FMC at least 72 hours in advance, indicating if possible, the date\nand the duration of the maintenance. Unscheduled maintenance shall be\ncommunicated as soon as possible to the other FMC.\n32.             \nDuring the maintenance, the provision of VMS\ndata can be queued until the system is operational again. Relevant VMS data are\nthen made available immediately after maintenance has been completed.\n33.             \nIf maintenance lasts more than 24 hours, the VMS\ndata will be transmitted to the other FMC using the electronic alternative\nmeans referred to in paragraph 27.\n34.             \nEU authorities shall inform its competent\nMonitoring Control and Surveillance (MCS) services so that Seychelles vessels are not subject to any infringement procedure for non VMS data\ntransmission due to maintenance of the FMC.\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sent\nsix (6) Hours before entering EU Fishing Areas.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sent\nsix (6) Hours before exiting EU Fishing Areas.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Every\nthree (3) days after entering EU Fishing Areas.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
