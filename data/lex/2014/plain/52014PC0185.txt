This implies that the availability period of the financial assistance\r\nends on 18 May 2014. In order to ensure a comprehensive and thorough assessment\r\nof compliance with the programme conditionality, it is essential to take the\r\ninformation covering the period until the end of the first quarter of 2014 into\r\naccount. Therefore, the twelfth review mission under the Portuguese Programme\r\ncannot start before mid-April 2014. This means that the processes for the completion\r\nof the review and the preparation of the necessary documents would be compressed\r\ninto very few weeks, with the the risk of insufficient time for the appropriate\r\nscrutiny in assessing the compliance. There would also be a risk of not meeting\r\nthe end-programme deadline, in which case Portugal would lose the final\r\ndisbursement. To avoid \u00a0these risks, it would seem prudent that the availability\r\nperiod of the programme should be extended by six weeks.\nIt should be\r\nnoted that such decision will enhance the predictability of the disbursement\r\nunder the programme. At the same time, it enhances the quality of the review\r\nassessment. It is therefore considered that the changes consisting in the\r\nextension of availability period of the financial assistance are beneficial to\r\nsecuring the programme's objectives. \n2014/0103 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\namending Implementing Decision 2011/344/EU\r\non granting Union financial assistance to Portugal\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EU) No\r\n407/2010 of 11 May 2010 establishing a European financial stabilisation\r\nmechanism[1],\r\nand in particular Article 3(2) thereof.\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCouncil granted financial assistance to Portugal, at the latter's request, on 17 May 2011 by means of Council Implementing Decision 2011/344/EU[2]. That financial\r\nassistance was granted in support of a strong economic and financial reform\r\nprogramme (the 'Programme') which aims to restore confidence, enable the return\r\nof the economy to sustainable growth, and safeguard financial stability in Portugal, the euro area and the Union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For technical reasons of\r\ndata availability, which are independent from the Portuguese authorities\u2019\r\naction, the Twelfth and Final Review under the Programme cannot\r\nstart before mid-April 2014. At the same time, the availability period of the financial\r\nassistance currently ends on 18 May 2014. To allow for a full assessment of Programme\r\ncompliance under the Final Review in due diligence, which is a condition for\r\nthe release of the last instalment, a short extension by six weeks of the\r\navailability period of the financial assistance is a necessary formality.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nline with Article 3(10) of\r\nImplementing Decision 2011/344/EU, the Commission, together with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and in\r\nliaison with the European Central\r\nBank (ECB), conducted, between 20 February and 28 February 2014, the Eleventh Review of the Portuguese authorities' progress on the implementation of the agreed measures under the Programme.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Real\r\ngross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 performed better than projected at the\r\nTenth Programme Review and is now estimated to have declined by 1,4% (up 0,2\r\npercentage points). This is the result of robust positive growth in the fourth\r\nquarter of 2013 and statistical upward revisions for previous quarters. Short-run\r\nindicators point to a further strengthening of the economic recovery in the\r\ncurrent year. On an annual basis, real GDP is estimated to move into positive\r\nterritory in 2014 and to remain there in 2015, with growth of 1,2% and 1,5%, respectively. The labour market outlook has improved as well, but\r\nunemployment remains high, foreseen to decline to 15,7% in 2014 and continue\r\ndeclining thereafter. Downside risks to the macroeconomic outlook remain, as\r\nthe projected recovery crucially hinges on positive trade and financial market\r\ndevelopments, which also depend on the broader European outlook.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The general government\r\ndeficit is estimated to have been reduced to around 4,5% of GDP in ESA-95 terms\r\nin 2013 (excluding bank recapitalisations, about 4,9% including them), i.e.\r\nabout 1% of GDP below the target of 5,5% of GDP. The overperformance is\r\nexplained mainly by better-than-expected State tax revenues (including the\r\none-off tax and social security debt recovery scheme) and lower-than-expected\r\nexpenditure at the central government level (e.g. in acquisition of goods and\r\nservices and capital expenditure). By contrast, non-tax revenues were\r\nunderperforming. The overall\r\nfiscal effort, measured by the improvement in the structural balance, is\r\nestimated at 1% of GDP.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nstock of domestic arrears has declined by about EUR 1,2 billion (0,7% of GDP),\r\non the back of the different debt settlement programmes (for health, local and\r\nregional sectors). Nevertheless, new arrears are still accumulating albeit at a\r\nreduced pace.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ncarry-over from the 2013 budget execution and the improved macroeconomic\r\noutlook for 2014 are estimated to have a positive impact of 0,7% of GDP on the\r\nbaseline fiscal accounts in 2014. About 0,2% of GDP is estimated to result of\r\nthe positive carry-over effect; and a further estimated 0,5% of GDP is explained\r\nby increases in revenues and social security contributions as well as lower\r\nunemployment benefit expenditures due to the upward revision of growth and\r\nemployment, as well as a downward revision of the unemployment rate.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\n4% of GDP deficit target for 2014 is underpinned by consolidation measures\r\ntotalling 2,3% of GDP included in the 2014 budget and other supporting\r\nlegislation. These measures are primarily of a permanent nature and rely\r\npredominantly on expenditure savings. Measures worth about 1,8% of GDP are drawn from the public expenditure\r\nreview (PER) and are complemented by smaller-scale revenue-increasing measures\r\nworth about 0,4% of GDP as well as some one-off items of around 0,1% of GDP. The\r\nPER measures act along three main axes: (1) reduction of the public-sector wage\r\nbill by, among others measures, reducing over-employment in specific\r\nsub-sectors and a revision of the wage scale; (2) pension reform, notably by\r\nincreasing the retirement age to 66 years and introducing changes to the\r\nconditions for granting survivors' pensions; and (3) sector-specific reforms\r\nmainly aimed at streamlining personnel costs, intermediate consumption and\r\ninvestment across line ministries. The other permanent revenue-increasing\r\nmeasures include increments in company cars taxation and excise duties on\r\nalcohol and tobacco. Most legislation underpinning the permanent consolidation\r\nmeasures has entered into force as from 1 January 2014. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given\r\nthe improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and positive carry-over from 2013,\r\nrisks around the achievement of the 2014 fiscal targets have become more\r\nbalanced than previously as the envisaged measures cater for budgetary\r\npressures and implementation risks. Higher pressures could especially arise for\r\nsome revenue items (e.g. property income) as well as in intermediate\r\nconsumption and social transfers. Moreover, beyond delays on some permanent\r\nmeasures, implementation risks are first and foremost of a legal nature: four\r\nmeasures included in the Budget Law have been sent to the Constitutional Court\r\n(including the wage scale revision and the changes to the survivors' pension\r\nentitlements) and there is a possibility that other measure in the recent\r\nSupplementary Budget will also be contested.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\npublic debt-to-GDP ratio has reached 128,8% in 2013. Debt is forecast to gradually decline from this year on, with a\r\nprojected debt ratio of 126,7% of GDP in 2014. The decline in 2014 is expected\r\nto be partly supported by the further use of cash deposits as well as the\r\nongoing reallocation of the Social Security portfolio from foreign assets to\r\ngovernment securities. Net debt is projected to stand at around 118,1% of GDP\r\nby end-2014.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nbudgetary adjustment process is flanked by a range of fiscal-structural\r\nmeasures to enhance control over government expenditure and improve revenue\r\ncollection:\n\u2013              \r\nOn public financial management: the Commitment\r\nControl system is showing results by limiting the build-up of new arrears but\r\nimplementation needs to be monitored closely to ensure that commitments are\r\ncovered by the available funding and no new arrears are accumulated. The\r\naccumulation of new arrears is notably due to structural imbalances in some\r\nstate-owned hospitals as well as in the railroad company Comboios de Portugal.\r\nStrategic plans to underpin the financial sustainability of these SOEs and\r\narrest the accumulation of new arrears in 2014 are scheduled to be finalised by\r\nend-March. The comprehensive reform of the Budget Framework Law (BFL) is\r\nprogressing. As a first step, the BFL should be amended end-March 2014 to\r\nensure the full transposition of the Fiscal Compact and the six-pack.\n\u2013              \r\nWhile the renegotiations of PPPs have made\r\nprogress, they could not be concluded by the end of 2013 as planned.\r\nNevertheless, savings that failed to materialise in 2013 will accumulate this\r\nyear, adding to the significant savings expected for 2014 and beyond. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) reached operational\r\nbalance on average in both 2012 and 2013 and additional reforms are foreseen to\r\navoid a renewed deterioration of their results. Privatisation has made good\r\nprogress and the proceeds exceed the target under the Programme. \n\u2013              \r\nReforms towards a modern compliance risk\r\nmanagement model of the revenue administration continue. The new Risk\r\nAssessment Unit is now operational and focuses in the first place on improving\r\ncompliance of certain groups of taxpayers such as the self-employed and high\r\nwealth individuals. The fight against tax fraud and\r\nevasion continues with initiatives such as the recently launched VAT lottery.\n\u2013              \r\nReforms in the public administration are being implemented with a view to\r\nmodernising and rationalising public sector employment and entities. A number\r\nof key reforms in the public administration support the public expenditure\r\nreview and underpin the 2014 consolidation strategy. These include: measures to\r\naddress public employment and aimed at rebalancing the composition of the\r\npublic sector workforce towards high-skilled and better-trained civil servants\r\n(e.g. through mutual agreement terminations and a requalification scheme); a\r\nrevision of the wage scale and development of a single supplements' wage scale\r\n(expected to enter into force by end-June 2014); the compilation of the\r\nexisting rules of public sector employment along the structure of the private\r\nlabour code through a new general Public Administration Labour Law; and\r\nconvergence of the pension system of public sector employees (CGA) to the\r\ngeneral regime. Other recent reforms in the public administration include the\r\nimplementation of the strategy of shared services in the area of financial\r\nresources in all structures to be covered by the initiative.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Policy implementation and reforms\r\nin the health sector continue progressing and produce savings through increases\r\nin efficiency. The existence of an important stock of arrears is strongly\r\n(though not solely) related to the consistent underfunding of SOEs hospitals\r\nvis-\u00e0-vis their service provision. The authorities remain committed to\r\nimplementing the ongoing hospital reform and to the\r\ncontinued fine-tuning of the set of measures related to pharmaceuticals,\r\ncentralised procurement and primary care.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further\r\nprogress has been made in implementing growth and competitiveness-enhancing\r\nstructural reforms. The authorities have adopted additional measures to reduce\r\nunemployment and to boost labour market effectiveness. Further improvements to\r\nthe wage bargaining system and actions to reduce the highl level of\r\nsegmentation in the labour market are under discussion. A draft law revising\r\nthe definition of individual fair dismissals in the Labour Code has been sent\r\nto the Parliament after previous amendments were overturned by the Constitutional Court. The system of job search assistance and activation have experienced\r\nfurther progress. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Relevant\r\nreforms in the education system have been implemented so far. The Portuguese\r\nauthorities are commited to continously evaluate and supervise them. Portugal has also approved a decree law creating a short-cycle training course and another\r\none is in the pipeline to revise and harmoinse the rules governing professional\r\nschools of reference.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nGovernment introduced a new levy on energy operators which must be closely\r\nmonitored to avoid that it is passed on to end user prices. Rent-reducing\r\nmeasures to eliminate the energy tariff debt by 2020 and ensure the\r\nsustainaibility of the system seem insufficient. The Government will present additional\r\nmeasures.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite\r\nsome positive developments over the review period, progress in transport\r\nreforms is evolving at a slower pace than expected. A clear long term vision of\r\nthe transport system needs to be delivered, even though some improvement has\r\nbeen made with the prioritisation of infrastrucutre projects. Moreover, the\r\nlegal framework of the Transport Regulator (AMT) has been finalised and it is\r\nexpected to be approved in March 2014. Further policy reforms in the ports\r\nsector are necessary, in order to boost Portugal's competitiveness. As regards\r\nthe railway and urban transport services, the authorities need to increase\r\nefforts to strengthen their financial sustainability, competition and\r\nefficiency.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Progress\r\non the adoption of legislative amendments to transpose the Services Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[3]\r\nhas continued albeit at a modest pace. The Construction\r\nlaws, the law amending the legal regime of universities and the submission to\r\nParliament of the amended professional bodies' bylaws following the adoption of\r\nthe horizontal framework law on public professional associations have\r\nexperienced further delays. Progress was observed in making the Point of Single\r\nContact fully operational.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\r\nthe full implementation of the new legal framework, the urban lease reform is\r\nongoing. Nonetheless, the impact of the reform needs to be continuously\r\nassessed. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\r\nthe adoption of the framework law setting the main principles of the\r\nfunctioning of the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), the bylaws of the\r\nNRAs are being amended accordingly; some of them have already been approved.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures\r\nto improve the licensing environment and reduce the administrative burdens have\r\nadvanced and an inventory of the burdensome regulations is ongoing. However,\r\nthe one-in/one-out rule for new regulations, the measures for environmental and\r\nterritorial planning, and the review of the geological exploration and mining\r\nlicensing regimes are delayed. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nbanks' capital ratios comfortably continued to meet the European Banking\r\nAuthority (EBA) regulatory capital buffers as well as the 10% Core Tier 1\r\nProgramme target. That capital buffer remains adequate across the board when\r\nusing the new Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) IV rules for evaluating the\r\nbanks' own funds. These new capital rules apply since January 2014 with a threshold set at 7% of Common\r\nEquity Tier 1 ratio for all banks and an add-on of 1 percentage point for the\r\nlargest four banks. The system wide loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 117,0% and is likely to decrease further until\r\nthe end-of 2014.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Efforts\r\nto diversify the sources of funding for the corporate sector are being\r\ncontinuously strengthened. The government appointed the\r\nexperts for the committee that sets up a Development Financial Institution\r\n(DFI). The committee is in charge of conceiving the founding documents of the\r\nDFI, notably the by-laws, establishing the strategic business plan and devising\r\nthe structure of the new entity. The DFI's aim is to streamline and centralise\r\nthe implementation of financial instruments supported by the European structural\r\nand investment funds, which relate to the provision of finance for the\r\ncorporate sector.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The authorities agreed to\r\nprepare, in consultation with the Banco de Portugal, a strategic plan aiming at\r\naddressing the corporate debt overhang and supporting the capital reallocation\r\ntowards the productive sectors of the economy, while promoting financial\r\nstability.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to improve the\r\ngovernance, efficiency and risk management practices within the National\r\nGuarantee System (NGS) which manages the government-sponsored credit lines were\r\nimplemented. A new methodology to set the interest rate caps is currently being\r\napplied to guaranteed loans.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe light of these developments, Implementing Decision 2011/344/EU should be amended,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nImplementing Decision 2011/344/EU is hereby\r\namended as follows:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 1, paragraph 2\r\nis replaced by the following:\n\u20182. The financial assistance shall be made\r\navailable during three years and six weeks starting from the first day after\r\nthe entry into force of this Decision.\u2019\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 3, paragraphs 8\r\nand 9 are replaced by the following:\n\u20188. Portugal shall adopt the following measures\r\nduring 2014, in line with specifications in the Memorandum of Understanding:\n(a)         \r\nthe general government deficit shall not exceed\r\n4% of GDP in 2014 and the accummulation of new arrears shall be halted. For the\r\ncalculation of the deficit target, the possible budgetary costs of bank support\r\nmeasures in the context of the government's financial sector strategy shall not\r\nbe taken into account. To achieve this objective, Portugal shall deliver\r\nconsolidation measures worth 2,3% of GDP as defined in the 2014 Budget Law and supporting legislation\r\nadopted with this aim; \n(b)         \r\nto control for potential expenditure slippages,\r\nthe government shall closely monitor the respect of the\r\nministerial expenditure ceilings through monthly reporting to the Council of\r\nMinisters; \n(c)         \r\nPortugal shall swiftly\r\ndefine and implement the envisaged changes in survivors' pensions eligibility\r\nconditions as well as draft the framework law regulating the conditions for the\r\nsale of online gambling licences by mid-March. In addition, Portugal shall make decisive steps to implement the agreed sale of some port concessions;\n(d)        \r\nthe comprehensive reform of the corporate income\r\ntax shall be implemented within the existing budgetary envelope to respect the\r\nfiscal consolidation targets;\n(e)         \r\nthe standstill rule for tax expenditures at\r\ncentral, regional or local level shall be maintained. Efforts to fight tax\r\nevasion and fraud for various types of taxes shall be further strengthened, inter\r\nalia by the monitoring of the e-invoicing system. A study on the shadow\r\neconomy in the housing market shall be carried out in the first quarter of 2014\r\nwith a view to seeking ways to reduce rental tax evasion;\n(f)          \r\nshould adverse legal or other budgetary\r\nexecution risks materialise, Portugal shall implement compensatory measures of\r\nhigh quality in order to meet the deficit target;\n(g)         \r\nthe Government shall specify the measures\r\nnecessary to achieve the fiscal deficit target of no\r\nmore than 2,5 % of GDP in 2015. The detailed plans\r\nshall be reflected in the 2014 Fiscal Strategy Document to be published by\r\nend-April 2014, which shall also specify detailed expenditure ceilings by line\r\nministries. In order to comply with the EU budgetary framework requirements,\r\nthis document shall also provide details of the medium-term budgetary plans;\n(h)         \r\nthe 2015 consolidation strategy shall be\r\nunderpinned, among others, by the following measures: the Government shall\r\ndevelop a single wage scale during 2014 with a view to implementing it in 2015\r\nand aimed at the rationalisation and consistency of remuneration policy across\r\nall careers of the public sector; the single supplements scale, expected to be\r\nimplemented in 2014, shall have its full fiscal impact in 2015; a comprehensive\r\npension reform shall be undertaken, aimed at improving the long-term sustainability\r\nof the pension system. The recently appointed Pension Reform Committee shall\r\ndevelop specific details of the reform. The reform shall include short-term\r\nmeasures further linking pension entitlements to demographic and economic\r\ncriteria while also respecting progressivity principles, in line with the\r\nrecent Constitutional Court ruling on the convergence of the public workers'\r\npension regime (CGA) to the general system. The specific design of this reform shall\r\nbe presented by the time of the Twelfth Review with a draft law to be submitted\r\nto Parliament in the first half of the year. Further steps ensuring the\r\nlong-term sustainability of the pension systems shall be specified. In\r\naddition, the Government shall ensure that the recently increased retirement\r\nage effectively apply to CGA pensioners in 2015; other measures to reach the 2,5\r\npercent of GDP target shall be defined before mid-April;\n(i)           \r\nthe medium-term fiscal strategy shall build on\r\nfurther reforms which are, inter alia, outlined in the Proposal for the Reform\r\nof the State. These reforms shall aim at improving the efficiency of the public\r\nsector and the quality of its services. Building on the first round of\r\nconsultations with social partners, the progress of this agenda shall be\r\ndiscussed at the Twelfth Review;\n(j)           \r\nPortugal shall publish a\r\ntax expenditure report as part of the 2014 Budget covering central, regional\r\nand local administrations;\n(k)         \r\nPortugal shall set up an\r\naccounting function in the Ministry of Finance to improve the public sector\r\naccounting and reporting framework by end-June 2014. As part of its tasks, it\r\nshall ensure an adequate accounting for revenues, expenses, assets and\r\nliabilities related to government bank accounts, debt, and public private\r\npartnerships;\n(l)           \r\nthe Commitment Control Law shall be fully\r\nenforced in all public entities to arrest the creation of new arrears;\n(m)       \r\nPortugal shall take\r\nadditional measures to further strengthen its Public Financial Management\r\nsystem. Portugal shall review the Budget Framework Law (BFL) to fully transpose\r\nthe relevant European Union legislation by end-March. In addition, Portugal shall carry out a more comprehensive revision of the BFL to reduce budgetary\r\nfragmentation by limiting the number of budget entities and reviewing the\r\nclassification of own revenues; to streamline the budget appropriation\r\nstructure; to strengthen accountability; and to further anchor public finances\r\nin a medium-term framework. The key aspects and the structure of the new law\r\nshall be developed by end-April 2014. Portugal shall ensure that the measures\r\nto implement the new budgetary framework at central government level shall also\r\nbe applied at regional and local level;\n(n)         \r\nPortugal shall fully\r\nimplement the new legal and institutional PPPs framework. Renegotiations of\r\nPPPs shall proceed in various sectors in order to contain their budgetary\r\nimpact. Annual reporting on PPPs shall provide a comprehensive assessment of\r\nthe fiscal risks stemming from PPPs and concessions in time for the fiscal\r\nrisks assessment of the budget. Following the new SOEs framework law and in\r\nline with the Ministry of Finance's enhanced shareholder role, a Technical Unit\r\nfor the monitoring of SOEs shall be further staffed. The government shall\r\ncontinue its comprehensive restructuring programme of SOEs with a view to maintain\r\nand strengthen a sustainable operational balance. The Portuguese government\r\nshall continue with the privatisations already in the pipeline;\n(o)         \r\nPortugal shall continue\r\nthe reform agenda towards a modern and more efficient revenue administration in\r\nline with international best practises. Portugal shall announce by March-2014\r\nthe list of 50% of local tax offices to be closed by May 2014. The number of\r\nresources devoted to auditing in the tax administration shall increase by at\r\nleast 30% of the total staff by the twelfth review. A new Taxpayer Services\r\nDepartment, unifying various services for taxpayers, shall be created within\r\nthe tax administration.
