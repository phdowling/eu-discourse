Considerable research work, comparing many\r\ndifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\nFor this reason a codification of rules that\r\nhave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and\r\ntransparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 April 1987 the Commission\r\ndecided[1]\r\nto instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten\r\namendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments\r\nshould endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they\r\nare responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily\r\nunderstandable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Conclusions of the Presidency\r\nof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the\r\nimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a\r\ngiven matter at a given time.\nCodification must be undertaken in full\r\ncompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made\r\nto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament, the\r\nCouncil and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement\r\ndated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the\r\nfast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1506/98 of\r\n13 July 1998 establishing a concession in the form of a\r\nCommunity tariff quota for Turkey in 1998 in respect of hazelnuts and\r\nsuspending certain concessions[3]. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in\r\nit[4]; this proposal fully\r\npreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than\r\nbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the\r\ncodification exercise itself.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The codification proposal was\r\ndrawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in 23 official languages,\r\nof Regulation (EC) No 1506/98 and the instrument amending it, carried out by the Publications\r\nOffice of the European Union, by means of a data-processing system. Where the\r\nArticles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the\r\nnew numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex III to the codified\r\nRegulation.\n\u00ea 1506/98\r\n(adapted)\n2014/0275 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\n\u00a0suspending certain concessions \u00d6 relating\r\nto the import into the Union of agricultural products originating in Turkey \u00d5 (codification)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5, and in\r\nparticular Article \u00d6 207(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00ea \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1506/98[6] has been substantially amended[7]. In the interests of\r\nclarity and rationality, that Regulation should be codified.\n\u00ea 1506/98 recital\r\n1\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the Agreement\r\nestablishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey[8] (\u2018the Agreement\u2019)\r\nconcessions were granted to that country in respect of certain agricultural\r\nproducts.\n\u00ea 1506/98 recital\r\n4 (adapted)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision No 1/98 of the\r\nEC-Turkey Association Council[9]\r\nprovides for the improvement and consolidation of trade preferences relating to\r\nthe import into the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 of\r\nagricultural products originating in Turkey and establishes a series of\r\npreferential concessions for \u00d6 Union \u00d5 exports of\r\nmeat and live animals to Turkey.\n\u00ea 1506/98\r\nrecital 5 (adapted)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turkey has since 1996 been\r\napplying a ban on the import of live animals of the bovine species (CN code\r\n0102) and restrictions on the import of beef (CN codes 0201-0202). Those\r\nmeasures, being quantitative restrictions, are incompatible with the Agreement\r\nand prevent the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 from benefiting\r\nfrom the concessions granted to it under Decision No 1/98. Despite talks\r\nintended to achieve a negotiated solution with Turkey to the problem, the\r\nquantitative restrictions are still in place. \n\u00ea 1506/98 recital\r\n6 (adapted)\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a result of those\r\nmeasures, exports to Turkey of the products in question originating in the \u00d6 Union \u00d5 are blocked. In\r\norder to protect the \u00d6 Union's \u00d5 commercial\r\ninterests, the situation should be counterbalanced by means of equivalent\r\nmeasures. The concessions set out in \u00d6 Annex I \u00d5 to this\r\nRegulation should therefore be suspended. \n\u00ea 255/2014\r\nrecital 6 (adapted)\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of \u00d6 this \u00d5 Regulation,\r\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should\r\nbe exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council[10],\n\u00ea 1506/98 (adapted)\n\u00d6 HAVE \u00d5 ADOPTED THIS\r\nREGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThe two tariff quotas laid down in Annex I\r\nare suspended.\n\u00ea 255/2014\r\nArt. 3.1\nArticle 2\nThe Commission shall, by means of\r\nimplementing acts, terminate the suspension measures referred to in Article 1\r\nonce the barriers to preferential exports from the Union to Turkey have been lifted.
