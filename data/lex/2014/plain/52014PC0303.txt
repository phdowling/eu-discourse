Norway has a National Action Plan on reduced risks on pesticide use for the period\r\n2010-2014. The current action plan is the fourth national plan focusing on\r\nreducing the use and the risks connected with the use of plant protection\r\nproducts. The Action Plan meets, to a large extent, the requirements of the\r\nDirective. Several of the projects run until the end of 2014. Furthermore, due\r\nto a fixed funding cycle, it has already been decided which projects will be\r\nprioritized in 2014. It is thus necessary to have a period of time after 31\r\nDecember 2014 to analyze the results of ongoing projects and to elaborate a new\r\nNational Action plan. \nThe following adaptation concerning Article\r\n4(2) of the Directive is hence proposed by the EFTA side in the draft JCD,\r\nallowing Norway the necessary time to elaborate a new National Action Plan:\n\u201cWith regard to Norway, the words \u201c26\r\nNovember 2012\u201d shall be replaced by the words \u201c1 January 2016\u201d.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n2894/94 concerning arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement provides\r\nthat the Council establishes the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf on such Decisions, on a proposal from the Commission. \nThe Commission submits the Draft Decision\r\nof the EEA Joint Committee for adoption by the Council as the Union\u2019s position.\r\nThe Commission would hope to be able to present it in the EEA Joint Committee\r\nat the earliest possible opportunity.\n2014/0157 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position
