At the end of the negotiations a new draft Agreement\r\nand Protocol were initialled by the negotiators on 25 April 2014. The new\r\nAgreement repeals and replaces the existing Agreement; it covers a period of\r\nfive years from its entry into force, renewable by tacit agreement. The new\r\nProtocol covers a period of five years from the date of provisional application\r\nlaid down in Article 12, that being the date on which it was signed by the\r\nparties.\nThe main aim of the new Agreement is to provide\r\nan updated framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed Common\r\nFisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to establishing a\r\nstrategic partnership between the European Union and the Republic of Senegal in the field of fisheries.\nThe aim of the Protocol is to grant fishing\r\nopportunities to European Union vessels in Senegalese waters taking into\r\naccount available scientific assessments, in particular those of the Fishery\r\nCommittee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF), and in accordance with the\r\nbest available scientific advice and the recommendations of the International\r\nCommission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), within the limits of\r\nthe available surplus. The Commission based its position in part on the results\r\nof a forward-looking assessment, carried out by external experts, of whether a\r\nnew Agreement and Protocol should be concluded. The aim is also to enhance\r\ncooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Senegal to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources\r\nin the Senegalese fishing zones, in the interests of both parties.\nThe Protocol provides for fishing\r\nopportunities in the following categories:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 28 tuna seiners;\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8 pole-and-line vessels;\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2 trawlers (targeting black\r\nhake, a deep-sea demersal species).\nThe method for allocating fishing\r\nopportunities among the Member States should be defined. The Commission\r\nproposes, on this basis, that the Council adopt the Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe interested parties were consulted as\r\npart of the forward-looking assessment of whether a new Fisheries Partnership\r\nAgreement should be entered into by the European Union and the Republic of   Senegal. Experts from the Member States were also consulted in technical\r\nmeetings. These consultations led to the conclusion that it would be beneficial\r\nto renew the Fisheries Agreement and conclude a Fisheries Protocol with the Republic of   Senegal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThis procedure is being initiated in\r\nparallel with the procedures relating to the Council Decision authorising the\r\nsignature and provisional application of the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership\r\nAgreement and the Implementation Protocol thereto, and to the Council Decision\r\non the conclusion of a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the\r\nEuropean Union and the Republic of Senegal and the Implementation Protocol\r\nthereto.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe annual financial contribution has been\r\nset at EUR 1 808 000 for the first year, EUR 1 738 000\r\nfor the second, third and fourth years and EUR 1 668 000 for the\r\nfifth year, based on:\n(a) a reference tonnage of 14 000\r\ntonnes for tunas and a volume of authorised catches of 2 000 tonnes for\r\nblack hake, the amounts linked to such access having been set at EUR 1 058 000\r\nfor the first year, EUR 988 000 for the second, third and fourth\r\nyears, and at EUR 918 000 for the fifth year; and \n(b) support for the development of the\r\nsectoral fisheries policy of the Republic of Senegal amounting to EUR 750 000\r\nper year.
