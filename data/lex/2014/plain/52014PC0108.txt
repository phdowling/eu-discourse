The duty was maintained by means of Council Implementing Regulation\r\n(EU) No 875/2013 (OJ L 244, 13.9.2013,\r\np. 1).\nConsistency\r\nwith other policies and objectives of the Union\nNot applicable.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nInterested\r\nparties concerned by the proceeding have already had the possibility to defend\r\ntheir interests during the investigation, in line with the provisions of the\r\nbasic Regulation.\nCollection\r\nand use of expertise\nThere was no\r\nneed for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThis proposal is the result of the implementation of the basic\r\nRegulation.\nThe basic\r\nRegulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an\r\nexhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nRiver Kwai\r\nInternational Food Industry Co., Ltd (\u2018RKI\u2019), a Thai exporting producer, lodged\r\na request for a partial interim review (limited to dumping). The Commission\r\ninitiated the review on 14 February 2013. \nRKI is subject to the individual anti-dumping duty of 12,8 %. The review\r\ninvestigation established a dumping margin of 3,6 %. \nTherefore, it is\r\nsuggested that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Regulation amending\r\nthe duty for RKI. \nLegal basis\nCouncil\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped\r\nimports from countries not members of the European Community. \nSubsidiarity\r\nprinciple\nThe proposal\r\nfalls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle\r\ntherefore does not apply.\nProportionality\r\nprinciple\nThe proposal\r\ncomplies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe form of action\r\nis described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for\r\nnational decision.\nIndication of\r\nhow financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national\r\ngovernments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is\r\nminimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of\r\ninstruments\nProposed\r\ninstrument: Regulation.\nOther means\r\nwould not be adequate for the following reason:\nThe basic\r\nRegulation does not foresee alternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has\r\nno implication for the Union budget.\n2014/0055 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\namending Council Implementing Regulation\r\n(EU) No 875/2013 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain\r\nprepared or preserved sweetcorn in kernels originating in Thailand following an interim review pursuant of Article 11(3) of Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1225/2009\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union, and in particular Article 291(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\r\ncountries not members of the European Community[1]\r\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019) and in particular 11(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\r\nthe European Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures in force\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following an investigation\r\n(\u2018the original investigation\u2019), the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 682/2007[2], imposed a definitive\r\nanti-dumping duty on imports of certain prepared or preserved sweetcorn in\r\nkernels currently falling within CN codes ex 2001 90 30 and ex 2005 80 00\r\noriginating in Thailand. The measures took the form of an ad valorem\r\nduty ranging between 3,1 % and 12,9 %.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation (EC) No\r\n954/2008[3]\r\nthe Council amended the measures in force with regard to one exporting producer\r\nand consequently the rate applicable to \u2018all other companies\u2019, thereafter ranging\r\nbetween 3,1 % and 14,3 %.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following an expiry review\r\npursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation the Council maintained the\r\nduty ranging between 3,1 % and 14,3 % by means of Council Implementing Regulation\r\n(EU) No 875/2013[4]\r\n(\u2018the expiry review\u2019).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Request for a review\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Commission\r\n('the Commission') received a request for a partial interim review pursuant to\r\nArticle 11(3) of the basic Regulation. This request was lodged by River Kwai\r\nInternational Food Industry Co. Ltd. (\u2018the applicant\u2019), an exporting producer\r\nfrom Thailand.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request was limited in\r\nscope to the examination of dumping as far as the applicant was concerned. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its request, the\r\napplicant provided prima facie evidence that, as far as the dumping by\r\nthe applicant is concerned, the circumstances on the basis of which the\r\nmeasures in force were imposed have changed and that these changes were of a lasting\r\nnature. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In particular, the\r\napplicant claimed that the changed circumstances relate to changes in the\r\nproduct range it commercialises which have a direct impact on cost of\r\nproduction thereof. A comparison of its domestic prices with its export prices\r\nto the Union indicated that the dumping margin appeared to be lower than the current\r\nlevel of measures.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation of a partial\r\ninterim review\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission determined,\r\nafter consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed to\r\njustify the initiation of a partial interim review limited to the examination\r\nof dumping as far as the applicant is concered. On this basis, it announced by\r\na notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union[5] on 14 February\r\n2013 (\u2018the notice of initiation\u2019), the initiation of a partial interim review\r\npursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review investigation\r\nperiod \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation of\r\ndumping covered the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 December 2012 (\u2018the review\r\ninvestigation period\u2019 or \u2018RIP\u2019).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the\r\ninvestigation \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\r\nadvised the applicant, representatives of the exporting country as well as the\r\nassociation of Union producers (Association Europ\u00e9enne des Transformateurs de\r\nMa\u00efs Doux 'AETMD') of the initiation of the interim review.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties were\r\ngiven the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a\r\nhearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The written comments\r\nsubmitted by AETMD were considered and, where appropriate, taken into account.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to obtain the\r\ninformation necessary for its investigation, the Commission sent a\r\nquestionnaire to the applicant and received a reply within the deadline set for\r\nthat purpose.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sought and\r\nverified all information deemed necessary for the determination of dumping. The\r\nCommision carried out a verification visit at the premises of the applicant in Thailand in Bangkok and Kanchanaburi.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRODUCT\r\nCONCERNED ANDF LIKE PRODUCT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product concerned\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product under this\r\nreview is the same as the one defined in the original and the expiry review investigations,\r\nnamely sweetcorn (Zea mays var. saccharata) in kernels, prepared or\r\npreserved by vinegar or acetic acid, not frozen, currently falling within CN code\r\nex 2001 90 30, and sweetcorn (Zea mays var. saccharata) in kernels,\r\nprepared or preserved otherwise than by vinegar or acetic acid, not frozen,\r\nother than products of heading 2006, currently falling within CN code ex 2005\r\n80 00, originating in Thailand.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like product\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nestablished in the original investigation and confirmed in the expiry review\r\nsweetcorn produced and sold in the Union and sweetcorn produced and sold in Thailand\r\nwas found to have essentially the same physical and chemical characteristics\r\nand the same basic uses as sweetcorn produced in Thailand and sold for export\r\nto the Union. They are therefore considered to be alike within the meaning of\r\nArticle 1(4) of the basic Regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DUMPING\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Determination of Normal Value\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nfirst sentence of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, the Commission first\r\nestablished whether the applicant\u2019s total domestic sales of the like product\r\nduring the RIP were representative. The domestic sales are representative if\r\nthe total domestic sales volume of the like product represented at least 5 % of\r\nthe total export sales volume of the product concerned to the Union during the RIP.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Total domestic sales of the\r\nlike product were found to be representative.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission subsequently\r\nidentified the product types sold domestically that were identical or directly\r\ncomparable with the types sold for export to the Union.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For each of these product\r\ntypes, the Commission established whether domestic sales were sufficiently\r\nrepresentative in accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. The domestic\r\nsales of a product type are representative, if the total volume of domestic sales\r\nof this product type to independent customers during the RIP represents at\r\nleast 5 % of the total volume of export sales to the Union of the\r\nidentical or comparable product type.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission established\r\nthat, for all the product types sold for export to the Union, the applicant\u2019s\r\ndomestic sales were made in representative quantities. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Next, the Commission defined\r\nthe proportion of profitable sales to independent customers on the domestic\r\nmarket for each product type during the RIP in order to decide whether to use\r\nactual domestic sales for the calculation of the normal value in accordance\r\nwith Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nnormal value is based on the actual domestic price per product type\r\nirrespective of whether these sales are profitable or not, if\n\u2013              \r\nthe sales volume of the product type, sold at a\r\nnet sales price equal to or above the calculated cost of production, represented\r\nmore than 80 % of the total sales volume of this product type, and\n\u2013              \r\nthe weighted average sales price of this product\r\ntype is equal to or higher than the unit cost of production. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission's analysis of domestic sales showed that more than 90 % of domestic\r\nsales were profitable and that the weighted average sales price was higher than\r\nthe unit cost of production. Accordingly, the normal value was calculated as a\r\nweighted average of the prices of all domestic sales during the RIP. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Determination of the\r\nExport price\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All sales by the applicant for\r\nexport to the Union were made directly to unrelated customers in the Union or Thailand. The export price is therefore established, on the basis of prices paid or payable\r\nin accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission compared the\r\nnormal value and the export price on an ex-works basis.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where justified, the\r\nCommission adjusted the normal value and/or the export price for differences\r\naffecting prices and price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of\r\nthe basic Regulation.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adjustments for differences\r\nin transport costs, insurance costs, handling and loading costs, packaging, commissions,\r\ncredit costs and bank charges were granted when applicable and duly justified. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\napplicant claimed an allowance under Article 2(10)(d) of the basic Regulation for\r\na difference in brand value when sold under own brand on the domestic market\r\nand when sold under own brand on the Union market. Allegedly, the brand value\r\nof the applicant's own brand is higher on the Thai market than on the Union\r\nmarket. To justify its claim the applicant made reference to the adjustment\r\nmade in the original investigation and in the expiry review. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the applicant\u2019s\r\nsituation in the present interim review differs from the situation of other\r\nexporting producers for which the adjustment was granted in the original and\r\nexpiry review investigation. The adjustment made in the original investigation\r\nand in the expiry review specifically refers to exporting producers whose sales\r\non the domestic market are carrying their own brand whereas sales to the Union are sold under retailer's brand. In the present interim review, the\r\napplicant\u2019s sales both on the domestic market and on the Union market carry its\r\nown brand. Moreover, the adjustment made in the original and expiry review\r\ninvestigations was made to the profit margin when constructing the normal value\r\nin accordance with Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation. However, in the\r\npresent interim review, the normal value is based on applicant\u2019s actual\r\ndomestic prices.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the alleged lack\r\nof brand value when selling to the Union market, the importer of the product\r\nconcerned carrying the applicant\u2019s brand is specialized in imports of branded\r\nfood products, in particular from Asia. The applicant failed to clarify or\r\nprovide evidence why sales to this particular importer would carry a lower value\r\nthan the brand value on the applicant\u2019s domestic market. Consequently, the\r\nCommission concluded that the applicant has not demonstrated that the alleged\r\ndifference in brand value has an impact on prices or price comparability.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The applicant also claimed\r\nthe same adjustment under Article 2(10)(k) of the basic Regulation. However,\r\nsince the applicant has not demonstrated that the alleged difference has an\r\nimpact on prices or price comparability, the allowance could not be accepted\r\nunder this provision either.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The claim for an allowance\r\nunder Article 2(10)(d) and Article 2(10)(k) is therefore rejected.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With reference to Article\r\n2(10)(b) of the basic Regulation, the applicant also claimed an allowance for a\r\ngovernment-paid export tax rebate. An amount is paid to the applicant by the\r\ngovernment when the product concerned is sold for export, including to the\r\nUnion market.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The applicant could\r\ndemonstrate that an amount equivalent to less than 0,5 % of the invoice value\r\nis paid to the applicant for exports to the Union market. However, in\r\naccordance with Article 2(10)(b) of the basic regulation, an adjustment is to\r\nbe made to the normal value if the conditions set in this Article are met and\r\nnot to the export price as claimed by the applicant. Furthermore, the\r\ninvestigation showed that no direct link could be established between the\r\npayment received by the applicant in respect of the product concerned when\r\nexported to the Union and import charges for the raw materials physically\r\nincorporated therein. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The company also claimed\r\nthe same adjustment under Article 2(10)(k). However, since the applicant failed\r\nto demonstrate any link between the export tax rebate and the pricing of the\r\nexported product concerned, the claim could not be accepted.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The claim for an allowance for\r\nexport tax rebate under Article 2(10)(b) and Article 2(10)(k) is therefore\r\nrejected.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping during the RIP\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The weighted average normal\r\nvalue of each type of the product concerned exported to the Union was compared\r\nwith the weighted average export price of the corresponding type of the product\r\nconcerned, as provided for in Article 2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, the weighted\r\naverage dumping margin expressed as a percentage of the CIF Union frontier\r\nprice, duty unpaid, was found to be 3,6 %.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LASTING NATURE OF\r\nCHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n11(3) of the basic Regulation, the Commission examined whether the\r\ncircumstances on the basis of which the current dumping margin was based have\r\nchanged and whether that change was of a lasting nature.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its request for a\r\nreview, the applicant had referred to changes in the product range it\r\ncommercialises which would have a direct impact on the cost of production\r\nthereof. The investigation has confirmed that, due to a corporate\r\nrestructuring, the applicant does no longer produce and sell certain products\r\nwhich it did in the original investigation, and that this has had an impact on\r\nthe cost of production for the product concerned.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AETMD has commented that\r\nthe re-structuring carried out by the applicant may not be of lasting nature as\r\nit could easily be reversed.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis indeed possible that the management of the applicant, if it so wishes, would\r\nbe in a position to reverse the re-structuring. However, there is no evidence\r\nsuggesting that the applicant\u2019s decision to re-structure and to streamline the\r\ncommercialization of the group\u2019s products between the group\u2019s companies would\r\nnot be of a lasting nature. In addition, the restructuring already took place by\r\n2009 which indicates that the new corporate structure is of a lasting nature.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, AETMD\r\nreiterated its claim that the change on basis of which the review was initiated\r\ncould not be considered as of a lasting nature. More specifically, it\r\nquestioned the impact on the cost of production due to the internal\r\nreorganisation within the group, claiming that costs within the group can simply\r\nbe reallocated in order to lower the normal value. For this reason, the new\r\ncost of production could not be considered as being of a lasting nature. AETMD\r\nalso noted that the subsidiary responsible for production and sales of fresh\r\nproducts shares the same address as the applicant. AETMD claimed that this is\r\nanother indication that the reorganisation is not profound and lasting.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to AETMD's\r\nclaims in the preceding recital, the applicant stressed that the reorganisation\r\nalso entailed an improved cost accounting system whereby bottlenecks were\r\nidentified and resolved in order to optimize production and to reduce manufacturing\r\ncosts. The applicant also stressed that any reversal of the 2009-reorganisation\r\nat this stage would be a very complex process as the mother-company to the\r\napplicant, Agripure Holding PLC, is listed on the Thai Stock Exchange. \n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The risk for a potential reversal\r\nof the applicant's re-organisation has already been addressed in recital (43)\r\nabove.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, for the purpose\r\nof verifying the accuracy of the claims in the request for the initiation of\r\nthe present review, the Commission made a comparison of the cost of production\r\nfor the product types exported to the Union during the original investigation\r\n(i.e. before the applicant's reorganisation in 2009) and during the RIP. This\r\ncomparison has indeed confirmed that the manufacturing cost per unit have\r\nchanged to a significant degree. The change in manufacturing costs per unit\r\nidentified goes beyond a simple reallocation of costs and is due to a real\r\ndecrease in indirect costs of production such as manufacturing overheads and\r\nlabour costs. \n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As to the question of the\r\napplicant and its subsidiary sharing the same administrative address, this is a\r\ncommon practise in corporate business. Moreover, during the verification visit\r\nto the applicant's premises, the Commission noted that the production lines and\r\nstorage of finished goods within the premises were dedicated to sweet corn\r\nproduction; there was no visible trace of the production and storage of the fresh\r\nproducts sold by the subsidiary.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to the\r\narguments of AETMD and of the applicant, and having identified a de facto\r\ndecrease in the cost of manufacturing per unit between the original\r\ninvestigation and the RIP, the argument put forward by AETMD has to be\r\nrejected.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AETMD has also submitted\r\nthat the applicant planned to increase its production capacity during 2013 by\r\nsome 40 %. According to AETMD, this fact would go against the applicant\u2019s claim\r\nthat the new, revised cost of production (which followed the re-structuring)\r\nwould be of lasting nature.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ninvestigation has indeed confirmed that the applicant is in the process of\r\nincreasing its production capacity. The impact of the increased capacity has\r\nbeen one of the factors on which basis it was concluded that there was a risk\r\nfor continuation of dumping in the expiry review[6].\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, AETMD\r\nreiterated the claim that the investment into new production capacity will\r\nnecessarily have an effect on the cost of production and therefore, the prevailing\r\ncost of production against which the domestic prices were compared in this\r\nreview (see recital (24)), is not of a lasting nature. In particular, AETMD\r\nmade a calculation based on available sources on which basis it concluded that\r\nthe total costs would increase due to increased depreciation by some 10 % as\r\ncompared to the current costs.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The applicant did not\r\ncontradict AETMD's claim concerning increased depreciation costs per se,\r\nbut stressed that these increased costs of depreciation is to be offset by\r\nincreases in total revenues (through increased sales) and by decreases in other\r\ncosts as a result of increased automation.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nmentioned in recital (51), the applicant is indeed in the process of investing\r\nin new production facilities. Investments into new facilities may entail increase\r\nof cost for depreciation. On the other hand and as\r\nthe applicant pointed out in response to AETMD's comment, new production\r\nfacilities may also entail changes (as compared to existing production lines)\r\nsuch as the level of automation. These changes should have a direct decreasing effect\r\non the labour and energy costs and could offset the increases for the cost of\r\ndepreciation. \u00a0\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On balance, it is concluded\r\nthat the overall impact on the cost of production per unit produced cannot\r\nbe measured until the new installations have been inaugurated and any\r\nadditional costs reflected in the accounts. \n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless and having\r\nregard to the objective of the investment (increased efficiency and \u00a0competitiveness,\r\nto reduce manufacturing costs per unit), it is expected that at least in the\r\nmedium to long term there will be no significant increase in the cost of\r\nproduction per unit. In such circumstances it is expected that the normal value\r\nwill still be based on domestic prices as in the present review. The argument brought\r\nforward by AETMD must therefore be rejected.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, AETMD\r\nalso questioned the lasting nature of the new dumping margin. It argued that the\r\nbasis of the export prices used for the calculation of the dumping margin were\r\nnot representative. More specifically, it argued that \n(a)         \r\nthe number of tonnes exported during the RIP\r\nwere too small to be considered representative, and\n(b)         \r\nwith reference to recital (29), the fact that\r\nthe export transactions of own-branded products made up almost half of\r\nthe all exports during the RIP, the export prices should be deemed unrepresentative.\r\nAETMD considered that, should the proposed decrease of measures enter into\r\nforce, the major portion of exports to the Union are more likely to be of\r\nretailers' brand carrying lower export prices[7].\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due\r\nto the fact that the quantities exported to the Union were not significant, the\r\nCommission ascertained itself that the applicant's export prices paid or\r\npayable to the Union were\r\nrepresentative by comparing them with applicant's export prices paid or payable\r\nto other third countries. On this basis, it was concluded that the prices to\r\nthe Union were consistent with those charged to customers in other export\r\nmarkets.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The existence of different market\r\nsegments, own brand and the retailers brand, have been acknowledged during the\r\ncourse of earlier investigations[8].\r\nIt constitutes one important part of the definition of different product types within\r\nthe scope of the product concerned. On this basis, exports of own-brand\r\nproducts have been compared with domestic sales of own-brand products\r\nand export sales of retailers' brand have been compared with domestic sales of\r\nretailers' brand.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The claim by AETMD that future\r\nexports will mainly be constituted by retailers' brand is speculative, not supported\r\nby evidence and as such insufficient to put into question the representativity\r\nof the exports of own-brand products during the RIP. The claim by AETMD is\r\ntherefore rejected.\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AETMD also claimed that the\r\ndecrease of the duty to a lower level could lead to the risk for circumvention\r\nof the measures.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that the\r\nduties in force are already differentiated between the Thai exporting\r\nproducers. Thus, the risk for circumvention (i.e. using the TARIC additional code\r\nwith lower duties) has been present since the introduction of the original\r\nmeasures. The lower duty for one of these exporting producers does not per\r\nse increase the risk for circumvention from Thailand as a whole. \n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, should\r\ninformation become available suggesting that the duties are undermined by way\r\nof circumvention, an investigation can be initiated as appropriate provided\r\nthat conditions set in Article 13 of the basic Regulation are met.\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AETMD also stated that the\r\napplicant may have artificially increased the export prices to the Union by way of cross-compensation with parallel sales of other products at artificially\r\nlow prices.\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated in recital (58)\r\nabove, export prices to the Union of the product concerned were in line with\r\nthose to third countries. Thus, there are no indications that export prices to\r\nthe Union were artificially high during the RIP and the argument is therefore\r\nrejected.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the results of\r\nthe investigation, the Commission considers it appropriate to amend the\r\nanti-dumping duty applicable to imports of the product concerned from River\r\nKwai International Food Industry Co. Ltd.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, and upon request\r\nfrom the applicant, its address in Thailand is also changed.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DISCLOSURE\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties were\r\ninformed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was\r\nintended to recommend an amendment to Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No\r\n875/2013.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, the Thai\r\ngovernment argued that the average duty rate for co-operating non-sampled\r\nexporters should also be revised in order to\r\ntake account of the findings of this partial interim review. It should be noted\r\nthat this claim goes beyond the limited scope of the current review which only\r\naims at adjusting the level of the existing anti-dumping duty rate for the\r\napplicant. Any request to amend the level of the anti- dumping duty rates\r\nfollowing an alleged change in circumstances should be presented pursuant to\r\nArticle 11(3) of the basic Regulation. Therefore, this claim has to be rejected,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The entry concerning River Kwai\r\nInternational Food Industry Co., Ltd in the table of Article 1(2) of Council\r\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 875/2013 is hereby replaced by the following: \n Company || Anti-Dumping duty (%) || TARIC Additional Code \n River Kwai International Food Industry Co., Ltd, 99 Moo 1 Thanamtuen Khaupoon Road Kaengsian, Muang, Kanchanaburi 71000 Thailand || 3,6 || A791 \nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No 682/2007 of 18 June 2007\r\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the\r\nprovisional duty imposed on imports of certain prepared or preserved sweetcorn\r\nin kernels originating in Thailand (OJ L 159, 20.6.2007, p. 14).\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No 954/2008 of 25 September\r\n2008 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 682/2007 imposing a definitive\r\nanti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on\r\nimports of certain prepared or preserved sweetcorn in kernels originating in Thailand (OJ L 260, 30.9.2008, p. 1). \n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 875/2013 of 2\r\nSeptember 2013 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain\r\nprepared or preserved sweetcorn in kernels originating in Thailand following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1225/2009 (OJ L 244, 13.9.2013, p. 1).\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C 42, 14.2.2013, p. 7.\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See recitals (49) to (75) of the expiry review.\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See recital (86) of the expiry review.\n[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See recital (85) of the expiry review.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
