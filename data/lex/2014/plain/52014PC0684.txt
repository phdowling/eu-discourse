At the end of the negotiations a new draft protocol was initialled by the\r\nnegotiators on 19 June 2014. The new Protocol\r\ncovers a period of four years from the date of provisional application laid\r\ndown in Article 15 \u2013 i.e. from the date of its signature and\r\n1 January 2015 at the earliest.\nThe primary\r\nobjective behind the Protocol to the Agreement is to define the fishing\r\nopportunities for vessels from the European Union in the fishing zone of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar, in line with the management measures adopted by the\r\nrelevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisation, namely the Indian Ocean\r\nTuna Commission (IOTC) and where relevant, in keeping with the limits of the\r\navailable surplus. The Commission based itself in part on the results of an\r\nex-post evaluation carried out by external experts.\nThe general aim is to enhance the\r\ncooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Madagascar, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable\r\nfisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the Malagasy\r\nfishing zone, in the interests of both Parties.\nMore specifically, the\r\nProtocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories:\n\u00b7      40 tuna seiners;\n\u00b7      32 surface longliners with a tonnage greater than 100 GT\n\u00b7      22 surface longliners with a tonnage less than or equal to 100 GT.\nThe Commission proposes, on this basis,\r\nthat the Council, with the consent of the Parliament, adopt this new Protocol\r\nby Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe interested parties were consulted\r\nduring the evaluation of the Protocol for the period 2013-14.
