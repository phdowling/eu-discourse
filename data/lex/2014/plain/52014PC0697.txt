At the end of the negotiations a new draft\r\nprotocol was initialled by the negotiators on 28 August 2014. The new Protocol\r\ncovers a period of four years from the date of provisional application laid\r\ndown in Article 15, that being the date on which it is signed.\nThe main purpose of the Protocol to the\r\nAgreement is to grant fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the fishing\r\nzone of the Republic of Cape Verde, in accordance with the best scientific\r\nopinions available and the recommendations of the International Commission for\r\nthe Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), where applicable within the limits\r\nof the available surplus. The Commission's negotiating position was based in\r\npart on the results of an ex-post evaluation of the previous Protocol carried\r\nout by external experts.\nThe general aim is to enhance cooperation\r\nbetween the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde, thereby creating a\r\npartnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy\r\nand sound exploitation of fishery resources in the fishing zone of the Republic of   Cape Verde, in the interests of both parties.\nThe Protocol provides for fishing\r\nopportunities in the following categories:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 28 tuna seiners\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 30 surface longliners\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13 pole-and-line tuna vessels.\nThe method for allocating fishing\r\nopportunities among the Member States should be defined. The Commission\r\nproposes, on this basis, that the Council adopt the Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe interested parties were consulted\r\nduring the evaluation of the Protocol for the period 2011-14. Experts from the\r\nMember States were also consulted in technical meetings. These consultations\r\nled to the conclusion that it would be beneficial to maintain a fishing\r\nprotocol with the Republic of Cape Verde.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThis procedure is being initiated in\r\nparallel with the procedures relating to the Council Decision on the conclusion\r\nof the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial\r\ncontribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the\r\nEuropean Union and the Republic of Cape Verde, and to the Council Decision\r\nauthorising the signature and provisional application of the Protocol itself.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe annual financial contribution is EUR\r\n550 000 the first two years and EUR 500 000 the last two years, based on (a) a\r\nreference tonnage of 5 000 tonnes, for which an amount linked to access has\r\nbeen set at EUR 275 000 the first two years and EUR 250 000 the last two\r\nyears, and (b) support for development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the\r\nRepublic of Cape Verde, amounting to EUR 275 000 per year the first two years\r\nand EUR 250 000 per year the last two years. This support meets the\r\nobjectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the needs of the Republic of   Cape Verde in its fight against illegal fishing.\n2014/0330 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non the allocation of fishing opportunities\r\nunder the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial\r\ncontribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the\r\nEuropean Union and the Republic of Cape Verde\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 19 December 2006, the\r\nCouncil adopted Regulation (EC) No 2027/2006 on the conclusion of the\r\nFisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of   Cape Verde[1].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A new Protocol to the\r\nPartnership Agreement was initialled on 28 August 2014.
