It contained a revision to Directive\r\n98/70/EC[1]\r\non the quality of petrol and diesel.\nThe revised Directive obliges suppliers[2] to reduce by 6% the\r\nlife cycle greenhouse gas intensity of fuel and other (electric) energy\r\nsupplied for use in road vehicles and of fuel for use in non-road mobile\r\nmachinery by the end of the compliance period in 2020. The target would also\r\nfacilitate meeting Member States\u2019 non-ETS targets. The article establishing\r\nthis new element is Article 7a of the Directive which effectively establishes a\r\n\"low carbon fuel standard\" in Union legislation. The Directive also\r\nobliges suppliers to report from 2011 information on, inter alia, the\r\ngreenhouse gas intensity of the fuel they have supplied to authorities\r\ndesignated by the Member States. \nThe 6% reduction is likely to be achieved\r\nthrough the use of biofuels, electricity and a reduction in the flaring and\r\nventing of gases at the extraction stage of fossil fuel feedstocks.\nArticle 7a(5) requires the Commission to\r\nintroduce any measures necessary for the implementation of Article 7a to be adopted\r\nthrough the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. Consequently, the Commission is\r\nempowered to adopt implementing measures concerning the mechanism to monitor\r\nand reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, the Commission was asked to\r\nconsider proposals for:\n\u2013              \r\nA method for calculating greenhouse gas\r\nemissions of fuels and other energy from non-biological sources (elements\r\ndealing with the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions for biofuels are\r\nalready included in Annex IV of the Directive);\n\u2013              \r\nA method for calculating the baseline fossil\r\nfuel greenhouse gas intensity to be used as a reference for measuring\r\ncompliance with the target;\n\u2013              \r\nCalculation and verification of the greenhouse\r\ngas intensity of electric energy used in electric vehicles;\n\u2013              \r\nAny rules necessary to give effect to the\r\nrequirement that two or more suppliers from one or more Member States are\r\nallowed to report their greenhouse gas intensity jointly;\n\u2013              \r\nAny other measures necessary for the\r\nimplementation of Article7a.\nThis draft Directive addresses all five\r\nelements outlined above. \nArticle 7a(1) of Directive 98/70/EC defines\r\nthe supplier reporting obligations. These are supplemented with harmonized\r\ndefinitions for the reported data and reporting requirements addressing Member State reporting to the Commission on the greenhouse gas performance of fuels consumed in\r\nthe Union. In particular, these reporting requirements will enable the updating\r\nof the fossil fuel comparator described in Annex IV, Part C, Point 19 of\r\nDirective 98/70/EC and Annex V, Part C, Point 19 of Directive 2009/28/EC, will\r\nfacilitate the reporting required pursuant to Article 8(3) and Article 9(2) of\r\nDirective 98/70/EC.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nA public consultation[3] was launched in July\r\n2009 which focussed on the issues to be addressed in the draft Directive. In\r\nJanuary 2010 a stakeholder meeting was held comprising the fossil and biofuel\r\nindustries, Member States and NGOs. In March 2010 the Commission Services\r\ndiscussed a concept paper with the Member States with a view to developing the\r\ndraft Directive. In addition, the Commission has relied upon the following work\r\nin formulating the current proposal:\n\u2013              \r\nThe work of the JEC and its \"well to\r\nwheels\" study [4];\n\u2013              \r\nThe Brandt study on natural bitumen [5],\n\u2013              \r\nThe Brandt study on oil shale [6],\n\u2013              \r\nThe ICCT study on other crude oils[7].\nThe work by Dr Brandt was subjected to an\r\nexternal peer-review process whose findings were discussed with stakeholders at\r\na public meeting on 27 May 2011[8].\r\nThe work by ICCT was also subjected to a peer review process whose findings\r\nwere discussed with stakeholders at a public meeting on 20 February 2014[9].\nIn 2013, following inconclusive discussions\r\nwith the Committee on Fuel on the draft Directive[10] harmonising the method\r\nfor calculating greenhouse gas emissions from fuels of non-biological origin\r\nand electricity in road vehicles, the Commission prepared an impact assessment\r\nin order to evaluate all proposed implementing options. The approach\r\nunderpinning this assessment was presented during two stakeholder workshops\r\nheld on 20 December 2012 and 15 April 2013[11].\nIn parallel the Commission attempted to\r\nascertain whether industry required the development of rules for suppliers who\r\ncould meet their reduction target jointly. Despite several requests in this\r\nrespect, industry did not respond. The Commission has therefore concluded that\r\nno specific rules are at present necessary, apart from harmonised definitions\r\nand a reporting mechanism..\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe main features of the draft Directive\r\nregarding the method for calculating greenhouse gas emissions of fuels and\r\nother energy from non-biological sources are: \n\u2013              \r\nThe use of one average default value to\r\nrepresent the unit greenhouse gas intensity per fuel type;\n\u2013              \r\nHarmonized annual reporting by Suppliers to\r\nMember States and Member States to the Commission needed for monitoring the\r\nreduction of GHG emissions in the Union and for the updating the calculation\r\nmethods to technical and scientific progress;\nGenesis of the selected calculation\r\nmethod and reporting requirements\nThe work underpinning the impact assessment\r\nfocused on analysing the accuracy of the evaluated greenhouse gas calculation\r\nmethods and the related cost of compliance and administrative burden suppliers\r\nand the Member States would incur for complying with Article 7a of Directive\r\n98/70/EC. \nInaccurate reporting undermines the\r\nachievement of the Fuel Quality Directive's greenhouse gas intensity target and\r\nunfairly affects the way efforts are shared amongst fuel suppliers. Accuracy of\r\nthe calculation method depends upon the method chosen and the accuracy of the\r\nunderlying data. Methods based on higher degrees of differentiation of\r\nfeedstocks yield more accurate results. The accuracy of the reported data is also\r\nclosely related to information on emissions from extraction and processing of\r\nfeedstocks (\u201cupstream emissions\u201d). The data[12] underpinning values\r\nincluded in the draft measure discussed with the Committee on Fuel Quality are\r\nbased on voluntary reporting from the Oil and Gas Producers Association,\r\nreflects less than half of the crude oil refined in the Union and does not\r\nprovide information on imported products. The latest studies and data on\r\nfeedstocks used for producing 60%[13]\r\nto 90%7 of fossil\r\nfuels consumed in the Union suggest that the life cycle average emissions are\r\napproximately 5% higher than the data presented to the Committee on Fuel\r\nQuality in the 2011 proposal. This is largely attributed to significantly higher\r\nand widely varying upstream carbon emissions of fossil fuels. Significant\r\ndifferences exist in the upstream greenhouse gas intensity of conventional\r\nfeedstocks and the production of unconventional sources of oil often exhibit\r\nhigher greenhouse gas intensities. Hence, the accuracy of the reported\r\nemissions will improve through harmonized data reporting.\nThe accuracy of the calculation method is\r\nstrongly correlated with the fraction of high intensity feedstocks used in the\r\nproduction of the fuel. It is therefore necessary to harmonise reporting\r\nrelated to the origin[14]\r\nand the place of purchase[15]\r\nof the fuel. Such reporting must, however, be coherent with existing Union\r\nlegislation on the registration of crude oil imports and deliveries in the EU[16]. \u00a0\nAccording to the analysis underlying this\r\nproposal the total additional cost per litre of fuel for all calculation\r\nmethods considered varied from 0.03 Euro cents to 0.04 Euro cents. The largest\r\nincrease was noted if suppliers were obliged to report greenhouse gas values\r\nbased on supplier-specific emissions or Union average emissions per each\r\nfeedstock used as opposed to a Union average per fuel type for all feedstocks.\r\nThis suggests that the optimum option should not require suppliers to report\r\nfeedstock-specific greenhouse gas values. Hence, the proposed methodology\r\nrequires suppliers to report a Union average greenhouse gas emission intensity\r\nper each fuel.\nArticle 7a(4) of Directive 98/70/EC\r\nforesees that groups of suppliers may choose to meet the 6% reduction\r\nobligation jointly and that Article 7a(5)(c) of Directive 98/70/EC allows for\r\nthe establishment of \u201cany necessary rules\u201d to put this into effect. Hence, it\r\nis necessary to harmonize the definitions of the supplier identification, the\r\nvolume of fuel or energy, the fuel or energy type, the place of purchase and\r\nthe origin of the fuel or energy placed on the market to facilitate the use of\r\na common reporting scheme for suppliers from multiple Member States agreeing to\r\nreport jointly. Furthermore, to verify that double counting is avoided in cross\r\nborder, joint supplier reporting, it is appropriate to harmonise Member State\r\nreporting to the Commission so that the requisite information pertaining to\r\neach supplier forming a group of two or more suppliers from one or more Member\r\nStates can be made available to all affected Member State authorities.\nIt is appropriate for Member States to\r\nallow suppliers to report by using data being collected pursuant to other Union or national legislation so as to reduce the administrative burden provided that the\r\nreporting is conducted in accordance with the requirements outlined in Annex\r\nIV. Such Union legislation includes but is not limited to Commission Regulation\r\n(EC) No 684/2009 of 24 July 2009 implementing Council Directive 2008/118/EC as\r\nregards the computerised procedures for the movement of excise goods under\r\nsuspension of excise duty[17],\r\nCommission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions\r\nfor the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the\r\nCommunity Customs Code[18],\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1099/2008 on energy statistics[19], Directive 2009/28/EC\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion\r\nof the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently\r\nrepealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC[20]\r\nand subsequent implementing acts thereof, Commission Decision 2007/589/EC of 18\r\nJuly 2007 establishing guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of\r\ngreenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council[21]\r\nas well as Council Regulation 2964/95 introducing registration for crude oil\r\nimports and deliveries in the Community.\n\u00a0Financial impacts\nCompetitiveness of the Union industry was\r\nalso discussed in the impact assessment. It appears that no significant impacts\r\non businesses (including refineries) are expected. This stems from the fact\r\nthat the expected pump price increases are negligible and virtually all these costs\r\nare expected to be passed through according to the impact assessment. \n2014/0286 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\non laying down calculation methods and\r\nreporting requirements pursuant to Directive 98/70/EC of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council relating to the quality of petrol and diesel\r\nfuels\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Directive 98/70/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the\r\nquality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC[22], and in particular Article 7a(5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nmethod for calculating greenhouse gas emissions of fuels and other energy from\r\nnon-biological sources to be established pursuant to Article 7a(5) of Directive\r\n98/70/EC should yield reporting of sufficient accuracy so that the Commission\r\ncould critically assess the performance of fuel suppliers in meeting their\r\nobligations under Article 7a(2) of Directive 98/70/EC. The calculation method\r\nshould ensure measurement accuracy while having due regard for the complexity\r\nof the associated administrative requirements. At the same time, it should incentivise\r\nsuppliers to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuel they supply. Careful consideration should also be given\r\nto the impact of the methodology on refineries in the Union. Hence, the calculation method should be\r\nbased on average greenhouse gas intensities that represent an industry average\r\nvalue which is typical for a particular fuel source (\"average default\r\nvalues\"). This has the advantage of reducing the administrative burden on\r\nsuppliers and Member States. At this time, the proposed methodology should not\r\nrequire the differentiation of the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel on the\r\nbasis of the source of the raw material as this would affect current\r\ninvestments in certain refineries in the Union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reporting requirements for\r\nfuel suppliers which are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as defined\r\nin Commission Recommendation 2003/61 should be minimised as far as in possible\r\nin the context of Article 7a(1) of Directive 98/70/EC. Similarly, importers of\r\npetrol and diesel refined outside the EU should not be obliged to provide detailed\r\ninformation about the sources of the crude oils used to make those fuels as\r\nthis information may not be available or difficult to obtain.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to incentivise\r\nfurther greenhouse gas emission reductions, savings claimed from upstream\r\nemission reductions including from flaring and venting should be included in\r\nthe calculation of suppliers' life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. In order to\r\nfacilitate the claiming of upstream emissions savings by fuel suppliers, the\r\nuse of various emission schemes should be allowed for calculating and\r\ncertifying emission reductions. Only upstream reduction projects which start\r\nafter the date of the establishment of the baseline set out in Article 7a(5)(b)\r\ni.e. 1 January 2011 should be eligible.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Weighted average\r\ngreenhouse gas default values provide a simple method by which fuel suppliers\r\nmay determine the greenhouse gas content of the fuel they supply. Such values\r\nrepresenting the EU crude oil slate are contained, inter alia, in the\r\n\"Well to Wheel\" report (version 4) prepared by the JEC consortium,\r\nthe studies commissioned by the European Commission from Dr. A. Brandt on\r\nnatural bitumen and oil shale as well as the work undertaken for the European\r\nCommission by the International Council on Clean Transportation on upstream\r\nemissions in the context of the \"oil production greenhouse gas emissions\r\nestimator\" in connection with crude oils consumed in the EU.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reductions in greenhouse\r\ngas emissions associated with oil and gas upstream emissions should be\r\nestimated and validated in accordance with principles and standards identified\r\nin International Standards and in particular ISO 14064, ISO 14065 and ISO\r\n14066.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article7a(5)(b) of\r\nDirective 98/70/EC requires the establishment of a methodology to determine the\r\naggregate greenhouse gas intensity of fuels from non-biological origin used in\r\nthe Union in 2010 (the \"fuel baseline standard\").\u00a0 The baseline\r\nstandard should be based upon the volumes of diesel, petrol, non-road gas oil,\r\nliquefied petroleum gas and compressed natural gas using data officially\r\nreported to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2010. The fuel\r\nbaseline standard should not be the fossil fuel comparator that is used for\r\ncalculating greenhouse gas savings from biofuels, which should remain as set\r\nout in Annex IV to Directive 98/70/EC.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the composition of\r\nthe relevant fossil fuel mix changes little from year to year, the aggregate\r\nvariation in the greenhouse gas intensity of the fossil fuels\u00a0 from year to\r\nyear will also be small. It is therefore appropriate that the fuel baseline\r\nstandard is based on the 2010 Union average consumption data as reported by the\r\nMember States to the United Nations Framework Convention on the Climate Change.\r\n\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The 2010 fuel baseline\r\nstandard should represent an average upstream greenhouse gas intensity and\r\naverage complex refinery greenhouse gas intensity for fossil fuels. Hence the\r\nbaseline should be calculated using the respective fuel default values. The\r\nfuel baseline standard emission value should remain unchanged for the period up\r\nuntil 2020 in order to provide regulatory certainty to fuel suppliers in\r\nrespect of their obligations to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the\r\nfuels they supply. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 7a(5)(d) of\r\nDirective 98/70/EC provides for the adoption of a methodology to calculate the contribution\r\nof electric road vehicles. Pursuant to that Article the methodology should\r\nbe compatible with Article 3(4) of Directive 2009/28/EC of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council[23]. To ensure this compatibility,\r\nthe same adjustment factor should be used for the powertrain efficiency. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Electric energy supplied\r\nfor use in road transport may be reported by suppliers as laid down in Article\r\n7a(1) of Directive 98/70/EC as part of their annual reports to the Member\r\nStates. In order to limit administrative costs it is appropriate that the methodology\r\nbe based on an estimate rather than an actual measurement of the consumption of\r\nelectricity in an electric road vehicle or motorcycle for the purpose of supplier\r\nreporting.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\r\ninclude a detailed approach for estimating the quantity and the greenhouse gas\r\nintensity of biofuels in cases where processing of a biofuel and a fossil fuel\r\noccurs during the same process. A specific method is needed because the\r\nresulting volume of the biofuel is not measurable such as during co-hydro\r\ntreatment of vegetable oils with a fossil fuel. Article 7d(1) of Directive\r\n98/70/EC stipulates that the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions should, for\r\nthe purposes of Article 7a and Article 7b(2) of that Directive, be calculated\r\nwith the same methodology. Therefore the certification of greenhouse gas\r\nemissions by recognised Voluntary Schemes is as valid for the purposes of Article\r\n7a as it is for the purpose of Article 7b (2) of Directive 98/70/EC.\u00a0 \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The required supplier\r\nreporting laid down in Article 7a(1) of Directive 98/70/EC should be supplemented\r\nby a harmonized format and definitions of the data to be reported.\r\nHarmonisation of the definitions of data is needed for the proper execution of\r\nthe greenhouse gas intensity calculation linked to an individual supplier\u2019s\r\nreporting obligations as the data form key inputs into the method harmonised\r\npursuant to Article 7a(5)(a) of Directive 98/70/EC. These data include the\r\nsupplier identification, volume of fuel or energy placed on the market and fuel\r\nor energy type placed on the market. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The required supplier\r\nreporting, outlined in Article 7a(1) of Directive 98/70/EC should be\r\nsupplemented by harmonized reporting requirements, a reporting format and\r\ndefinitions for Member State reporting to the Commission pertaining to the\r\ngreenhouse gas performance of fuels consumed in the Union. In particular, these\r\nreporting requirements will enable the updating of the fossil fuel comparator\r\ndescribed in Point 19 of Part C of Annex IV, of Directive 98/70/EC and Point 19\r\nof Part C of Annex V, Part C, of Directive 2009/28/EC, will facilitate the\r\nreporting required pursuant to Article 8(3) and Article 9(2) of Directive\r\n98/70/EC and will facilitate updating of the calculation method to technical\r\nand scientific progress in order to ensure that it meets its intended purpose.\r\nThese data include the volume of fuel or energy placed on the market and fuel\r\nor energy type, the place of purchase and the origin of the fuel or energy\r\nplaced on the market. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate for\r\nMember States to allow suppliers to fulfil their reporting requirements by\r\nrelying on equivalent data being collected pursuant to other Union or national\r\nlegislation so as to reduce the administrative burden provided that the\r\nreporting is conducted in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex IV\r\nand definitions laid down in Annexes I and III.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate\r\nreporting by groups of suppliers pursuant to Article 7a(4) of Directive\r\n98/70/EC, Article 7a(5)(c) of that Directive allows for the establishment of\r\nany necessary rules. It is desirable to facilitate such reporting in order to\r\navoid disruption to physical fuel movements since different \u00a0suppliers place\r\ndifferent fuels of differing proportions on the market and hence may have to\r\ndeploy different levels of resources to meet the greenhouse gas reduction\r\ntarget. Hence, it is necessary to harmonize the definitions of the supplier\r\nidentification, the volume of fuel or energy placed on the market, the fuel or\r\nenergy type, the place of purchase and the origin of the fuel or energy placed\r\non the market. Furthermore, to avoid double counting in cross border, joint\r\nsupplier reporting, it is appropriate to harmonise Member State reporting to\r\nthe Commission so that the requisite information pertaining to each supplier\r\nforming a group of two or more suppliers from one or more Member States can be\r\nmade available to all Member State authorities concerned.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 8(3) of\r\nDirective 98/70/EC, Member States are to submit an annual report of national\r\nfuel quality data for the preceding year in accordance with the format\r\nestablished in Commission Decision 2002/159/EC of 18 February 2002[24]. To cover the\r\namendments introduced to Directive 98/70/EC by Directive 2009/30/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council [25]\r\nand the subsequent additional reporting requirements on the Member States it is\r\nnecessary in the interest of effectiveness and harmonization to clarify which\r\ninformation, falling under the reporting obligation on fuel quality data in\r\nArticle 8 of Directive 98/70/EC, should be reported and also adopt a format for\r\nthe submission of data by suppliers and Member States.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission presented a\r\ndraft measure to the Committee established by Directive 98/70/EC on 23 February\r\n2012.
