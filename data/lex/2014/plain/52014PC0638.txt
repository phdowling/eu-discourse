The World Health Organisation estimates that 285\r\nmillion people worldwide are visually impaired: 39 million are blind and 246\r\nmillion have low vision[1].\r\nThe World Blind Union reports that in Europe only 5 % of published books\r\nare available in an accessible format for visually impaired persons, while in\r\ndeveloping countries \u2013 where approximately 90 % of visually impaired\r\npeople live \u2013 this rate is as low as 1 %[2].\nCopies of books in accessible formats\r\n(\u2018accessible-format copies\u2019) are now usually produced and distributed at\r\nnational level by specialised organisations, for example libraries for the\r\nblind, under licences or under limitations or exceptions to copyright. However,\r\nthe lack of an international legal framework allowing for the cross-border\r\nexchange of accessible formats produced under a limitation or exception leads\r\nto a duplication of effort in making these, even across countries sharing the\r\nsame language. This is a problem due to the costs of producing accessible\r\nformat copies and the limited resources available to organisations serving the\r\nblind.\nSince January 2011 the European Union has\r\nbeen bound by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with\r\nDisabilities. This enshrines the right of access to information (Article 21) and\r\nthe right of people with disabilities to participate in cultural life on an\r\nequal basis with others (Article 30). The Convention has become an integral\r\npart of the EU legal order. Twenty-five Member States are parties to the\r\nConvention and three countries are finalising ratification.\nIn 2009, negotiations began in the World\r\nIntellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) on a possible international treaty\r\nintroducing limitations and exceptions to copyright for the benefit of people who\r\nare blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled, with the objective of\r\nfacilitating the cross-border exchange of books in accessible formats.\nOn 26 November 2012, the Council adopted a\r\nDecision authorising the Commission to participate in these negotiations, on\r\nbehalf of the European Union[3].\r\nThe WIPO negotiations were successfully concluded at the diplomatic conference\r\nheld in Marrakesh between 17 and 28 June 2013. These led to the adoption of the\r\nMarrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are\r\nBlind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled (\u2018the Treaty\u2019) on 27 June\r\n2013.\nThe Treaty establishes a set of\r\ninternational rules which ensure that there are limitations or exceptions to\r\ncopyright at national level for the benefit of people who are blind, visually\r\nimpaired, or otherwise print-disabled and enable the cross-border exchange of\r\naccessible-format copies of published works that have been made under an\r\nexception or limitation to copyright in any of the Contracting Parties to the\r\nTreaty.\nThe Council authorised the signature of the\r\nTreaty on behalf of the European Union[4]\r\non 14 April 2014.\nWith this proposal for a Council Decision,\r\nthe Commission seeks authorisation from the Council, after obtaining the\r\nconsent of the European Parliament, to conclude the Treaty, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n2.1 The provisions of the Treaty\nThe Treaty\u2019s \u2018beneficiaries\u2019 are people who\r\nare blind, have a visual impairment or a perceptual or reading disability, or\r\nare otherwise unable, due to physical disability, to hold or manipulate a book,\r\nor focus or move their eyes to the extent that would be normally acceptable for\r\nreading.\nThe Treaty obliges every Contracting Party\r\nto provide, in their national copyright laws, for a limitation or exception to\r\nthe rights of reproduction, distribution and making available to the public, to\r\nfacilitate the availability of works in accessible formats for the Treaty\u2019s\r\nbeneficiaries[5].\r\nContracting Parties may decide to limit such limitations or exceptions to cases\r\nwhere accessible format copies are not commercially available on reasonable\r\nterms to beneficiaries in their territory.\nThe Treaty defines \u2018works\u2019 as literary and\r\nartistic works within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Berne Convention for\r\nthe Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (\u2018the Berne Convention\u2019), in the\r\nform of text, notation and/or related illustrations, whether published or\r\notherwise made publicly available in any media. By virtue of an agreed\r\nstatement, this also covers audiobooks.\nAn \u2018accessible-format copy\u2019 is a copy in an\r\nalternative manner and form compared to the format in which the work has been\r\npublished and which gives beneficiaries access to the work as comfortably as\r\nsighted people could access it. The accessible-format copy must be used\r\nexclusively by beneficiaries and it must respect the integrity of the original\r\nwork.\nAccessible format copies made under a\r\nlimitation or exception to copyright may be exported by \u2018authorised entities\u2019,\r\ndefined as government institutions or other organisations that provide\r\neducation, instructional training, adaptive reading or information access to\r\nblind, visually impaired, or otherwise print-disabled persons on a non-profit\r\nbasis. These entities must ensure that they only distribute accessible formats\r\nto beneficiaries, that they discourage the reproduction, distribution and\r\nmaking available of unauthorised copies and that they maintain due care in, and\r\nrecords of, their handling of the copies.\nContracting Parties may only allow accessible\r\nformat copies to be exported, if they ensure that\u00a0 relevant limitations or\r\nexceptions to the rights of reproduction, distribution and making available to\r\nthe public are subject to the \u2018three-step test\u2019. This means that either they\r\nmust be a party to the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) or they must otherwise\r\nensure that the relevant limitations or exceptions are limited to certain\r\nspecial cases which do not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work\r\nand do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder.\nThe Treaty clarifies that, to the extent a\r\nContracting Party permits a beneficiary or an authorised entity to make an\r\naccessible-format copy of a work, it should also permit accessible-format\r\ncopies to be imported.\nContracting Parties are obliged to take\r\nappropriate measures, if necessary, to ensure that\r\nwhen they provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies\r\nagainst the circumvention of effective technological measures, this legal\r\nprotection does not prevent the beneficiaries from enjoying the limitations and\r\nexceptions provided for in the Treaty.\u00a0 \nThe Treaty also requires Contracting\r\nParties to protect the privacy of beneficiaries and to cooperate in order to\r\nfacilitate the cross-border exchange of accessible-format copies. WIPO will set\r\nup an information access point to assist authorised entities in identifying one\r\nanother with a view to working together. The Treaty also encourages authorised\r\nentities to provide information on their policies and practices to interested\r\nparties and to members of the public.\nThe Treaty confirms that Contracting\r\nParties are free to determine the appropriate method of implementing the Treaty\r\nwithin their own legal system and practice. However, they must comply with\r\nexisting international obligations under the Berne Convention, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual\r\nProperty Rights and the WCT. The Treaty recognises that the Contracting Parties\r\nmay maintain or implement other limitations and exceptions for \u00a0\u00a0beneficiaries\r\nand people with other disabilities, outside the scope of the Treaty.\nArticles 13 to 22 contain administrative\r\nand procedural provisions that are very similar to those in other WIPO Treaties\r\nin the field of copyright (e.g. WCT).\nThe Treaty will enter into force once\r\ntwenty Contracting Parties have ratified it.\nThe European Union may become a party to\r\nthe Treaty, having made the declaration during the Marrakesh diplomatic conference,\r\nthat it is competent in respect of, and has its own legislation binding on all\r\nits Member States on matters covered by this Treaty and that it has been duly\r\nauthorised, in accordance with its internal procedures, to become party to the\r\nTreaty. The European Union signed the final act of the diplomatic conference on\r\n28 June 2013 and signed the Treaty on 30 April 2014 in Geneva.\n2.2 The legal bases\nIn light of the Treaty\u2019s subject matter, and\r\nas with Council Decision 2014/221/EU authorising the signature of the Treaty,\r\nthe Council\u2019s decision on the conclusion of the Treaty should be based on Articles\r\n114, 207, and 218(6)(a)(v) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion (TFEU).\nThe Treaty\u2019s central provisions (Articles 5,\r\n6 and 9) aim to ensure the cross-border exchange of accessible-format copies\r\nbetween the Contracting Parties of the Treaty, including between the EU and\r\nthird countries. This exchange falls under the TFEU provision on the common\r\ncommercial policy.\nAuthors\u2019 rights affected by the exceptions and\r\nlimitations required by the Treaty (the right of reproduction, the right of\r\ndistribution and the right of communication to the public including the right\r\nof making available) were harmonised at EU level by Articles 2-4 of Directive\r\n2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related\r\nrights in the information society[6].\r\nAn exhaustive list of exceptions or limitations to those rights is set out in\r\nArticle 5(2) and 5(3) of this Directive. Recital 32 makes it clear that Member\r\nStates cannot introduce different or additional exceptions to these rights in\r\ntheir national law. The exceptions or limitations should be exercised in\r\naccordance with Article 5(5) (the \u2018three-step test\u2019), also emphasised in\r\nrecital 44. \nArticle 5(3)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC\r\nprovides for an optional exception or limitation to authors\u2019 rights \u00a0for uses,\r\nfor the benefit of people with any disability, which are directly related to\r\nthe disability and are of a non-commercial nature, to the extent required by\r\nthe specific disability. Unlike the Treaty, this Article is not limited to any\r\nparticular disability and Member States are free to choose whether they\r\nimplement this limitation or exception. It is settled case-law that any\r\ndiscretion which Member States enjoy when they make use of any of the\r\nexceptions or limitations under Article 5 of Directive 2001/29/EC must be\r\nexercised within the limits imposed by EU law[7].\r\n\nFinally, Article 6 of Directive 2001/29/EC provides\r\ncomprehensive legal protection for technological measures used by right holders\r\nand Article 6(4) provides that Member States must ensure that beneficiaries of\r\ncertain exceptions or limitations benefit from those exceptions where\r\ntechnological protection measures are in place, in the absence of voluntary\r\nagreements. Articles 3, 4, 7, 10 and 11 of the Treaty affect these provisions\r\nof EU law.\nAs a result, it is considered that: \na) the cross-border exchange of\r\naccessible-format copies with third countries is a predominant element of the\r\nTreaty, therefore its relevant articles fall under the common commercial policy\r\n(Article 207 TFEU); and \nb) the articles of the Treaty on mandatory\r\nexceptions or limitations fall within the scope of EU law, affect or alter the\r\nscope of the common rules, namely those in Directive 2001/29/EC and in any\r\nevent are within an area which is already largely covered by EU rules (Article\r\n114 TFEU)[8].\nThe Commission is therefore submitting a\r\nproposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Treaty. In accordance\r\nwith Article 218(6)(a)(v) of the TFEU, the European Parliament has to give its\r\nconsent before the Decision is adopted.\n2014/0297 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, of the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works\r\nfor Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 114 and 207, in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[9],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since 22 January 2011,\r\npursuant to Council Decision 2010/48/EC[10],\r\nthe European Union has been bound by the United Nations Convention on the\r\nRights of Persons with Disabilities, whose provisions have become an integral\r\npart of the Union legal order.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 26 November 2012, the\r\nCouncil authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, an international agreement within the World Intellectual Property Organization\r\non improved access to books for print-impaired persons.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The negotiations were\r\nsuccessfully concluded at the diplomatic conference held in Marrakesh between 17\r\nand 28 June 2013. The Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works\r\nfor Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled (the \u2018Marrakesh\r\nTreaty\u2019) was adopted on 27 June 2013.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Council\r\nDecision 2014/221/EU,[11]\r\nthe Marrakesh Treaty was signed, on behalf of the European Union as regards matters\r\nfalling within the Union\u2019s competence, on 30 April 2014, subject to its\r\nconclusion at a later date.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Marrakesh Treaty\r\nestablishes a set of international rules which ensure that there are\r\nlimitations or exceptions to copyright at national level for the benefit of people\r\nwho are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print\u2013disabled. The relevant\r\ncopyright provisions have been harmonised by Union law, as they affect the\r\nfunctioning of the internal market. \u00a0The Treaty will also enable the cross-border\r\nexchange of copies of published works that have been made in an accessible\r\nformat under limitations or exceptions to copyright, and therefore also falls\r\nwithin the area of commercial policy. The Treaty will facilitate access to\r\npublished works for its beneficiaries in and outside the European Union.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Marrakesh Treaty\r\nshould be approved on behalf of the European Union,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access\r\nto Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise\r\nPrint Disabled is hereby approved on behalf of the European Union.\nThe text of the Marrakesh Treaty is\r\nattached to this Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe President of the Council is hereby\r\nauthorised to designate the person(s) empowered to deposit, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, the instrument of ratification provided for in Article 19 of the\r\nMarrakesh Treaty in order to express the Union\u2019s consent to be bound by the\r\nTreaty.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\nday of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fact sheet No 282, June 2012; http://www.who.int.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.worldblindunion.org.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision on the participation of the European\r\nUnion in negotiations for an international agreement within the World\r\nIntellectual Property Organisation on improved access to books for print\r\nimpaired persons; 16259/12 EU RESTRICTED.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2014/221/EU of 14 April 2014 on the\r\nsigning, on behalf of the European Union, of the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate\r\nAccess to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or\r\notherwise Print Disabled.
