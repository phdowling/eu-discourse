By the time the proposal below was sent for\r\nadoption, neither the offer from Greenland nor the opinion of Member States on\r\nthat offer were available. Therefore, this TAC is shown in \"pm\" (pro\r\nmemoria) in this proposal, and is to be completed after its adoption..\nAs regards redfish in international waters\r\nof I and II, Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 included an incorrect figure (19,300\r\ntonnes) that did not reflect the TAC level established by the North-East\r\nAtlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC): 19,500 tonnes. This TAC is not to be\r\nfished prior to 1 July 2014, as stated in the footnote attached to\r\nthe Union quota, which is not being modified. Another error was identified in\r\nthe TAC for Greenland halibut in Greenland waters of V and XIV: the Union quota\r\ndistributed between Norway, the Faroe Islands, and some Member States was 200\r\ntonnes higher than the actual offer made by Greenland: 4,665 tonnes, instead of\r\n4,465 tonnes. Finally, certain errors are corrected in the TAC for mackerel in\r\nIIIa and IV; Union waters of IIa, IIIb, IIIc and Subdivisions 22-32: firstly,\r\nthe Union quota can be fished in Faroese waters; secondly, the Faroe Islands should\r\nbe able to fish part of their mackerel quota (46,850 tonnes) in certain EU\r\nareas and this should be reflected in the relevant table; in relation to this,\r\nthe description of the Union waters area where Faroese vessels can be\r\nauthorised to fish for mackerel must also be corrected (Annex VIII of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 43/2014).\nFinally, this proposal contains amendments\r\nlinked to the implementation of measures linked to Regional Fisheries\r\nManagement Organisations (RFMOs). At its 8th Regular Session in 2012,\r\nthe Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) adopted a conservation\r\nand management measure prohibiting certain fishing activities as regards\r\noceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus). At its 9th\r\nRegular Session, WCPFC adopted a similar prohibition for silky sharks (Carcharhinus\r\nfalciformis). Both prohibitions should be implemented in Union law.\n2014/0193 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Council Regulation (EU) No\r\n43/2014 as regards certain catch limits\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Fisheries Partnership\r\nAgreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the Government of\r\nDenmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, on the other hand[2],\r\nand the Protocol thereto[3], provide that the Union\r\nis to receive 7.7 % of the total availabe catches (TAC) for capelin in\r\nGreenland waters of ICES zones V and XIV.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EU) No\r\n43/2014[4]\r\nfixed a Union quota of 0 tonnes for 2014 for the stock of capelin in those Greenland waters, to be applied until 30 April 2014.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On [date to be added]\r\nthe Union received information from the Greenland authorities that the TAC for\r\ncapelin in Greenland waters of ICES subareas V and XIV had been established at [pm]\r\ntonnes for the period from [date to be added] until [date to be added].\r\nThe relevant Union quota for that period should therefore be fixed at [pm]\r\ntonnes.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to correct\r\nthe TAC established for the stock of redfish in international waters of I and\r\nII and the TAC established for Greenland halibut in Greenland waters of V and\r\nXIV. It is also necessary to correct the TAC for mackerel in the North Sea and\r\nadjacent waters, in order to include the mutual access arrangements between the\r\nUnion and the Faroe Islands; furthermore, the area where Faroese vessels may\r\nobtain fishing authorisations for mackerel fishing should be modified\r\naccordingly. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its 8th Regular\r\nSession, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) adopted a\r\nprohibition to retain on board, tranship, store or land oceanic whitetip sharks\r\n(Carcharhinus longimanus). At its 9th Regular Session, WCPFC\r\nadopted a similar prohibition for silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis).\r\nBoth prohibitions should be implemented in the law of the Union. In accordance\r\nwith Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96[5], the stocks that are\r\nsubject to the various measures referred to therein should be identified.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The catch limits provided\r\nfor in Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 apply from 1 January 2014. The provisions of\r\nthis Regulation concerning catch limits should therefore in principle also\r\napply from this date. Such retroactive application is without prejudice to the\r\nprinciples of legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations as the\r\nfishing opportunities concerned have not yet been exhausted. However, the\r\nprohibition to fish silky sharks in the WCPFC Convention Area becomes effective\r\non 1 July 2014 and should apply from that date. Similarly, the corrected TAC\r\nfor Greenland halibut in Greenland waters of V and XIV should apply from the\r\ndate of entry into force of this Regulation, as it entails a reduction of\r\nfishing opportunities for Union vessels. Moreover, in view of the fishing\r\nseason for capelin, the catch limits for the stock in question provided for by\r\nthis Regulation should apply from [date to be added]. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the modification of\r\nsome catch limits has an influence on the economic activities and the planning\r\nof the fishing season of Union vessels, this Regulation should enter into force\r\nimmediately after its publication. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 43/2014\r\nshould be amended accordingly, \nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\r\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) No 43/2014\n(1)                   \r\nIn Regulation (EU) No 43/2014, the\r\nfollowing Article 37a is inserted:\n\u201cArticle 37a\r\nOceanic whitetip sharks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retaining\r\non board, transhipping, storing or landing any part or whole carcass of oceanic\r\nwhitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus) shall be prohibited.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When\r\naccidentally caught, species referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be harmed.\r\nSpecimens shall be promptly released.\u201d\n(2)                   \r\nthe following Article 37b is inserted:\n\u201cArticle 37b\r\nSilky sharks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retaining\r\non board, transhipping, storing or landing any part or whole carcass of silky\r\nsharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) shall be prohibited.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When\r\naccidentally caught, species referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be harmed.\r\nSpecimens shall be promptly released.\u201d\n(3)                   \r\nAnnex IA to Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 is amended in accordance with the\r\ntext set out in Annex I to this Regulation.\n(4)                   \r\nAnnex IB to Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 is\r\namended in accordance with the text set out in Annex II to this Regulation.\n(5)                   \r\nAnnex VIII to Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 is\r\namended in accordance with the text set out in Annex III to this Regulation.\nArticle 2\r\nEntry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union.\nPoint (2) of Article 1 shall apply from 1\r\nJuly 2014.\nPoints (3) and (5) of Article 1 and point\r\n(c) of Annex II shall apply from 1 January 2014.\nPoint (a) of Annex II shall apply from [date\r\nto be added].\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 of 20 January 2014\r\nfixing for 2014 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of\r\nfish stocks, applicable in Union waters and, to Union vessels, in certain\r\nnon-Union waters (OJ L 24, 28/01/2014, p. 1\u2013145).\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 172, 30.6.2007, p. 4.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 293, 23.10.2012, p. 5.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 24, 28/01/2014, p. 1\u2013145.\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996\r\nintroducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and\r\nquotas (OJ L 115, 9.5.1996, p. 3).\nANNEXES\nto the\nproposal for a Council Regulation\namending Council Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 43/2014 as regards certain catch limits\nANNEX I\nIn Annex IA, the entry for mackerel in IIIa\r\nand IV;
