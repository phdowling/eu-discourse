It is proposed to repeal this Directive and replace it with\r\na new text for the following reasons: (1) align the powers conferred on the\r\nCommission with the new distinction introduced by the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union (TFEU) (2) take account of other legislation adopted in\r\nthe meantime, notably with regard to food law (3) align the compositional\r\nrequirements of the products concerned to the relevant international standard\r\nissued by the Codex Alimentarius.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union (TFEU) distinguishes between, on the one hand, the power\r\ndelegated to the Commission to adopt non legislative acts of general\r\napplication to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a\r\nlegislative act, as set out in Article 290 (delegated acts), and, on the other\r\nhand, the power conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing acts where\r\nuniform conditions are needed, as referred to in Article 291 (implementing\r\nacts). The scrutiny exercise of the provisions of Directive 83/417/EEC in\r\nrelation to the new distinction between delegated and implementing acts has\r\nshown the need for the Commission to be empowered to adopt delegated acts to\r\namend, where appropriate, the technical definitions and standards established\r\nin the annexes for edible caseins and caseinates to take account of\r\ndevelopments in relevant international standards and of technical progress. A\r\ncorresponding empowerment is included in the present proposal.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The present proposal takes account of the further development of parallel\r\nlegislation, notably with regard to food law. This notably concerns updates to\r\nDirective 2000/13/EC[1], Regulation (EC) No 178/2002[2],\r\nRegulation (EC) No 882/2004[3], Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008[4]\r\nand Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008[5].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An international standard has been adopted by the Codex Alimentarius for edible\r\ncasein products[6]. That standard defines, among others, the essential composition and\r\nquality factors of casein products. To allow food business operators to benefit\r\nfrom a level-playing field on the world market, the present proposal adjusts\r\nthe compositional requirements laid down in the annexes for edible casein and\r\ncaseinates to those applicable in the above mentioned Codex standard. This\r\nadjustment results in two changes: the maximum moisture content of edible\r\ncasein is increased from 10 to 12% and the maximum milk fat content of edible\r\nacid casein is decreased from 2.25 to 2%. With this change, the compositional\r\nrequirements laid down in the proposal are fully in line with the international\r\nstandard.\nThe proposal has\r\nno financial implications for the EU budget.\nGeneral context\nArticles 290\r\nand 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)\r\ndistinguish two different types of Commission acts:\nArticle 290 of the TFEU allows the legislator\r\nto \"delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of\r\ngeneral application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a\r\nlegislative act\". Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are\r\nreferred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as \"delegated acts\"\r\n(Article 290(3)).\nArticle 291 of the TFEU allows Member States to \"adopt all measures of\r\nnational law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts\". Those\r\nacts shall confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform\r\nconditions for implementing them are needed. Legal acts adopted by the\r\nCommission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as\r\n\"implementing acts\" (Article 291(4)).\nSince the\r\nadoption of the original Directive in 1983, a number of legal acts have been\r\nadopted in the field of food law. They must be taken account of.\nThe production\r\nof casein and caseinates from milk was subject to an internal subsidy scheme\r\noperated by the Union until 2006. This subsidy scheme has ceased to be applied\r\nsince then and has been definitively repealed by the political agreement\r\nreached on the reformed single Common Market Organisation for Agricutural\r\nProducts in 2013. Specific provisions, differing from international standards,\r\nare therefore no longer justified. As a consequence, the proposal adjusts the\r\ncompositional requirements of casein products to the relevant Codex standard.\nExisting provisions in the area of the proposal\nArticles 290 and\r\n291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\nDirective\r\n2000/13/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, Regulation (EC) No 882/2004,\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1332/2008 and Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.\nCodex Stan\r\n290-1995.\nConsistency with the other policies and objectives\r\nof the Union\nThe proposal is\r\nconsistent with the new classification of powers conferred to the Commission by\r\nthe TFEU, with the relevant legal acts in the field of food law and with the\r\ninternational standard issued for casein products by the Codex Alimentarius.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nThere is no\r\nneed for consultation of interested parties since the proposal deals mainly\r\nwith inter-institutional issues and does not alter the substance of Directive\r\n83/417/EEC which has worked well for decades. The proposal also allows for a\r\nbetter integration of the rules on caseins and caseinates into the wider legal\r\nframework related to food law which brings advantages in terms of clarity and\r\nsimplification. Also the rules on the provision of information from business to\r\nbusiness have been streamlined.\nThe further\r\nalignment to the international standard has been discussed with the industry\r\nand they warmly welcome the proposed change.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere is equally\r\nno need for external expertise for the same reasons.\nImpact assessment\nThere is equally\r\nno need for an impact assessment for the same reasons.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal (1) identifies the need for\r\ndelegated power to be conferred on the Commission for the purpose of adopting\r\namendments to Annexes I and II and establishes the corresponding procedure for\r\nadoption of these acts in the new legal context determined by the entry into\r\nforce of Articles 290 and 291 of the TFEU (2) adapts existing provisions to the\r\nfurther development of legislation notably in the field of food law (3) adjust,\r\nwhere appropriate, the composition requirements of edible caseins to the\r\ncorresponding Codex standard.\nLegal basis\nArticle 114 of\r\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal\r\nfalls under shared competence between the EU and the Member States and complies with the subsidiarity principle.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal\r\ncomplies with the proportionality principle.\nChoice of instruments\nThe form of the\r\noriginal act (a Directive) is not changed. The proposal is aimed at designing\r\nthe Commission's empowerment in the new legal context created by the Lisbon\r\nTreaty. It also takes account of the further development of legislation in the\r\npast years and of existing, updated international standards.\nMoreover the\r\nproposal takes into consideration the need for the Member States to have some\r\nmargin to adapt the implementation to the national legal and administrative\r\nenvironment, in particular with reference to the possible adoption of national\r\nmeasures in matters not specifically harmonised by the proposal.\n2014/0096 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the approximation of the laws of the\r\nMember States relating to caseins and caseinates intended for human consumption\r\nand repealing Council Directive 83/417/EEC\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[7],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive\r\n83/417/EEC[8]\r\nprovides for the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to\r\ncertain lactoproteins (caseins and caseinates) intended for human consumption. Since\r\nthe entry into force of that Directive several changes have taken place,\r\nnotably the development of a comprehensive legal framework in the area of food\r\nlaw and the adoption of an international standard by the Codex Alimentarius[9] for edible casein\r\nproducts, which need to be taken into account.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 83/417/EEC\r\nconfers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of its provisions. As\r\na consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, those powers need\r\nto be aligned to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion (the Treaty).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the sake of clarity, Directive\r\n83/417/EEC should therefore be repealed and replaced with a new Directive.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account that\r\nRegulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council[10], contains general,\r\nhorizontal and uniform Union rules concerning the methods of sampling and\r\nanalysis of foodstuffs, the related provisions of Directive 83/417/EEC are\r\ntherefore no longer necessary.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account that\r\nRegulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council[11] contains general,\r\nhorizontal and uniform Union rules concerning the adoption of emergency\r\nmeasures for food and feed, the related provisions of Directive 83/417/EEC are therefore\r\nno longer necessary.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2000/13/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[12]\r\ndoes not apply to business to business relations. Since the products covered by\r\nthis Directive are not meant to be sold to the final consumer but only from\r\nbusiness to business for the preparation of food products, it is appropriate to\r\nmaintain, adapt to the current legal framework and simplify the specific rules\r\nalready included in Directive 83/417/EEC. Those rules provide for the\r\ninformation to be provided for those products in order to allow the food\r\nbusiness operators, on the one hand, to avail of the information they need for\r\nthe labelling of the final products, for example when it comes to allergens,\r\nand on the other hand to avoid that those products can be confused with similar\r\nproducts not meant for human consumption.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council[13] provides for the\r\ndefinition of processing aids referred to as technological adjuvants in\r\nDirective 83/417/EEC. Consequently, this Directive should use the term\r\n\u2018processing aids\u2019 instead of \u2018technological adjuvants\u2019.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other terms and references\r\nused in the Annexes to Directive 83/417/EEC should be adapted to take into\r\naccount those used in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and Regulation (EC) No\r\n1332/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council[14].\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex I to Directive\r\n83/417/EEC fixes the maximum moisture content for edible caseins at 10% and the\r\nmaximum milk fat content for edible acid casein at 2.25%. Taking into\r\nconsideration that international standard 290\u20131995 set by the Codex\r\nAlimentarius fixes those parameters at respectively 12% and 2%, the corresponding\r\nparameters should be set in line with the international standard so as to avoid\r\ntrade distortions.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to promptly adapt\r\nor update the technical elements contained in the Annexes to take account of\r\ndevelopments in relevant international standards or technical progress, the\r\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be\r\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of the standards applicable to edible\r\ncaseins and edible caseinates laid down in Annexes I and II.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is of particular\r\nimportance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its\r\npreparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and\r\ndrawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\r\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the\r\nCouncil.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should have\r\nsome margin to adopt national measures in matters not specifically harmonised\r\nby this Directive to adapt to the national legal and administrative environment.\r\nIn such cases, Member States should notify their national measures to the\r\nCommission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Directive 98/34/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[15],\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nThis Directive applies to caseins and\r\ncaseinates, which are intended for human consumption and
