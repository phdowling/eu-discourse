of the Internal Market, the EEA Joint Committee is to\r\nintegrate all the relevant EU legislation into the EEA Agreement as soon as\r\npossible after its adoption. \nArticle 78 of the EEA Agreement provides\r\nthat the Contracting Parties shall strengthen and broaden cooperation in the\r\nframework of the Union\u2019s activities in the fields of, inter alia, information\r\nservices, and\u00a0

Joint\r\nCommittee (annexed to the proposed Council Decision) aims to amend Protocol 31\r\nto the EEA Agreement on cooperation in specific fields outside the four\r\nfreedoms in order to extend the cooperation of the Contracting Parties in the\r\narea of information services, and\u00a0 research and innovation.\nIn order to extend the cooperation of the\r\nContracting Parties to the EEA Agreement, Decision No 1104/2011/EU of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on the rules for\r\naccess to the public regulated service provided by the global navigation\r\nsatellite system established under the Galileo programme[1] needs to be\r\nincorporated in the EEA Agreement.\nProtocol 31 to the EEA Agreement should\r\ntherefore be amended in order to allow for this extended cooperation to take\r\nplace.\nIt should be noted that Liechtenstein decided not to participate in this activity and participation of Iceland shall be suspended until otherwise decided by the EEA Joint Committee.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n2894/94 concerning
