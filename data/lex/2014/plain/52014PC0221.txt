As a result, estimations of undeclared work vary widely[2].\nAccording to the latest Eurobarometer\nsurvey[3]\nof 2013[4],\nonly 4% of respondents admitted that they performed undeclared work. However, 11%\nadmitted that they had purchased goods or services in the previous year where\nthey had good reasons to believe it involved undeclared work. There are\nconsiderable variations across the EU. The incidence\nand policies to address undeclared work are analysed in the chapter\n\"Undeclared work: recent developments\" in the Employment and Social\nDevelopments in Europe 2013 review.[5]\n\nUndeclared work has serious budgetary\nimplications through decreased tax and social security revenues. It has\nnegative impacts on employment, productivity and working conditions, skills\ndevelopment and life-long learning. It results in lower pension rights and less\naccess to health care. It causes unfair competition between undertakings. Moving\nfrom informal or undeclared work to regular employment can also contribute to\nachieving the employment target as part of the Europe 2020 Strategy[6].\nA closely related phenomenon is falsely\ndeclared work, or bogus self-employment, which occurs when the worker is\nformally declared as self-employed on the basis of a service contract but the\nwork he/she performs fulfils all the criteria that are used by national law and\npractice to characterize an employment relationship. Bogus self-employment has negative\nconsequences in terms of health and safety and social security coverage of the\nworkers concerned, as well as on tax revenue, although normally less harmful\nthan undeclared work.\nIn the Communication \"Towards a\njob-rich recovery\"[7],\nthe Commission stressed that strengthening job-rich growth calls for employment\npolicies that generate favourable conditions for job creation, and that the transformation\nof informal or undeclared work into regular employment could have a positive\nimpact on labour demand. \nConsequently, the Employment Guideline Nr 7\non \"Increasing labour market participation of women and men, reducing\nstructural unemployment and promoting job quality\"[8] urges Member States to\nstep up social dialogue and tackle labour market segmentation with measures\naddressing precarious employment, underemployment and undeclared work. \nIn the 2012 and 2013 Country Specific\nRecommendations[9],\nseveral Member States received recommendations concerning fighting undeclared\nwork, the shadow economy, tax evasion and/or tax compliance. \nThe European Parliament in its Resolution\nof 14 January 2014 called for stronger cooperation and reinforcement of labour\ninspectorates to fight undeclared work[10].\n\nThe new Enforcement Directive on Posting of\nWorkers will contribute to tackling better fraud and abuse and certain forms of\nundeclared work.\nThe main responsibility for tackling\nundeclared work lies with the Member States. The fight against undeclared work\nrelies mostly on three types of enforcement bodies: (a) labour inspectorates to\naddress abusive behaviour regarding working conditions and/or health and safety\nnorms, (b) social security inspectorates fighting fraud on social insurance\ncontributions, and (c) tax authorities to deal with tax evasion. In some Member\nStates, social partners[11]\nare also involved in these tasks. In addition, in some Member States, customs\nauthorities, migration bodies, the police and the public prosecutor's office\nare involved. It has however been noticed that, in some cases, cooperation\nbetween these different bodies at national level is not as structured or\neffective as necessary. \nSince measuring undeclared work remains a\nbig challenge, it makes it more difficult to develop targeted policies and to\nimprove inspection practices for preventing, reducing or at the very least\nmonitoring the incidence of undeclared work. The common challenge governments face\nin reducing undeclared work and ensuring conditions of decent work for\nundeclared workers, calls more coordinated steps on the part of governments and\npublic institutions. There is a need to pursue policies that will at the same\ntime reduce the incentives for employers to use undeclared work and for workers\nto engage in such activities.\nUndeclared work can occur in a variety of\nsectors. The single sector most often over-proportionately affected by\nundeclared work is the construction sector[12].\nOther sectors are household services, which include domestic cleaning services\nas well as child and elderly care, personal services, private security,\nindustrial cleaning, agriculture and hotel, restaurant and catering industry. \nIt is found in a wide range of workplaces\nand involving workers with different profiles and backgrounds. Such\nheterogeneity makes undeclared work difficult to approach and demand specific\nstrategies.\nPreventing and deterring undeclared work\ncontributes to better enforcement of EU and national law, especially in the\nareas of employment, labour law, health and safety and coordination of national\nsocial security systems. As the challenges are common to Member States, and as\nundeclared work often has a cross-border dimension, EU level action can play an\nimportant role by reinforcing cooperation between enforcement authorities within\nand between different Member States in the prevention and deterrence of\nundeclared work. At the moment, there is no formal mechanism in place for all\nrelevant authorities from the Member States to address issues related to\ncross-border aspects of undeclared work.\nEU level action would therefore help Member\nStates to tackle undeclared work more effectively and efficiently. It would\nalso contribute to addressing at EU level, in a positive and constructive way, the\nchallenges associated with labour mobility, while safeguarding free movement of\nworkers as one of EU's fundamental freedoms.\nCooperation between national enforcement\nauthorities already takes place at EU level, where the work of several\ncommittees or working groups is linked to undeclared work. However, they do it on\nan occasional and limited basis: the Senior Labour Inspectors Committee (SLIC)\nlooks at undeclared work from the occupational health and safety angle; the\nExpert Committee on Posting of Workers deals with undeclared work in relation\nto circumventing the rules on posting of workers; the Employment Committee\n(EMCO) discusses the impact of employment policy on undeclared work; the\nAdministrative Commission for social security coordination looks at error and\nfraud in the framework of social security coordination; the Working Group on\nadministrative cooperation in the field of direct taxation aims at facilitating\nthe exchange of information, experience and good practice in that field. \nIn addition, useful exchange of experiences\nhas taken place, either in the context of the Mutual Learning Programme under the\nEuropean Employment Strategy or as part of multilateral projects[13], which shows that\nMember States are interested in cooperation to tackle undeclared work. Member\nStates have also carried out multilateral projects on certain aspects of\nundeclared work and concluded bilateral agreements. The Platform will not\nprevent the application of bilateral agreements or arrangements concerning\nadministrative cooperation. \nHowever, the lessons learnt show that not\nall Member States take part in these exercises. In case of such voluntary\nmultilateral cooperation, there is no obligation for Member States to\nparticipate, nor is there a mechanism to make participation mandatory in case\nthe participation is found necessary by other Member States. As a result, EU\nlevel cooperation remains patchy both in terms of the Member States involved and the issues covered. \nThe existence of common challenges for the\nrelevant enforcement authorities across Member States is another incentive for\nthem to cooperate in this area. Inspection authorities face difficulties in\ncross-border situations, in particular when the aim is to identify or sanction\ncases of undeclared work, because their traditional mechanisms are meant to\ntackle mostly domestic aspects of undeclared work. Inspecting the nature and/or\nconditions of the employment relationship of migrant workers can be difficult\ndue to communication problems, lack of knowledge of rules or the presence of\norganised networks operating at the margins of the law, often making use of\ncomplex legal constructions, involving agencies or intermediaries located in\nseveral Member States and sometimes having recourse to bogus self-employment\nforms of work. Many Member States face difficulties in ensuring appropriate\ncommunication and cooperation between different enforcement bodies within the\nMember States and in a cross-border context. \nIn addition, it is commonly perceived that\nexcessive taxation or regulation of labour may boost undeclared work and that\nthere may be effective, non-punitive ways to encourage employers to declare\nwork and comply with law. \nFinally, while in general all Member States\nagree on the need to prevent and deter undeclared work, in practice there may be\ndifferent ways and levels of commitment to this goal and this might end up with\nlow political priority and low sense of urgency to tackle undeclared work. \nThe Communication \"Towards a job-rich\nrecovery\" therefore highlighted the need for improved cooperation among\nMember States and announced the launch of consultations on setting up an\nEU-level platform between labour inspectorates and other enforcement bodies to\ncombat undeclared work, aimed at improving cooperation, sharing best practices\nand identifying common principles for inspections. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThis proposal stems from various studies\nand consultations undertaken recently.\nIn 2010, an external feasibility study[14] on the establishment\nof a European platform for cooperation between labour inspectorates and other\nrelevant monitoring and enforcement bodies to prevent and fight undeclared work\nwas carried out. The study analysed existing national institutional frameworks\nand policy measures, difficulties encountered by enforcement bodies on national\nand international levels, existing cross-border co-operation, best practices\nand identifies possible options for a European platform to prevent and fight\nundeclared work. \nThe special Eurobarometer[15] on undeclared work and\na recent report from Eurofound on tackling undeclared work in the Member States[16] also fed into the preparation\nof this initiative. The Eurofound report was accompanied by an updated database[17] of measures taken between\n2008 and 2013. The database includes 186 case studies from all EU Member States\nas well as from candidate countries. The database can be used to search\nmeasures by country, type of measures, target group and sector.\nThe consultation of stakeholders was\ncarried out in the framework of the group of Directors General of Industrial\nRelations (DG IR), the Senior Labour Inspectors Committee (SLIC) and the\nAdministrative Commission for social security coordination. In general, Member\nStates' representatives recognized the added value in EU level action targeted\nat preventing and deterring undeclared work and welcomed the intention of the\nCommission to become more involved in this policy area. \nThe views of the European Social Partners\nhave been collected in a 1st stage consultation[18] (4 July 2013 to 4\nOctober 2013). The Commission identified the main problems related to\nprevention and deterrence of undeclared work, recalled the most recent\nactivities taken by the Commission and introduced the objectives and possible\ncontent of the initiative. The aim of the consultation was to consult\nmanagement and labour on the possible direction of EU action. The Commission\nreceived 15 replies from them (2 joint replies, 3 replies from the workers'\nrepresentatives and 10 replies from employers' organisations). Social Partners\nagreed with the overall problem description and indicated that action at EU\nlevel is justified with the main objective of assisting national authorities,\nsuch as labour inspectorates, social security and tax authorities to prevent\nand deter undeclared work. In general, social partners agreed that a European\nplatform could be an appropriate vehicle for enhancing cooperation between\nMember States. However, the views of social partners were divergent. \nMost of the employers' representatives were\nof the opinion that the Platform should be established. However, they\nconsidered that there was no need for a separate new structure. Instead,\noptions such as the creation of a subgroup to an existing group or better\ncoordination of existing groups, could be considered. All trade unions and some\nemployers' representatives favoured the establishment of an independent new\nbody in order to ensure that all the facets of undeclared work be covered,\nwhich could not happen if existing structures would be used. Regarding the\nparticipation in the Platform, trade unions and some employers' representatives\nargued in favour of a mandatory approach for Member States, while some employers'\norganisations preferred a voluntary approach. The Social Partners supported the\nCommission's objective to present an initiative, but did not wish to enter into\nnegotiations on this issue.\nA 2nd stage consultation of Social\nPartners took place from 30 January to 13 March 2014[19]. In this consultation,\nthe Commission presented an overview of the results of the 1st stage\nconsultation and outlined the content of the planned initiative. The aim of the\nconsultation was to obtain Social Partners' views on the content of the\nenvisaged initiative on enhancing cooperation between Member States in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work. The Commission received 16 replies\n(1 joint reply, 4 replies from the workers' representatives and 11 replies from\nemployers' organisations). Social partners generally lent their support for\naction at EU level to prevent and deter undeclared work and reiterated the\nviews expressed during the 1st stage consultation regarding the\nobjectives, scope, tasks/initiatives, participation and form of the Platform.\nNew elements were provided regarding social partners' participation in the\nPlatform. Trade unions and employers' representatives agreed that EU level\nsocial partners, both cross-sectoral and in sectors with high incidence of\nundeclared work should be involved in the Platform as observers. Some trade\nunions and employers' representatives suggested that social partners should be\ngiven member status[20].\n\nThe\nImpact Assessment included several options for enhancing EU cooperation in the\nprevention and deterrence of undeclared work. The first option considered was no\nnew action beyond the existing working groups and initiatives. The option of better\ncoordination of the work of the different existing working groups and\ncommittees was also considered. \nThe\nthird option was the establishment of a European Platform to enhance EU\ncooperation in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work. Several sub-options\nwere considered for setting up the Platform, such as a Platform with voluntary\nor mandatory membership and giving a responsibility for coordinating Member\nStates actions against undeclared work to Eurofound. An option to create a\ndecentralised agency responsible for enforcement of EU law and fight against\nundeclared work was considered.\nThe analysis concluded that the preferred\noption would be the establishment of a European Platform with mandatory\nmembership. The Platform would provide for the involvement of all relevant\nauthorities of all Member States in the EU level activities and enable regular\nand operational cooperation in this area. The sub-option of a voluntary\nmultilateral cooperation was considered sub-optimal since the refusal of some Member\nStates to participate would greatly diminish the value of EU cooperation for\nmore ambitious Member States. In particular, mandatory participation was\nconsidered necessary, because cooperation to tackle cross-border aspects of\nundeclared work could not be fully achieved if some Member States were in (Member\nStates with high priority in dealing with such aspects, mostly destination countries)\nand others out. The cross-border aspects of undeclared work could also have\nnegative impact on the functioning of the Single Market as employers providing\nservices in other Member States using undeclared workers would cause unfair\ncompetition. These employers can provide cheaper services due to the fact that\nthey do not pay taxes or comply with obligations arising, for instance, from\nhealth and safety and working conditions regulations.\nTaken into account all of the above, namely\nthe need for improved EU cooperation, cross-border aspects of undeclared work\nand their impacts on the functioning of the Single Market, all Member States\nneed to be included on the mandatory basis in the enhanced cooperation to\ntackle all aspects of the phenomenon. \nOther options would not guarantee the\ninvolvement of all the relevant authorities of all Member States, would limit\ncooperation to the exchanges of best practices or would not allow for\nenforcement issues to be addressed appropriately and would thereby fail to support\nthe holistic approach needed to tackle the problem. In addition, other options\nwould contribute to a lesser degree to the visibility and prioritisation of the\nproblem at EU level. \nThe Platform will bring together different\nenforcement authorities of all Member States as members. Other stakeholders, in\nparticular the Social Partners at EU level, relevant Union decentralised\nagencies, such as Eurofound and European Agency for Safety and Health at Work\n(EU-OSHA) and international organisations, such as the International Labour\nOrganisation (ILO) and representatives of EEA states, will have an observer\nstatus.\nThe Platform will carry out a number of\ntasks to be defined and implemented on the basis of agreed work programmes.\nExchange of good practice would be the first practical step of cooperation. It would\nimprove the knowledge of the phenomenon and develop better understanding about\nhow undeclared work is tackled and who the main actors are in the Member States.\nTo make best use of this exchange, based on a Eurofound database, a Knowledge\nBank could be established, which could inter alia elaborate further on\nenforcement issues and lead to the development of common guidelines and\nprinciples. It is foreseen that the Platform will evolve progressively from a forum\nfor exchange of information and good practice to more elaborate forms of\ncooperation as mutual trust and experience build up. Ultimately, the Platform\nshould be able to undertake joint trainings and exchange of staff, and\ncoordinate operational actions, including joint inspections and data sharing. \nThe proposal will enhance the development,\nimplementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Union's instruments, policies\n(promoting a high level of quality and sustainable employment, guaranteeing\nadequate and decent social protection, combating social exclusion and poverty\nand improving working conditions) and relevant law and promote evidence-based\npolicy-making and social progress, in partnership with different stakeholders.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal\nbasis\nThe EU has the competence to act in the\nfield of undeclared work based on Social Policy articles in the TFEU. In\nparticular, Article 151 TFEU stipulates that the Union and the Member States \"shall have as their objectives the promotion of employment, improved\nliving and working conditions, [\u2026] proper social protection, [\u2026] with the view\nto lasting high employment and the combating of social exclusion.\" Article\n153 TFEU lists the fields where the Union shall support and complement the\nactivities of the Member States, which include working conditions, integration\nof persons excluded from the labour market and combating social exclusion. \nThe proposal on an enhanced EU cooperation\nin deterrence and prevention of undeclared work is based on Article 153 (2)\n(a) TFEU, which allows for the European Parliament and the Council to adopt\nmeasures designed to encourage cooperation between Member States through\ninitiatives aimed at improving knowledge, developing exchanges of information and\nbest practices, promoting innovative approaches and evaluating experiences,\nexcluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States. \nThe main objectives to be achieved by this\ninitiative are the promotion of employment and improved working conditions (Art\n151 TFEU). Taking into account the fact that the fight against undeclared work\nin different Member States relies on different types of enforcement bodies (as\nexplained in Chapter 1), it is necessary that this initiative is extended to all\nnational authorities, including those which will not be active in the\nemployment and social fields, but are also responsible for, or have a role in\nthe deterrence or prevention of undeclared work, such as taxation, migration\nand customs authorities. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity\nand proportionality principles\nThe choice of legal instrument \u2013 a Decision\nof the European Parliament and of the Council \u2013 is the most appropriate, taken\ninto account that the Article foresees the ordinary legislative procedure for\nthe adoption of the initiative.\nWhile the main competences for tackling\nundeclared work lie with the Member States, the challenges faced, such as the negative\nimpact of undeclared work on the economy and the society, the difficulties in\ntackling cross-border forms of undeclared work, the trade-off between\nappropriate levels of taxation / regulation and the need to avoid encouraging\nemployers to resort to undeclared work, and the lack of cooperation between\ndifferent enforcement authorities, are common to all Member States. The EU\naction enhancing cooperation at EU level would support the efforts of Member\nStates in the deterrence and prevention of undeclared work by making it more\neffective and efficient. It thereby adds value to Member States' actions.\nNational enforcement authorities are indeed the most appropriate level to\ntackle the challenges linked to undeclared work. In addition, the cross-border\naspects can be better tackled at EU level. The proposal thereby complies with\nthe principle of subsidiarity.\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle since it is a measure designed to encourage\ncooperation between Member States without any harmonisation of the laws and\nregulations of the Member States. An option of creating a new EU decentralised agency\nwas considered, but was discarded given the administration costs entailed in establishing\na new agency. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nRegulation (EU) No 1296/2013 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil[21]\nestablishes a European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation\n(\"EaSI\") for the period 2014-2020. Funding for the Platform will come\nfrom the PROGRESS axis. An indicative amount of 2.1 million EUR per year is\nforeseen for carrying out the tasks, such as the establishment of practical tools,\nsupport by service providers, publishing of common guidelines and principles,\nand handbooks, developing a permanent training capacity and a common framework\nfor carrying out joint trainings, organising peer reviews and European\nCampaigns. In addition, grants to finance projects supporting the achievement\nof the objectives of the Platform will be covered. Up to 224 000 EUR per year\nwill be used to reimburse the costs related to participation in the Platform\nmeetings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIt is also recalled that the European Social Fund (ESF) supports Member States'\nefforts to improve the quality of public administration and governance and, by\ndoing so, promote their structural reforms. Financing is foreseen within the\nMultiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. Member States are encouraged to use\nthe ESF to reinforce the capacity of their national authorities in tackling\nundeclared work.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe legislative proposal is budget-neutral and does not require additional\nstaff resources. The \nCOM staff \u2013 2.5 full time employees \u2013 currently working in the\nDirectorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion \u2013 will act as the\nPlatform's Secretariat. Details are explained in the legislative financial\nstatement annexed to this proposal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe involvement of the European Union's\ndecentralised agencies, Eurofound and European Agency for Safety and Health at\nWork, in the work of the Platform as observers will not extend their existing\nmandates. Regarding these Agencies, the proposal is budget neutral.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n2014/0124 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non establishing a European Platform to\nenhance cooperation in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 153 (2) (a)\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[22],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[23],\nAfter consulting the European Data\nProtection Supervisor,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Communication of 18\nApril 2012[24],\nthe Commission highlighted the need for improved cooperation among Member\nStates and announced the launch of consultations on setting up an\nEU-level platform between labour inspectorates and other enforcement\nauthorities to combat undeclared work, aimed at improving cooperation, sharing\nbest practices and identifying common principles for inspections.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naccordance with Article 148(4) of the Treaty, the Council by Decision\n2010/707/EU[25] adopted guidelines[26] for the employment policies of the Member States. These integrated guidelines give orientations to the Member\nStates on defining their national reform programmes and on implementing\nreforms. The employment guidelines form the basis for country-specific\nrecommendations that the Council addresses to the Member States under that Article.\nIn recent years, those recommendations have\nincluded country-specific recommendations on the fight against undeclared work.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 151 of the Treaty\nsets out as objectives in the field of social policy the promotion of\nemployment and improved living and working conditions. With a view to achieving\nthese objectives, the Union can support and complement the activities of Member\nStates in the fields of health and safety at work, working conditions, the\nintegration of persons excluded from the labour market and the combating of\nsocial exclusion. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Parliament in\nits resolution on \"Effective labour inspections as a strategy to improve\nworking conditions in Europe\" welcomed the Commission's initiative to\ncreate a European Platform and called for enhanced cooperation at EU level to\nfight undeclared work[27].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At European level\nundeclared work is defined as \"any paid activities that are lawful as\nregards their nature but not declared to public authorities, taking into\naccount differences in the regulatory systems of the Member States\"[28], thus excluding all\nillegal activities. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The abuse of the status of\nself-employed, either at national level or in cross-border situations, is\nfrequently associated with undeclared work. Bogus self-employment occurs when a\nperson is declared as self-employed while fulfilling the conditions\ncharacteristic of an employment relationship, in order to avoid certain legal\nor fiscal obligations. Bogus self-employment is, therefore, falsely declared\nwork and should come under the scope of the Platform. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Undeclared work has\nserious budgetary implications through decreased tax and social security\nrevenues. It has negative impacts on employment, productivity, compliance with working\nconditions' standards, skills development and life-long learning. It undermines\nthe financial sustainability of social protection systems, deprives workers of\nadequate social benefits and results in lower pension rights and less access to\nhealthcare. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A wide range of policy\napproaches and measures to tackle undeclared work have been introduced across\nthe Member States. Member States have also concluded bilateral agreements and\ncarried out multilateral projects on certain aspects of undeclared work. The\nPlatform will not prevent the application of bilateral agreements or\narrangements concerning administrative cooperation. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EU level cooperation\nremains far from comprehensive, both in terms of the Member States involved and\nthe issues covered. There is a no formal mechanism in place for cross-border\ncooperation between Member States' relevant authorities to address issues\nrelated to undeclared work. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The strengthening of\ncooperation among Member States at EU level is necessary to help Member States\nto prevent and deter undeclared work more efficiently and effectively. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Platform will aim to facilitate\nthe exchange of best practices and information, provide a framework at EU level\nto develop expertise and analysis, and improve operational coordination of\nactions between the different national enforcement authorities of the Member\nStates.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Platform should make\nuse of all relevant sources of information, in particular studies, bilateral\nagreements concluded between Member States and multilateral cooperation\nprojects and create synergies between existing EU level instruments and\nstructures to maximise the deterrent or preventive effect of these measures. The\noperational coordination of actions of the Member States could take the form of\njoint trainings, peer reviews and solutions for data sharing. European\ncampaigns or common strategies could increase the awareness of undeclared work.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three different national\nenforcement authorities are mainly involved with undeclared work: labour\ninspectorates, social security inspectorates and tax authorities. In some\ncases, migration authorities and employment services as well as customs\nauthorities, the police, the public prosecutor's office and the social partners\nare also involved. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to address undeclared\nwork comprehensively and successfully, a policy mix is to be implemented in the\nMember States, that is facilitated by structured cooperation between relevant\nauthorities. The cooperation should include all national authorities which are\nleading and/or active in the prevention and/or deterrence of undeclared work. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To achieve its objectives,\nthe Platform should be supported by a 'Single point of contact' in each Member State who should have the necessary authority to liaise with national authorities\ndealing with the multifaceted aspects of undeclared work.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Platform should involve\nthe social partners at EU level, both cross-industry and in those sectors more\nseverely affected by undeclared work, and cooperate with relevant international\norganisations, such as the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and Union decentralised agencies, in particular Eurofound and European Agency for Safety and\nHealth at Work. The involvement of Eurofound and European Agency for Safety and\nHealth at Work in the work of the Platform as observers will not extend their\nexisting mandates.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Platform should adopt\nits rules of procedure, work programmes and regular reports.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 95/46/EC on the\nprotection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on\nthe free movement of such data[29]\nas well as the the national implementing measures thereto apply to the\nprocessing of personal data carried out by the Member States in the framework\nof this Decision. As the Commission is part of the European Platform,\nRegulation (EC) No 45/2001 on the protection of individuals with regard to the\nprocessing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the\nfree movement of such data[30]\nequally applies to processing of personal data carried out in the framework of\nthis Decision. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Platform can establish\nworking groups to examine specific issues and should be able to rely on the\nexpertise of professionals with specific competences.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Platform will cooperate\nwith the EU level relevant expert groups and committees whose work has links\nwith undeclared work. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Platform and its tasks should\nbe funded through the PROGRESS axis of the programme for Employment and Social\nInnovation (EaSI) within the appropriations set by the budgetary authority.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission will take\nthe

Taking into account Article 153 TFEU, where Member States and the Union have shared competencies, the EU action would support the efforts of Member States by enhancing cooperation in the deterrence and prevention of undeclared work at EU level, making it more effective and efficient and thereby adding value to Member States' actions. \n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\n So far there has been no comprehensive approach involving all relevant authorities of all Member States to tackle undeclared work at EU level. \n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\n Fundamental rights: The proposal is consistent with the EU's fundamental rights strategy (COM(2010) 573 final) Europe 2020 strategy: The initiative will contribute to the creation of employment and to social inclusion, within the strategy for smart, sustainable and socially inclusive growth.
