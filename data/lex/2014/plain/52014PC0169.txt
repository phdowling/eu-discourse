This Regulation focuses mainly on Atlantic and North Sea stocks. These\r\nfishing opportunities are usually amended several times during the period in\r\nwhich they are in effect. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot applicable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 43/2014 so as to allow fishing for sandeel in ICES zones IIa, IIIa and IV.\r\nThe levels proposed are in accordance with the scientific advice for this stock\r\ndelivered by ICES on 21 February 2014. \n2014/0092 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 as\r\nregards catch limits for the fisheries on sandeel in EU waters of ICES zones\r\nIIa, IIIa and IV\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission[1],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Catch limits for sandeel\r\nin EU waters of ICES zones IIa, IIIa and IV were set at zero in Annex IA of Regulation (EU) 43/2014, pending advice from the International Council for the\r\nExploration of the Sea (ICES).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ICES advice on the stock\r\nhas been available since 21 February 2014, and it is now possible to set a TAC\r\nfor sandeel in this area, distributed in seven management areas in order to\r\navoid local depletion. The allocation of quotas in these management areas\r\nshould take into account the exchanges agreed with Norway in the light of\r\nconsultations on fishing rights held in accordance with the bilateral agreement\r\non fisheries with Norway[2].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex IA to Regulation\r\n(EU) No 43/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The catch limits provided\r\nfor in Regulation (EU) 43/2014 apply respectively from 1 January 2014. The\r\nprovisions of this Regulation concerning catch limits should therefore also\r\napply from that date. Such retroactive application will be without prejudice to\r\nthe principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations as\r\nthe fishing opportunities concerned were set to zero in the Regulation (EU)\r\n43/2014. Since the modification of this catch limit has an influence on the\r\neconomic activities and the planning of the fishing season of Union vessels,\r\nthis Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\r\nAmendment to Regulation (EU) No 43/2014\nAnnex IA to Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 is amended in accordance with the\r\nAnnex to this Regulation.\nArticle 2\r\nEntry into force and application\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Agreement on fisheries between the European Economic\r\nCommunity and the Kingdom of Norway (OJ L 226, 29.8.1980, p. 48).\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
