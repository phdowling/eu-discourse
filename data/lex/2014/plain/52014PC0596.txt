In case the United Kingdom has made that\r\nnotification, all acts referred to in Article 10(1) shall cease to apply\r\nto it as from the date of expiry of the transitional period referred to in Article\r\n10(3), that is from 1 December 2014.\nThe United Kingdom has made the notification\r\nmentioned in the first subparagraph of Article 10(4) of Protocol (No 36) on\r\n24 July 2013.\nArticle 10(4), second subparagraph of Protocol\r\n(No 36) provides that the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal\r\nfrom the Commission, shall determine the necessary consequential and\r\ntransitional arrangements. The United Kingdom shall not participate in the\r\nadoption of this decision. \nArticle 10(4), third subparagraph of Protocol\r\n(No 36) provides that the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal\r\nfrom the Commission, may also adopt a decision determining that the United Kingdom shall bear the direct financial consequences, if any, necessarily and\r\nunavoidably incurred as a result of the cessation of its participation in those\r\nacts. A proposal in this respect is submitted to the Council today.[1]\nArticle 10(5) of Protocol (No 36) provides\r\nthat the United Kingdom may, at any time afterwards, notify the Council of its\r\nwish to participate in acts which have ceased to apply to it pursuant to Article\r\n10(4), first subparagraph.\nIt is expected that the United Kingdom will notify its wish to participate in 35 acts of the former third pillar\r\nacquis which will cease to apply to it on 1 December 2014. Any disruption in\r\nthe implementation and application of these acts should be avoided. It should\r\ntherefore be provided that these acts will continue to apply to the United Kingdom for a limited transitional period until the decisions of the Council and the\r\nCommission authorising the participation of the United Kingdom take effect.\nThe United Kingdom announced that it does not\r\nintend to notify the Council at this stage of its wish to participate in\r\nCouncil Decision 2008/615/JHA of 23 June 2008 on stepping up of cross-border\r\ncooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime,[2]\r\nin Council Decision 2008/616/JHA of 23 June 2008 on the\r\nimplementation of Council Decision 2008/615/JHA on stepping up of cross-border\r\ncooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime[3]\r\nand in Council Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA of 30\r\nNovember 2009 on accreditation of forensic service providers carrying out\r\nlaboratory activities[4]\r\n(hereafter the \"Pr\u00fcm Decisions\").\nAs a consequence of the notification of\r\n24 July 2013 and of the non-notification of a wish to participate,\r\nthe Pr\u00fcm Decisions will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from\r\n1 December 2014.\nThe non-application of the Pr\u00fcm Decisions to\r\nthe United Kingdom from 1 December 2014 has as a consequence that the\r\n  United Kingdom cannot access for law enforcement purposes fingerprints\r\ncontained in the Eurodac database. The reason for this consequence is contained\r\nin Article 20 and recital (32) of Regulation (EU) No 603/2013.[5] This has no bearing on\r\nthe application of the remainder of Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 to the United Kingdom.\nIn view of the practical and operational\r\nsignificance of the Pr\u00fcm Decisions to the Union for public security, and more\r\nparticularly for law enforcement and the prevention, detection and investigation\r\nof criminal offences, the following arrangements have been made: the United\r\nKingdom will undertake a full business and implementation case to assess the\r\nmerits and practical benefits of the United Kingdom re-joining the Pr\u00fcm\r\nDecisions and of the necessary steps for it to do so, the results of which will\r\nbe published by 30 September 2015. It will do so in close consultation with\r\noperational partners in the United Kingdom, all other Member States, the\r\nCommission, Europol and Eurojust. If this business and implementation case is\r\npositive, the United Kingdom will decide, by 31 December 2015, on whether to\r\nnotify, within the following four weeks, its wish to participate in the Pr\u00fcm\r\nDecisions, in accordance with Article 10(5) of Protocol 36. The United Kingd  om has indicated that a positive vote in its Parliament will be required\r\nbefore such a decision.\nFinancial consequences should be attached to\r\nthe non-respect of those arrangements, as well as to the possible\r\nnon-participation of the United Kingdom in the Pr\u00fcm Decisions. A proposal in\r\nthis respect is presented to the Council today.[6]\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n Summary of the proposed measures The proposal provides for consequential and transitional arrangements in the meaning of Article 10(4), second subparagraph of Protocol (No 36). \n Legal basis Article 10(4), second subparagraph of Protocol (No 36). \n Principle of subsidiarity Only the Council is authorised, on the basis of Article 10(4), second subparagraph of Protocol (No 36), to adopt consequential and transitional arrangements. The principle of subsidiarity is therefore not applicable. \n Principle of proportionality The proposal complies with the principle of proportionality. \n Choice of instrument \n Proposed instrument: Council decision. \n Article 10(4), second subparagraph of Protocol (No 36) provides for the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, \"determining the necessary consequential and transitional arrangements\". A decision is the correct form of act to implement this provision of primary law. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPACT\nThe proposal has no impact on the European\r\nUnion budget.\n2014/0278 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\ndetermining certain consequential and\r\ntransitional arrangements concerning the cessation of participation of the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in certain acts of the\r\nUnion in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal\r\nmatters adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\r\nProtocol on transitional provisions, and in particular the second subparagraph\r\nof Article 10(4) thereof,\nHaving regard to the\r\nproposal from the European Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under Protocol (No 36) on\r\ntransitional provisions, annexed to the Treaty on\r\nEuropean Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European\r\nAtomic Energy Community, the United Kingdom had the\r\npossiblity to notify to the Council, by 31 May 2014 at the latest, that it does\r\nnot accept the powers of the Commission and of the Court of Justice introduced\r\nby the Treaty of Lisbon with respect to acts of the Union in the field of\r\npolice cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters which had been\r\nadopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter to the President\r\nof the Council of 24 July 2013, the United Kingdom has notified that it did not\r\naccept the powers of the Commission and of the Court of Justice introduced by the\r\nTreaty of Lisbon in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation.
