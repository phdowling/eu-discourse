One important tool\r\nin this respect is the annual fixing of fisheries opportunities in the form of\r\ntotal allowable catches (TACs), quotas and fishing effort limits. \nThe objective of this proposal is to fix,\r\nfor the commercially most important fish stocks in the Black Sea, the fishing\r\nopportunities for Member States for 2015.20\n\u00b7      General context\nThe Communication from the Commission on\r\nthe consultation on fishing opportunities for 2015 (COM(2014) 388 final),\r\noutlines the background to the proposal. \nThe scientific advice on fishing\r\nopportunities in the Black Sea in 2015 was delivered by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries\r\n(STECF) on 31 October 2014. \nThe proposal contains one section of\r\nimportance for the management of the Black Sea fisheries in 2015 which fixes\r\nthe TACs and quotas.\n\u00b7      Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\nFishing opportunities and the way they are\r\nallocated to Member States are regulated annually. The latest such legal act is\r\nCouncil Regulation (EU) No 24/2014[1]\r\nof 10 January 2014 fixing for 2014 the fishing opportunities for certain fish\r\nstocks applicable in the Black Sea.\nIn addition to the annual fishing\r\nopportunities, the following measures relevant to the Black Sea fisheries covered\r\nby this proposal should be mentioned: \n\u2013                        \r\nMinimum conservation sizes and minimum mesh\r\nsizes regarding the turbot fishery in the Black Sea are established by\r\nRegulation (EU) No 227/2013 of the Council and the European Parliament of 13\r\nMarch 2013[2]\r\namending Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery\r\nresources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine\r\norganisms and Council Regulation (EC) No 1434/98 specifying conditions under\r\nwhich herring may be landed for industrial purposes other than direct human\r\nconsumption.\n\u2013                        \r\nRecommendation GFCM/37/2013/2 establishing a set\r\nof minimum standards for bottom-set gillnet fisheries for turbot and\r\nconservation of cetaceans in the Black Sea adopted by the General Fisheries\r\nCommission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) in its 37th Session (Split, May 2013).\n\u00b7      Consistency with other policies and objectives of the EU\nThe proposed measures are in accordance\r\nwith the objectives and rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and are consistent\r\nwith the Union\u2019s policy on sustainable development.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u00b7      Collection and use of expertise\nMain organisations/experts consulted\nThe scientific organisation consulted is\r\nthe Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).\nThe Union asks STECF\r\neach year for scientific advice on the state of important fish stocks. The\r\nadvice, delivered in October 2014, covers all Black Sea stocks for which TACs\r\nare proposed.\n\u00b7      Consultation of interested parties\nInterested parties were\r\nconsulted via the Communication from the Commission on the Consultation on\r\nfishing opportunities for 2015. The scientific basis for the proposal was\r\nprovided by STECF. \n\u00b7      Impact assessment\nBased on the scientific\r\nadvice, the proposed measures will result in a change in fishing opportunities\r\nin terms of catch volumes for Union fishing vessels in the Black Sea.\nThe proposal reflects\r\nnot only short-term concerns but is also part of a longer term approach whereby\r\nthe level of fishing is gradually adapted to long-term sustainable levels.\nThe approach taken in\r\nthe proposal might therefore, in the medium to long term, result in reduced\r\nfishing effort but stable or increasing quotas in the long term. The long-term\r\nconsequences of the approach are expected to be a reduced impact on the\r\nenvironment as a consequence of the adaptation in fishing effort and unchanged\r\nor increased landings. The sustainability of fishing activities will increase\r\nin the long term.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7      Summary of the proposed action\nThe proposal establishes the catch\r\nlimitations applicable in the Black Sea to Union fisheries, in order to achieve\r\nthe objective of the Common Fisheries Policy of ensuring fisheries at levels\r\nthat are biologically, economically and socially sustainable.\n\u00b7      Legal basis\nArticle 43(3) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union.\n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the Union\r\nexclusive competence as referred to in Article 3(1)(d) of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does\r\nnot apply.\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reason.\nThe Common Fisheries Policy is a common\r\npolicy. According to Article 43(3) TFEU it is incumbent upon the Council to\r\nadopt the measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\nThe proposed Council Regulation allocates\r\nfishing opportunities to Member States. Having regard to Article 16(6) and (7)\r\nand Article 17 of Regulation 1380/2013, Member States are free to allocate such\r\nopportunities among vessels flying its flag as they see fit. Therefore, Member\r\nStates have ample room for manoeuvre on decisions related to the\r\nsocial/economic model of their choice to exploit their allocated fishing opportunities.\nThe proposal has no new financial\r\nimplications for Member States. This Regulation is adopted by Council every\r\nyear, and the public and private means to implement it are already in place.\n\u00b7      Choice of instruments\nProposed instruments: Regulation.\nThis is a proposal for fisheries management\r\non the basis of Article 43(3) TFEU and in accordance with Article 16 of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 .\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implications for the Union\r\nbudget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n\u00b7      Simplification\nThe proposal continues to provide for\r\nsimplification of administrative procedures for public authorities (EU or\r\nnational), as it contains provisions similar to those of the 2014 Regulation on\r\nthe fishing opportunities in the Black Sea. \n\u00b7      Review/revision/sunset clause\nThe proposal concerns an annual Regulation\r\nfor the year 2015 and therefore does not include a revision clause.\n\u00b7      Detailed Explanation\nThe proposal fixes for 2015 the fishing\r\nopportunities for certain stocks or groups of stocks for Member States fishing\r\nin the Black Sea. \nThe landing obligation\r\nfor stocks caught in certain fisheries starts to become applicable from 1\r\nJanuary 2015. In the Black Sea these fisheries cover small pelagic fisheries,\r\nnamely, the fishery for sprat, which is one of the stocks under TACs and quotas\r\nin this Regulation.\nWith introduction of the\r\nlanding obligation, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013, the fishing opportunities proposed shall reflect the change from\r\namount landed to amount caught. This is done on the basis of the received\r\nscientific advice for the fish stocks in fisheries as refered to in Article\r\n15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. The fishing opportunities should also be\r\nfixed in accordance with Articles 16(1) (referring to the principle of relative\r\nstability) and 16(4) (referring to the objectives of the Common Fisheries\r\nPolicy and the rules provided for in multiannual plans). The proposed figures reflect the scientific advice and the framework\r\nfor setting the TACs and quotas outlined in the Communication\r\nfrom the Commission on the Consultation on fishing opportunities for 2015. \nGiven the Commission's\r\nintention to ensure the sustainable use of fishery resources, in line with the Union's policy and international commitments while maintaining stable fishing\r\nopportunities, annual variations in TACs are limited as far as practicable\r\ntaking account of the status of a given stock.\nThe TACs and quotas allocated to Member\r\nStates are given in the Annex to the proposed Regulation.\nIn accordance with Article 2 of\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 847/96[3],\r\nit is proposed that Articles 3 and 4 do not apply to the stocks covered by this\r\nRegulation. However, in accordance with Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No\r\n1380/2013 year-to-year flexibility envisaged therein applies to stocks covered\r\nby the landing obligation\n2014/0341 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nfixing for 2015 the fishing opportunities\r\nfor certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks in the Black Sea\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 43(3) of the\r\nTreaty provides that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, is to\r\nadopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[4]\r\nrequires that conservation measures be adopted taking into account available\r\nscientific, technical and economic advice, including, where relevant, reports\r\ndrawn up by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries\r\n(STECF).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is incumbent upon the\r\nCouncil to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities\r\nby fishery or group of fisheries in the Black Sea including certain conditions\r\nfunctionally linked thereto, as appropriate. In accordance with Article 16(1) and (4) of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1380/2013 fishing opportunities should be distributed among Member\r\nStates in such a way as to ensure relative stability of each Member State's\r\nfishing activities for each stock or fishery and in accordance the objectives\r\nof the Common Fisheries Policy established in Article 2(2) of that.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The total allowable\r\ncatches (TACs) should be established on the basis of the available scientific\r\nadvice, taking into account biological and socioeconomic aspects whilst\r\nensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the\r\nopinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For sprat fisheries the\r\nlanding obligation referred to in Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013\r\napplies from 1 January 2015. Article 16(2) of that Regulation provides that, when\r\nthe landing obligation is introduced in respect of a fish stock, fishing\r\nopportunities are to be fixed taking into account the change from fixing\r\nfishing opportunities that reflect landings to fixing fishing opportunities\r\nthat reflect catches.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of fishing\r\nopportunities set out in this Regulation is subject to Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1224/2009[5]\r\nand in particular to Articles 33 and 34 thereof concerning\u00a0 the recording of\r\ncatches and the notification of data on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities.\r\nIt is therefore necessary to specify the codes to be used by the Member States\r\nwhen sending data to the Commission relating to landings of stocks subject to\r\nthis Regulation.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\r\nArticle 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96[6], the stocks that are\r\nsubject to the various measures referred to therein must be identified.\n\u00a0(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to avoid interruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihood\r\nof Union fishermen, it is important to open the fisheries concerned in the Black Sea on 1 January 2015. For reasons of urgency, this Regulation should enter into\r\nforce immediately after its publication,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\r\nScope and definitions\nArticle 1\r\nSubject
