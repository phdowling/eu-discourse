This would allow\r\nthe EEA/EFTA countries to take full advandage of the opportunities offered by\r\nthis biggest EU Research and Innovation programme ever with nearly \u20ac80 billion\r\nof funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020). \nThe participation of the EEA/EFTA countries\r\nin Horizon 2020 programme will have budgetary implications since these\r\ncountries will not only participate in the initiatives in this framework, but\r\nat the same time they shall also financially contribute. This is the reason why\r\nthis draft Joint Committee Decision is to be adopted in the form of a Council Decision\r\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe effects of the inclusion of Horizon\r\n2020\nPrevious framework programmes have been\r\nincluded into Article 1(5) of Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement. Pursuant to\r\nthat provision also acts deriving from the framework programmes are to be considered\r\nobjects of that Article. This method of inclusion has been very beneficial,\r\nbecause it has not been necessary to include every act concerning the\r\nprogrammes separately, with all the work and procedures this would entail. Acts\r\nsuch as those establishing specific programmes and laying down the rules for\r\nthe participation and dissemination in the framework programmes have therefore\r\nnot been included separately into the EEA Agreement. The draft JCD applies the\r\nsame method of incorporation and hence contains a provision on the inclusion of\r\nthe Horizon 2020 Framework Regulation into Article 1(5).\nRegulation (EC) No 294/2008[1] establishing the\r\nEuropean Institute of Innovation and Technology is included in Article 1(11) of\r\nProtocol 31 to the EEA Agreement. The Regulation has been amended by Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1292/2013, and this amendment must be reflected in the EEA Agreement.\r\nThe draft JCD therefore contains a provision including the amending act in\r\nArticle 1(11).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nRegulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing Horizon\r\n2020 \u2013 the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) and\r\nrepealing Decision No 1982/2006/EC[2]\r\n\nRegulation (EU) No 1292/2013 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 amending Regulation (EC) No\r\n294/2008 establishing the European Institute of Innovation and Technology[3]\nThe Commission submits the Draft Decision\r\nof the EEA Joint Committee for adoption by the Council of the corresponding Union\u2019s position.
