In case the United Kingdom has made that\r\nnotification, all acts referred to in Article 10(1) shall cease to apply\r\nto it as from the date of expiry of the transitional period referred to in Article\r\n10(3), that is from 1 December 2014.\nThe United Kingdom made the notification\r\nmentioned in the first subparagraph of Article 10(4) of Protocol (No 36) on\r\n24 July 2013.\nArticle 10(4), second subparagraph of Protocol\r\n(No\u00b036) provides that the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal\r\nfrom the Commission, shall determine the necessary consequential and\r\ntransitional arrangements. The United Kingdom shall not participate in the\r\nadoption of this decision.\nArticle 10(4), third subparagraph of Protocol\r\n(No 36) provides that the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal\r\nfrom the Commission, may also adopt a decision determining that the United Kingdom shall bear the direct financial consequences, if any, necessarily and\r\nunavoidably incurred as a result of the cessation of its participation in those\r\nacts.\nArticle 10(5) of Protocol (No 36) provides\r\nthat the United Kingdom may, at any time afterwards, notify the Council of its\r\nwish to participate in acts which have ceased to apply to it pursuant to Article\r\n10(4), first subparagraph.\nThe United Kingdom announced that it does not\r\nintend to notify the Council of its wish to participate in Council Decision\r\n2008/615/JHA of 23 June 2008 on stepping up of cross-border cooperation,\r\nparticularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime,[1]\r\nin Council Decision 2008/616/JHA of 23 June 2008 on the\r\nimplementation of Council Decision 2008/615/JHA on stepping up of cross-border\r\ncooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime[2]\r\nand in Council Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA of 30\r\nNovember 2009 on accreditation of forensic service providers carrying out\r\nlaboratory activities[3]\r\n(hereafter the \"Pr\u00fcm Decisions\").\nAs a consequence of the notification of\r\n24 July 2013 and of the non-notification of a wish to participate,\r\nthe Pr\u00fcm Decisions cease to apply to the United Kingdom from\r\n1 December 2014.\nIn view of the practical and operational\r\nsignificance of the Pr\u00fcm Decisions to the Union for public security, and more\r\nparticularly for law enforcement and the prevention, detection and\r\ninvestigation of criminal offences, the Commission has proposed a Council\r\nDecision on consequential and transitional arrangements which provides for\r\nbinding arrangements [\u2026].[4]\nThe United Kingdom has been allocated funds\r\nfrom the ISEC Programme as set out in Council Decision 2007/125/JHA of 12\r\nFebruary 2007 establishing for the period 2007 to 2013, as part of General\r\nProgramme on Security and Safeguarding Liberties, the Specific Programme\r\n\u2018Prevention of and Fight against Crime\u2019[5]\r\nfor two projects related to the Pr\u00fcm Decisions, first concerning the\r\nimplementation by the United Kingdom of the Pr\u00fcm DNA Exchange, with a maximum\r\nco-funding of EUR 961 019 granted to the Home Office, and secondly\r\nconcerning the Pr\u00fcm Fingerprint Evaluation project by the United Kingdom, with\r\na maximum co-funding of EUR 547 836 granted to the Home Office. This\r\nmakes for a total of EUR 1 508 855.\nIf the United Kingdom does not respect a\r\ncondition contained in the Council Decision on consequential and transitional\r\narrangements [\u2026], or if the United Kingdom decides not to participate in the\r\nPr\u00fcm Decisions, it should repay the sum which has been actually paid to it, up\r\nto the total of EUR 1 508 855.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n Summary of the proposed measures The proposal determines the direct financial consequences \u00a0necessarily and unavoidably incurred as a result of the cessation of the participation of the United Kingdom in acts in the meaning of Article 10(4), third subparagraph of Protocol (No\u00b036). \n Legal basis Article 10(4), third subparagraph of Protocol (No\u00b036). \n Principle of subsidiarity Only the Council is authorised, on the basis of Article 10(4), third subparagraph of Protocol (No\u00b036), to adopt a decision determining that the United Kingdom shall bear the direct financial consequences necessarily and unavoidably incurred as a result of the cessation of its participation in the acts concerned. The principle of subsidiarity is therefore not applicable. \n Principle of proportionality The proposal complies with the principle of proportionality. \n Choice of instrument \n Proposed instrument: Council decision. \n Article 10(4), third subparagraph of Protocol (No\u00b036) provides for the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, to possibly adopt \"a decision determining that the United Kingdom shall bear the direct financial consequences, if any, necessarily and unavoidably incurred as a result of the cessation of its participation in those acts\". A decision is therefore the form of act expressly provided for in this provision of primary law. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPACT\nThe proposal has a potential positive impact on\r\nthe European Union budget, as it provides in certain hypotheses for the\r\nrepayment by the United Kingdom of up to EUR 1 508 855 received from the Union.\n2014/0277 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\ndetermining certain direct financial\r\nconsequences incurred as a result of the cessation of the participation of the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in certain acts of the\r\nUnion in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal\r\nmatters adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\r\nProtocol on transitional provisions, and in particular the third subparagraph\r\nof Article 10(4) thereof,\nHaving regard to the\r\nproposal from the European Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under Protocol (No 36) on\r\ntransitional provisions, annexed to the Treaty on\r\nEuropean Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European\r\nAtomic Energy Community, the\r\nUnited Kingdom had the possiblity to notify to the Council, by 31 May 2014 at\r\nthe latest, that it does not accept the powers of the Commission and of the\r\nCourt of Justice introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon with respect to acts of the\r\nUnion in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal\r\nmatters which had been adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of\r\nLisbon.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter to the President\r\nof the Council of 24 July 2013, the United Kingdom has notified that it did not\r\naccept the powers of the Commission and of the Court of Justice introduced by\r\nthe Treaty of Lisbon in the field of police cooperation and judicial\r\ncooperation. As a consequence the relevant acts in the field of police\r\ncooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters cease to apply to the United Kingdom on 1 December 2014.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The United Kingdom may notify its wish to participate in the acts which have ceased to apply to\r\nit.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter to the President\r\nof the Council and to the President of the Commission of [\u2026 2014], the United Kingdom has notified its wish to participate in some of the acts.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the second\r\nsubparagraph of Article 10(4) of Protocol 36, the Council should, on a proposal\r\nfrom the Commission, determine the necessary consequential and transitional\r\narrangements.

However, given the practical and operational significance of the Pr\u00fcm\r\nDecisions to the Union for public security, and more particularly for law\r\nenforcement and the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal\r\noffences, the Council decided in its Decision [\u2026][9] that the United Kingdom\r\nwill undertake a full business and implementation case to assess the merits and\r\npractical benefits of the United Kingdom re-joining the Pr\u00fcm Decisions and the\r\nnecessary steps for it to do so, the results of which will be published by 30\r\nSeptember 2015. If the business and implementation case is positive, the United Kingdom will decide, by 31 December 2015, on whether to notify, within the following\r\nfour weeks, of its wish to participate in the Pr\u00fcm Decisions, in accordance\r\nwith Article 10(5) of Protocol 36.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Funds from the Programme \u2018Prevention of and Fight against\r\nCrime\u2019 established by Council Decision 2007/125/JHA[10] have been allocated to the United Kingdom for two projects related\r\nto Decisions 2008/615/JHA and 2008/616/JHA and Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA,\r\nfirst concerning the implementation by the United Kingdom of the Pr\u00fcm DNA Exchange,\r\nwith a maximum co-funding of EUR 961 019 granted to the Home Office,\r\nand secondly concerning the Pr\u00fcm Fingerprint Evaluation project by the United\r\nKingdom, with a maximum co-funding of EUR 547 836 granted to the Home\r\nOffice.
