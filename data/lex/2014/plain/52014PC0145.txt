The High Representative/Vice-President,\r\nBaroness Ashton, also welcomed and expressed satisfaction at the conduct of the\r\nelections[8].\r\n\nAll the\r\nconditions are thus met for the EU's commitments on Madagascar, as listed in\r\nthe annex to Council Decision 2011/808/EU, to be honoured and for the Council\r\nto repeal the decision currently in force. \nRevoking\r\nthe provisional measures will send a strong, clear political signal from the EU\r\nto Madagascar and to all international partners, particularly those in Africa,\r\nregarding its support at the start of this new post-crisis era and will allow\r\nthe normal cooperation ties between the EU and Madagascar to be resumed.\n2014/0082 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nrepealing Decision 2010/371/EU of 7 June\r\n2010\r\nconcerning the conclusion of consultations \r\nwith the Republic of Madagascar \r\nunder Article 96 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement\r\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to the Partnership Agreement\r\nbetween the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, of\r\nthe one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other\r\npart, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000[9],\r\nand revised in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on 22 June 2010[10], hereinafter referred\r\nto as \u2018the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement\u2019, and in particular Article 96 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Internal Agreement\r\nbetween the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting\r\nwithin the Council, on measures to be taken and procedures to be followed for\r\nthe implementation of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement[11], and in particular\r\nArticle 3 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nIn agreement with the High Representative\r\nof the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2010/371/EU of 7\r\nJune 2010 concerning the conclusion of consultations with the Republic of Madagascar under Article 96 of the ACP\u2011EU Partnership Agreement[12] was adopted in order\r\nto implement appropriate measures in response to the violation of the essential\r\nelements referred to in Article 9 of the Agreement. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These measures were\r\nextended until 6 December 2011 by Decision 2011/324/EU[13] of 30 May 2011,\r\namended and extended until 5 December 2012 by Decision 2011/808/EU of 5\r\nDecember 2011[14]\r\nand, most recently, extended indefinitely by Decision 2012/749/EU[15] of 3 December 2012 \u2018until\r\nthe Council decides, on the basis of a proposal made by the Commission, that\r\ncredible elections have taken place and that constitutional order has returned\r\nto Madagascar \u2026\". \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Presidential and general\r\nelections were held on 25 October and 20 December 2013, the results\r\nwere officially announced on 17 January and 6 February 2014 and the newly\r\nelected institutions have been inaugurated, thus confirming Madagascar's return to constitutional rule.
