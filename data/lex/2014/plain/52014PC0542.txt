In the framework of\r\nthe AA/DCFTA negotiations, the Republic of Moldova has adopted an ambitious\r\nagenda for political association and further economic integration with the Union. It has also made strong progress on regulatory approximation leading to convergence\r\nwith Union laws and standards.\nRecently the Republic of Moldova has experienced and continues to experience difficulties with its fruit and vegetables\r\nexports to some of its traditional markets, which threaten its economic\r\nrecovery and the reform process that is vigorously pursued by the government of\r\nthe Republic of Moldova. The agricultural sector represents around 40 per cent\r\nof the Republic of Moldova's economy and the horticultural sector is an\r\nimportant part of it, providing employment to some 250,000 people (i.e. around\r\n10% of the active population), who are mainly living in rural areas and\r\ncultivating medium to smaller family plots. Moreover, horticultural export\r\nlevels have fallen in recent years and any significant further decline would\r\nhave a disproportionately adverse effect, not just on the economy but on\r\nsociety as a whole. \nIn the framework of the DCFTA, the Union committed\r\nitself to fully liberalise the market access for a number of fresh fruits and\r\nvegetables up to certain volumes set above the Republic of Moldova's traditional exports to the Union. Taking into consideration the current temporary severe\r\ndifficulties in accessing the Republic of Moldova's traditional export markets\r\nfor a number of products, the European Commission proposes to increase temporarily\r\nits fully liberalised market access for imports of these products from the Republic of Moldova, allowing their commercialisation in the Union. \nThe proposed amendment to Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 55/2008 introduces three new duty free tariff quotas for fresh\r\napples, fresh table grapes and fresh plums. As the Autonomous Trade Preference scheme\r\nexpires at the end of 2015, this amendment provides for a time-limited response\r\nto the immediate needs for the key export products adversely affected (i.e.\r\napples, plums and table grapes). \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the proposal is Article\r\n207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposed amendment to the Regulation\r\nincurs negligible implications for the EU budget. The total imports from the Republic of   Moldova to the EU in 2013 constituted 0.1% of the total imports to the EU.\r\nWhereas about 90% of all imports from the Republic of Moldova enter the EU\r\nduty-free, imports of fresh apples, fresh plums and fresh table grapes under\r\nentry price from the Republic of Moldova represented less than 0.01% of the\r\ntotal EU imports from the world of these products. \nThe corresponding loss of tariff revenue\r\nshould therefore have a limited impact on the EU\u2019s own resources. Although the\r\nduty-free quotas proposed are significantly higher than the current imports\r\nfrom the Republic of Moldova of those three products, filling in of these\r\nquotas by the Republic of Moldova is not expected to significantly increase the\r\n  Republic of Moldova's share in the EU total imports of the products\r\nconcerned. \n2014/0250 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n55/2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n55/2008[1]\r\nestablished a specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences (ATPs) for the Republic of   Moldova. That scheme gives all products originating in the Republic of Moldova\r\nfree access to the Union market, except for certain agricultural products\r\nlisted in Annex I to that Regulation for which limited concessions have been granted\r\neither in the form of exemption from customs duties within the limit of tariff\r\nquotas or of reduction of customs duties. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the framework of the\r\nEuropean Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the EU-Moldova ENP Action Plan, and the\r\nEastern Partnership, the Republic of Moldova has adopted an ambitious agenda\r\nfor political association and further economic integration with the Union. The Republic of Moldova has also already made strong progress on regulatory\r\napproximation leading to convergence with Union laws and standards.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Association Agreement,\r\nincluding the establishment of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA)\r\nbetween the Union and the Republic of Moldova was signed on 27 June 2014 and\r\nwill apply provisionally from 1 September 2014. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The specific scheme of\r\nautonomous trade preferences will continue to apply until 31 December 2015. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to support the\r\nefforts of the Republic of Moldova in accordance with the objectives set out in\r\nthe ENP, the Eastern Partnership and the Association Agreement, and to provide\r\nan attractive and reliable market for its exports of fresh apples, fresh plums\r\nand fresh table grapes, further concessions should be made for the import of those\r\nproducts from the Republic of Moldova into the Union, on the basis of duty free tariff quotas.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also necessary to\r\namend certain CN codes in the Annex to this Regulation in order to reflect the\r\namendments introduced to Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23\r\nJuly 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs\r\nTariff[2]\r\nby Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1001/2013[3]. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow the\r\noperators to benefit from those further concessions as soon as possible, this\r\nRegulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the\r\nOfficial Journal of the European Union. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the seasonal\r\nproduction peak of those products, it is appropriate to apply the further\r\nconcessions from 1 August 2014.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 55/2008\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nIn Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 55/2008,\r\nTable 1 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 August 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the European Parliament\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\nThe President\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n FINANCIAL STATEMENT || FinancSt/2014 JE/ks/2755352 6.9.2014.1 \n   || DATE: 28/07/2014 \n 1. || BUDGET HEADING: Chapter 12 \u2013 Customs duties and other duties || APPROPRIATIONS: B 2014: EUR 16 185.6 million \n 2. || TITLE: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova.   \n 3. || LEGAL BASIS: Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in particular Article 207(2).   \n 4. || AIMS: To further liberalise imports of certain products of the fruit and vegetables sector from the Republic of Moldova into the EU.   \n 5. || FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS || 12 MONTH PERIOD (EUR million) || CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR 2014 (EUR million) || FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR 2015 (EUR million) \n 5.0 || EXPENDITURE -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHARGED TO THE EU BUDGET (REFUNDS/INTERVENTIONS) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL AUTHORITIES -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OTHER || - || - || - \n 5.1 || REVENUE -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OWN RESOURCES OF THE EU (LEVIES/CUSTOMS DUTIES) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL || - || - || - \n   ||   || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 \n 5.0.1 || ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE || - || - || - || - \n 5.1.1 || ESTIMATED REVENUE || - || - || - || - \n 5.2 || METHOD OF CALCULATION: - \n OBSERVATIONS : Most of the products currently imported from the Republic of Moldova in the EU already benefit from trade preferences due to the existing autonomous trade measures. This proposal will have an effect on collected import duties. However, in view of the very limited quantities imported, this effect is expected to be limited and cannot be quantified precisely at present.   The proposed amendment to the Regulation incurs negligible implications for the EU budget. The total imports from the Republic of Moldova to the EU in 2013 constituted 0.1% of the total imports to the EU. Whereas about 90% of all imports from the Republic of Moldova enter the EU duty-free, imports of fresh apples, fresh plums and fresh table grapes under entry price from the Republic of Moldova represented less than 0.01% of the total EU imports from the world of these products. The corresponding loss of tariff revenue should therefore have a limited impact on the EU\u2019s own resources. Although the duty-free quotas proposed are significantly higher than the current imports from the Republic of Moldova of those three products, filling in of these quotas by the Republic of Moldova is not expected to significantly increase the Republic of Moldova's share in the EU total imports of the products concerned. \n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 of 21 January 2008\r\nintroducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova and amending Regulation (EC) No 980/2005 and Commission Decision 2005/924/EC (OJ L 20,\r\n24.1.2008, p. 1).\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 290, 31.10.2013, p. 1\nANNEX\n\u201c1.\r\nProducts subject to annual duty free tariff quotas\n Order No || CN Code || Description || 2008 (1) || 2009 (1) || 2010 (1) || 2011 (1) || 2012 (1) || 2013 (1) || 2014 (1) || 2015 (1) \n 09.0504 || 0201 to 0204 || Fresh, chilled and frozen meat of bovine animals, swine and sheep and goats || 3 000 (2) || 3 000 (2) || 4 000 (2) || 4 000 (2) || 4 000 (2) || 4 000 (2) || 4 000 (2) || 4 000 (2) \n 09.0505 || ex 0207 || Meat and edible offal of the poultry of heading 0105, fresh, chilled or frozen, other than fatty livers of subheading 0207 34 || 400 (2) || 400 (2) || 500 (2) || 500 (2) || 500 (2) ||     500 (2) || 500 (2) || 500 (2) \n 09.0506 || ex 0210 || Meat and edible meat offal of swine and bovine animals, salted, in brine, dried or smoked; edible flours and meals of meat or meat offal of domestic swine and bovine animals || 400 (2) || 400 (2) || 500 (2) || 500 (2) || 500 (2) ||     500 (2) || 500 (2) || 500 (2) \n 09.4210 || 0401 to 0406 || Dairy products || 1 000 (2) || 1 000 (2) || 1 500 (2) || 1 500 (2) || 1 500 (2) || 1 500 (2) || 1 500 (2) || 1 500 (2) \n 09.0507 || 0407 00 || Birds' eggs, in shell || 90 (3) || 95 (3) || 100 (3) || 110 (3) || 120 (3) || 120 (3) || 120 (3) || 120 (3) \n 09.0508 || ex 0408 || Bird's eggs, not in shell and egg yolks, other than unfit for human consumption || 200 (2) || 200 (2) || 300 (2) || 300 (2) || 300 (2) || 300 (2) || 300 (2) || 300 (2) \n 09.0515 || 0806 10 10 || Fresh table grapes || - || - || - || - || - || - || 10 000 (2) (4) || 10 000 (2) \n 09.0516 || 0808 10 80 || Fresh apples (at the exception of cider apples, in bulk, from 16 September to 15 December) || - || - || - || - || - || - || 40 000 (2) (4) || 40 000 (2) \n 09.0517 || 0809 40 05 || Fresh plums || - || - || - || - || - || - || 10 000 (2) (4) || 10 000 (2) \n 09.0509 ||   1001 91 20 1001 91 90 1001 99 || Other spelt (other than spelt for sowing), common wheat and meslin || 25 000 (2) || 30 000 (2) || 35 000 (2) || 40 000 (2) || 50 000 (2) || 55 000 (2) || 60 000 (2) || 65 000 (2) \n 09.0510 || 1003 90 00 || Barley || 20 000 (2) || 25 000 (2) || 30 000 (2) || 35 000 (2) || 45 000 (2) || 50 000 (2) || 55 000 (2) || 60 000 (2) \n 09.0511 || 1005 90 || Maize || 15 000 (2) || 20 000 (2) || 25 000 (2) || 30 000 (2) || 40 000 (2) || 45 000 (2) || 50 000 (2) || 55 000 (2) \n 09.0512 || 1601 00 91 and 1601 00 99 || Sausages and similar products, of meat, meat offal or blood; food preparations based on these products || 500 (2) || 500 (2) || 600 (2) || 600 (2) || 600 (2) || 600 (2) || 600 (2) || 600 (2) \n ex 1602 || Other prepared or preserved meat, meat offal or blood: - of fowls of the species Gallus domesticus, uncooked, - of domestic swine, - of bovine animals, uncooked ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n 09.0513 || 1701 99 10 || White Sugar || 15 000 (2) || 18 000 (2) || 26 000 (2) || 34 000 (2) || 34 000 (2) || 34 000 (2) || 34 000 (2) || 34 000 (2) \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From 1\r\nJanuary until 31 December, except for 2008, for which the tariff quotas apply\r\nfrom the first day of application of the Regulation until 31 December. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tonnes (net\r\nweight). \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Million\r\nunits.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\n2014, the tariff quota applies from 1 August until 31 December.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
