It has contributed\r\nconsiderably to the completion and operation of the Single Market with regard\r\nto PPE. It permits the free movement of PPE covered by its scope in Europe while ensuring a high level of protection for its user.\nThe PPE Directive sets out basic\r\nrequirements, that PPE must comply with in order to be made available on the EU\r\nmarket. PPE must be designed and manufactured in compliance with the provisions\r\nof the Directive. Manufacturers must also affix the CE marking and provide users\r\nwith instructions for storage, use, cleaning, maintenance, servicing and\r\ndisinfection of the PPE.\nThe PPE Directive is based on Article 114\r\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and is one of the first\r\nharmonisation Directives based on the \u201cNew Approach\u201d principles, according to\r\nwhich manufacturers must ensure compliance of their products with the essential\r\nhealth and safety requirements provided for in the legislative instrument. The\r\nessential requirements are performance based, without imposing specific\r\ntechnical solutions or specifications.\nThe PPE Directive applies to PPE that is\r\ndefined as \u201cany device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual\r\nfor protection against one or more health and safety hazards\u201d. It also\r\ncovers \u201cinterchangeable PPE components which are essential to its\r\nsatisfactory functioning and used exclusively for such equipment\u201d and \u201cany\r\nsystem placed on the market in conjunction with PPE for its connection to\r\nanother external, additional device\u201d. Examples of PPE are safety helmets, ear\r\nmuffs, safety shoes, life jackets but also bicycle helmets, sunglasses and\r\nhigh-visibility vests.\nCertain types of PPE are excluded from the\r\nscope of the PPE Directive, namely PPE specifically designed and manufactured for\r\nuse by armed forces or in the maintenance of law and order, PPE for\r\nself-defence, PPE designed and manufactured for private use against atmospheric\r\nconditions, damp, water and heat, PPE intended for the protection or rescue of\r\npersons on vessels or aircraft, not worn all the time and helmets and visors\r\nintended for users of two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles.\nWhile the directive has successfully\r\nachieved its objectives in creating a single market and ensuring a high level\r\nof protection for users of PPE, certain problems have been encountered in its\r\nimplementation. These concern products on the market that do not ensure an\r\nadequate level of protection, diverging approaches of the notified bodies, the\r\neffectiveness of the market surveillance as well as risks related to protective\r\nequipment which is currently not covered by the PPE Directive. Furthermore some\r\nprovisions of the PPE Directive should be made clearer and simpler.\nThis proposal intends to replace Directive 89/686/EEC\r\non personal protective equipment by a Regulation, in line with the Commission\u2019s\r\nsimplification objectives.\nThe overall objectives of this initiative\r\nare to better protect the health and safety of PPE users, to ensure a level\r\nplaying field for PPE economic operators within the internal market and\r\nsimplify the European regulatory environment in the field of PPE. The proposal modifies\r\nand clarifies a number of the provisions of the existing Directive and aligns\r\nit with the provisions of Decision No 768/2008/EC[2] establishing a common\r\nframework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision).\nMore specifically, it is proposed to slightly\r\nenlarge the scope of the current PPE Directive by removing the exclusions of products\r\nfor private use providing protection against heat, damp and water. Experience with\r\nthe implementation and enforcement of the PPE Directive showed that these exclusions\r\nwere no longer justified. In order to improve the health and safety of the users,\r\nthe requirements of the PPE Directive and hence of this proposal should apply\r\nto these products. Clarifications were introduced in order to reduce\r\ninterpretation, e. g. concerning provisions for made-to-measure and individually\r\nadapted PPE. The list of the products subject to the most stringent conformity\r\nassessment procedure was revised in order to remove inconsistencies.\r\nDocumentary requirements were changed in order to improve the work of the\r\nmarket surveillance authorities and minor changes to three essential health and\r\nsafety requirements were introduced in order to remove sources of confusion.\nThe proposal also intends to align the PPE Directive\r\nto the NLF Decision. Many of the general problems identified at horizontal\r\nlevel have also been observed in the context of implementing the PPE Directive\r\n(PPE placed on the market that does not ensure an adequate level of protection,\r\nproblems with the quality of the services delivered by some notified bodies,\r\ndifferent practices in the Member States as regards the evaluation and\r\nmonitoring of notified bodies). A number of manufacturers are also faced with\r\nthe problem of the legal framework being complex and sometimes inconsistent. The\r\nalignment of the PPE Directive with the NLF responds to the political commitment\r\nlaid down in Article 2 of the NLF Decision.\nThe NLF Decision sets out a common\r\nframework for EU product harmonisation legislation. This framework consists of\r\nthe provisions which are commonly used in EU product legislation (e.g.\r\ndefinitions, obligations of economic operators, notified bodies, safeguard\r\nmechanisms, etc.). These common provisions have been reinforced to ensure that\r\nthe legislation can be applied and enforced more effectively in practice. New elements,\r\nsuch as obligations of importers, have been introduced, which are crucial for\r\nimproving the safety of products on the market. \nThe Commission has already proposed the\r\nalignment of nine Directives to the NLF Decision within an NLF implementation\r\npackage adopted on 21 November 2011.\nIn view of ensuring consistency across Union harmonisation legislation for industrial products, in accordance with the political\r\ncommitment resulting from the adoption of the NLF Decision and the legal\r\nobligation provided for in Article 2 of the NLF Decision, it is necessary that\r\nthis proposal is in line with the provisions of the NLF Decision.\nThe proposal takes into account Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October\r\n2012 on European standardisation, amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and\r\n93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC, 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC,\r\n2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council and repealing Council Decision 87/95/EEC and Decision No 1673/2006/EC\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[3].\nThe proposal also takes into account the\r\nproposal of the Commission of 13 February 2013 for a Regulation on market\r\nsurveillance of products[4],\r\nwhich intends to set out a single legal instrument on the market surveillance\r\nactivities in the field of non-food goods, consumer or non-consumer products\r\nand products covered or not by Union harmonisation legislation. The proposal merges\r\nthe rules on market surveillance of Directive 2001/95/EC on general product\r\nsafety[5],\r\nRegulation (EC) 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9\r\nJuly 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market\r\nsurveillance relating to the marketing of products[6] and of sector-specific\r\nharmonisation legislation in order to increase the effectiveness of market\r\nsurveillance activities within the Union. The proposed Regulation on market\r\nsurveillance of products contains also the relevant provisions on market\r\nsurveillance and safeguard clauses. Therefore, provisions in existing sector\r\nspecific harmonisation legislation that relate to market surveillance and\r\nsafeguard clauses should be removed from that harmonisation legislation. The\r\noveracting objective of the proposed Regulation is to simplify the Union market\r\nsurveillance framework fundamentally so that it works better for its main\r\nusers: market surveillance authorities and economic operators. The current PPE\r\nDirective provides for a safeguard clause procedure. In line with the framework\r\nintended to be established by the proposed Regulation on market surveillance of\r\nproducts, this proposal for a Regulation on PPE does not include the provisions\r\non market surveillance and safeguard clause procedures for PPE provided for in\r\nthe NLF Decision. However, in order to ensure legal clarity, it makes a\r\nreference to the proposed Regulation on market surveillance of products.\nConsistency with other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThis initiative is in\r\nline with the Single Market Act[7], which stressed the need to restore consumer\r\nconfidence in the quality of products on the market and the importance of\r\nreinforcing market surveillance.\nFurthermore it supports\r\nthe Commission\u2019s policy on Better Regulation and simplification of the\r\nregulatory environment.\nThis proposal does not\r\nchange the relationship to the Directive 89/656/EEC[8] of\r\n30 November 1989 on the minimum health and safety requirements for\r\nthe use by workers of personal protective equipment at the workplace (third\r\nindividual directive within the meaning of Article 16 (1) of Directive\r\n89/391/EEC).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nThe revision of the PPE Directive has been\r\ndiscussed with all stakeholders, including Member States, manufacturers' federations,\r\nnotified bodies and representatives from standardisation. The consultation\r\nincluded meetings for a selected group of experts as well as consultation of\r\nthe PPE Working Group as well as the PPE AdCo Group of market surveillance\r\nauthorities.\nWhile the success of the Directive is\r\ngenerally recognised a broad consensus exists among the Member States and other stakeholders that some improvements can be made, contributing to an even more\r\neffective protection of the health of the users and to a more efficient\r\nfunctioning of the PPE legislation including more effective market surveillance.\r\nMost of the proposed improvements result from the day to day experience of\r\nMember States authorities and other stakeholders with the enforcement and\r\nimplementation of the PPE legislation and are not directly related to\r\naccidents. \nFrom April to June 2011 a public\r\nconsultation collected views and opinions of relevant stakeholders and citizens\r\non the various issues that the revision of the PPE Directive might address.\r\nOverall 77 responses were received, 74 from the 27 Member States (authorities,\r\nenterprises, notified bodies, trade associations, individual citizens), 2 from\r\nan EFTA country and 1 from overseas. The replies provided the Commission\r\nservices with a broader view on the identified policy needs and as such confirmed\r\nthe envisaged approaches[9].\nIn general all stakeholders expressed\r\nsupport for the initiative. Both authorities and industry consider that the PPE\r\nlegislation needs to be simplified and clarified. There is unanimity on the\r\nneed to improve market surveillance and the system for assessing and monitoring\r\nnotified bodies.\nThere is also unanimity on the need to\r\nalign the PPE Directive to the NLF and thus to improve the existing general\r\nregulatory framework. Authorities fully support the exercise because it will\r\nstrengthen the existing system and improve cooperation at EU level. Industry\r\nexpects a more level playing field resulting from more effective actions\r\nagainst products that do not comply with the legislation, as well as a\r\nsimplification effect from the alignment of legislation.\nFurthermore Member States and stakeholders\r\nexpressed their support for:\n\u2013                        \r\nThe extension of the product coverage of the PPE\r\nDirective;\n\u2013                        \r\nThe addition of some types of PPE to the list of\r\nproducts subject to the most stringent conformity assessment procedure;\n\u2013                        \r\nThe change of three basic health and safety\r\nrequirements; and\n\u2013                        \r\nThe change of the requirements to the technical\r\nfile, the validity and content of the EC type-examination certificate, and the\r\nEC Declaration of Conformity.\nCollection and use of expertise - Impact\r\nassessment \nAn impact assessment on the revision of the\r\nPPE Directive has been conducted. The impact assessment sets out extensively\r\nthe different options of revision of the sector related aspects of the PPE Directive.\nWith regard to the NLF alignment aspects,\r\nthe impact assessment report for the revision of the PPE Directive refers to\r\nthe general impact assessment conducted in the framework of the NLF\r\nImplementation package of 21 November 2011[10].\nIn particular, the modifications due to the\r\nalignment to the NLF Decision and their impacts are expected to be the same as\r\nfor the nine product harmonisation Directives included in the Alignment\r\nPackage.\nThe Impact Assessment Report on this Alignment\r\nPackage has already examined in depth the different options, which are exactly\r\nthe same with regard to the PPE Directive. The Report contained also an\r\nanalysis of the impacts resulting from the legislative alignment to the\r\nprovisions of the NLF Decision.\nTherefore, the Impact Assessment Report on\r\nthe revision of the PPE Directive did not examine those aspects and it focussed\r\non specific issues relating to the PPE Directive as well as on the ways to\r\naddress them.\nAn external study launched and completed in\r\n2010[11]\r\nto complement he results of the consultation .The study\r\nprovides an overview of the structure of the PPE market as well as it assesses\r\nthe impacts of the proposed measures. \nIn 2012 another complementary study was\r\ncarried out. It focused on analysing the competitiveness impacts of the\r\nenvisaged changes[12].\nBased on the information collected, the\r\nimpact assessment carried out by the Commission examined and compared three\r\noptions with regard to problems and issues relating to the PPE Directive.\nOption 1 \u2013 \u201cDo nothing\u201d - No changes to\r\nthe existing situation\nThis option proposes no changes to the PPE\r\nDirective.\nOption 2 \u2013 Intervention by\r\nnon-legislative measures\nOption 2 considers voluntary measures to\r\nresolve the identified issues, e.g., guidance documents containing a commonly\r\nagreed interpretation of the PPE Directive.\nOption 3 \u2013 Intervention by legislative\r\nmeasures\nThis option consists in modifying the PPE Directive.\nOption 3 was\r\nfound to be the preferred option because:\n\u2013                        \r\nit is considered more effective than option 2:\r\ndue to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the\r\npositive impacts would materialise under that option;\n\u2013                        \r\nit leads to an improved level of protection of\r\nthe health and safety of the users in a framework of legal certainty;\n\u2013                        \r\nit ensures a more effective work of the market\r\nsurveillance authorities and consequently reduces the non-compliant products\r\nand creates a more level playing field;\n\u2013                        \r\nit does not entail significant costs for\r\neconomic operators and notified bodies; for manufacturers of products that are\r\nnot yet covered by the PPE Directive the cost will be higher but only affect\r\nthose manufacturers that do not meet the basic requirements at the moment;\r\nhowever, those products are manufactured in mass production resulting in a low\r\nimpact on cost per unit;\n\u2013                        \r\nit will strengthen the competitiveness of\r\nEuropean enterprises as a result of guaranteeing a level playing field for the\r\neconomic operators and will lead to a better protection of the users of PPE; \n\u2013                        \r\noptions 1 and 2 do not provide answers to legal\r\ninconsistencies or ambiguities and therefore will not lead to a better\r\nimplementation of the PPE Directive.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\r\nScope and definitions\nThe scope of the proposed Regulation is\r\nenlarged compared to the scope of Directive 89/686/EEC. The exclusions of PPE\r\ndesigned and manufactured for private use against heat, damp and water, set out\r\nin Annex I of 89/686/EEC, are removed. These products are included in the\r\nscope of the proposed Regulation.\nThe proposal keeps the other existing\r\nexclusions and clarifies that it does not apply to PPE for head, face or eye\r\nprotection, subject to the relevant UNECE Regulation, of users of two- or\r\nthree-wheeled motor vehicles.\nTwo PPE specific definitions have been\r\nadded in order to clarify the applicable conformity assessment procedures: \u201cIndividually\r\nadapted PPE\u201d and \u201cMade-to-measure PPE\u201d.\nAdditionally, the general definitions of the\r\nNLF Decision have been inserted.\n3.2.\r\nMaking available on the market, free movement, obligations of economic\r\noperators, CE marking\nThe proposal contains the typical\r\nprovisions for product-related Union harmonisation legislation and sets out the\r\nobligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised\r\nrepresentatives, importers and distributors), in accordance with the NLF\r\nDecision.\nThe proposal obliges the manufacturer of\r\nPPE to draw up a technical documentation and to ensure that the PPE is\r\naccompanied by a copy of the EU declaration of conformity or a simplified EU\r\ndeclaration of conformity.\n3.3.\r\nNotified bodies\nProper functioning of notified bodies is\r\ncrucial for ensuring a high level of health and safety protection and for the\r\nconfidence of all interested parties in the New Approach system.\nTherefore, in line with the NLF Decision,\r\nthe proposal sets out requirements for national authorities responsible for\r\nconformity assessment bodies (notified bodies). It leaves the ultimate\r\nresponsibility for designating and monitoring notified bodies with the\r\nindividual Member State.\n3.4. Categories\r\nand Conformity assessment\nThe proposal simplifies the definition of\r\nthe categories of PPE. The category only depends on the risk against which the\r\nPPE is intended to protect. The risks belonging to each category are set out in\r\nAnnex I. Made-to-measure PPE is defined as category II.\nThe conformity assessment procedures to be\r\nfollowed depend on the category of the PPE.\nThe proposed Regulation changes the\r\ncategory of a few types of PPE compared to Directive 89/686/EEC. PPE intended\r\nto protect the user against drowning, cuts by hand-held chain-saws,\r\nhigh-pressure cutting, bullet wounds or knife stabs, and harmful noise is\r\nlisted under category III and subject to the most stringent conformity\r\nassessment procedure.\nThe proposal keeps the applicable conformity\r\nassessment procedures provided for under Directive 89/686/EEC. It however\r\nupdates the corresponding modules in line with the NLF Decision.\nIn module B, EU type-examination,\r\nadditional requirements are introduced concerning the minimum content and the length\r\nof validity of the EU type-examination certificates. The module provides for a\r\nprocedure for a review of the certificate.\nModule B also requires particular steps for\r\nindividually adapted PPE and made-to-measure PPE. \n3.5.\r\nEssential health and safety requirements\nThe proposed Regulation changes marginally\r\nthree essential health and safety requirements (EHSR) set out in Annex II. EHSR\r\n3.1.3, 3.5, and 3.9.1 are changed in order to remove requirements shown to be\r\nimpracticable or that create confusion.\n3.6.\r\nImplementing acts\nThe proposal empowers the Commission to\r\nadopt, where appropriate, implementing acts to ensure the uniform application\r\nof this Regulation in respect of notified bodies that do not meet or no longer\r\nmeet the requirements for their notification.\nThose implementing acts will be adopted in\r\naccordance with the provisions on implementing acts laid down in Regulation\r\n(EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February\r\n2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for\r\ncontrol by the Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing\r\npowers.\n3.7. Delegated\r\nacts\nThe proposal empowers the Commission to\r\nadopt delegated acts in order to modify the category of a specific risk to take\r\ninto account the progress of technical knowledge or new scientific evidence.\n3.8.\r\nFinal provisions\nThe proposed Regulation will become applicable\r\ntwo years after its entry into force to allow manufacturers, notified bodies\r\nand Member States time to adapt to the new requirements.\nHowever, the designation of notified bodies\r\npursuant to the new requirements and process needs to start shortly after the\r\nentry into force of this Regulation. This will ensure that by the date of\r\napplication of the proposed Regulation, sufficient notified bodies will have\r\nbeen designated in accordance with the new rules so as to avoid problems with\r\nproduction continuity and market supply.\nTransitional provisions are foreseen for\r\nproducts manufactured and the certificates issued by notified bodies under\r\nDirective 89/686/EEC so as to allow stocks to be absorbed and ensure a smooth\r\ntransition to the new requirements.\nDirective 89/686/EEC will be repealed and\r\nreplaced by the proposed Regulation.\n3.10.\r\nUnion competence, legal basis, subsidiarity principle and legal form\nLegal basis\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe subsidiarity principle arises in\r\nparticular with regard to the newly added provisions aiming at the improvement\r\nof effective enforcement of Directive 89/686/EEC, namely, the economic\r\noperators\u2019 obligations, the traceability provisions, the provisions on the\r\nassessment and notification of conformity assessment bodies. \nExperience with the enforcement of the\r\nlegislation has shown that measures taken at national level have led to\r\ndivergent approaches and to a different treatment of economic operators inside\r\nthe EU, which undermines the objectives of Directive 89/686/EEC. If actions are\r\ntaken at national level to address the problems, this risks creating obstacles\r\nto the free movement of goods. Furthermore action at national level is limited\r\nto the territorial competence of a Member State. Coordinated action at EU level\r\ncan much better achieve the objectives set, and will in particular render\r\nmarket surveillance more effective. Hence it is more appropriate to take action\r\nat EU level.\nProportionality\nIn accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, the proposed modifications do not go beyond what is necessary\r\nto achieve the objectives set. \nThe new or modified obligations do not\r\nimpose unnecessary burdens and costs on industry - especially on small and\r\nmedium sized enterprises - or administrations. Where modifications have been\r\nidentified to have negative impacts, the analysis of the impacts of the option\r\nserves to provide the most proportionate response to the problems identified. A\r\nnumber of modifications concern the improvement of clarity of the existing\r\nDirective without introducing new requirements that entail added cost. \nLegislative technique used\nThe proposal takes the form of a\r\nRegulation.\nThe proposed change from a Directive to a\r\nRegulation takes into account the Commission\u2019s general objective to simplify\r\nthe regulatory environment and the need to ensure a uniform implementation\r\nthroughout the Union of the proposed legislation.\nThe use of a Regulation does not conflict\r\nwith the subsidiarity principle. This legislation is based on Article 114 TFEU\r\nwith the objective of ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market\r\nfor personal protective equipment. To achieve this objective, the PPE Directive\r\n89/686/EEC is a total harmonisation directive. Member States are not allowed to\r\nimpose more stringent or additional requirements in their national legislation\r\nfor the placing on the market of PPE. In particular, the mandatory essential\r\nhealth and safety requirements for products and the conformity assessment\r\nprocedures to be followed by manufacturers must be identical in all of the\r\nMember States. Given this level of harmonisation, which is necessary to avoid\r\nobstacles to the free movement of PPE, Member States have almost no flexibility\r\nin transposing the Directive into their national law and its content is in many\r\ncases reproduced word for word in the national transposition legislation.\nThe same applies to the new provisions that\r\nwill be integrated into the text following the alignment to the NLF Decision No\r\n768/2008/EC. These provisions lay down requirements, obligations and procedures\r\nfor the manufacturers, importers and distributors of PPE and for the notified\r\nbodies that carry out the conformity assessment procedures. All of these\r\nprovisions are clear and sufficiently precise to be applied directly by the\r\nactors concerned.\nThe obligations set by the legislation for\r\nthe Member States, such as the obligation to assess, appoint and notify the\r\nconformity assessment bodies are, in any case, not transposed as such into\r\nnational law but implemented by the Member States by means of the necessary\r\nregulatory and administrative arrangements. This will not change when the\r\nobligations concerned are set out in a Regulation. \nThe change from a Directive to a Regulation\r\nwill not lead to any change in the regulatory approach. The characteristics of\r\nthe New Approach will be fully preserved, in particular the flexibility given\r\nto manufacturers in the choice of the means employed to comply with the\r\nessential requirements (harmonised standards or other technical specifications)\r\nand in the choice of the procedure used to demonstrate compliance from among\r\nthe available conformity assessment procedures. The existing mechanisms\r\nsupporting the implementation of the legislation (standardisation process,\r\nworking groups, market surveillance, administrative cooperation (AdCo), and the\r\ndevelopment of guidance documents\u2026) will not be affected by the nature of the\r\nlegal instrument and will continue to operate in the same manner under the\r\nRegulation as they currently do under the Directive.\nFinally, the use of Regulations in the area\r\nof internal market legislation, in accordance also with the preference\r\nexpressed by stakeholders, avoids the risk of \u2018gold plating\u2019. It also allows\r\nmanufacturers to work directly with the Regulation text instead of needing to\r\nidentify and examine 28 transposition laws.\nOn this basis, it is considered that the\r\nchoice of a Regulation is the most appropriate solution for all involved\r\nparties as it will allow a more rapid and coherent application of the proposed\r\nlegislation and will establish a clearer regulatory environment for economic\r\noperators.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis proposal does not have any implication\r\nfor the EU budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nRepeal of existing legislation\nThe adoption of the proposal will lead to\r\nrepeal of Directive 89/686/EEC.\nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposal concerns the EEA and should\r\ntherefore be extended to the European Economic Area.\n2014/0108 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non personal protective equipment\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive\r\n89/686/EEC[13]\r\nwas adopted in the context of establishing the internal market in order to\r\nharmonise health and safety requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE)\r\nin all Member States and to remove obstacles to trade in PPE between Member\r\nStates.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 89/686/EEC is\r\nbased on the New Approach principles, as set out in the Council Resolution on a\r\nnew approach to technical harmonisation and standards[14]. Thus, it sets only\r\nthe essential safety requirements applying to PPE, whereas technical details\r\nare adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the\r\nEuropean Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC) in accordance\r\nwith Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[15]. Conformity with the\r\nharmonised standards so set, the reference number of which is published in the Official\r\nJournal of the European Union, provides a presumption of conformity with\r\nthe requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC. Experience has shown that those basic\r\nprinciples have worked well in this sector and should be maintained and even\r\nfurther promoted.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, experience with\r\nits application has shown inadequacies and inconsistencies in the product\r\ncoverage and conformity assessment procedures. In order to take account of this\r\nexperience and to provide clarification in relation to the framework within\r\nwhich products covered by this Regulation may be marketed, certain aspects of\r\nDirective 89/686/EEC should be revised and enhanced. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the scope, the\r\nessential health and safety requirements and conformity assessment procedures are\r\nto be identical in all the Member States there is almost no flexibility in\r\ntransposing Directives based on the New Approach principles into national law. Directive 89/686/EEC\r\nshould therefore be replaced by a Regulation, which is the appropriate legal\r\ninstrument for imposing clear and detailed rules which do not give room for\r\ndivergent transposition by Member States.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council[16] lays down horizontal\r\nprovisions on the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies and on the CE\r\nmarking.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision No 768/2008/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[17]\r\nprovides common principles and reference provisions for the purposes of\r\nlegislation based on the New Approach principles. In order to ensure\r\nconsistency with other sectoral product legislation, it is appropriate to align\r\ncertain provisions of this Regulation to that Decision, in so far as sectoral\r\nspecificities do not require a different solution. Therefore, certain\r\ndefinitions, the general obligations of economic operators, the presumption of\r\nconformity, EU declaration of conformity, rules on CE marking, requirements for\r\nconformity assessment bodies and notification procedures, the conformity\r\nassessment procedures and the provisions concerning procedures to deal with\r\nproducts presenting a risk should be aligned to that Decision. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n1025/2012 provides for a procedure for objections to harmonised standards where\r\nthose standards do not entirely satisfy the requirements of this Regulation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No xx/xxxx\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council [18]\r\nprovides detailed rules on market surveillance and on controls of harmonised\r\nproducts, including PPE, entering the Union from third countries. In accordance\r\nwith that Regulation, Member States are to organise and carry out market\r\nsurveillance, to appoint market surveillance authorities, to specify their\r\npowers and duties, and to set up general and sector-specific market\r\nsurveillance programmes. That Regulation also sets out a safeguard clause\r\nprocedure.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some products on the\r\nmarket that provide a protective function to the user are excluded from the\r\nscope of Directive 89/686/EEC. In order to ensure as high level of protection\r\nfor the user of those products as for the PPE covered by\r\nDirective 89/686/EEC, the scope of this Regulation should include PPE for\r\nprivate use against damp, water and heat (e.g. dish-washing gloves, oven\r\ngloves), in line with similar PPE for professional use which is already covered\r\nby Directive 89/686/EEC. Artisanal products, such as handmade gloves, for which\r\nthe manufacturer does not explicitly claim a protective function are not\r\npersonal protective equipment; they are therefore not concerned by this\r\ninclusion. It is also appropriate to clarify the exclusion list set out in\r\nAnnex I to Directive 89/686/EEC by adding a reference to products covered by\r\nother legislation and therefore are excluded from the PPE Regulation.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\r\nunderstanding and uniform application of this Regulation, new definitions for\r\n\u201cindividually adapted PPE\u201d and \u201cmade-to-measure PPE\u201d should be introduced and\r\nthe conformity assessment procedures for these kinds of PPE should be adapted\r\nto the specific conditions of their manufacture.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic\r\noperators should be responsible for the compliance of products, in relation to\r\ntheir respective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of\r\nprotection of public interests, such as health and safety, and the protection\r\nof users and to guarantee fair competition on the Union market.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All economic operators\r\nintervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate\r\nmeasures to ensure that PPE protects the health and safety of persons and that\r\nthey make available on the market only products which comply with this\r\nRegulation. This Regulation should provide a clear and proportionate\r\ndistribution of obligations which correspond to the role of each operator in\r\nthe supply and distribution chain.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The manufacturer, having\r\ndetailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to\r\ncarry out the complete conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment\r\nshould therefore remain the obligation of the manufacturer alone.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to ensure\r\nthat PPE entering the Union market complies with this Regulation and, in\r\nparticular, that appropriate assessment procedures have been carried out by\r\nmanufacturers. Provision should therefore be made for importers to make sure\r\nthat the PPE they place on the market complies with the requirements of this\r\nRegulation and that they do not place on the market PPE which does not comply\r\nwith such requirements or which present a risk. Provision should also be made\r\nfor importers to make sure that the conformity assessment procedures have been\r\ncarried out and that the CE marking and technical documentation drawn up by\r\nmanufacturers are available for inspection by the market surveillance\r\nauthorities.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Distributors make PPE\r\navailable on the market after it has been placed on the market by the\r\nmanufacturer or the importer and should act with due care to ensure that their\r\nhandling of the PPE does not adversely affect the compliance of the PPE.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When placing PPE on the\r\nmarket, importers should indicate on the product their name and the address at\r\nwhich they can be contacted. Exceptions should be provided for in cases where\r\nthe size or nature of the PPE does not allow for such an indication. This\r\nincludes cases where the importer would have to open the packaging to put his\r\nname and address on the product.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any economic operator that\r\neither places PPE on the market under its own name or trademark or modifies a\r\nproduct in such a way that compliance with the requirements of this Regulation may\r\nbe affected should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the\r\nobligations of the manufacturer.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Distributors and importers,\r\nbeing close to the market place, should be involved in market surveillance\r\ntasks carried out by competent national authorities, and should be prepared to\r\nparticipate actively, providing those authorities with all necessary\r\ninformation relating to the PPE concerned.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ensuring traceability of\r\nPPE throughout the supply chain helps to make market surveillance simpler and\r\nmore efficient. An efficient traceability system facilitates the market\r\nsurveillance authorities' task of tracing economic operators who made\r\nnon-compliant product available on the market.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to simplify and\r\nadapt certain essential safety requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC to the\r\ncurrent practice the requirement to label PPE protecting against harmful noise\r\nwith a comfort index should be removed as experience has shown that it is not\r\npossible to measure and establish such an index. As regards mechanical\r\nvibrations, it is appropriate to remove the requirement not to exceed the limit\r\nvalues set by Union legislation on the exposure of workers to vibrations since\r\nthe use of PPE alone is not able to achieve this objective. As regards PPE\r\nprotecting against radiation, it is no longer necessary to require that the\r\ninstructions for use supplied by the manufacturer indicate transmission curves,\r\nsince the indication of the protection factor is more useful and is sufficient\r\nfor the user.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to clearly\r\nspecify the relationship and scope of this Regulation with the entitlement of Member\r\nStates to lay down requirements for the use of PPE at workplace, in particular\r\npursuant to Council Directive 89/656/EEC[19],\r\nin order to avoid any confusion and ambiguity and hence ensure the free\r\nmovement of compliant PPE.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The requirement in other\r\ninternal market legislation to supply an EU declaration of conformity with the\r\nequipment has been found to facilitate and to enhance the efficiency of market\r\nsurveillance and should therefore also be introduced into this Regulation. It\r\nshould be possible to provide a simplified EU declaration of conformity in\r\norder to reduce the burden associated with this requirement without reduction\r\nof its effectiveness. Both possibilities should therefore be provided for in\r\nthis Regulation.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to increase the\r\nefficiency of market surveillance it is necessary to extend the obligation to\r\ndraw up a complete technical documentation to all PPE.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that PPE\r\nis examined on the basis of the state of the art the limit of validity of the\r\nEU type-examination certificate should set to a maximum of five years. A\r\nprocess for reviewing the certificate should be provided for. A minimum content\r\nof the certificate should be required in order to facilitate the work of the\r\nmarket surveillance authorities.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The CE marking, indicating\r\nthe conformity of a product, is the visible consequence of a whole process\r\ncomprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. The general principles\r\ngoverning the CE marking are set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Rules\r\ngoverning the affixing of the CE marking on PPE should be laid down in this\r\nRegulation. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is crucial to make clear\r\nto manufacturers and users that by affixing the CE marking to the product, the\r\nmanufacturer declares that the product is in conformity with this Regulation\r\nand takes full responsibility therefor.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The CE marking should be\r\nthe only marking indicating that PPE is in conformity with Union harmonisation\r\nlegislation. However, other markings should be allowed as long as they\r\ncontribute to the improvement of consumer protection and are not covered by Union\r\nharmonisation legislation.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\r\ncompliance with the essential safety requirements, it is necessary to lay down\r\nappropriate conformity assessment procedures to be followed by the manufacturer.\r\nDirective 89/686/EEC classifies PPE into three categories that are subject to\r\ndifferent conformity assessment procedures. In order to ensure a consistently\r\nhigh level of safety for all PPE, the list of products subject to one of the\r\nconformity assessment procedures relating to the production phase should be\r\nenlarged. The conformity assessment procedures for each category of PPE should\r\nbe set, as far as possible, on the basis of the conformity assessment modules\r\nlaid down in Decision No 768/2008/EC.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to ensure a\r\nuniformly high level of performance of bodies performing conformity assessment\r\nof PPE throughout the Union, and all such bodies should perform their functions\r\nat the same level and under conditions of fair competition. Therefore\r\nobligatory requirements should be set for conformity assessment bodies wishing\r\nto be notified in order to provide conformity assessment services under this Regulation.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a\r\nconsistent level of quality in the performance of conformity assessment of PPE,\r\nit is also necessary to set requirements that notifying authorities and other\r\nbodies involved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of notified\r\nbodies must fulfil.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take into\r\naccount the progress of technical knowledge and new scientific evidence, the\r\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission to\r\namend the list of PPE included in each category. It is of particular importance\r\nthat the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its\r\npreparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and\r\ndrawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\r\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing\r\npowers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised\r\nin accordance with Regulation (EU) 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council[20].\r\nThe advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts requesting\r\nthe notifying Member State to take the necessary corrective measures in respect\r\nof notified bodies that do not meet or no longer meet the requirements for\r\ntheir notification.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should lay\r\ndown rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this\r\nRegulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be\r\neffective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow\r\nmanufacturers and other economic operators sufficient time to adapt to the\r\nrequirements of this Regulation, it is necessary to provide for a sufficient\r\ntransitional period after the entry into force of this Regulation during which\r\nPPE which complies with Directive 89/686/EEC may still be placed on the market.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nRegulation, namely to ensure a high level of protection of human health and\r\nsafety whilst guaranteeing the functioning of the internal market by setting\r\nharmonised health and safety requirements for PPE and minimum requirements for\r\nmarket surveillance, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and\r\ncan therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union\r\nlevel, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of\r\nsubsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In\r\naccordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article,\r\nthis Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that\r\nobjective.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 89/686/EEC has\r\nbeen amended several times. Since further substantial amendments are to be made\r\nand in order to ensure a uniform implementation throughout the Union, Directive\r\n89/686/EEC should be repealed and replaced by a Regulation.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER\r\nI\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle\r\n1\nSubject Matter\nThis Regulation lays down requirements for\r\nthe design and manufacture of personal
