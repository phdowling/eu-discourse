Article 349 of the TFEU provides,\r\nhowever, for the possibility of introducing specific measures for those regions\r\nbecause of the permanent handicaps which affect the economic and social\r\nconditions of the outermost regions.\nCouncil\r\nDecision 2002/546/EC of 20 June 2002[1],\r\nadopted on the basis of Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, authorised Spain, up\r\nto 30 June 2014, to apply exemptions from or reductions in the \u2018Arbitrio sobre\r\nImportaciones y Entregas de Mercanc\u00edas en las Islas Canarias\u2019 (hereinafter \u2018AIEM\u2019)\r\nto certain products produced locally in the Canary Islands. The Annex to that\r\nDecision contains a list of products to which tax exemptions and reductions may\r\nbe applied. The difference between the taxation of locally manufactured\r\nproducts and the taxation of other products may not exceed 5, 15 or 25\r\npercentage points, depending on the product.\nDecision\r\n2002/546/EC sets out the reasons for adopting specific measures, which include\r\nisolation, raw material and energy dependence, the obligation to build up\r\nstocks, the small size of the local market and the low level of export\r\nactivity. The combination of these handicaps means that production costs, and\r\ntherefore the cost price of goods produced locally, are increased, so that\r\nwithout specific measures they would be less competitive than goods produced\r\nelsewhere, even taking into account the cost of transporting the latter to the\r\nCanary Islands. This would make it harder to maintain local production. The\r\nspecific measures covered by Decision 2002/546/EC were thus designed to\r\nstrengthen local industry by making it more competitive. \nThe AIEM is an indirect State tax levied in a\r\nsingle stage on the supplies of goods in the Canary Islands. The taxable base\r\nfor the imported goods is based on the customs value, and that of the supplies\r\nof goods by producers in the Canary Islands is based on the total amount of the\r\nconsideration. The specific measures covered by Decision 2002/546/EC establish a form of differentiated taxation, benefiting the local production of\r\nsome products. This tax benefit constitutes state aid that requires the\r\napproval of the Commission, which was granted by\r\nDecision on State Aid NN 22/2008.\nOn 16 November\r\n2010, Spain submitted a request to the Commission to extend the period of\r\napplication of Decision 2002/546/EC for two years, so that its expiry date\r\ncoincided with the one of the Guidelines on national regional aid for 2007-2013[2].\nIn addition, Spain also introduced a request for the extension for two years of the period of\r\napplication of Decision on State Aid NN 22/2008, according to which the aid\r\ngiven by the Spanish authorities, in respect of the AIEM, was compatible with\r\nthe common market. The Commission authorized this extension for two years by\r\nmeans of its Decision on State Aid SA.31950 (N 544/2010)[3], which extended the\r\nperiod of Decision on State Aid NN 22/2008 up to 31 December 2013. \nAs regard the\r\nrequest for the extension of the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC,\r\nthe Commission assessed it in light of the scale of the handicaps affecting the\r\n Canary Islands and came to the conclusion that it was justified to grant the\r\nrequested extension. \nIn fact, the\r\nreport from the Commission to the Council on the application of the special\r\narrangements concerning the AIEM tax applicable in the Canary Islands, adopted\r\non 28 August 2008, confirmed that the AIEM was functioning in a satisfactory\r\nmanner and without the need to any amendments to the provisions of Decision\r\n2002/546/EC. \nTherefore,\r\nCouncil Decision 895/2011/EU of 19 December 2011[4]\r\namended Decision 2002/546/EC, extending its period of application up to 31\r\nDecember 2013.\nOn 04 March\r\n2013, the Spanish authorities requested the Commission to prepare a Council\r\nDecision authorising Spain to apply exemptions from or reductions in the AIEM\r\nto certain products produced locally in the Canary Islands for the period\r\n2014-2020, modifying the list of products and the maximum rates applicable to\r\nsome of them. \nOn 28 June 2013\r\nthe Commission has adopted new regional aid guidelines for the period 2014-2020[5]. These Guidelines are\r\npart of a broader strategy to modernise state aid control, aiming at fostering\r\ngrowth in the Single Market by encouraging more effective aid measures and\r\nfocusing the Commission\u2019s enforcement on cases with the biggest impact on\r\ncompetition.\nConsidering\r\nthat these Guidelines will enter into force on 1 July 2014, it seemed justified\r\nto extend the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC, as amended by\r\nDecision 895/2011/EU, for six months, so that its expiry date coincides with\r\nthe expiry date of the current Guidelines. Decision 2002/546/EC has been\r\namended accordingly by Decision 1413/2013/EU[6]\r\nthat extended its application until 30 June 2014.\nThe Commission\r\nhas analysed the request received from the Spanish authorities, as well as the\r\ninformation provided by many different stakeholders that have taken the\r\ninitiative to contact the Commission. This analysis confirms that the special\r\ncharacteristics of the Canary Islands restrain their development and are\r\nresponsible for additional costs for the operators situated there. It is\r\ntherefore justified to maintain the exemption of the AIEM to a list of locally\r\nproduced industrial products. This measure is necessary and proportionate and\r\ndoes not undermine the integrity and the coherence of the Union legal order.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ANALYSIS OF THE SPANISH\r\nREQUEST AND PROPORTIONALITY OF THE DEROGATION DECISION\nAccording to Article 110 TFEU no Member State shall impose, directly or indirectly, on the products of other Member States\r\nany internal taxation of any kind in excess of that imposed directly or\r\nindirectly on similar domestic products. Furthermore, no Member State shall impose on the products of other Member States any internal taxation of such a\r\nnature as to afford indirect protection to other products.\nHowever, on the basis of Article 349 TFEU\r\nthe Council may authorise Member States with outermost regions to derogate from\r\nthe provisions of Article 110 TFEU so as to take account of the structural\r\nsocial and economic situation of these regions and which is compounded by other\r\nfactors that severely restrain their development. Such derogation may not\r\nundermine the integrity and the coherence of the Union legal order, including\r\nthe internal market and common policies, such as common taxation policies based\r\non Article 113 TFEU. Thus, such derogations must remain proportionate, i.e.\r\nthey must not go further than necessary to address the adverse framework\r\nconditions hampering the economic development of these regions and it must not\r\nexcessively distort competition in the single market. In consequence, any\r\nderogation from Article 110 TFEU should remain limited to fully or partially\r\ncompensating the cost disadvantage from which producers in these regions\r\nsuffer.\nThe Canary Islands economy is highly\r\ndependent on tourism. This dependency is a serious threat to the development of\r\nthe Canary Islands because change of taste, natural disasters or economic\r\nrecessions can have a huge impact in the economic and social situation of the\r\narchipelago. This was precisely what occurred during the global financial\r\ncrisis of 2008 and 2009 that had a strong impact in the number of tourists\r\nvisiting the Islands and, consequently, in its economy. The decrease in\r\ntourists led to a huge increase in the levels of unemployment, with the rate of\r\nunemployment becoming higher than in mainland Spain, which is, together with Greece, one of the two Member States with the highest unemployment rate in the European Union.\r\nThe growth was even more visible in the rate of youth unemployment, which can\r\nbe explained by the large number of young people depending on the seasonal jobs\r\ncreated by tourism.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe Canary Islands market is also characterised\r\nby its reduced dimension that prevents industries from reaching the optimal\r\npoint of production. Most industrial machines are designed to produce at large\r\nscale, in order to increase productivity and profitability. These machines are\r\nnot designed for a smaller market, generating unused productive capacity, which\r\nmeans that industries are forced to operate at a production level lower than the\r\nnecessary to minimise production costs, restricting opportunities for economies\r\nof scale.\nThe countries and territories in the\r\nproximity of the Canary Islands (Morocco, Western Sahara and Mauritania) have reduced acquisitive capacity, and the considerable development gap limits the\r\npossibilities for Canary Islands exports.\u00a0 \nAnother characteristic of the Canary Islands with an important effect in the additional costs incurred by operators\r\nestablished there is the territorial fragmentation and distance to the sources\r\nof most raw materials, which generates higher transport costs. The problem has\r\nbeen aggravated by the rise of oil prices that has had an important impact in\r\nthe increase of transportation costs.\nWater is a scarce resource in Canary Islands. The insufficiency of water has an obvious impact in its cost, creating a\r\ncompetitive disadvantage towards industries located in other parts of Spain or the European Union. This is particularly important for the industries that use\r\nwater as an important raw material (e.g. food, chemistry, paper) but also the\r\nones that require high levels of refrigeration.\nThere are projects for the introduction of\r\nnatural gas in the two major islands of Canary Islands, but it is not clear\r\nwhen this fuel can be used in an effective way. The absence of natural gas generates\r\nan important element of loss of competitiveness, as the cost of generating heat\r\nand energy using other sources is considerably more expensive.\nAs there are no recycling plants and waste\r\nhas to be transported to the mainland and toxic waste has to be treated outside\r\nthe Canary Islands, the disposal of industrial waste and treatment of toxic\r\nwaste leads to higher environmental costs.\nThe characteristics of the Canary Islands previously described affect to a certain extent all domestic production. It\r\nis therefore appropriate to verify what has been the effect of the existing differentiated\r\ntaxation in the market share of local production and adjust this differentiated\r\ntaxation to ensure that there is no excessive distortion of competition.\nThe analysis made to conclude on the\r\ndifferentiated rates accepted took into account not only the average market share\r\nof local production in the period 2008-2011 but also its evolution and other\r\ninformation provided by stakeholders that contacted the Commission to provide\r\nrelevant information. For industries producing products with different common\r\ncustoms tariffs it was analysed the evolution of the combined market share for\r\nall products and not only the individual market shares. \u00a0These reasons explain\r\nwhy products with similar average market shares of local production have a\r\ndifferent maximum rate of differentiated taxation.\nIn the case of tobacco, it is suggested to\r\nkeep the differentiated rate in 25% and update the minimum for 1000 cigarettes\r\nfrom EUR 6 to EUR 18 as requested by the Spanish authorities.\nThe Spanish authorities have included in\r\nthe list of products to be subject to differentiated taxation some products\r\nwith an extremely low market share of local production. The justification presented\r\nby the Spanish authorities is that there are plans to increase local production\r\nof these products, an increase that will not be possible without the\r\ndifferentiated taxation.\nIn total, of the 139 products mentioned in\r\nthe request received from the Spanish authorities, the Commission accepts the\r\nrate as requested for 119 of these, while for the remaining 20 the Commission considers\r\nthat the differentiated rate should be lower, to prevent possible cases of\r\ndistortion of competition. \nFrom the detailed analysis made by the\r\nCommission, it is possible to establish the different lists of products\r\naccording to the rates of tax differentiation, sector and the Common Customs\r\nTariff:\n5%\nAgricultural\r\nand fishery products:\n0207 11/0207\r\n13\nMinerals:\n2516 90\r\n00 00/6801/6802\nBuilding\r\nmaterials:\n3816/3824\r\n40 00 00/3824 50/3824 90 45 00/3824 90 70 00/ 3824 90 97 99/ 6809\nChemicals:\n2804 30 00\r\n00/2804 40 00 00/3105 20 90 00/3208/3209/3210/3212 90 00 00/3213/3214/3304 99\r\n00 00/3925 90 80 00/ 3401/3402/3406/3814 00 90/3923 90 00 00/4012 11 00/4012 12\r\n00/4012 13/4012 19\nMetal-working industries:\n7604/7608\nFood industry:\n0210 12 11 00/0210 12 19 00/0210 19 40 00/0210 19 81/0305 41 00/0305\r\n43 00 90/\n0901\r\n22 00 00/1101/1102/1601/1602/1704 90 30 00/1704 90 51 00/1704 90 55 00/ \n1704\r\n90 75 00/1704 90 71 00/1806/1901 20 00 00/1901 90 91 00/1901 90 99/\n1904\r\n10 10/1905/2005 20 20/2006 00 31 00/2008 11 96 00/2008 11 98 00/2008 19 92/\n2008\r\n19 93/2008 19 95/2008 19 99/2309\nBeverages:\n2009 11/2009 12 00/2009 19/2009 41/2009\r\n49/2009 50/2009 61/2009 71/2009 79/2009 89/ 2009 90/2201/2202/2204\nTextiles and leather:\n6112 31/6112 41\nPaper:\n4818 90 90 00/4823 90 85 90\nGraphic arts and publishing:\n4910\n10%\nAgricultural and fishery products:\n0203 11/0203 12/0203 19/0701 90/0703\nBuilding materials:\n2523 29 00 00/\nFood industry:\n0210 11 11 00/0210 11 31 00/1905/2105\nPaper:\n4808/4819/4823 90 40 00/\n15%\nAgricultural and fishery products:\n0407 21 00 00/0407 29 10 00/0407 90 10 00\nBuilding materials:\n2523 90/7010\nChemicals:\n3809 91 00/3917 21/3917 23/3917 32 00/ 3917\r\n33 00/3917 39 00/3917 40 00/3923 10 00/39 23 21 00/3923 30 10/3924 10 00\nMetal-working industries:\n7309 00/7610 10 00 00/9403 20 80 90\nFood industry:\n0403/0901 21/1902/2103 20 00 00/2103\r\n30/2103 90 90/2106 90 98/\nBeverages:\n2203/2208 40\nTextiles and leather:\n6302\nPaper:\n4818 10/4818 20/4818 30/4821\nGraphic arts and publishing:\n4909/4911\n25%\nTobacco:\n2402\nThese lists of products address the\r\nobjective of Article 349 of adopting specific measures to take into account the\r\nspecial characteristics of the Canary Islands as outermost regions, while at\r\nthe same time, not distorting competition in a way that could undermine the\r\ninternal market.\nWhen the Spanish authorities submit the\r\nreport foreseen in Article 2 of this Council Decision it would be advisable for\r\nthe Commission to evaluate the effects of the differentiated rates and assess\r\nthe need for changes. It would also be important at that time to check whether\r\nthere has been an increase in local production of those products for which a\r\ndifferentiated taxation is requested but which do not have significant local\r\nproduction at the moment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of\r\nthe proposed measures\nTo authorise Spain to apply exemptions from or reductions in the tax known as AIEM for certain products produced\r\nlocally in the Canary Islands.\nLegal basis \nArticle 349\r\nTFEU.\nSubsidiarity\r\nprinciple\nOnly the\r\nCouncil is authorised, on the basis of Article 349 TFEU, to adopt specific\r\nmeasures in favour of the outermost regions to adjust the application of the\r\nTreaties to those regions, including the common policies, because of the\r\npermanent handicaps which affect the economic and social conditions of the\r\noutermost regions.\nThe proposal\r\ntherefore complies with the subsidiarity principle. \nProportionality\r\nprinciple\nThe proposal\r\ncomplies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons:\nChoice of\r\ninstrument\nProposed\r\ninstrument: Council Decision.\nOther\r\ninstruments would not have been appropriate for the following reason:\nDerogations granted under Article 349 TFEU\r\nare contained in Council Decisions. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal\r\nhas no impact on the budget of the European Union.\n2014/0093 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the AIEM tax applicable in the Canary Islands\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 349 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[7],\r\n\nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure, \nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 349 of\r\nthe TFEU, the Council, taking into account the structural social and economic\r\nsituation of the outermost regions, which is compounded by their remoteness,\r\ninsularity, small size, difficult topography and climate and economic\r\ndependence on a few products, shall adopt specific measures aimed, in\r\nparticular, at laying down the condition of application of the Treaties to\r\nthose regions, including common policies.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific measures should\r\ntherefore be adopted in order to establish the conditions for applying the\r\nTreaty to those regions. They must take account of the special characteristics\r\nand constraints of these regions, but without undermining the integrity and\r\ncoherence of the Community legal order, including the internal market and\r\ncommon policies. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the top of the list of\r\nhandicaps identified in the Canary Islands is the predominance of the services\r\nsector and in particular tourism in the regional product and also the\r\ndependence of the Canary Islands\u2019 economy on this sector and the small share of\r\nindustry in the Canary Islands\u2019 GDP.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In second place is the\r\nisolation inherent in an archipelago which hinders the free movement of\r\npersons, goods and services. Dependence on certain modes of transport, air\r\ntransport and maritime transport is increased since these are modes of transport\r\nwhich have not yet been fully liberalised. Production costs are greater because\r\nthese modes of transport are less efficient and more expensive than road or\r\nrail.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a further consequence\r\nof this isolation, higher production costs result from dependence in terms of\r\nraw materials and energy, the obligation to build up stocks and difficulties\r\naffecting the supply of production equipment.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The small size of the\r\nmarket and the low level of export activity, the geographical fragmentation of\r\nthe archipelago, and the obligation to maintain diversified but only small\r\nproduction lines in order to meet the requirements of a small market, restrict\r\nthe opportunities for economies of scale.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is in many cases more\r\ndifficult or more expensive to obtain specialised and maintenance services, and\r\ntraining for managers and technicians, or to subcontract or promote business\r\nexpansion beyond the Canary Islands\u2019 market. The narrow range of distribution\r\nmethods also results in overstocking.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the environment,\r\nthe disposal of industrial waste and the treatment of toxic waste give rise to\r\nhigher environmental costs. These costs are higher because there are no\r\nrecycling plants, other than for certain products, and waste has to be\r\ntransported to the mainland and toxic waste has to be treated outside the Canary Islands.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of all this\r\ninformation and the notification from the Spanish authorities, it is advisable\r\nto renew the authorisation to the application of a tax to a list of products\r\nfor which exemptions for local products may be allowed.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision\r\n2002/546/EC of 20 June 2002[8],\r\nadopted on the basis of Article 299 of the EC Treaty, initially authorised\r\nSpain, up to 31 December 2011, to apply exemptions from or reductions in the\r\ntax known as \u2018Arbitrio sobre Importaciones y Entregas de Mercanc\u00edas en las Islas\r\nCanarias\u2019 (hereinafter \u2018AIEM\u2019) to certain products produced locally in the\r\nCanary Islands. The Annex to that Decision contains a list of products to which\r\ntax exemptions and reductions may be applied. The difference between the\r\ntaxation of locally manufactured products and the taxation of other products\r\nmay not exceed 5, 15 or 25 percentage points, depending on the product.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 895/2011/EU\r\nof 19 December 2011[9]\r\namended Council Decision 2002/546/EC, extending its period of application up to\r\n31 December 2013.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 1413/2013/EU\r\nof 17 December 2013[10]\r\namended Council Decision 2002/546/EC, extending its period of application up to\r\n30 June 2014.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The AIEM tax is serving the\r\nobjective of autonomous development of the Canary Islands\u2019 industrial\r\nproduction sectors and of diversifying the Islands\u2019 economy.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The maximum exemptions\r\nwhich may be applied to the industrial products in question vary depending on\r\nsector and product, from 5 % to 15 %.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The maximum exemption\r\napplicable to finished tobacco products is nevertheless higher, because the\r\ntobacco sector is an exceptional case. The tobacco industry, which had greatly\r\nexpanded in the Canary Islands, has been declining very markedly for a number\r\nof years. The traditional handicaps of insularity described above are of course\r\nat the root of the decline in local tobacco production in the Canary Islands.\r\nThere are grounds for keeping a substantial exemption for tobacco. Exemption\r\nfrom taxation is in direct relation with the objective of maintaining\r\nproduction in the Canary Islands.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objectives of promoting\r\nthe socio-economic development of the Canary Islands are reflected at national\r\nlevel in the purpose of the tax and the allocation of the revenue it generates.\r\nThe incorporation of the revenue from this tax in the resources of the Canary Islands\r\n\u2018economic and tax system and its use for an economic and social development\r\nstrategy involving the promotion of local activities is a legal obligation.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The arrangements are to\r\napply for 6.5 years.
