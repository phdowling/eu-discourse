The high heating costs are either due to very severe climate conditions\r\nor due to severe climate condition or insularity of such zones combined with\r\ndifficult fuel procurement.\n\u00b7                        \r\nGeneral context\nBy letter dated 31 May 2012, the Italian\r\nauthorities requested authorisation to apply, in certain particularly\r\ndisadvantaged geographical areas, reduced rates of taxation to gas oil and LPG\r\nused for heating purposes by way of a renewal of Council Decision 2008/318/EC\r\nof 7 April 2008 authorising Italy to apply, in determined geographical areas,\r\nreduced rates of taxation on gas oil and LPG used for heating purposes in\r\naccordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC ([2]). This Decision authorised Italy to apply, until 31 December 2012,\r\nin certain particularly disadvantages areas reduced rates of excise duty on\r\ndomestic fuel and LPG used for heating. In addition the Italian authorities have\r\nincluded in its request an extension of the scope of the authorisation to municipalities\r\nwhich are part of provinces where over 70 % of the municipalities are\r\nclassified in climate zone F but they themselves do not fall within climate\r\nzone F. Additional information and clarifications were provided by the Italian\r\nauthorities on 4 December 2012, 16 July 2013, 31 December 2013, 22 January 2014.\r\nWith letter dated 19 March 2014 the Italian authorities informed the Commission\r\nthat they request a renewal of the authorisation granted by Council Decision\r\n2008/318/EC for a new period of six years without adding to the list new\r\nmunicipalities as initially requested. \nIn justification of its request for\r\nderogation, Italy points to its diversified territory with variable climate and\r\ngeographical conditions. The national levels of excise duty on gas oil and LPG\r\nused for heating in Italy are relatively high. In order to avoid excessive\r\nburden on certain consumers particularly dependent on heating, Italy has introduced reduced rates of taxation in certain parts of its territory and would like\r\nto continue to apply the same reduction as introduced in 2006. The tax\r\nreduction amounts to EUR 129.11 per 1 000 litres in the case of gas oil (driving the applicable tax rate\r\ndown to EUR 274.10 per 1 000 litres) and to EUR 159.07 per 1 000 kg of LPG (driving the applicable tax rate down to EUR 30.87 per 1 000 kg). The\r\napplicable tax rates are above the minimum levels of taxation prescribed by the\r\nDirective.\nThe tax reduction is applicable in\r\ngeographical areas fulfilling the following criteria:\nUnder Article 8(10) of Italian Law No\r\n448/1998, the advantage applies to supplies of the fuels in question (gas oil\r\nand LPG) used in municipalities:\n\u00b7                        \r\nclassified in climate zone F, as referred to in\r\nPresidential Decree No 412 of 26 August 1993;\n\u00b7                        \r\nwhich do not have a gas supply network and are\r\nclassified in climate zone E, as referred to in the abovementioned Presidential\r\nDecree 412/1993. In this case, as provided for in Article 8(10)(c) point 4) of\r\nLaw No 448/1998, the advantage will be withdrawn as soon as the municipality\r\nbecomes connected to the gas supply network. \n\u00b7                        \r\nin the region of Sardinia and the smaller\r\nislands, as long as the natural gas network has not been made available in the\r\ncommune concerned; this part of the regimes covers all Italian islands apart\r\nfrom Sicily. \nThe tax advantage cannot be combined with\r\nother excise duty reductions.\nAccording to the Italian authorities, the\r\ntax differentiation is based on objective criteria and intends to ensure\r\ngeographical continuity with the rest of the Italian territory, i.e. it aims at\r\nputting the population of the eligible areas on more comparable footing with\r\nthe rest of the Italian population by means of reducing their\r\ndisproportionately high heating costs. The amount of the tax reduction is the\r\nsame for all users; it is only aimed at partially alleviating the additional\r\nheating costs of the population of the eligible areas which are due to cold\r\nclimate or difficulties with fuel procurement.\nAccording to the Italian authorities the\r\nadditional costs for mountainous regions for transport of LPG are 120 %\r\nhigher than the rest of the country and for gas oil 132 % higher.\nAccording to the Italian authorities, for\r\nclimate zones E and F, the tax reduction equals on average to 11 \u2013 12 % of\r\nthe price of gas oil and LPG for heating purposes. \nThese figures have to be compared with the\r\naverage heating costs: these are, due to climate conditions, by 90 %\r\nhigher than the national average in climate zone E and by 170 % higher than\r\nthe national average in climate zone F. \nThe specificity of the islands consists in\r\nthe fact that due to their geographical particularities, the fuel supply is\r\nrestricted in scope and as a result it is more expensive than on the Italian\r\nmainland due to additional transport costs. The Italian authorities confirmed\r\nthat the tax reduction does not result in overcompensation and does not drive\r\nthe prices of LPG and gas oil below the price on the mainland. With regard to the application of the subsidy in the smaller\r\nislands, in the locations in question the logistics chain is inevitably more\r\nexpensive than that in mainland Italy. The higher costs are the result of a\r\nlack of primary logistics, which gives rise to higher distribution costs.\r\nHigher costs are also due to often problematic road access, higher motor fuel\r\ncosts than those on the mainland and the transportation costs for accessing the\r\nsmaller islands and the limited quantities of individual supplies. The Italian\r\nauthorities have estimated these higher costs as being approximately 10 \u201315 % higher than the corresponding costs\r\nin mainland Italy.\nThe Italian authorities explain that during\r\nthe last three years the measure has reduced the end purchase price of LPG and\r\ngas oil used for heating by approximately 10 %.\nThe Italian authorities explain that there is\r\nno development of natural gas network in those areas which is an additional\r\ndisadvantage for these mountain communes, Sardinia and the small islands. \nThe annual budgetary expenditure of the measure is around EUR 230 million. \n\u00b7                        \r\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nCouncil\r\nDirective 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework\r\nfor the taxation of energy products and electricity and Council Decision 2008/318/EC of 7 April 2008 authorising Italy to\r\napply, in determined geographical areas, reduced rates of taxation on gas oil\r\nand LPG used for heating purposes in accordance with Article 19 of Directive\r\n2003/96/EC.\nConsistency with the other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nEach request for derogation under Article\r\n19 of the Energy Taxation Directive must be examined by the Commission taking\r\ninto account the proper functioning of the internal market, the need to ensure\r\nfair competition and EU health, environment, energy and transport policies.\nThe tax differentiation partially\r\nalleviates the additional heating costs incurred by citizens in certain\r\ngeographical areas of Italy that are particularly disadvantaged compared to the\r\nrest of the territory and for which, therefore, the standard tax rate\r\napplicable to LPG and gas oils used for heating purposes would result in an excessive\r\ntax burden. The geographical disadvantage translates into additional heating\r\ncosts which are due to severe climate conditions or insularity of such zones,\r\ncombined with unavailability of alternative heating resources, in particular\r\nunavailability of access to the natural gas network.\nThe reduced rate of taxation both for gas\r\noil and LPG remains higher than the EU minimum levels of taxation set out in\r\nthe Energy Taxation Directive and it only partially alleviates the additional\r\nheating costs incurred in the geographical areas in question.\nIt can be thus considered that the\r\nreduction is compatible with the goal of providing a tax incentive for the\r\npurpose of energy efficiency. The measure has not been found to be incompatible\r\nwith the relevant EU policies on the environment and energy. \nFurthermore, the measure is acceptable from\r\nthe point of view of the proper functioning of the internal market and the need\r\nto ensure fair competition. It merely seeks to partially offset the additional\r\nheating costs associated with the objective conditions of the areas in\r\nquestion. The tax reduction is not cumulative with any other sorts of tax\r\nreduction and it does not apply to other use of the heating fuels then space\r\nheating.\nArticle 19(2) of the Energy Tax Directive\r\nfurther provides that measures adopted under its provisions must be limited in\r\ntime, and sets a maximum period of six years, with a possibility of renewal. The\r\nCommission's understanding is that as this is a tax measure of temporary nature\r\nits prolongation should provide Italy with sufficient time to make an\r\nassessment of the environmental effect of the measure but also to put in place incentives\r\nto improve energy efficiency and evaluate those. The prolongation of the\r\nmeasure should provide the Italian authorities with enough time to collect the\r\ninformation necessary for such an assessment. It will also give the signal that\r\nin the future the focus would be on more targeted energy saving measures in\r\norder to improve energy efficiency and have a positive effect on the\r\nenvironment. For these reasons at the present stage, it appears appropriate to\r\ngrant the authorisation for three years.\nState aid rules\nThe reduced tax rates of EUR 274.10\r\nper 1 000 l for gas oil and EUR 30.87 per 1 000 kg for\r\nLPG used for heating envisaged by the Italian authorities are above the EU minimum levels of taxation\r\npursuant to Article 9 of Directive 2003/96/EC. The\r\nmeasure is therefore covered by Article 25 of Regulation 800/2008/EC ([3]) (the \u2018General Block Exemption Regulation\u2019) and would thus be\r\nconsidered compatible with the internal market and exempted from the\r\nnotification requirement. The period of validity of the General Block Exemption\r\nRegulation was originally limited to 31 December 2013 but it was extended by\r\nCommission Regulation 1224/2013/EU ([4])\r\nto 30 June 2014. In case new State aid rules are adopted by the Commission\r\nprior to the Council's decision on this proposal the notification obligations\r\nwill need to be reassessed under the new rules.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n \u00b7                         Consultation of interested parties \n This proposal concerns only Italy. \n \u00b7                         Collection and use of expertise \n There was no need for external expertise. \n \u00b7                         Impact assessment This proposal concerns an authorisation for an individual Member State upon its own request. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposal aims at authorising Italy to derogate from the general provisions of Council Directive 2003/96/EC and to apply\r\na reduced rate of taxation to gas oil and LPG used for\r\nheating purposes.\nLegal basis\nArticle 19 of Council Directive 2003/96/EC.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe field of indirect taxation covered by\r\nArticle 113 TFEU is not in itself within the exclusive competence of the\r\nEuropean Union within the meaning of Article 3 TFEU.\nHowever, the exercise by Member States of\r\ntheir competences in this field is strictly circumscribed and limited by\r\nexisting EU law. Pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC, only the\r\nCouncil is empowered to authorise a Member State to introduce further\r\nexemptions or reductions within the meaning of that provision. Member States\r\ncannot substitute themselves for the Council. \nThe proposal therefore respects the\r\nprinciple of subsidiarity.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal respects the principle of\r\nproportionality. The tax reduction does not exceed what is necessary to attain\r\nthe objective in question (cf. the considerations on the internal market and\r\nfair competition aspects, above).\nChoice of instruments\nInstrument(s) proposed: Council\r\nImplementing Decision.\nArticle 19 of Directive 2003/96 makes\r\nprovision for this type of measure only.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe measure does not impose any financial\r\nor administrative burden on the Union. The proposal therefore has no impact on\r\nthe budget of the Union.\n2014/0200 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nauthorising Italy to apply, in determined\r\ngeographical areas, reduced rates of taxation on gas oil and LPG used for\r\nheating purposes in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council\r\nDirective 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework\r\nfor the taxation of energy products and electricity ([5]) and in particular Article 19(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 19(1)\r\nof Directive 2003/96/EC, Italy was authorised to apply in certain particularly\r\ndisadvantages areas reduced rates of excise duty on gas oil and LPG used for\r\nheating. The authorisation was granted until 31 December 2012 by Council\r\nDecision 2008/318/EC of 7 April 2008 authorising Italy to apply, in determined\r\ngeographical areas, reduced rates of taxation on gas oil and LPG used for\r\nheating purposes in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC ([6]).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\r\nletter dated 31 May 2012 the Italian authorities requested authorisation to\r\napply in certain particularly disadvantaged geographical areas, reduced rates\r\nof taxation on gas oil and LPG used for heating purposes by way of extension of\r\na practice followed under the above-mentioned Council Decision in some areas,\r\nand this before it has expired. Additional information\r\nand clarifications were provided by the Italian authorities on 4 December 2012,\r\n16 July 2013, 31 December 2013 and 22 January 2014. By letter dated 19 March\r\n2014 the Italian authorities requested a renewal of the authorisation granted\r\nby Council Decision 2008/318/EC without changes in its territorial scope. The authorisation was requested for the period from 1 January 2013\r\nto 31 December 2018.\u00a0 \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Italy has very diversified\r\nterritory with variable climate and geographical conditions. Taking into\r\naccount the particularities of its territory, Italy has introduced reduced\r\nrates of taxation to gas oil and LPG with the purpose of partially offsetting\r\nthe disproportionately high heating costs for residents in certain geographical\r\nareas.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The tax differentiation is\r\nbased on objective criteria and aims at putting the population of the eligible\r\nareas on more comparable footing with the rest of the Italian population by\r\nmeans of reducing their disproportionately high heating costs which are due to\r\nsevere climate conditions or difficulties with fuel procurement in comparison\r\nwith the rest of the Italian territory.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The tax reduction is\r\napplicable in geographical areas fulfilling the following criteria: i) most\r\nsevere climate conditions within the Italian territory (communes falling into\r\nzone F as defined in the Presidential decree No 412 of 1993 ([7])), severe climate\r\nconditions combined with difficulties with fuel procurement (communes falling\r\ninto zone E as defined in the Presidential decree No 412 of 1993 as long as the\r\nnatural gas network has not been made available in the commune), geographical\r\nisolation combined with difficult and costly fuel procurement: Sardinia and\r\nsmall islands. Since the development of the natural gas network would to an\r\nimportant extent reduce the additional heating costs and would lead to greater\r\ndiversity of fuel supply, where appropriate, the application of the reduced\r\nrates is restricted until the completion of the natural gas network in the\r\ncommunes concerned.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measure has been\r\nreviewed by the Commission and been found not to distort competition or hinder\r\nthe operation of the internal market and it is not considered incompatible with\r\nEU's policy on the environment, energy and transport. The reduced rate of\r\ntaxation both for gas oil and LPG remains higher than the EU minimum levels of\r\ntaxation set out in the Directive 2003/96/EC and it only partially alleviates\r\nthe additional heating costs incurred in the geographical areas in question.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measure in question\r\napplies only to space heating purposes (both for private individuals and\r\nbusinesses); it does not apply for other forms of business use of the said\r\nproducts. According to the Italian authorities the amount of the tax advantage\r\nfor business users is in each particular case covered by the Commission\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1407/2013 of 18 December 2013 on the application of Articles\r\n107 and 108 of the TFEU to de minimis aid ([8]).\r\nNevertheless, if the benefit to any single undertaking exceeds the ceiling laid\r\ndown in that Regulation, it should be notified to the Commission in accordance\r\nwith Council Regulation (EU) No 734/2013 of 22 July 2013 amending Regulation\r\n(EC) No 659/1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93\r\nof the EC Treaty ([9]).\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Considering the potential\r\nenvironmental effects of the measure, it appears appropriate to grant the\r\nauthorisation for three years. This period of application would provide Italian\r\nauthorities with enough time to assess the environmental effect of the measure\r\nand it will also indicate that in the future more targeted energy saving\r\nmeasures would need to be put in place in order to improve energy efficiency\r\nand ensure a positive effect on the environment,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nItaly is hereby\r\nauthorised to apply reduced rates of taxation to gas\r\noil and LPG used for heating purposes in the following disadvantaged\r\ngeographical areas: \u00a0\n1.     \r\nCommunes falling in the climate zone F as\r\nestablished by the Presidential Decree of 26 August 1993 No 412.\n2.     \r\nCommunes falling in the climate zone E as\r\nestablished by the Presidential Decree of 26 August 1993 No 412.\n3.     \r\nCommunes of Sardinia and small islands ([10]).\nIn order to avoid any overcompensation, the\r\nreduction must not go beyond the additional costs of heating in the areas in\r\nquestion.
