At the end of the negotiations a new draft protocol was\r\ninitialled by the negotiators on 19 December 2013. The new Protocol covers a\r\nperiod of four years from the date of the provisional application laid down in\r\nArticle 14, that being the date on which this new Protocol was signed.\nThe main purpose of the Protocol to the\r\nAgreement is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in S\u00e3o\r\nTom\u00e9an waters, in compliance with the best scientific opinions available and\r\nthe recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of\r\nAtlantic Tunas (ICCAT), within the limits of the available surplus. The\r\nCommission based itself in part on the results of an ex-post evaluation of the\r\nprevious Protocol carried out by external experts.\nThe aim is also to strengthen cooperation\r\nbetween the European Union and the Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe\r\nwith a view to establishing a sustainable fisheries policy and sound\r\nexploitation of fisheries resources in the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an fishing zone, in the\r\ninterests of both parties.\nThe Protocol provides for fishing\r\nopportunities in the following categories:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 28 tuna seiners\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 surface longliners.\nThe Commission proposes, on this basis,\r\nthat the Council authorise the signing and provisional application of the new\r\nProtocol.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe interested parties were consulted\r\nduring the evaluation of the Protocol for the period 2011-14. Experts from the\r\nMember States were also consulted in technical meetings. These consultations\r\nled to the conclusion that it would be beneficial to maintain a fishing\r\nprotocol with the Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThis procedure is being initiated in parallel\r\nwith the procedures relating to the Council Decision authorising the signature\r\nand provisional application of the Protocol itself, as well as with the Council\r\nRegulation concerning the allocation of the fishing opportunities between the\r\nMember States of the EU.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe annual financial contribution is\r\nEUR 710 000 the first three years and EUR 675 000 the\r\nfourth year, based on a) a reference tonnage of 7 000 tonnes, for which an\r\namount linked to access has been set at EUR 385 000 the first three years and\r\nEUR 350 000 the fourth year, and b) support for the development of the sectoral\r\nfisheries policy of the Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, amounting\r\nto EUR 325 000.

To secure continuity of\r\nfishing operations, a procedure for adoption by the Council of a Decision on\r\nthe signing and provisional application of the Protocol has been launched in\r\nparallel with this procedure.\nThe new Protocol will provide a framework for the fishing activities\r\nof the European fleet in the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an fishing zone and will authorise\r\nEuropean vessel owners to apply for fishing licences allowing them to fish in\r\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an waters. In addition, the new Protocol enhances cooperation between\r\nthe EU and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, with a view to promoting the development of a\r\nsustainable fishing policy. It provides, in\r\nparticular, for vessels to be monitored via VMS and for the electronic\r\ntransmission of catch data.

electronic reporting system for fishing activities (ERS)\nGeneral provisions\n(1)              \r\nAll EU fishing vessels must be equipped with an\r\nelectronic system, hereinafter referred to as \u2018ERS system\u2019, capable of\r\nrecording and transmitting data relating to the vessel's fishing activity,\r\nhereinafter referred to as \u2018ERS data\u2019, whenever the vessel is operating in the\r\nwaters of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe.\n(2)              \r\nAn EU vessel that is not equipped with an ERS,\r\nor whose ERS is not working, is not authorised to enter S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an waters in\r\norder to engage in fishing activities.\n(3)              \r\nERS data shall be transmitted in accordance with\r\nthe procedures of the vessel\u2019s flag State, i.e. they shall firstly be sent to\r\nthe Fisheries Monitoring Centre (hereinafter: FMC) of the flag State which will\r\nmake them automatically available to the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC. \n(4)              \r\nThe flag State and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe shall\r\nensure that their FMCs have the necessary IT equipment and software to\r\nautomatically transmit ERS data in xml format, [available via\r\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/cfp/control/codes/index_en.htm] and shall have a backup\r\nprocedure in place capable of saving and storing ERS data in a format which\r\nwill be computer-readable for at least three years.  \n(5)              \r\nAny change or update to this format shall be\r\nidentified and dated and must be operational six (6) months after its\r\nintroduction.\n(6)              \r\nERS data must be transmitted using the\r\nelectronic means of communication operated by the European Commission on behalf\r\nof the EU, referred to as the DEH (Data Exchange Highway).\n(7)              \r\nThe flag State and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe shall\r\neach designate an ERS correspondent who will act as the point of contact. \n(a)              \r\nERS correspondents shall be designated for a\r\nminimum period of six (6) months.\n(b)              \r\nThe FMCs of the flag State and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and\r\nPr\u00edncipe shall notify one another of the contact details (name, address,\r\ntelephone number, fax, e-mail address) of their ERS correspondent, before the\r\nsupplier starts production of the ERS.\n(c)              \r\nAny changes to the contact details of the ERS\r\ncorrespondent must be notified immediately.\nProducing and communicating ERS\r\ndata\n(8)              \r\nEU fishing vessels must:\n(a)              \r\nCommunicate on a daily basis ERS data for each\r\nday spent in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an waters;\n(b)              \r\nrecord the quantity of each species caught and\r\nkept on board as target species or by-catch, or discarded, for each fishing\r\noperation;\n(c)              \r\ndeclare the bad catch of each species specified\r\nin the fishing authorisation issued by S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe;\n(d)             \r\nidentify each species by its FAO 3-alpha code;\n(e)              \r\nexpress quantities in kilograms of live weight\r\nor, where necessary, the number of individual fish;\n(f)               \r\nrecord, in the ERS data, the transhipped and/or\r\nunloaded quantity of each species; \n(g)              \r\nrecord in the ERS data, every time S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an\r\nwaters are entered (COE message) or exited (COX message), a specific message\r\ncontaining the quantities held on board at the time of passing for each species\r\nspecified in the fishing authorisation issued by S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe;\n(h)              \r\ntransmit ERS data on a daily basis to the FMC of\r\nthe flag State, according to the format referred to in paragraph 3 above, by\r\n23:59 UTC at the latest.\n(9)              \r\nThe master is responsible for the accuracy of\r\nthe ERS data recorded and sent. \n(10)          \r\nThe FMC of the flag State shall send the ERS\r\ndata automatically and without delay to the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC. \n(11)          \r\nThe FMC of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe shall confirm\r\nthat it has received the ERS data by means of a return message and shall handle\r\nall ERS data confidentially. \nFailure of the on-board ERS and/or\r\ntransmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State\n(12)          \r\nThe flag State shall immediately inform the\r\nmaster and/or owner of a vessel flying its flag, or their agent, of any\r\ntechnical failure of the ERS installed on board or any breakdown in\r\ntransmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State. \n(13)          \r\nThe flag State shall inform S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and\r\nPr\u00edncipe of the failure detected and the corrective measures taken. \n(14)          \r\nIn the event of a breakdown in the on-board ERS,\r\nthe master and/or owner shall ensure the ERS is repaired or replaced within ten days.\r\nIf the vessel makes a call at a port within those ten days, it may only\r\nresume fishing activity in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an waters once its ERS is in perfect working\r\norder, unless S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an authorities allow otherwise. \n(15)          \r\nFollowing a technical failure in its ERS, a\r\nfishing vessel may not leave port until:\n(a)              \r\nits ERS is in working order again, to the\r\nsatisfaction of the flag State and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, or\n(b)              \r\nit receives authorisation from the flag State. In\r\nthe latter case, the flag State shall inform S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe of its\r\ndecision before the vessel leaves. \n(16)          \r\nAny EU vessel operating in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an waters\r\nwith a faulty ERS must transmit all ERS data on a daily basis and by\r\n23:59 UTC at the latest to the FMC of the flag State by any other\r\navailable means of electronic communication accessible by the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC. \n(17)          \r\nERS data which could not be made available to\r\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe via the ERS owing to a failure shall be transmitted by\r\nthe FMC of the flag State to the FMC of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe by another\r\nmutually agreed form of electronic communication. This alternative transmission\r\nshall be considered a priority, it being understood that it will not be\r\npossible to comply with the transmission deadlines usually applicable.\n(18)          \r\nIf the FMC of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe does not\r\nreceive ERS data from a vessel for three consecutive days, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and\r\nPr\u00edncipe may instruct the vessel to immediately call at a port of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and\r\nPr\u00edncipe\u2019s choosing in order to investigate. \nFMC failure \u2013 ERS data not received\r\nby S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC\n(19)          \r\nIn the event that ERS data are not received by\r\nan FMC, its ERS correspondent shall immediately inform the ERS correspondent\r\nfor the other FMC, and if necessary they shall work together to resolve the\r\nproblem.\n(20)          \r\nBefore the ERS becomes operational, the FMC of\r\nthe flag State and the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC shall mutually agree on the alternative\r\nmeans of electronic communication to be used in order to transmit ERS data in\r\nthe event of an FMC failure, and shall immediately inform one another of any\r\nchanges.\n(21)          \r\nIf the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC reports that ERS data have\r\nnot been received, the FMC of the flag State shall identify the causes of the\r\nproblem and take appropriate measures in order to resolve the problem. The FMC\r\nof the flag State shall inform the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC and the EU of the outcome of\r\nthe measures taken within 24 hours of recognising the failure. \n(22)          \r\nIf more than 24 hours is required in order\r\nto resolve the problem, the FMC of the flag State shall immediately transmit\r\nthe missing ERS data to the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an FMC via one of the alternative means of\r\nelectronic communication referred to in point 17.\n(23)          \r\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe shall inform its competent\r\nmonitoring services (MCS) so that EU vessels are not considered by the S\u00e3o\r\nTom\u00e9an FMC to be in breach of their obligations for not transmitting ERS data,\r\nowing to a failure in one of the FMCs.\nFMC maintenance\n(24)          \r\nPlanned maintenance of an FMC (maintenance\r\nprogramme) which may affect the exchange of ERS data must be notified at least\r\n72 hours in advance to the other FMC, indicating, where possible, the date\r\nand duration of the maintenance work. Information about unplanned maintenance\r\nwork shall be sent to the other FMC as soon as possible.\n(25)          \r\nDuring the maintenance work, the provision of\r\nERS data may be put on hold until the system is operational again. The relevant\r\nERS data shall be made available immediately after the maintenance work has\r\nbeen completed.\n(26)          \r\nIf the maintenance work takes more than\r\n24 hours, ERS data shall be sent to the other FMC using one of the\r\nalternative means of electronic communication referred to in point 17.\n(27)          \r\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe shall inform its competent\r\nmonitoring services (MCS) so that EU vessels are not considered by the S\u00e3o\r\nTom\u00e9an FMC to be in breach of their obligations for not transmitting ERS data,\r\nowing to the maintenance of an FMC.\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 33.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/losic/losic9ef.pdf\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
