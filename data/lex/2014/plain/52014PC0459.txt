Taking the opportunity of this\r\namendment and in line with the Commission's Staff Working paper of 2010, the\r\nCommission proposes the adoption of additional modifications to improve the\r\nmanagement and the governance of F4E.\nThese proposals have been extensively discussed\r\nwith the Members of F4E\u2019s Governing Board and following these exchanges, the\r\nGoverning Board adopted unanimously the proposed amendments at its meeting on\r\n9-10 December 2013. Pursuant to the amendment procedure laid down in Article 21\r\nof the F4E Statutes, once the Governing Board has approved the proposed\r\namendments, the Commission can submit the proposal to modify the Statutes to\r\nthe Council for its adoption.\nTherefore, in accordance with Article 50 of\r\nthe Euratom Treaty and Article 21 of the F4E Statutes, the Commission is hereby\r\nmaking a proposal to the Council for the approval of these amendments.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe members of the Governing Board of F4E\r\nare the main interested parties in F4E. All Member States, Switzerland and Euratom are represented and their consultation and agreement are required on any\r\nproposal to amend the Statutes of F4E, in line with Article 6(4) of the F4E\r\nStatutes.\nFor this reason, in June 2013, the\r\nCommission presented a draft proposal to amend the F4E Statutes to the\r\nGoverning Board. The Governing Board decided then to set up an ad-hoc group, chaired\r\nby the Chair of the Governing Board, with the mandate to seek consensus among\r\nthe members on proposals to amend the Statutes. \nThe first meeting of this ad hoc group took\r\nplace on 21 October 2013 and following this meeting a proposal was drafted and\r\nsubmitted to the Governing Board of 9-10 December 2013. At that meeting, the\r\nGoverning Board adopted unanimously the proposed amendments and now the\r\nCommission can submit the proposal to the Council for approval.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n1. Redefinition of the role of the\r\nExecutive Committee, creation of a Procurement and Contracts Committee and a\r\nBureau.\nThe tasks currently entrusted to the\r\nExecutive Committee would be divided between two Committees, an\r\n\"Administration and Management Committee\" and a \"Procurement and\r\nContracts Committee\". The proposed separation of these tasks allows for a\r\nmore appropriate alignment between the composition of these two committees, the\r\nformer being composed of representatives of Members and the latter of experts\r\nacting in a personal capacity.\nThe Administration and Management Committee\r\nwould, inter alia, prepare opinions and recommendations to the Governing\r\nBoard on the budget, resource estimates plan, annual accounts, the project plan,\r\nthe work programme, etc.\nThe Procurement and Contracts Committee would\r\ngive recommendations to the F4E Director on the award of contracts and would have\r\nonly an advisory role unlike the current Executive Committee which has an\r\napproval role. This amendment is fully consistent with the prerogatives granted\r\nto the Director of F4E in his capacity of Authorising Officer. The Internal\r\nAudit Service of the Commission has pointed out that the Director is\r\nresponsible for awarding the contracts and should not delegate this\r\nresponsibility to a Committee where members are appointed ad personam by\r\nthe Governing Board.\nThe \"Bureau\", a committee not\r\ndefined in the initial Council Decision establishing F4E, was set up by a\r\ndecision of the Governing Board in 2011, as a subsidiary body, to assist the\r\nGoverning Board in the preparation of its decisions. It is now proposed to specifically\r\nintroduce this committee in the F4E Statutes as the Governing Board considers\r\nthat it has proven to be a useful instrument that allows it to work more\r\nefficiently.\n2. Strengthening the rights of Euratom\r\nas regards the 'reservation on legality'.\nPursuant to Article 6(6) of the current F4E Statutes\r\nEuratom has the right to make a reservation to a decision by the Governing\r\nBoard when it considers that that decision may be contrary to Community law. In\r\nthis case the decision is suspended and the matter is referred to the\r\nCommission for a review of its legality. However, the Governing Board can adopt\r\na decision despite a Commission opinion contesting its legality. Strengthening\r\nthe rights of the Commission as regards the provision on the 'reservation on\r\nlegality' would ensure consistency of the decisions of the Governing Board with\r\nthe Community law in line with Article 17 of the Treaty of the European Union\r\nwhich states that the Commission \"shall ensure the application of the\r\nTreaties, and of measures adopted by the institutions pursuant to them\".\nWith this amendment the Governing Board\r\ncannot adopt a decision as long as the Commission has lodged an opinion calling\r\ninto question its legality. \n3. Privileged partnership with\r\ndesignated organisations in the field of scientific and technological fusion\r\nresearch.\nThis amendment aims at establishing a stable\r\nrelationship with the European Fusion Laboratories (EFL). \nThis relationship is important for the\r\nefficient and effective operation of the European fusion programme, for F4E in\r\nthe discharge of its responsibilities and for the European Fusion Laboratories\r\nto optimise their capacity and participation. For the Fusion laboratories, it\r\nwould provide a stable framework for a multi-annual plan of activities, while\r\nfor F4E it would provide stable and reliable R&D support, based on the\r\nknowledge and know-how developed by the European Fusion programme in the last 30\r\nyears of activity and those to be developed in the future. \nThe benefit to the European fusion programme\r\nwould be a better use of resources ensuring among others that bottlenecks and\r\nduplications of effort are mitigated and national funding is optimally combined\r\nwith the community funding flowing through F4E.\n4. Adaptation deriving from the new\r\nframework financial regulation.\nThe new framework financial regulation for\r\nthe bodies referred to in Article 208 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council has been recently adopted by the\r\nCommission. This new regulation contains provisions that need to be included in\r\nthe constituent act (the Council Decision) or in the basic act (the Statutes)\r\nestablishing these bodies which also concerns F4E. The amendments are purely\r\ntechnical and do not affect the substance of the proposal approved by the\r\nGoverning Board. In this regard it is important to note that according to\r\nArticle 208(3) the Commission's internal auditor shall exercise the powers of\r\ninternal auditor of F4E. Consequently the paragraph 2 of Article 5 of the\r\nCouncil Decision, which mentions that the Joint Undertaking shall establish its\r\nown internal audit service, needs to be deleted. Accordingly, point 3 of Annex\r\n3 of the Statutes has been amended to indicate that the Joint Undertaking shall\r\nestablish an audit capability.\u00a0 \n5. Amendment needed to align the\r\nStatutes to the new basic act for the financing of F4E activities approved by\r\nthe Council in December 2013.\nThe Council Decision on the financing of F4E\r\nactivities for 2014-2020 entails an amendment to the F4E Statutes. As it stands\r\nnow, Article 12(a) of the F4E Statutes provides for the Euratom contribution to\r\nbe made available through the Community research and training programmes,\r\nadopted pursuant to Article 7 of the Treaty. This provision needs to be amended\r\nto take into account that the financing of F4E for 2014-2020 will not be made\r\navailable through the Euratom Framework Programme but through this new Council Decision based on article 47 of the\r\nTreaty.\nIn addition, a new Article 5aa is inserted in\r\nthe Council Decision establishing Fusion for Energy to reinforce the protection\r\nby the Joint Undertaking of the financial interests of its Members.\n6. Voting rights for Croatia.\nBy decision of the Governing Board during its\r\nmeeting of 10-11 June 2013, it is proposed to grant Croatia two votes in the\r\nGoverning Board.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis proposal for a Council Decision has no\r\nbudgetary implication. The financing of the activities\r\nof F4E for the period 2014-2020 has been set up by Council Decision\r\n2013/791/Euratom of 13 December 2013.\n2014/0215 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\namending Decision 2007/198/Euratom\r\nestablishing the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of\r\nFusion Energy and conferring advantages upon it\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing\r\nthe European Atomic Energy Community and in particular the third and fourth\r\nparagraphs of Article 47 and Article 48 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nDecision 2007/198/Euratom[1] established the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the\r\nDevelopment of Fusion Energy (hereinafter \"Joint Undertaking\") to provide\r\nthe contribution of the European Atomic Energy Community (hereinafter\r\n\"Euratom\") to the ITER International Fusion Energy Organisation and\r\nthe Broader Approach Activities with Japan as well as to prepare and coordinate\r\na programme of activities in preparation for the construction of a\r\ndemonstration fusion reactor and related facilities.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2007/198/Euratom\r\nhas been amended by Council Decision 2013/791/Euratom[2] to allow the financing\r\nof the activities carried out by the Joint Undertaking during the period\r\n2014-2020.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its conclusions of 12\r\nJuly 2010 on the Commission's Communication \"ITER status and possible way\r\nforward\"[3],\r\nthe Council requested the Commission to examine and address the way in which\r\nthe Commission, the Member States and the Joint Undertaking should implement\r\ntheir responsibilities and tasks on ITER.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A detailed list of actions\r\nwas identified in the Commission's Staff Working Paper \"Towards a robust\r\nmanagement and governance of the ITER project\"[4] issued on 9 November\r\n2010, to be undertaken either at the international level, mainly by the ITER Organization,\r\nor at the European level, mainly by the Joint Undertaking.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the accession of\r\n Croatia to the Union on 1 July 2013, there is a need to amend the Statutes of the\r\nJoint Undertaking to grant Croatia voting rights in the Governing Board of the\r\nJoint Undertaking. It is necessary to make further amendments to those Statutes\r\nin order to improve the management and the governance of the Joint Undertaking.\r\nTo take into account amendments to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic\r\nEnergy Community by the Treaty of Lisbon, it is also necessary to update the\r\nreference to the provisions on the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Governing Board of the\r\nJoint Undertaking approved the amendments proposed by the Commission to\r\nDecision 2007/198/Euratom, in accordance with the Statutes of the Joint\r\nUndertaking.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An Administration and\r\nManagement Committee should be established to prepare opinions and\r\nrecommendations for the adoption of key documents by the Governing Board. This Committee\r\nshould also provide advice or recommendations on specific administrative and\r\nfinancial issues upon request of the Director or the Governing Board. The\r\nGoverning Board should have the power to delegate tasks to this Committee. Any\r\nMember of the Joint Undertaking should have the right to nominate a\r\nrepresentative to serve on this Committee.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Procurement and Contracts\r\nCommittee should be established to give recommendations to the Director of the\r\nJoint Undertaking on the award of contracts, grants and related matters.\r\nMembers of this Committee should be nominated in a personal capacity by the\r\nGoverning Board.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Bureau should be\r\nestablished to assist the Governing Board in the preparation of its decisions. The\r\nGoverning Board should have the power to delegate tasks to the Bureau. The members\r\nof the Bureau should be the Chair of the Governing Board, the Chairs of the\r\nGoverning Board Committees, a representative of Euratom and a representative of\r\nthe ITER Host State (France). The Governing Board should be entitled to appoint\r\nadditional persons to the Bureau.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n17 of the Treaty on European Union, the Commission is to ensure the application\r\nof the Treaties, and of measures adopted by the institutions pursuant to them.\r\nTherefore, the rights of the Commission should be strengthened to ensure\r\nconsistency of the decisions of the Governing Board with Union law.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is desirable to\r\nestablish a network of designated organisations in the field of scientific and\r\ntechnological fusion research to provide stable and long-term research and\r\ndevelopment support to the Joint Undertaking, based on the knowledge and\r\nknow-how developed by the European Fusion programme and those to be developed\r\nin the future.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to take\r\ninto account the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[5]\r\nand Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012[6], in particular the role\r\nof the Commission's internal auditor as internal auditor of the Joint\r\nUndertaking. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision\r\n2007/198/Euratom as amended by Decision 2013/791/Euratom\r\nensures the financing of the Joint Undertaking activities for 2014-2020.\r\nArticle 12 a) of the Statutes of the Joint Undertaking provides for the Euratom\r\ncontribution to be made available through the Community research and training\r\nprogrammes, adopted pursuant to Article 7 of the Treaty. That provision should\r\nbe amended to take into account that the financing for 2014-2020 will no longer\r\nbe made available through the Euratom Framework Programme.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also appropriate to\r\nupdate Decision 2007/198/Euratom as regards the provisions on protection of the\r\nfinancial interests of the Members.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2007/198/Euratom\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nDecision 2007/198/Euratom is amended
