This has changed the\r\ncontext of relations between the European Union and Georgia in a significant\r\nand positive way. The EU and Georgia have in the meantime finalised\r\nnegotiations for an Association Agreement (\"the Agreement) to succeed the\r\nPCA. The negotiations of the Association Agreement were completed on 22 July\r\n2013, and the Agreement was initialled on 29 November 2013 on the occasion of\r\nthe Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius.\nThe Association Agreement will\r\nsignificantly deepen Georgia\u2019s political association and economic integration\r\nwith the EU and includes the gradual implementation of a Deep and Comprehensive\r\nFree Trade Area.\nThe successful implementation of a Visa\r\nLiberalisation Action Plan constitutes a fundamental element underpinning the\r\npolitical association and economic integration of Georgia with the European Union\r\nforeseen in the Association Agreement, namely the substantial enhancement of\r\nmobility and people-to-people contacts. \nThe EU Heads of State and Government\r\ninitially envisaged signature of the Association Agreement autumn 2014.\r\nPrompted by worrisome developments in Ukraine which could well impact also\r\nother countries in the region, the decision was taken to bring forward the\r\nsigning of the agreement to June. Following concerted efforts between Union institutions\r\nto shorten the technical work on the texts of the Agreement, this objective\r\nwill be reached. \nThe Association Agreement can only enter\r\ninto force once ratified by all Parties (i.e. the EU, its Member States and Georgia). This is likely to be a lengthy process, possibly of several years.\r\nTherefore, the Agreement foresees the provisional application of parts thereof\r\nonce the partner country has completed the necessary procedures and the EU side\r\nhas notified its readiness for provisional application to start. \nThe aim of the Association Agenda is thus\r\nto prepare and facilitate the implementation of the Association Agreement, by\r\ncreating a practical framework through which the overriding objectives of\r\npolitical association and economic integration can be realised, thus succeeding\r\nto the EU-Georgia European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan. \nBased on the structure of the Association\r\nAgreement, the Association Agenda provides for a list of priorities for joint\r\nwork in the period 2014-2016. The fact that the Association Agenda focuses upon\r\na limited number of priorities should not affect the scope or the mandate of the\r\nexisting dialogue under the P CAor other agreements nor should it prejudge the\r\nimplementation of commitments made in the Association Agreement once it enters\r\ninto force or is provisionally applied. It is important to note that unlike the\r\nAssociation Agreement, the Association Agenda is not a legally binding\r\ninstrument under international law. \nThe Commission attaches the text of a\r\nproposal for a Council Decision on the Union position within the EU-Georgia\r\nCooperation Council with regard to the adoption of the Association Agenda, as\r\nset out in Annex. \nThe Commission therefore request the\r\nCouncil to adopt the attached draft Council Decision.\n2014/0182 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the Union position with the Cooperation\r\nCouncil established by

The\r\nPresident\nANNEXES\nto the\nProposal for a \r\nCOUNCIL DECISION\r\non the Union position with the Cooperation Council established by the European\r\nUnion \u2013 Georgia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European\r\nCommunity and its Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other\r\npart with regard to the adoption of a Recommendation on the implementation of\r\nthe EU-Georgia Association Agenda\nANNEX 1\nDraft\nRECOMMENDATION\nOn\r\nthe implementation of the EU-Georgia Association Agenda\nTHE\r\nEU-GEORGIA COOPERATION COUNCIL,\nHaving regard to the EU-Georgia Partnership\r\nand Cooperation Agreement, establishing a Partnership between the European\r\nCommunity and its Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other\r\npart (hereinafter \"the Agreement\") and in particular\u00a0 Article 81\r\nthereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)                   \r\nPursuant to Article 81 of the Agreement, a\r\nCooperation Council is established which will supervise the implementation of\r\nthe Agreement. The Cooperation Council may make appropriate recommendations, by\r\nagreement between the two Parties.\n(2)                   \r\nThe Parties to the Agreement have agreed on the\r\ntext of the Association Agenda which aims to prepare and facilitate the\r\nimplementation of the future Association Agreement through creating a practical\r\nframework to realise their overriding objectives of political association and\r\neconomic integration. \n(3)                   \r\nThe Association Agenda serves the dual purpose\r\nof setting out concrete steps in bringing the fulfilment of the Parties'\r\nobligations set out in the Association Agreement, and of providing a broader\r\nframework for further strengthening EU-Georgia relations to involve a\r\nsignificant measure of economic integration and a deepening of political\r\ncooperation, in accordance with the overall objective of the Association\r\nAgreement. \nHAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING RECOMENDATION\nSole\r\nArticle\nThe Cooperation Council recommends that the\r\nParties implement the EU-Georgia Association Agenda set out in the Annex,\r\ninsofar as such implementation is directed towards attainment of the objectives\r\nof the EU-Georgia Association Agreement including Deep and Comprehensive Free\r\nTrade Area, establishing an Association between the European Community and its\r\nMember States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part. \nDone at [\u2026]\nFor the Cooperation Council\nThe President\nANNEX\r\n2\nANNEX\r\nAssociation Agenda \nbetween the European Union and Georgia\nThe European Union and Georgia ('the\r\nParties') recognise that the context of their relations has changed in a\r\nsignificant and positive way since the inception of the Eastern Partnership.\r\nThe Parties began negotiations of an Association Agreement in 2010, and of a\r\nDeep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, to form an integral part of that\r\nAgreement, in 2012. They have also developed and launched a Visa Liberalisation\r\nAction Plan, whose successful implementation is a fundamental element\r\nunderpinning the political association and economic integration of Georgia with\r\nthe European Union foreseen in the Association Agreement, namely the\r\nsubstantial enhancement of mobility and people-to-people contacts. \nThe negotiations of the Association\r\nAgreement were finalised on 22 July 2013, and the Agreement was initialled on\r\n29 November 2013. It will take some time before the full Agreement can enter\r\ninto force. In the meantime, action is needed to ensure that the Parties are\r\nable to enjoy the full benefits of the Agreement starting with its partial\r\nprovisional application. The aim of the present Association Agenda is to\r\nprepare and facilitate the implementation of the Association Agreement, by\r\ncreating a practical framework through which the overriding objectives of political\r\nassociation and economic integration can be realised and to succeed to the\r\nEU-Georgia European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) Action Plan. \nBased on the structure of the Association\r\nAgreement, the Association Agenda provides for a list of priorities for joint\r\nwork in the period 2014-2016.\nThe fact that the Association Agenda\r\nfocuses upon a limited number of priorities should not affect the scope or the\r\nmandate of existing dialogue under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement,\r\nother relevant Agreements or under the multilateral track of the Eastern\r\nPartnership, nor should it prejudge implementation of commitments made in the\r\nAA/DCFTA once it enters into force or is provisionally applied.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Principles, instruments and\r\nresources for implementing the Association Agenda\nThe following common principles will guide\r\nthe implementation of the Association Agenda:\n\u00b7                        \r\nActions undertaken through the Association\r\nAgenda should be implemented in the spirit of the overall objective of\r\npolitical association and economic integration;\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe priorities of the Association Agenda\r\ncomplement the responsibilities of the EU and Georgia to implement in full the\r\nprovisions of the EU-Georgia Association Agreement once it enters into force;\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe Association Agenda should be implemented in\r\nfull respect of the principles of transparency, accountability and\r\ninclusiveness;\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe Association Agenda involves an engagement\r\nfrom both sides in its implementation; \n\u00b7                        \r\nThe Association Agenda aims to achieve tangible\r\nand defined results through the progressive implementation of practical\r\nmeasures;\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe Parties recognise the importance of\r\nsupporting the agreed priorities through appropriate and sufficient political,\r\ntechnical and financial means; and\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe implementation of the Association Agenda\r\nwill be subject to annual reporting, monitoring and assessment. Progress made\r\nwill be reviewed including in the existing structures under the Partnership and\r\nCooperation Agreement or other relevant Agreements.\nThe European Union will support Georgia in implementing the objectives and priorities set out in the Association Agenda. It\r\nwill do so through using all available sources of EU support, as well as\r\nexpertise and advice, best practices and know how, the sharing of information,\r\nsupport to capacity-building and institutional strengthening. It will also\r\nencourage and seek coordination of support from other partners of Georgia. The relevant EU financial instruments will also be available to help in the\r\nimplementation of the Association Agenda. Notwithstanding this, the latter is\r\nnot in itself a financial programming document and does not substitute for the\r\nprogramming or formulation exercises undertaken by the Parties.\nEU support will be provided in the context\r\nof the overall priorities for assistance in favour of Georgia, as outlined in\r\nthe ENI Single Support Framework (SSF) and in the multi-country programming\r\nunder the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) as part of the overall\r\nfunding available for Georgia and in full respect of the relevant\r\nimplementation rules and procedures of EU external assistance. \nThis Association Agenda will be applied\r\nfrom the moment of its adoption, for an initial period of three years which may\r\nbe extended by mutual agreement. From the start of its application, it will\r\nreplace the ENP Action Plan as the principal vehicle for monitoring Georgia\u2019s progress within the European Neighbourhood Policy framework. Civil society will\r\nalso be encouraged to focus their monitoring activities on the Association\r\nAgenda. \nThis Association Agenda may be amended or\r\nupdated at any time as necessary by agreement of the EU-Georgia Cooperation\r\nCouncil (Association Council), in particular when the Association Agreement\r\nenters into force.\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Priorities of the Association\r\nAgenda\n2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Political dialogue and reform\nPolitical\r\ndialogue and cooperation towards reforms in the framework of this Association\r\nAgenda seek to strengthen respect for democratic principles, the rule of law\r\nand good governance, human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the\r\nrights of persons belonging to minorities as enshrined\r\nin the core UN and Council of Europe Conventions and related protocols and to\r\ncontribute to consolidating domestic political reforms, in particular through\r\napproximating with the EU acquis\r\ncommunautaire. The EU Special Adviser on Constitutional and Legal\r\nreform and Human Rights Thomas Hammarberg's report from September 2013 \"Georgia in Transition\"[1] and especially the recommendations included therein should be taken\r\ninto account when implementing the below matters of political dialogue and\r\nreform[2].\nThe dialogue and cooperation will cover the\r\nfollowing areas:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strengthening the stability,\r\nindependence and effectiveness of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule\r\nof law and respect for human rights, and in particular by:\n\u00b7                        \r\nEnsuring the democratic conduct of elections,\r\naddressing any shortcomings in the legislative framework and election\r\nadministration as identified by the Inter-Agency Task\r\nForce on Free and Fair Elections (IATF) and Organisation\u00a0\r\nfor Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) / Office for Democratic\r\nInstitutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) including in view of the 2014 local\r\nelections;\n\u00b7                        \r\nEnsuring that constitutional amendments, if\r\ncontemplated, are subject to comprehensive consultation domestically and with\r\nthe Council of Europe\u2019s Venice Commission to ensure that they stand the test of\r\ntime;\n\u00b7                        \r\nImproving the balance between flexibility and\r\nstability of the constitution and strengthen the budgetary powers of the Parliament\r\nin line with the opinion of the Venice Commission No. 737/2013;\n\u00b7                        \r\nEnsuring respect for the roles of the Prime\r\nMinister and President under the constitution; \n\u00b7                        \r\nEnsuring adequate checks and balances in the\r\npolitical system as Georgia undergoes transition from semi-presidential to\r\nparliamentary system.
