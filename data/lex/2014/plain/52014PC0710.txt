The\r\nFund, as part of the Board\u2019s budget is financed through contributions from the\r\nbanking sector of the Member States participating in the SRM.\nA sufficiently funded Single Resolution\r\nFund is essential for the SRM to function properly and protect financial\r\nstability without recourse to taxpayers' money. It is also in the interest of\r\nthe banking sector that the Fund has the necessary resources to intervene where\r\nnecessary in resolution procedures to ensure the effective application of the\r\nresolution tools.\nPursuant to Articles 58 and 59 of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 806/2014, the Board has an autonomous budget which is not\r\npart of the Union budget, comprising of two parts: Part I for the\r\nadministration of the Board and Part II for the Single Resolution Fund ('the\r\nFund'). This proposal for a Council implementing act refers only to Part II of\r\nthe budget of the Board. \nPursuant to Article 60 of Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 806/2014, the revenues of Part II of the budget, the Fund, shall consist, in\r\nparticular, of annual contributions from entities within the scope of the SRM\r\nRegulation. Such contributions cover, in particular, the amounts used by the\r\nBoard in resolution procedures to ensure the effective application of the\r\nresolution tools.\nThe Board is required under Article 70(2)\r\nof Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 to calculate each year the individual\r\ncontributions of the institutions subject to the SRM to the Fund. The annual\r\ncontribution of each entity shall be based on a basic contribution that is pro\r\nrata to the amount of its liabilities (excluding own funds) less covered\r\ndeposits, with respect to the aggregate liabilities (excluding own funds) less\r\ncovered deposits of all the institutions authorised in the territories of the\r\nparticipating Member States in the SRM which shall be risk adjusted based on\r\nthe criteria listed in Article 103(7) of Directive 2014/59/EU.\nPursuant to Article 70(6) of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 806/2014, for the purpose of determining the annual contributions to\r\nthe Fund, the Board shall apply the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No\r\nxxxx/2014 supplementing Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council with regard to ex-ante contributions to resolution financing\r\narrangements which is adopted pursuant to Article 103(7) of Directive\r\n2014/59/EU and specifies the notion of adjusting contributions in proportion to\r\nthe risk profile of institutions. When determining the annual contribution of\r\nentities the Board is also required under Article 70(2) of Regulation (EU) No\r\n806/2014 to take into account the principle of proportionality, to avoid\r\ncreating distortions between banking sector structures of the participating\r\nMember States in the SRM, and to allow for a balanced distribution of\r\ncontributions across different types of banks.\nUnder Article 70(7)(a) and (b) of the SRM\r\nRegulation, the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, is empowered\r\nto adopt implementing acts on the contributions to the Fund in particular in\r\nrelation to the application of the methodology for the calculation of\r\nindividual contributions and the practical modalities for allocating to\r\ninstitutions the risk factors specified in the Commission Delegated Regulation\r\n(EU) No xxx/2014 with regard ex-ante contributions to the resolution financing\r\narrangements.\nThis proposal from the Commission for a\r\nCouncil implementing act specifies the manner in which the additional risk\r\nadjustment component of the annual contribution and the methodology for the\r\napplication of the risk adjustment to the basic annual contribution provided\r\nfor in the Commission delegated Regulation (EU) No xxx/2014 with regard to\r\nex-ante contributions to the resolution financing arrangements has to be\r\napplied when calculating the annual contributions by the Board in order to\r\nadapt the methodology laid down in that delegated act to the specificities of a\r\nunified system of contributions pooled into a single Fund on the basis of\u00a0 a\r\nEuropean target level.\nIn accordance with Article 67(4) of the SRM\r\nRegulation, the contributions to the Fund decided by the Board shall be raised\r\nby national resolution authorities and transferred to the Fund in accordance\r\nwith the Agreement among the participating Member States in the SRM on the\r\ntransfer of contributions the Fund and the progressive mutualisation of such\r\ncontributions.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNo additional formal impact assessment has\r\nbeen carried out for this delegated Regulation because the impacts have been\r\nassessed in the Impact Assessment conducted for the adoption of the Directive\r\n2014/59/EU.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThis proposal for a Council implementing\r\nRegulation covers in particular the following areas:\nArticle 1 lays down provisions on the\r\napplication by the Board of the methodology for the calculation of individual\r\ncontributions and the practical modalities for allocating to institutions the\r\nrisk factors specified in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No xxxx/2014\r\nsupplementing Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncilwith regard to ex-ante contributions to the resolution financing\r\narrangements.\nArticle 2 defines the scope of the Implementing\r\nRegulation. The addressees are all the entities falling within the scope of the\r\nSRM Regulation.\nArticle 3 lays down the applicable\r\ndefinitions.\nArticle 4 provides for the rules on the\r\ndetermination of the annual contributions to the single resolution fund.\nArticle 5 sets out communication\r\nrequirements to be complied with by the Board.\nArticle 6 sets out reporting requirements.\nArticle 7 lays down transitional provisions.\n2014/0336 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nspecifying uniform conditions of\r\napplication of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council with regard to ex-ante contributions to the Single Resolution Fund\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EU) No\r\n806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2014\r\nestablishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit\r\ninstitutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single\r\nResolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution Fund and amending Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 1093/2010, and in particular Article 70(7) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Single Resolution Fund\r\n(\u2018the Fund\u2019) was established pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 as a\r\nsingle financing arrangement for all the Member States participating in the\r\nSingle Supervisory Mechanism (\u2018the SSM\u2019) pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) No\r\n1024/2013[1]\r\nand in the Single Resolution Mechanism (\u2018the SRM\u2019) to replace the resolution\r\nfinancing arrangements of those Member States, established in accordance with\r\nArticle 100(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil2. The resources that those\r\nfinancing arrangements have accumulated before the Fund was established should\r\nbe transferred to the Fund.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under Article 67(2) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 806/2014, the Single Resolution Board (\u2018the Board\u2019)\r\nestablished pursuant to that Regulation is entrusted with the administration of\r\nthe Fund.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n70 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, the Fund should be used in resolution\r\nprocedures where the Board considers it necessary to ensure the effective\r\napplication of the resolution tools. The Fund should have adequate financial\r\nresources to allow for an effective functioning of the resolution framework by\r\nbeing able to intervene where necessary for the effective application of the\r\nresolution tools and protect financial stability without recourse to taxpayers'\r\nmoney.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Board is empowered to\r\ncalculate ex-ante contributions from all the entities referred to in Article 2\r\nof Regulation (EU) No 806/2014. Those entities are credit institutions\r\nestablished in the Member States participating in the SRM and parent\r\nundertakings, investment firms and financial institutions established in the\r\nMember States participating in the SRM, where they are subject to consolidated\r\nsupervision carried out by the European Central Bank ('ECB') in accordance with\r\nArticle 4(1)(g) of Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Board should calculate\r\nthe contributions to the Fund on the basis of a single target established as a\r\npercentage of the amount of covered deposits of all entities authorised in the\r\nparticipating Member States in the SRM. In accordance with Article 69(1) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 806/2014, the Board should ensure that, eight years as of 1\r\nJanuary 2016, the available financial means of the Fund reach at least 1 %\r\nof the amount of covered deposits of entities authorized in the participating\r\nMember States in the SRM.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 70(2)\r\nof Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, the annual contribution to a resolution financing\r\narrangement should be based on a fixed amount determined on the basis of that\r\ninstitution's liabilities and a risk adjusted contribution depending on the risk\r\nprofile of that institution.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, the Board is considered, for the\r\napplication of that Regulation and of Directive 2014/59/EU, as a national\r\nresolution authority where it performs tasks and exercises powers which are to\r\nbe performed or exercised by the national resolution authorities pursuant to\r\nthose acts. Therefore the Board should also be considered as the resolution\r\nauthority for the purpose of the application of Delegated Regulation (EU) No\r\nxxxx/2014[2].\r\nThe provisions set out in that Delegated Regulation apply to the Board when\r\nperforming the tasks and exercising powers set out in this Regulation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of\r\ncalculating the annual contribution, the Board applies the methodology set out\r\nin the Delegated Regulation (EU) No xxxx/2014, as required by Article 70(6) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 806/2014. Therefore, the specific regime applicable to\r\ninstitutions which are considered as being small under that Delegated\r\nRegulation also applies to the institutions authorised in the participating\r\nMember States which fulfil the criteria set out in that Regulation for being\r\nrecognised as being small.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the rules laid down in\r\nthis Regulation determine conditions for the application of the methodology set\r\nout in the Delegated Regulation adopted under Article 103(7) of Directive 2014/59/EU,\r\nthe differences between the calculation of the annual contributions by the\r\nBoard for the entities authorised in the participating Member States in the SRM\r\nand the calculation of the annual contributions in the Member States which are\r\nnot participating in the SRM should reflect only the specificities of a unified\r\nsystem in the participating Member States in the SRM. Such specificities arise\r\nin particular from the fact that in the SRM there is a single target level for\r\nall participating Member States. The application, as a general rule, of the\r\nsame methodology for the calculation of the annual contributions in all Member\r\nStates should preserve a level-playing field among participating Member States and a strong internal market.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\r\nsystem of annual contributions to the Fund is fair and balanced, the Board\r\nshould take into account a balanced distribution of contributions across\r\ndifferent types of banks when deciding the manner in which the basic annual\r\ncontribution should be adjusted according to the risk profile of the\r\ninstitutions.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under a single resolution\r\nfund with a European target level the annual contribution of an entity is\r\ndependent on those of all entities subject to the SRM. The key for an effective\r\nfunctioning of the SRM and a smooth process of building-up of the Fund is that\r\nall entities fully pay their annual contributions to the Fund in a timely\r\nmanner. To ensure the effectiveness of the SRM, the Board should have the power\r\nto sanction the entities which would not pay or only partially pay the due\r\nannual contributions.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n67(4) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, the contributions to the Fund decided by\r\nthe Board are raised by national resolution authorities and transferred to the\r\nFund in accordance with an Agreement on the transfer of those contributions the\r\nFund and the progressive mutualisation of such contributions.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 70(2)(b) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 806/2014 requires the Board to calculate the annual\r\ncontributions of institutions to the Fund in a way which takes into account the\r\nprinciple of proportionality, without creating distortions between banking\r\nsector structures of the Member States. During the transitional period until\r\nthe Fund is fully built-up and its national compartments fully mutualised,\r\ndistortions between banking sector structures of the Member States\r\nparticipating in the SSM and the SRM may arise where there is an important\r\nvariation between the annual contribution of an institution as determined by\r\nthe Board in a given year, pursuant to Article 69 and Article 70(1) and (2) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 806/2014 and the new rules laid down in this Regulation,\r\ncompared to the annual contributions that the institution concerned would have\r\npaid pursuant to Article 103 of Directive 2014/59/EU and Delegated Regulation\r\n(EU) No xxx/2014 It is essential to prevent such distortions from arising on\r\nthe basis of the switch from a national target level for the resolution\r\nfinancing arrangements under Directive 2014/59/EU to a single target level for\r\nthe Member States participating in the SSM and the SRM, and the manner in which\r\nthe target level of the Fund is determined, on the basis of covered deposits.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The basic annual\r\ncontribution of institutions also varies according to the amount of covered\r\ndeposits held by institutions. As a result, the annual contributions to the\r\nFund of institutions which hold smaller amounts of covered deposits would be\r\nhigher under the single target level of the SRM compared to the national target\r\nlevel set by Directive 2014/59/EU, and the annual contributions of institutions\r\nwhich have higher amounts of covered deposits would be lower under the single\r\ntarget level of the SRM compared to the national target level set by Directive\r\n2014/59/EU. It is therefore necessary to avoid distortions between the banking\r\nsector structures of the Member States by adjusting, during the transitional\r\nperiod until the Fund is fully built-up and mutualised. During the initial\r\nperiod of eight years, the adjustment mechanism should be based on a non-linear\r\nphasing-in of the contributions calculated on the basis of a single target\r\nlevel and phasing-out of the contributions calculated on the basis of national\r\ntarget levels.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the adjustment\r\nmechanism would not eliminate all the distortions created between banking\r\nsector structures by the single target level introduced in Regulation (EU) No\r\n806/2014 because the annual contributions of some institutions under the\r\nadjustment mechanism could still exceed 100% of the annual contributions\r\ncalculated in accordance with Article 103 of Directive 2014/59/EU and Article 4\r\nof Delegated Regulation (EU) No xxx/2014. In order to mitigate the effects of\r\npossible distortions, the Board should be able to allow those institutions to\r\nmake use of the irrevocable payment commitments referred to in Article 70(3) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 806/2014. This would reflect the fact that those\r\ninstitutions will have to pay contributions which are in excess of their\r\ncontributions under Directive 2014/59/EU, and that therefore the relevant\r\nnational compartments will comprise more resources than the national resolution\r\nfunds that those Member States would have established under the BRRD. However,\r\nin order to ensure sufficient availability of resources in each national\r\ncompartment of the Fund, no institution should be able to make use of payment\r\ncommitments for more than 50% of its contributions. That adjustment mechanism\r\nshould apply only during the transitional period and should be without\r\nprejudice to the full discretion of the Board to allow the use of the\r\nirrevocable payment commitments to any institution after the expiry of the\r\ntransitional period. Moreover, the adjustment mechanism should take into\r\nconsideration the proportionality principle for institutions which are not\r\nsignificant. Therefore, the adjustment mechanism should not apply to\r\ninstitutions subject to the lump-sum system provided for in the Delegated\r\nRegulation (EU) No xxx/2014. Moreover, in order to mitigate possible effects on\r\ncertain institutions during the transitional period the lump-sum system should\r\nbe partially extended.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a system of annual\r\ncontributions to a single resolution fund is implemented in the Member States\r\nfor the first time, and considering that such a system is based on a target\r\nlevel to be reached progressively, the Commission will review the manner in\r\nwhich this Regulation is implemented at the same time as it will review of\r\nDelegated Regulation (EU) No xxx/2014 to allow, if needed, for an adjustment of\r\nthe rules provided for in this Regulation.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under Article 99(2) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 806/2014, that Regulation shall apply as of 1 January 2016.\r\nHowever, from 1 January 2015, the Board shall submit a monthly report approved\r\nin its plenary session to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the\r\nCommission on whether the conditions allowing for the transfer of the\r\ncontributions raised at national level have been met. From 1 December 2015,\r\nwhere those reports show that the conditions for the transfer of the contributions\r\nto the Fund have not been met, the application of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014\r\nrelating to the contributions to the Fund shall be postponed by one month each\r\ntime. Therefore, this Regulation should also apply as of the date at which\r\nRegulation (EU) No 806/2014 applies,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\r\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down rules specifying:\n(a)                   \r\nthe conditions of implementation of the\r\nobligation of the Single Resolution Board ('the Board') to calculate the\r\nindividual contributions of the entities referred to in Article 2 of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 806/2014 to the Single Resolution Fund ('the Fund');\n(b)                   \r\nthe application of the methodology for the\r\ncalculation of individual contributions referred to in point (a).\nArticle 2\r\nScope\nThis Regulation applies to the entities\r\nreferred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014. \nArticle 3\r\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of\r\nthis Regulation, the definitions contained in Article 3\r\nof Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 shall apply.
