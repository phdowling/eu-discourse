If animals are\r\nsick and need a treatment, veterinary medicinal products may be administered on\r\nthe basis of a veterinary prescription. The vast majority of medicated feed for\r\nfarmed animals contains antimicrobials or anti-parasites. \nAs regards the oral administration of medicines\r\nto animals, the animal holders can either add medicines themselves to the\r\nanimal feed or drinking water or use medicated feed into which the medicine is\r\nincorporated by themselves or by another approved manufacturer. \nMedicated feed is generally used to treat\r\nanimal diseases in large groups of animals, in particular pigs and poultry.\r\nThere is a clear correlation between the level of manufacture standards and the\r\nquality of the treatment via medicated feed. High standards mean good\r\nhomogenous distribution of the medicine in the feed, good compatibility of the\r\nmedicine with the feed and as a result good dosage and efficient treatment of\r\nthe animal and low carry-over of the medicine into non-target animal feed. \nThere are 13.7 million animal holdings in the\r\nEU. The value of livestock farming output in the EU is \u20ac157 billion. The value\r\nof the EU`s aquaculture which includes production of crustaceans, molluscs, and\r\nfinfish is estimated to be \u20ac3.3 billion. Pet animals represent the second\r\nlargest type of animals kept in the EU. There are around 64 million cats, 60\r\nmillion dogs, 40 million pet birds, 25 million small mammals and many millions\r\nof ornamental fishes. All these farmed animals, aquaculture species and pets,\r\ndepending on their health condition, may need medication.\nThe aim of the review of the medicated feed\r\nrules is to harmonise at a high safety level the manufacture, marketing and use\r\nof medicated feed and intermediate products in the EU and to reflect technical\r\nprogress in this field. The draft proposal updates the current legislation on\r\nmedicated feed by repealing Directive 90/167/EEC which sets out the conditions\r\nunder which medicated animal feed may be manufactured, placed on the market and\r\nused within the EU. The Directive has been established before the creation of\r\nthe internal market and it has never been adapted in substance. The national\r\ntransposition of this legal instrument has given freedom to Member States\r\nregarding interpretation and implementation of the legal provisions, but this\r\nflexibility has contributed to some problems. The Directive gives no indication\r\non what standards to apply in approving plants or the acceptable techniques to\r\nproduce medicated feed, whether standards should be technology-based or\r\nresults-based, it does not provide for homogeneity criteria, it is totally\r\nsilent on the concept of carry-over of medicated feed between batches, on the specific\r\nlabelling of medicated feed and on medicated feed for pets and it is vague on\r\nwhether feed may be prepared in advance of prescription in the feed mill,\r\nallowing Member States to arrive with different interpretations. \nFurthermore, the\r\nexisting legislation is likely to perpetuate existing discrepancies in its\r\nimplementation between the Member States. This creates an uneven playing field\r\nfor professional operators on the single market. There is a need to harmonise\r\nimplementation of the legislation, reduce financial and administrative burdens\r\nand support innovation. \nThe draft proposal will allow the anticipated medicated feed production, mobile and\r\non-farm mixing, while simultaneously establishing the parameters for these\r\nschemes. The provisions include measures for disposal of not used medicated\r\nfeed on farm. EU wide limits will be set for the carry-over of veterinary\r\nmedicines in feed that should be adapted based on an assessment of the risk for\r\nthe animals and the humans with regard to the different types of active\r\nsubstances.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nThe impact assessment builds on the results of\r\nan external study entitled \"Evaluation of the EU Legislative Framework in\r\nthe Field of Medicated Feed\u201d carried out in 2009/2010 by the Food Chain\r\nEvaluation Consortium (FCEC).\nIt is furthermore based on a wide stakeholders\u2019\r\nconsultation in the context of the evaluation conducted in 2009/2010, following\r\nwhich internal consultations and discussion with the Member States took place.\r\nIn addition, during the whole process consultations with the stakeholders were\r\ndone in the margins of the Advisory Group on the Food Chain and Animal and\r\nPlant Health, the Animal Health Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee\r\non Fisheries and Aquaculture working group on aquaculture. Furthermore,\r\ntargeted consultations of the International Federation for Animal Health\r\nEurope, the European Feed Manufacturers` Federation, the Federation of\r\nVeterinarians in Europe and the EU Farmers and Agri-Cooperatives were\r\nundertaken.\nFollowing the stakeholders' consultation in the\r\nmargins of the FCEC evaluation, a new web-based stakeholders' survey was\r\norganised from 30 March to 31 May 2011, using an Interactive Policy Making\r\nquestionnaire to collect comments on the policy options. \nFinally, focussed interviews with experts from\r\nthe industry and competent authorities were undertaken mainly to collect data\r\nfor the assessment of the different options.\nIn June 2009 a questionnaire was sent to the Member States plus Norway and Switzerland to gather information from the competent authorities\r\non the status quo in the field of medicated feed. \nIn addition, the Commission has consulted and\r\nreported regularly to the working party of Chief Veterinary Officers, the\r\nStanding Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (Section Animal\r\nNutrition) and the Veterinary Pharmaceutical Committee.\nThe purpose of the impact assessment was to\r\nsupport the changes proposed to the medicated feed legislation (Directive\r\n90/167/EEC) in line with the principles set out in the Commission's Work\r\nprogramme. This is related to similar on-going work in the field of veterinary\r\nmedical products. The Health and Consumers Directorate-General has taken the\r\ninitiative to revise Directive 90/167/EEC at the same time as the revision of\r\nthe veterinary medicinal products legislation.\nMember States and the different stakeholders involved in this field have on\r\nseveral times indicated the importance of ensuring that the revision of the\r\nmedicated feed legislation takes the specificities of the sector into account.\r\nThis can only be done by an independent approach which builds on the links with\r\nthe feed legislation and the veterinary medicinal products legislation.\nThe impact\r\nassessment identified the following main axes along which the system has to\r\nchange in order to answer the stakeholders concerns: residues of veterinary\r\nmedicines in feed, imprecise dosage of veterinary medicines, impossible market\r\naccess to medicated feed for pets and barriers to intra EU trade of medicated\r\nfeed.\nThe impact assessment concluded that an EU\r\nRegulation with detailed rules would have the most positive impacts and would\r\nprovide for the best way forward to achieve the objectives for the EU. It\r\nshould have a significant positive impact on cost efficiency and economic\r\ngrowth of the medicated feed manufacturing sector, also considering innovative\r\napplications of veterinary medicines. Animal and public health can be expected\r\nto be improved both in Member States with currently lax standards for medicated\r\nfeed and those with prohibitive standards. Safe tolerance levels for the\r\nunavoidable carry-over of veterinary medicines in feed would lead to a\r\npragmatic and solid level playing field for the industry and the control\r\nauthorities. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe aim of this proposal is to repeal Directive\r\n90/167/EEC by the proposed Regulation.\nGeneral provisions\nThe scope of the proposed Regulation covers the\r\nmanufacture, placing on the market and use of medicated feed for use in pets\r\nand in food-producing animals within the Union. It does not apply to veterinary\r\nmedicinal products used as the medicinal component of medicated feed\r\n(previously called \"medicated premixes\"), which are dealt with under\r\nthe veterinary medicinal products legislation.\nThe Regulation lays down rules for the\r\nmanufacture, composition, placing on the market and use of medicated feed. The\r\ngeneral manufacture requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 183/2005\r\napply. Furthermore, medicated feed may only be manufactured from veterinary\r\nmedicinal products authorised under the veterinary medicinal products\r\nlegislation. It also sets rules for the approval of feed business operators and\r\nrules they need to comply with in order to manufacture medicated feed. The\r\nRegulation lays down rules for the homogenous incorporation of the veterinary\r\nmedicinal products into the medicated feed and requirements in order to avoid\r\ncarry-over of active substances from veterinary medicinal products into non\r\ntarget feed.\nWith respect to labelling, the general\r\nprovisions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 apply. Specific rules for\r\nthe prescription, the validity of the prescription, the use of medicated feed\r\ncontaining antimicrobials in food-producing animals and the quantities required\r\nfor the treatment of animals with medicated feed are laid down. Manufacturers,\r\ndistributors and users of medicated feed must keep daily records for the\r\neffective tracing of medicated feed. For veterinary medicinal products\r\nauthorised at national level, the Regulation sets Intra-Union rules for trade\r\nof medicated feed in order to prevent distortions in competition. \nRules for the adoption of delegated acts and of\r\nimplementing acts on the basis of the Regulation are laid down in the proposal.\nLegal basis\nArticles 43 and 168(4)(b) of the TFEU provide for the legal basis of\r\nthe proposal.\nDirective 90/167/EEC was based on Article 43 of the Treaty\r\nestablishing the European Economic Community (now Article 43 of the TFEU),\r\nimplementing the Common Agricultural Policy. The objectives of that policy are\r\nto increase agricultural productivity, to ensure a fair standard of living for\r\nthe agricultural community, to stabilise markets, to assure the availability of\r\nsupplies and to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices. To\r\naim for harmonised and adequate production conditions for the EU livestock\r\nfarmers can be also derived from this Article.\nArticle 168(4)(b) of the TFEU covers measures\r\nin the veterinary and phytosanitary fields which have as their direct objective\r\nthe protection of public health.\nThe proposal takes the form of a Regulation of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council. Other means would not be\r\nappropriate because the objectives of the measure can be achieved most\r\nefficiently by fully harmonised requirements throughout the Union.\n2014/0255 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the manufacture, placing on the market\r\nand use of medicated feed and repealing Council Directive 90/167/EEC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 43 and 168(4)(b)\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee\r\nof the Regions[2],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nDirective 90/167/EEC[3]\r\nconstitutes the Union`s regulatory framework for the\r\nmanufacture, placing on the market and use of medicated feed.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Livestock production\r\noccupies a very important place in the agriculture of the Union. The rules\r\nconcerning medicated feed have significant influence on the keeping and on the\r\nrearing of animals, including non-food producing animals, and on the production\r\nof products of animal origin.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The pursuit of a high\r\nlevel of protection of human health is one of the fundamental objectives of\r\nfood law, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council[4],\r\nand the general principles laid down in that Regulation should apply to the\r\nplacing on the market and use of feed without prejudice to more specific Union\r\nlegislation. In addition, the protection of animal health constitutes one of\r\nthe general objectives of EU food law.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience with the\r\napplication of Directive 90/167/EEC has shown that further measures should be\r\ntaken to strengthen the effective functioning of the Internal Market and to explicitly\r\ngive and improve the possibility to treat non-food producing animals by medicated\r\nfeed.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Medicated feed is one of\r\nthe routes for the administration of veterinary medicinal products, which are\r\nincorporated into feed. The authorisation for use in feed, the manufacture,\r\ndistribution, advertising and supervision of those veterinary medicinal\r\nproducts are governed by Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council[5].\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a type of feed,\r\nmedicated feed falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 183/2005 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[6],\r\nof Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council[7], of Regulation (EC) No\r\n1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council[8] and of Directive\r\n2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[9]. Specific provisions\r\nfor medicated feed and intermediate products should be established concerning\r\nfacilities and equipment, personnel, manufacture quality control, storage and\r\ntransport, record-keeping, complaints and product recalls, the application of\r\nprocedures based on the hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP)\r\nprinciples and labelling.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Medicated feed imported\r\ninto the Union must satisfy the general obligations laid down in Article 11 of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 178/2002 and the import conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No\r\n183/2005 and in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council[10].\r\nWithin this framework, medicated feed imported into the Union is to be\r\nconsidered as falling within the scope of this Regulation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without prejudice to the\r\ngeneral obligations laid down in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002\r\nconcerning exports of feed to third countries, the provisions of this\r\nRegulation should apply to medicated feed and intermediate products which are\r\nmanufactured, stored, transported or placed on the market within the Union with the intention to be exported. However, the specific requirements concerning\r\nlabelling, prescription and use of medicated feed and intermediate products\r\nshould not apply to products intended to be exported.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Medicated feed should be\r\nmanufactured only with authorised veterinary medicinal products and the\r\ncompatibility of all compounds used should be ensured for the purpose of safety\r\nand efficacy of the product. Additional specific requirements or instructions\r\nfor the inclusion of the veterinary medicinal products into feed should be\r\nforeseen to ensure a safe and efficient treatment of the animals.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Homogeneous incorporation\r\nof the veterinary medicinal product into the feed is also crucial for the\r\nmanufacture of a safe and efficient medicated feed. Therefore, the possibility\r\nto establish criteria, such as target values, for the homogeneity of the\r\nmedicated feed should be provided for. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Feed business operators may\r\nproduce within one establishment a broad range of feeds for different target\r\nanimals and containing different types of compounds such as feed additives or\r\nveterinary medicinal products. The manufacture of different types of feed after\r\neach other in the same production line may result in the presence of traces of\r\na substance in the line, which ends up in the beginning of the production of\r\nanother feed. This transfer of traces of a substance from one production lot to\r\nanother is called \"carry-over\". \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Carry-over may occur during\r\nproduction, processing, storage and transport of feed where the same production\r\nand processing equipment, storage facilities or means of transport are used for\r\nfeed with different components. For the purposes of this Regulation, the\r\nconcept of \"carry-over\" is used specifically to designate the\r\ntransfer of traces of an active substance contained in a medicated feed to a\r\nnon-target feed, while the term \"cross-contamination\" is to be\r\nconsidered as a contamination resulting from a carry-over or from the transfer\r\nin feed of any unintended substance. Carry-over of active substances contained\r\nin medicated feed to non-target feed should be avoided or kept as low as\r\npossible. In order to protect animal health, human health and the environment,\r\nmaximum levels of carry-over for active substances contained in medicated feed\r\nshould be established, based on a scientific risk assessment performed by the\r\nEuropean Food Safety Authority and taking into account the application of good\r\nmanufacturing practice and the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable)\r\nprinciple. General limits should be set out in this Regulation, taking into\r\naccount the unavoidable carry-over and the risk caused by the active substances\r\nconcerned. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Labelling of medicated feed\r\nshould comply with the general principles laid down in Regulation (EC) No\r\n767/2009 and be subject to specific labelling requirements in order to provide\r\nthe user with the information necessary to correctly administer the medicated\r\nfeed. Similarly, limits for the deviations of the labelled content of medicated\r\nfeed from the actual content should be established.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Medicated feed should be\r\nmarketed in sealed containers for safety reasons and to protect user's\r\ninterest. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For intra Union trade of\r\nmedicated feed, it should be ensured that the veterinary medicinal product\r\ncontained therein has been duly authorised in the Member State of destination\r\naccording to Directive 2001/82/EC. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Feed business operators\r\nmanufacturing, whether they operate in a feed mill, with a specially equipped\r\nlorry or on-farm, storing, transporting or placing on the market medicated feed\r\nand intermediate products, should be approved by the competent authority, in\r\nline with the approval system laid down in Regulation (EC) No 183/2005, in\r\norder to ensure both feed safety and product traceability. Provision should be\r\nmade for a transition procedure concerning establishments already approved\r\nunder Directive 90/167/EEC.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the safe\r\nuse of medicated feed, its supply and use should be subject to presentation of a\r\nvalid veterinary prescription which has been issued after examination of the\r\nanimals to be treated. However, the possibility to manufacture medicated feed\r\nbefore a prescription is presented to the manufacturer should not be excluded.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a\r\nparticularly prudent use of medicated feed for food-producing animals and\r\ntherefore provide the basis for the assurance of a high level of protection of\r\npublic health, specific conditions concerning the use and the validity of the\r\nprescription, compliance with the withdrawal period and record-keeping by the\r\nanimal holder should be provided for.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\r\nserious public health risk posed by resistance to antimicrobials, it is\r\nappropriate to limit the use of medicated feed containing antimicrobials for\r\nfood-producing animals. Preventive use or use to enhance the performance of\r\nfood-producing animals should in particular not be allowed.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A system for the collection\r\nof unused or expired products should be put in place in order to control any\r\nrisk that such products might raise with regard to the protection of animal,\r\nhuman health or the environment.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to comply with the\r\nobjective of this Regulation and to take into account technical progress and\r\nscientific developments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290\r\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to\r\nthe Commission in respect of the establishment of specific carry-over limits\r\nand of the amendment to the Annexes to this Regulation. Those Annexes concern\r\nprovisions on feed business operators obligations related to the manufacture,\r\nstorage, transport and placing on the market of medicated feed and intermediate\r\nproducts, the incorporation of the veterinary medicinal product into feed, the\r\nlabelling particulars for medicated feed and intermediate products, the\r\npermitted tolerances for the compositional labelling of medicated feed or\r\nintermediate products and the specimen form to be used for the veterinary\r\nprescription. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts,\r\nshould ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\r\ndocuments to the European Parliament and Council.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation regarding the\r\nestablishment of homogeneity criteria for medicated feed, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles\r\nconcerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise\r\nof implementing powers[11].\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should lay\r\ndown penalties for infringement to the provisions of this Regulation and should\r\ntake all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. Such penalties\r\nshould be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nRegulation, namely ensuring a high level of protection of human and animal\r\nhealth, providing adequate information for users and strengthening the\r\neffective functioning of the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved\r\nby the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Union level, the\r\nUnion may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as\r\nset out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the\r\nprinciple of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does\r\nnot go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE\r\nADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nChapter I\r\nScope and definitions\nArticle 1\r\nScope\nThis\r\nRegulation shall apply to:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the\r\nmanufacture, storage and transport of medicated feed and intermediate products;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the\r\nplacing on the market, including import, and use of medicated feed and\r\nintermediate products; \n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the\r\nexport to third countries of medicated feed and intermediate products.
