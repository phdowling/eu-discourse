The new\r\nAgreement repeals and replaces the existing Agreement; it covers a period of\r\nfive years from its entry into force, renewable by tacit agreement. The new\r\nProtocol covers a period of five years from the date of provisional application\r\nlaid down in its Article 12 \u2013 that being the date on which it was signed by the\r\nParties.\nThe main aim of the new Agreement is to\r\nprovide an updated framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed\r\nCommon Fisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to establishing\r\na strategic partnership between the European Union and the Republic of Senegal in the field of fisheries. \nThe aim of the Protocol is to grant fishing\r\nopportunities to European Union vessels in Senegalese waters taking into\r\naccount available scientific assessments, in particular those of the Fishery\r\nCommittee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF), and in accordance with the\r\nbest scientific advice and the recommendations of the International Commission\r\nfor the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), within the limits of the\r\navailable surplus. The Commission based its position in part on the results of\r\na forward-looking assessment, carried out by external experts, of whether a new\r\nAgreement and Protocol should be concluded. The aim is also to enhance\r\ncooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Senegal to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources\r\nin the Senegalese fishing zones, in the interests of both parties.\nThe Protocol provides for fishing\r\nopportunities in the following categories:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 28 tuna seiners;\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8 pole-and-line vessels;\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2 trawlers (targeting black\r\nhake, a deep-sea demersal species).\nThe Commission proposes, on this basis,\r\nthat the Council authorise the signing and the provisional application of the\r\nnew Agreement and of the Implementation Protocol thereto.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe interested parties were consulted as\r\npart of the forward-looking assessment of whether a Fisheries Partnership\r\nAgreement should be entered into by the European Union and the Republic of   Senegal. Experts from the Member States were also consulted in technical\r\nmeetings. These consultations led to the conclusion that it would be beneficial\r\nto renew the Fisheries Agreement and to conclude a Fisheries Protocol with the Republic of   Senegal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThis procedure is being initiated in\r\nparallel with the procedures relating to the Council Decision authorising the\r\nsignature and provisional application of the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership\r\nAgreement and the Implementation Protocol thereto, and to the Council\r\nRegulation concerning allocation of the fishing opportunities between the\r\nMember States of the European Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe annual financial contribution has been\r\nset at EUR 1 808 000 for the first year, EUR 1 738 000 for the second, third\r\nand fourth years and EUR 1 668 000 for the fifth year, based on:\na) a reference tonnage of 14 000 tonnes for\r\ntunas and a volume of authorised catches of 2 000 tonnes for black hake, the\r\namounts linked to such access having been set at EUR 1 058 000 for the first\r\nyear, EUR 988 000 in the second, third and fourth years, and at EUR 918 000 for\r\nthe fifth year, and \nb) support for the development of the\r\nsectoral fisheries policy of the Republic of Senegal amounting to EUR\r\n750 000 per year. This support meets the objectives of the national\r\nfisheries policy and in particular the needs of the Republic of Senegal in terms of support for scientific research, for monitoring and fighting against\r\nillegal fishing, and for small-scale fishing, including the rehabilitation of\r\ndegraded ecosystems to allow the recovery of juvenile stocks.\n2014/0239 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL

It is therefore necessary to update it. The last Protocol\r\nto this Agreement expired on 30 June 2006. It is intended that the new Protocol\r\nwill apply provisionally from the date of its signature. In order not to extend\r\nthe period of suspension of fishing operations, a procedure for adoption by the\r\nCouncil of a Decision on the signing and provisional application of the\r\nAgreement and of the Protocol has been launched in parallel with this\r\nprocedure.\nThe new Protocol will provide a framework for the fishing activities\r\nof the European fleet in the Senegalese fishing zones and will authorise\r\nEuropean vessel owners to apply for fishing licences allowing them to fish in\r\nSenegalese waters. In addition, the new Protocol enhances cooperation between\r\nthe EU and Senegal, with a view to promoting the development of a sustainable\r\nfishing policy. It provides, in particular, for\r\nvessels to be monitored via VMS and for the electronic transmission of catch\r\ndata. Sectoral support has been strengthened to help the Republic of   Senegal with its national fisheries strategy, including in the fight against\r\nIUU fishing.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nAs regards this new Agreement and Protocol, failure to act by the EU\r\nwould allow the emergence of private agreements which would not guarantee\r\nsustainable fisheries. The European Union also hopes that with this Protocol,\r\nthe Republic of Senegal will continue to cooperate effectively with the EU\r\nparticularly as regards the fight against illegal fishing.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nAn analysis of past catches in Senegal and of recent catches within\r\nthe framework of similar protocols in the region, as well as the assessments\r\nand scientific advice available, led the parties to set a reference tonnage for\r\ntunas (14 000 tonnes a year) and an authorised volume of catches for black hake\r\n(2 000 tonnes a year).

No methods or devices may be used to seek to obstruct the mesh of the nets or reduce their selective effect. However, in the interests of reducing wear or damage, protective aprons of netting or other material may be attached, but only to the underside of the codend of a bottom trawl. Such aprons must be attached only to the forward and lateral edges of the codend of the trawl. Protective devices may be used for the top of the trawl, but these must consist of a single section of net of the same material as the codend, with the mesh measuring at least 300 millimetres when stretched out. Doubling of the codend\u2019s netting yarn, whether single or multiple, is prohibited. \n (4)               By-catches[2]: \n 7% cephalopods, 7% crustaceans, and 15% other deepwater demersal fish. The above percentages of by-catches shall be calculated at the end of each trip, in relation to the total catch weight, in accordance with Senegalese regulations. The retention on board, transhipment, landing, storage and sale of all or some of the elasmobranches protected by the EU Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks and by the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and the competent Regional Fisheries Organisations, i.e. of the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus), silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus), porbeagle (Lamna nasus), bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus), angel shark (Squatina squatina), giant manta ray (Manta birostris) and hammerhead shark species (Sphyrnidae) are prohibited. Elasmobranch species not allowed on board, if accidentally caught, must not be injured. Specimens caught must be promptly released. \n (5)               Total allowable catch/fees: \n Authorised catch volume: || 2 000 tonnes per year \n Fee: || EUR 90/tonne \n The fee shall be calculated at the end of each period of three months in which the vessel is authorised to fish, taking into account the catches made during that period. The licence shall be granted on advance payment of EUR 500 per vessel, to be deducted from the total amount of the fee.

and\r\nimplementing the electronic reporting system for fishing activities (ERS)\n\r\n1.                      \r\nGeneral provisions\r\n\n(1)              \r\nAll EU fishing vessels must be equipped with an\r\nelectronic system, hereinafter referred to as 'ERS system', capable of\r\nrecording and transmitting data relating to the fishing activity of the vessel,\r\nhereinafter referred to as 'ERS data', whenever the vessel is operating in\r\nSenegalese waters.\n(2)              \r\nAn EU vessel that is not equipped with an ERS,\r\nor whose ERS is not working, is not authorised to enter Senegalese waters in\r\norder to engage in fishing activities.\n(3)              \r\nERS data shall be transmitted in accordance with\r\nthe procedures of the vessel\u2019s flag State, i.e. they shall firstly be sent to\r\nthe Fisheries Monitoring Centre (hereinafter: FMC) of the flag State which will\r\nmake them automatically available to the Fisheries Protection and Monitoring\r\nDirectorate (DPSP) of Senegal.\n(4)              \r\nThe flag State and Senegal shall ensure that\r\ntheir FMCs have the necessary IT equipment and software to automatically\r\ntransmit ERS data in xml format, and shall have a backup procedure in place\r\ncapable of recording and storing ERS data in a format which will be\r\ncomputer-readable for at least three years.\n(5)              \r\nERS data must be transmitted using the\r\nelectronic means of communication operated by the European Commission on behalf\r\nof the EU, referred to as the DEH (Data Exchange Highway).\n(6)              \r\nThe flag State and Senegal shall each designate\r\nan ERS correspondent who will act as the point of contact. \n(a)              \r\nERS correspondents shall be designated for a\r\nminimum period of six (6) months.\n(b)              \r\nThe FMCs of the flag State and Senegal shall\r\nnotify one another of the contact details (name, address, telephone number,\r\nfax, e-mail address) of their ERS correspondent, before the supplier starts\r\nproduction of the ERS.\n(c)              \r\nAny changes to the contact details of the ERS\r\ncorrespondent must be notified immediately.\n\r\n2.                      \r\nProducing and communicating ERS data\r\n\n(1)              \r\nUnion fishing vessels shall:\n(a)              \r\ncommunicate on a daily basis ERS data for each\r\nday spent in Senegalese waters;\n(b)              \r\nrecord the quantity of each species caught and\r\nkept on board as target species or by-catch, or discarded, for each fishing\r\noperation;\n(c)              \r\nfor each species identified in the fishing\r\nauthorization issued by Senegal, also declare zero catches;\n(d)             \r\nidentify each species by its FAO alpha 3 code;\n(e)              \r\nexpress the quantities in kilograms of live\r\nweight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish;\n(f)               \r\nrecord, in the ERS data, the transhipped and/or\r\nunloaded quantity of each species;\n(g)              \r\nrecord in the ERS data, every time Senegalese\r\nwaters are entered (COE message) or exited (COX message), a specific message\r\ncontaining the quantities held on board at the time of passing for each species\r\nspecified in the fishing authorisation issued by Senegal;\n(h)              \r\ntransmit ERS data on a daily basis to the FMC of\r\nthe flag State, according to the format referred to in point 4 of paragraph 1\r\nabove, by 23:59 UTC at the latest.\n(2)              \r\nThe master is responsible for the accuracy of\r\nthe ERS data recorded and sent.\n(3)              \r\nThe FMC of the flag State shall send the ERS\r\ndata automatically and without delay to the Senegalese FMC.\n(4)              \r\nThe Senegalese FMC shall confirm that it has\r\nreceived the ERS data by means of a return message and shall handle all ERS\r\ndata confidentially.\n\r\n3.                      \r\nFailure of the on-board ERS and/or\r\ntransmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State\r\n\n(1)              \r\nThe flag State shall immediately inform the\r\nmaster and/or owner of a vessel flying its flag, or their agent, of any\r\ntechnical failure of the ERS installed on board or any breakdown in\r\ntransmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State.\n(2)              \r\nThe flag State shall inform Senegal of the\r\nfailure detected and the corrective measures taken.\n(3)              \r\nIn the event of a breakdown in the on-board ERS,\r\nthe master and/or owner shall ensure the ERS is repaired or replaced within\r\nten days. If the vessel makes a call at a port within those ten days,\r\nit may only resume fishing activity in Senegalese waters once its ERS is in\r\nperfect working order, unless Senegal authorises otherwise.\n(a)              \r\nFollowing a technical failure in its ERS, a\r\nfishing vessel may not leave port until its ERS functions again to the\r\nsatisfaction of the flag State and Senegal, or\n(b)              \r\nit receives authorisation from the flag State.\r\nIn the latter case, the flag State shall inform Senegal of its decision before\r\nthe vessel leaves.\n(4)              \r\nAny EU vessels operating in Senegalese waters\r\nwith a faulty ERS must transmit all ERS data on a daily basis and by\r\n23:59 UTC at the latest to the FMC of the flag State by any other\r\navailable means of electronic communication accessible by the Senegalese FMC.\n(5)              \r\nERS data which could not be made available to\r\nSenegal via the ERS owing to the failure of the system shall be transmitted by\r\nthe FMC of the flag State to the Senegalese FMC by another mutually agreed form\r\nof electronic communication. This alternative transmission shall be considered\r\na priority, it being understood that it will not be possible to comply with the\r\ntransmission deadlines usually applicable.\n(6)              \r\nIf the Senegalese FMC does not receive ERS data\r\nfrom a vessel for three consecutive days, Senegal may instruct a vessel to\r\nimmediately call at a port of its choosing in order to investigate.\n\r\n4.                      \r\nFMC failure \u2013 ERS data not received by\r\nSenegalese FMC\r\n\n(1)              \r\nIn the event that ERS data are not received by\r\nan FMC, its ERS correspondent shall immediately inform the ERS correspondent\r\nfor the other FMC, and if necessary they shall work together to resolve the\r\nproblem.\n(2)              \r\nBefore the ERS becomes operational, the FMC of the\r\nflag State and the Senegalese FMC shall mutually agree on the alternative means\r\nof electronic communication to be used in order to transmit ERS data in the\r\nevent of an FMC failure, and shall immediately inform one another of any\r\nchanges thereto.\n(3)              \r\nIf the Senegalese FMC reports that ERS data has\r\nnot been received, the FMC of the flag State shall identify the causes of the\r\nproblem and take appropriate measures in order to resolve the problem. The FMC\r\nof the flag State shall inform the Senegalese FMC and the EU of the outcome of\r\nthe measures taken within 24 hours after recognising the failure.\n(4)              \r\nIf more than 24 hours is required in order\r\nto resolve the problem, the FMC of the flag State shall immediately transmit\r\nthe missing ERS data to the Senegalese FMC via one of the alternative means of\r\nelectronic communication referred to in point 5 of paragraph 3.\n(5)              \r\nSenegal shall inform its competent monitoring\r\nservices (CMS) so that EU vessels are not considered by the Senegalese FMC to\r\nbe in violation of their obligations for not transmitting ERS data owing to a\r\nfailure in one of the FMCs.\n\r\n5.                      \r\nFMC maintenance\r\n\n(1)              \r\nPlanned maintenance of an FMC (maintenance\r\nprogramme) which may affect the exchange of ERS data must be notified at least\r\n72 hours in advance to the other FMC, indicating, where possible, the date\r\nand duration of the maintenance work. Information about unplanned maintenance\r\nwork shall be sent to the other FMC as soon as possible.\n(2)              \r\nDuring the maintenance work, the provision of\r\nERS data may be put on hold until the system is operational again. The relevant\r\nERS data shall be made available immediately after the maintenance work has\r\nbeen completed.\n(3)              \r\nIf the maintenance work takes more than\r\n24 hours, ERS data shall be sent to the other FMC using one of the\r\nalternative means of electronic communication referred to in point 5 of\r\nparagraph 3.\n(4)              \r\nSenegal shall inform its competent monitoring\r\nservices (CMS) so that EU vessels are not considered by the Senegalese FMC to\r\nbe in violation of their obligations for not transmitting ERS data owing to the\r\nmaintenance of an FMC.\nAppendix\r\n7\nCONTACT DETAILS FOR SENEGAL\n1.
