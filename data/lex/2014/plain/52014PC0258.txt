It has contributed considerably to the completion and\r\noperation of the Single Market with regard to appliances burning gaseous fuels.\r\nIt harmonises the conditions for the placing on the market and/or putting into\r\nservice of appliance burning gaseous fuels covered within its scope with regard\r\nto gas safety risks and rational use of energy.\nDirective 2009/142/EC sets out essential\r\nrequirements that appliances burning gaseous fuels must comply with in order to\r\nbe made available on the EU market. \nDirective 2009/142/EC is based on Article\r\n114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter\r\n\"the Treaty\") and is one of the first harmonisation Directives based\r\non the \u201cNew Approach\u201d principles, according to which manufacturers must ensure\r\ncompliance of their products with the mandatory performance and safety\r\nrequirements provided for in the legislative instrument, without out however\r\nimposing specific technical solutions or specifications.\nThis proposal intends to replace Directive\r\n2009/142/EC on appliances burning gaseous fuels by a Regulation, in line with\r\nthe Commission\u2019s simplification objectives.\nExperience from the implementation of\r\nDirective 2009/142/EC made necessary to update and clarify some of its\r\nprovisions, without however modifying its scope. Those provisions concern\r\nmainly some sector specific definitions, the content and the form of the Member\r\nStates communications of their gas supply conditions, the relationship with\r\nother Union harmonisation legislation applying to gas appliances (for other\r\naspects) and some essential requirements in order to complete them and reduce\r\nthus the need for interpretation.\nThe proposed Regulation does not change the\r\ncurrent scope of Directive 2009/142/EC, it however, modifies some of its\r\nprovisions in order to clarify and update their content. The proposed\r\nRegulation is also aligned to the provisions of Decision No 768/2008/EC\r\nestablishing a common framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision).\nThe proposed Regulation clarifies also the\r\nrelationship between its provisions and other more specific EU harmonisation\r\nlegislation. It also clarifies that the rational use of energy essential\r\nrequirement in point 3.5 of Annex I to this Regulation will not apply with\r\nregard to the energy efficiency aspect concerning appliances burning gaseous\r\nfuels falling within an implementing measure of Directive 2009/125/EC\r\nestablishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for\r\nenergy-related products[3].\r\nTo this date the implementing measures under Directive 2009/125/EC are\r\nDirective 92/42EEC on efficiency requirements for new hot-water boilers fired\r\nwith liquid or gaseous fuels[4],\r\nCommission Regulation (EU) No 813/2013 implementing Directive 2009/125/EC with\r\nregard to ecodesign requirements for space heaters and combination heaters[5], Commission Regulation\r\n(EU) No 814/2013 implementing Directive 2009/125/EC with regard to ecodesign\r\nrequirements for water heaters and hot water storage tanks[6] and Commission\r\nRegulation (EU) No 932/2012 implementing Directive 2009/125/EC with regard to\r\necodesign requirements for household tumble driers[7].The rational use of\r\nenergy requirement of this Regulation will not apply to appliances burning\r\ngaseous fuels which will be covered by future Ecodesign implementing measures\r\nunder Directive 2009/125/EC. In the absence of Ecodesign implementing measures,\r\nthe rational use of energy requirement continues to apply. However, this does not\r\naffect the obligations of Member States to adopt national measures with regard\r\nto the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and to the energy\r\nefficiency of buildings in accordance with Directive 2009/28/EC on the\r\npromotion of the use of energy from renewable sources[8], Directive 2010/31/EU\r\non the energy performance of buildings[9]\r\nand Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency[10].\r\nSuch measures, which may in certain circumstances, limit the installation of\r\ngas appliances which comply with the rational use of energy requirement of this\r\nRegulation, must be compatible with the Treaty and take into account of the\r\nneed to ensure the coherent implementation of the all aspects of Union law.\nThe proposal intends also to align\r\nDirective 2009/142/EC to the\r\n\u201cgoods package\u201d adopted in 2008 and in particular to\r\nthe NLF Decision.\nThe NLF Decision sets out a common\r\nframework for EU product harmonisation legislation. This framework consists of\r\nthe provisions which are commonly used in EU product legislation (e.g.\r\ndefinitions, obligations of economic operators, notified bodies, safeguard\r\nmechanisms, etc.). These common provisions have been reinforced to ensure that\r\nthe legislation can be applied and enforced more effectively in practice. New\r\nelements, such as obligations on importers, have been introduced, which are\r\ncrucial for improving the safety of products on the market. \nThe Commission has already proposed the\r\nalignment of nine Directives to the NLF Decision within an NLF implementation\r\npackage adopted on 21 November 2011.\nIn view of ensuring consistency across Union harmonisation legislation for industrial products, in accordance with the political\r\ncommitment resulting from the adoption of the NLF Decision and the legal\r\nobligation provided for in Article 2 of the NLF Decision, it is necessary that\r\nthis proposal is in line with the provisions of the NLF Decision.\nThe proposal takes into account Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on European\r\nStandardisation[11].\nThe proposal also takes into account the\r\nproposal of the Commission of 13 February 2013 for a Regulation on market\r\nsurveillance of products[12],\r\nwhich intends to set out a single legal instrument on the market surveillance\r\nactivities in the field of non-food goods, consumer or non-consumer products\r\nand products covered or not by Union harmonisation legislation. This proposal\r\nmerges the rules on market surveillance of Directive 2001/95/EC on general product\r\nsafety[13],\r\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\r\nsetting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating\r\nto the marketing of products[14]\r\nand of sector-specific harmonisation legislation in order to increase the\r\neffectiveness of market surveillance activities within the Union. The proposed\r\nRegulation on market surveillance of products contains also the relevant\r\nprovisions on market surveillance and safeguard clauses. Therefore, provisions\r\nin existing sector specific harmonisation legislation that relate to market\r\nsurveillance and safeguard clauses should be removed from that harmonisation\r\nlegislation. The overacting objective of the proposed Regulation is to simplify\r\nthe Union market surveillance framework fundamentally so that it works better\r\nfor its main users: market surveillance authorities and economic operators. Directive\r\n2009/142/EC provides for a safeguard clause procedure for gas appliances. In\r\nline with the framework intended to be established by the proposed Regulation\r\non the market surveillance of products, this proposal does not include the\r\nprovisions on market surveillance and safeguard clause procedures provided for\r\nin the NLF Decision. However, in order to ensure legal clarity, it makes a\r\nreference to the proposed Regulation on market surveillance of products.\nConsistency with other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThis initiative is in\r\nline with the Single Market Act[15],\r\nwhich stressed the need to ensure consumer confidence in the quality of\r\nproducts on the market and the importance of reinforcing market surveillance.\r\nIt is consistent with the Union energy policy as it does not affect the\r\napplication and implementation of Union legislation in the field of energy\r\nefficiency and renewable energy. \nIt complements and is\r\ncoherent with Union policy on energy supply and energy efficiency by not\r\napplying where more specific Union acts apply.\nFurthermore it supports\r\nthe Commission\u2019s policy on Better Regulation and simplification of the regulatory\r\nenvironment.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nThe revision of Directive 2009/142/EC has been\r\ndiscussed with national experts responsible for the implementation of the Directive,\r\nthe conformity assessment bodies\u2019 forum, the administrative cooperation group\r\non market surveillance as well as in bilateral contacts with industry\r\nassociations. \nThe consultation included meetings with the\r\nMember States Working Group Gas Appliances (WG-GA), the Working Group GAD\r\nRevision (WG GAD REV) and the Gas Appliances Directive Advisory Committee\r\n(GAD-AC). \nAn Ex-post Evaluation Study was carried out\r\nin 2010-2011, intending to evaluate the results of the implementation of\r\nDirective 2009/142EC[16].\r\nThe study assessed the effectiveness of Directive 2009/142/EC, its impact on\r\ncompanies and users, possible trade barriers limiting the free movement of\r\nappliances, innovation and whether the provisions of the Directive are\r\nsufficient to ensure that appliances burning gaseous fuels and fittings placed\r\non the market and/or put into service in accordance with it, are designed and\r\nmanufactured so as to operate safely and present no gas related risks.\nAlthough the Ex-post evaluation study\r\nconcluded that Directive 2009/142/EC was functioning well and contributed to\r\nthe improvement of safety of appliances burning gaseous fuels, it also\r\nhighlighted some areas for possible improvements.\nFrom December 2011 to March 2012, a public\r\nconsultation was organised with as main objective to have the views and\r\nopinions of authorities, manufacturers, associations, standardisation\r\norganisations, notified bodies, consumer organisations and citizens on various\r\nissues that needed to be addressed in preparing the options for the revisions\r\nof Directive 2009/142/EC.\nThe participation in the public\r\nconsultation was important and the Commission services received 90 replies with\r\ncontributions from public authorities, industry associations, notified bodies,\r\nstandardisation and consumer organisations, both big enterprises and SMEs and\r\nconsumers.\nThe results of the public consultation are published\r\nat: \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/pressure-and-gas/files/gad/publ-cons-summary_en.pdf. \u00a0\nThe consultation process in all related\r\nfora revealed widespread support for the revision.\nThere is unanimity on the need to align to\r\nthe NLF and thus to improve the existing general regulatory framework.\r\nAuthorities fully support the exercise because it will strengthen the existing\r\nsystem and improve cooperation at EU level. Industry expects a more level\r\nplaying field resulting from more effective actions against products that do\r\nnot comply with the legislation, as well as a simplification effect from the\r\nalignment of legislation. Certain concerns were expressed on some obligations\r\nwhich are, however, indispensable for increasing the efficiency of market\r\nsurveillance. These measures will not entail significant costs for industry and\r\nthe benefits resulting from improved market surveillance should by far outweigh\r\nthe costs.\nCollection and use of expertise - Impact\r\nassessment \nAn impact assessment on the revision of\r\nDirective 2009/142/EC has been conducted. The impact assessment sets out\r\nextensively the different options of revision of the sector related aspects of\r\nDirective 2009/142/EC.\nWith regard to the NLF alignment aspects,\r\nthe impact assessment report for the revisions of Directive 2009/142/EC refers\r\nto the general impact assessment conducted in the framework of the NLF\r\nImplementation package of 21 November 2011[17].\nIn particular, the modifications due to the\r\nalignment to the NLF Decision and their impacts are expected to be the same as\r\nfor the nine product harmonisation Directives included in the Alignment\r\nPackage.\nThe Impact Assessment Report on this\r\nAlignment Package has already examined in depth the different options, which\r\nare exactly the same with regard to Directive 2009/142/EC. The Report contained\r\nalso an analysis of the impacts resulting from the legislative alignment to the\r\nprovisions of the NLF Decision.\nTherefore, the Impact Assessment Report on\r\nthe revision of Directive 2009/142/EC did not examine those aspects and it\r\nfocussed on specific issues relating to Directive 2009/142/EC as well as on the\r\nways to address them.\nBased on the information collected, the impact\r\nassessment carried out by the Commission examined and compared three options\r\nwith regard to problems and issues relating to Directive 2009/142/EC.\nOption 1 \u2013 \u201cDo nothing\u201d - No changes to\r\nthe existing situation\nThis option proposes no changes to Directive\r\n2009/142/EC.\nOption 2 \u2013 Intervention by non-legislative\r\nmeasures\nOption 2 considers the possibility of\r\nencouraging voluntary interventions to resolve the identified issues, e.g.,\r\nguidance documents containing a commonly agreed interpretation of Directive\r\n2009/142/EC.\nOption 3 \u2013 Intervention by legislative\r\nmeasures\nThis option consists in modifying Directive\r\n2009/142/EC.\nOption 3 was\r\nfound to be the preferred option because:\n\u2013                        \r\nit is considered more effective than option 2:\r\ndue to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the\r\npositive impacts would materialise under that option;\n\u2013                        \r\nit does not entail significant costs for\r\neconomic operators and notified bodies; for those who are already acting\r\nresponsibly, no extra costs or only negligible costs are expected, as the scope\r\nand the provisions remain in substance unchanged and only legal clarifications\r\nare inserted;\n\u2013                        \r\nnot any significant economic or social impacts\r\ncould be identified;\n\u2013                        \r\noptions 1 and 2 do not provide answers to legal inconsistencies\r\nor ambiguities and therefore will not lead to a better implementation of\r\nDirective 2009/142/EC.\nThe proposal includes:\n\u00b7              \r\nThe removal of the outdated temperature limit of\r\n105\u00b0C from the definition of the scope;\n\u00b7              \r\nThe introduction of currently missing\r\ndefinitions for the sector specific terminology under Directive 2009/142/EC;\n\u00b7              \r\nThe introduction of a harmonised content and\r\nform of the communications of the Member States under Article 2(2) of Directive\r\n2009/142/EC, of the types of gas and corresponding supply pressures used on\r\ntheir territory;\n\u00b7              \r\nThe clarification of the relationship between\r\nDirective 2009/142/EC and other EU harmonisation legislation, including Ecodesign\r\nimplementing measures under Directive 2009/125/EC and other Union energy policy\r\ninstruments;\n\u00b7              \r\nThe improvement of the readability of some of\r\nthe provisions of Directive 2009/142/EC.\nThe impact of the proposal will lead to\r\nstrengthening the competitiveness of European enterprises as a result of guaranteeing\r\na level playing field for the economic operators and to enhanced safety\r\nprotection for consumers and other end-users.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1. Scope and definitions\nThe scope of the proposed Regulation\r\ncorresponds to the scope of Directive 2009/142/EC, and covers \u201cappliances\u201d and\r\n\u201cfittings\u201d.\nThe proposal introduces some definitions\r\nrelating to sector specific issues, in order to improve its readability.\nAdditionally, the general definitions\r\nresulting from the alignment to the NLF Decision have been inserted.\n3.2. Member States communications on\r\ngas supply conditions on their territory\nThe proposed Regulation contains current\r\nArticle 2(2) of Directive 2009/142/EC, according to which Member States must\r\ncommunicate the types of gas and corresponding supply pressures used on their\r\nterritories and any changes in their gas supply conditions to other Member States and the European Commission. Subsequently, this information is published in\r\nthe Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU)[18].\nThis information is very important for manufacturers\r\nas the gas supply conditions at the place where an appliance burning gaseous\r\nfuels is put into service are very important for its safe and correct\r\nfunctioning. Therefore, this aspect has to be taken into account by the\r\nmanufacturer already in the design phase.\nThe availability of adequate information is\r\nalso the prequisite for the determination of the \"appliance category\u201d marking\r\nor markings that must be indicated on the appliance and are\r\ndefined by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN). Cureently, this\r\ninformation is provided in harmonised standard hEN 437:2003+A1:2009 and in\r\nproduct specific European harmonised standards.\nHowever, as the\r\ncurrently published information is not sufficient, there is a need to better\r\ndetermine the parameters which should be communicated by the Member States in\r\norder to ensure the adequacy and comparability of this information.\nAdditionally, the gas\r\nsupply conditions in the Union are currently under rapid development. This is\r\ndue, amongst others, to the general Union objective to increase the proportion\r\nof energies from renewable sources. As a result, more and more gases from\r\nnon-conventional sources[19]\r\nwill be supplied both through isolated local networks and by injecting them\r\ninto natural gas distribution networks.\nDespite the attempts to\r\nachieve a higher degree of harmonisation of gas qualities across Europe[20], the\r\ngradual depletion of the sources of gas extracted from some gas fields and\r\ntheir replacement with biogas will lead to an increasing diversity of gas\r\nqualities.\nAs the types of gas and\r\ntheir supply pressures are not subject to harmonisation\r\nin the framework of Directive 2009/142/EC and cannot be subject to such\r\nharmonisation under this proposal, the gas quality\r\nissue has to be taken into account in the proposal in order to ensure the link\r\nwith the safety and performance of the appliances.\nIt is therefore important that this proposal ensures that manufacturers have adequate\r\ninformation about the types of gas and supply pressures available as gas\r\nappliances are very sensitive to the composition of the fuel. Inadequate or\r\nmissing pieces of information during the design phase would lead to unsafe\r\nand/or not correctly performing (e.g. significantly reduced energy efficiency\r\nlevel) appliances being placed on the market.\nTherefore the proposal defines the\r\nparameters that should be included in the communications, in order to better\r\nensure the compatibility of the appliances with the gas supply conditions and provides\r\nfor a harmonised form for those communications.\n3.3. Making available on the market of\r\ngas appliances and fittings, obligations of economic operators, CE marking,\r\nfree movement\nThe proposal contains the typical\r\nprovisions for product-related Union harmonisation legislation and sets out the\r\nobligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised\r\nrepresentatives, importers and distributors), in accordance with the NLF\r\nDecision.\nAccording to Directive 2009/142/EC,\r\nfittings do not bear the CE marking (as also they are not subject to a\r\nsafeguard clause procedure). Fittings are not appliances\r\nburning gaseous fuels, but intermediate products made separately available only\r\nbetween professionals and intended to be incorporated into an appliance before\r\nthe latter is placed on the market. According to\r\nDirective 2009/142/EC, fittings must however been accompanied by a certificate\r\ndeclaring their conformity with the provisions of the Directive and stating\r\ntheir characteristics and how they should be incorporated into an appliance or\r\nassembled to assist compliance with the essential requirements applicable to\r\nfinished appliances. As the appropriate design of a\r\nfitting contributes to the correct and safe functioning of a finished appliance\r\nand as the gas related risks of an appliance can only be assessed after\r\nincorporation of the fitting, the proposed Regulation keeps the existing\r\nprovision according to which fittings do not bear the CE marking. However, in order to improve clarity, the certificate accompanying fittings\r\nunder Directive 2009/142/EC has been qualified as \u201cFitting conformity\r\ncertificate\u201d, in order to better define its content and clarify its\r\nrelationship with the EU declaration of conformity requirement under other\r\npossibly applicable Union harmonisation legislation.\n3.4. Harmonised standards\nCompliance with harmonised standards\r\nprovides for a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements.\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1025/2012 sets out a horizontal legal framework for European\r\nstandardisation. The Regulation contains inter alia provisions on\r\nstandardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation\r\nOrganisation, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on\r\nstakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently the\r\nprovisions of Directive 2009/142/EC which cover the same aspects have not been\r\nreintroduced in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty.\n3.5. Notified bodies\nProper functioning of notified bodies is\r\ncrucial for ensuring a high level of health and safety protection and for the\r\nconfidence of all interested parties in the New Approach system.\nTherefore, in line with the NLF Decision,\r\nthe proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies and\r\nintroduces specific requirements for notifying authorities. \n3.6. Conformity assessment\nThe proposal keeps the conformity\r\nassessment procedures provided for under Directive 2009/142/EC. It however\r\nupdates the corresponding modules in line with the NLF Decision.\nIn particular, it keeps the requirement for\r\na notified body intervention in the design and production phase of all\r\nappliances and fittings.\nFurthermore, it keeps the current approach\r\nfor the design phase, according to which the type examination of the product by\r\nthe notified body takes the form of examination of the complete appliance or\r\nfitting.\nTherefore, in accordance with Article 4(6)\r\nof the NLF Decision, it provides only for the EU-type examination \u2013 production\r\ntype, as the examination of the technical documentation in conjunction with the\r\nexamination of the complete type is considered, as in Directive 2009/142/EC, to\r\nbetter correspond with the high risks related to gas safety.\n3.7. Implementing and delegated acts\nThe proposal empowers the Commission to\r\nadopt, where appropriate, implementing acts to ensure the uniform application\r\nof this Regulation in respect of notified bodies that do not meet or no longer\r\nmeet the requirements for their notification. Those implementing acts will be\r\nadopted in accordance with the provisions on implementing acts laid down in\r\nRegulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16\r\nFebruary 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms\r\nfor control by the Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing\r\npowers.\nThe proposal empowers the Commission to\r\nadopt, where appropriate, delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the\r\nTreaty in respect of the content and the form of the Member States\r\ncommunications relating to the gas supply conditions on their territory, in\r\norder to take into account technical developments.\n3.8. Final provisions\nThe proposed Regulation will become\r\napplicable two years after its entry into force to allow manufacturers,\r\nnotified bodies, Member States and European Standardisation Bodies, time to\r\nadapt to the new requirements.\nHowever, the designation of notified bodies\r\npursuant to the new requirements and process needs to start shortly after the\r\nentry into force of this Regulation. This will ensure that by the date of\r\napplication of the proposed Regulation, sufficient notified bodies will have\r\nbeen designated in accordance with the new rules so as to avoid problems with\r\nproduction continuity and market supply.\nA transitional provision is foreseen for\r\nthe certificates issued by notified bodies under Directive 2009/142/EC so as to\r\nallow stocks to be absorbed and ensure a smooth transition to the new\r\nrequirements.\nDirective 2009/142/EC will be repealed and\r\nreplaced by the proposed Regulation.\n3.9. Union competence, legal basis,\r\nsubsidiarity principle and legal form\nLegal basis\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the\r\nTreaty.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe subsidiarity principle arises in\r\nparticular with regard to the newly added provisions aiming at the improvement\r\nof effective enforcement of Directive 2009/142/EC, namely, the economic\r\noperators\u2019 obligations, the traceability provisions, the provisions on the\r\nassessment and notification of conformity assessment bodies. \nExperience with the enforcement of the\r\nlegislation has shown that measures taken at national level have led to\r\ndivergent approaches and to a different treatment of economic operators inside\r\nthe Union, which undermines the objectives of Directive 2009/142/EC. If actions\r\nare taken at national level to address the problems, this risks creating\r\nobstacles to the free movement of goods. Furthermore action at national level\r\nis limited to the territorial competence of a Member State. Coordinated action\r\nat Union level can much better achieve the objectives set, and will in\r\nparticular render market surveillance more effective. Hence it is more\r\nappropriate to take action at Union level.\nProportionality\nIn accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, the proposed modifications do not go beyond what is necessary\r\nto achieve the objectives set. \nThe new or modified obligations do not\r\nimpose unnecessary burdens and costs on industry - especially on small and\r\nmedium sized enterprises - or administrations. Where modifications have been\r\nidentified to have negative impacts, the analysis of the impacts of the option\r\nserves to provide the most proportionate response to the problems identified. A\r\nnumber of modifications concern the improvement of clarity of the existing\r\nDirective without introducing new requirements that entail added cost. \nLegislative technique used\nThe proposal takes the form of a\r\nRegulation.\nThe proposed change from a Directive to a\r\nRegulation takes into account the Commission's general objective to simplify\r\nthe regulatory environment and the need to ensure a uniform implementation\r\nthroughout the Union of the proposed legislation.\nThe proposed Regulation is based on Article\r\n114 of the Treaty and aims to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market\r\nfor gas appliances. It imposes clear and detailed rules which will become\r\napplicable in a uniform manner at the same time throughout the Union.\nIn accordance with the\r\ntotal harmonisation principles, Member States are not allowed to impose more\r\nstringent or additional requirements in their national legislation for the\r\nplacing on the market of gas appliances. In particular, the mandatory essential\r\nrequirements and the conformity assessment procedures to be followed by\r\nmanufacturers must be identical in all Member States.\nThe same applies with\r\nregard to the provisions that have been introduced as a result from the\r\nalignment to the NLF Decision. Those provisions are clear and sufficiently\r\nprecise to be applied directly by the actors concerned.\nThe obligations\r\nprovided for the Member States, such as the obligation to assess, appoint and\r\nnotify the conformity assessment bodies are, in any case, not transposed as\r\nsuch into national law but implemented by the Member States by means of the\r\nnecessary regulatory and administrative arrangements. This will not change when\r\nthe obligations concerned are set out in a Regulation.\nTherefore, Member\r\nStates have almost no flexibility in transposing a Directive into their\r\nnational law. The choice of a Regulation will however allow them to save the\r\ncosts associated with the transposition of a Directive.\nAdditionally, a Regulation avoids the risk\r\nof possible diverging transpositions of a Directive by the different\r\nMember States, which might lead to different levels of safety protection and\r\ncreate obstacles to the internal market, undermining thus its effective\r\nimplementation.\nThe change from a\r\nDirective to a Regulation will not lead to any change in the regulatory\r\napproach.\nThe characteristics of\r\nthe New Approach will be fully preserved, in particular the flexibility given\r\nto manufacturers in the choice of the means employed to comply with the\r\nessential requirements and in the choice of the procedure used, amongst the\r\navailable conformity assessment procedures, to demonstrate compliance of gas\r\nappliances. The existing mechanisms supporting the implementation of the\r\nlegislation (standardisation process, working groups, administrative\r\ncooperation, the development of guidance documents etc.) will not be affected\r\nby the nature of the legal instrument.\nFurthermore, the choice of a Regulation\r\ndoes not mean that the decision-making process is centralised. Member States\r\nretain their competence e.g. as regards the designation and accreditation of\r\nnotified bodies, market surveillance and enforcement action and of defining\r\ntheir gas supply conditions as far as the gas qualities are not harmonised at\r\nUnion level.\nFinally, the use of\r\nRegulations in the area of internal market legislation, allows, in accordance\r\nalso with the preference expressed by stakeholders, to avoid the risk of \u2018gold\r\nplating\u2019. It also allows manufacturers to work directly with the Regulation\r\ntext instead of needing to identify and examine 28 transposition laws.\nOn this basis, it is\r\nconsidered that the choice of a Regulation is the most appropriate solution for\r\nall involved parties as it will allow a more rapid and coherent application of\r\nthe proposed legislation and will establish a clearer regulatory environment\r\nfor economic operators.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis proposal does not have any implication\r\nfor the Union budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nRepeal of existing legislation\nThe adoption of the proposal will lead to\r\nrepeal of Directive 2009/142/EC.\nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposal concerns the EEA and should\r\ntherefore be extended to the European Economic Area.\n2014/0136 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non appliances burning gaseous fuels\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[21],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2009/142/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council relating to appliances burning\r\ngaseous fuels[22]\r\nlays down rules for the placing on the market and the putting into service of\r\nappliances burning gaseous fuels.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2009/142/EC is\r\nbased on the New Approach principles, as set out in Council Resolution of 7 May\r\n1985 on a new approach to technical harmonisation and standards[23]. Thus, it sets out\r\nonly the essential requirements applying to appliances burning gaseous fuels,\r\nwhereas technical details are adopted by the European Committee for\r\nStandardisation (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical\r\nStandardisation (Cenelec) in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council on European Standardisation[24]. Conformity with the\r\nharmonised standards so set, the reference numbers of which are published in\r\nthe Official Journal of the European Union, provides a presumption of\r\nconformity with the requirements of Directive 2009/142/EC. Experience has shown\r\nthat those basic principles have worked well in this sector and should be\r\nmaintained and even further promoted.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience from the\r\nimplementation of Directive 2009/142/EC has shown the need to modify some of\r\nits provisions in order to clarify and update them and ensure thus legal\r\ncertainty as regards the definitions relating to its scope, the content of the Member\r\nStates' communications of their gas types and supply pressures and certain\r\nessential requirements.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As certain aspects of\r\nDirective 2009/142/EC should be revised and enhanced, in the interests of\r\nclarity that Directive should be repealed. Since the scope, essential\r\nrequirements and conformity assessment procedures must be identical in all\r\nMember States, there is almost no flexibility in transposing a Directive based\r\non the New Approach principles into national law. In order to simplify the regulatory\r\nframework, Directive 2009/142/EC should be replaced by a Regulation, which is\r\nthe appropriate legal instrument as it imposes clear and detailed rules which\r\ndo not give room for divergent transposition by Member States and ensures thus\r\na uniform implementation throughout the Union.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision No 768/2008/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council on a common framework for the\r\nmarketing of products [25]\r\nlays down a common framework of general principles and reference provisions\r\nintended to apply across the legislation harmonising the conditions for the\r\nmarketing of products in order to provide a coherent basis for revision or\r\nrecasts of that legislation. In order to ensure consistency with other sectoral\r\nproduct legislation, Directive 2009/142/EC should be adapted to that Decision. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council setting out the\r\nrequirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the\r\nmarketing of products [26]\r\nlays down horizontal provisions on the accreditation of conformity assessment\r\nbodies [,market surveillance of products and controls on products from third\r\ncountries,] and the CE marking.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No [\u2026/\u2026]\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[27]\r\n[on market surveillance of products] provides detailed rules on market\r\nsurveillance and on controls of products entering the Union from third\r\ncountries, including appliances burning gaseous fuels. It also sets out a\r\nsafeguard clause procedure. Member States should organise and carry out market\r\nsurveillance, appoint market surveillance authorities and specify their powers\r\nand duties. They should also set up general and sector-specific market\r\nsurveillance programs.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scope of Directive\r\n2009/142/EC should be maintained. This Regulation should apply to appliances\r\nburning gaseous fuels and to fittings incorporated into an appliance burning\r\ngaseous fuels. Appliances burning gaseous fuels are domestic and non-domestic\r\nappliances intended for a number of specified applications.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should aim\r\nto ensure the functioning of the internal market of appliances burning gaseous\r\nfuels and of fittings as regards the gas safety risks and energy efficiency.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should not\r\napply where other Union harmonisation legislation covers more specifically the aspects\r\ncovered by this Regulation. This includes the measures issued under Directive\r\n2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[28] establishing a\r\nframework for ecodesign requirements.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 6 of this\r\nRegulation prevents Member States from imposing stricter requirements on\r\nhealth, safety and energy conservation which would prohibit, restrict or impede\r\nthe making available on the market and the putting into service of appliances\r\nwhich comply with this Regulation. However, this provision does not affect the\r\npossibility for Member States, when implementing other EU Directives, to impose\r\nrequirements which affect the energy efficiency of products, including gas\r\nappliances, as long as such measures are compatible with the Treaty. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2009/28/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[29]\r\non the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources requires Member\r\nStates to introduce in their building regulations and codes appropriate measures\r\nin order to increase the share of all kinds of energy from renewable sources in\r\nthe building sector. Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil on the energy performance of buildings[30]\r\nrequires Member States to set minimum energy performance requirements for\r\nbuildings and building elements and system requirements in respect of the\r\noverall energy performance of the technical building systems which are\r\ninstalled in existing buildings. Directive 2012/27/EU of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council on energy efficiency [31]\r\nrequires Member States to take sufficient measures to progressively reduce\r\nenergy consumption in different areas including in buildings.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation does not\r\naffect the obligation for Member States to adopt national measures with respect\r\nto the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and to the energy efficiency\r\nof buildings in accordance with Directives 2009/28/EC 2010/31/EU and 2012/27/EU.\r\nIt is consistent with the objectives of these Directives that national measures\r\nmay in certain circumstances limit the installation of gas appliances which\r\ncomply with the rational use of energy requirement of this Regulation, provided\r\nthat such requirements do not constitute an unjustifiable market barrier. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should take\r\nthe necessary steps to ensure that appliances burning gaseous fuels are made\r\navailable on the market and put into service only where they do not compromise\r\nthe safety of persons, domestic animals and property, when normally used.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of this\r\nRegulation do not affect the Member States\u2019 entitlement to lay down rules\r\nconcerning commissioning or periodic inspections of appliances burning gaseous fuels\r\nin order to ensure their correct installation, use and maintenance.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of this\r\nRegulation do not affect the Member States\u2019 entitlement to lay down\r\nrequirements as they may deem necessary concerning installation aspects, space\r\nventilation conditions and aspects relating to the safety of the building itself\r\nand its energy performance, provided that those provisions do not impose design\r\nrequirements on appliances burning gaseous fuels.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As this Regulation does not\r\ncover such risks caused by appliances burning gaseous fuels in case of\r\nincorrect installation, maintenance or use, Member States are encouraged to\r\ntake measures to ensure that public is made aware of the risks related to combustion\r\nproducts and in particular to carbon monoxide.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although this Regulation does\r\nnot regulate the gas supply conditions in the Member States, it should take\r\ninto account the fact that different conditions as regards types of gas and\r\nsupply pressures are in force in the Member States in the absence of\r\nharmonisation of the technical characteristics of the gaseous fuel. The\r\ncomposition and specifications of the types of gas and the supply pressures at\r\nthe place where an appliance burning gaseous fuels is put into service is very\r\nimportant for its safe and correct functioning and therefore this aspect should\r\nbe taken into consideration already at the design phase of the appliance in\r\norder to ensure its compatibility with the gas type(s) and supply pressure(s)\r\nit is intended for.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid barriers\r\nto trade with regard to appliances burning gaseous fuels on grounds relating to\r\nthe fact that the gas supply conditions are not yet harmonised and ensure thus\r\na sufficient information of economic operators, Member States should\r\ncommunicate to the other Member States and to the Commission the gas types and\r\nsupply pressures used in their territory and any changes thereof in good time.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The communication of the\r\ngas types and supply pressures by Member States should contain the relevant\r\nnecessary information for economic operators. In this framework, the primary\r\nsource of the gaseous fuel supplied is not relevant for the characteristics,\r\nthe performance and the compatibility of appliances burning gaseous fuels with\r\nthe communicated gas supply conditions.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When determining the gas\r\nfamilies and gas groups used on their territory, Member States are encouraged\r\nto take into account the on-going standardisation work concerning gas qualities\r\nand ensure thus across the Union, a coherent and coordinated approach towards\r\nharmonisation of the gaseous fuels via standardisation.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When in accordance with\r\nDirective 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning\r\ncommon rules for the internal market in natural gas[32] and the on-going\r\nstandardisation work of CEN on the gas quality specifications, Member States take\r\nconcrete measures for a wider use of biogas by injecting such gas into the gas\r\ndistribution network or by distributing such gas through isolated systems, they\r\nshould ensure to timely update their communication of gas types in case the\r\nquality of the supplied gas does not remain within the already communicated\r\nquality range.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Member States\r\nestablish their national action plans in accordance with Directive 2009/28/EC\r\nin order to comply with their obligation to increase the percentage of renewables\r\nenergies and in particular biogas in the total energy consumption, they are encouraged\r\nto consider the possibilities of injecting such gases in the gas distribution\r\nnetwork.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should take\r\nthe necessary measures to ensure that the gas supply conditions do not\r\nconstitute barriers to trade and that they do not restrict the putting into\r\nservice of appliances burning gaseous fuels that are compatible with the local\r\ngas supply conditions.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Appliances burning gaseous\r\nfuels covered by this Regulation and complying with its provisions should\r\nbenefit from the principle of free movement of goods. Such appliances should be\r\nallowed to be put into service provided that they are compatible with the local\r\ngas supply conditions.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appliance category\r\nmarking indicated on the appliance data plate establishes a direct link with\r\nthe gas families and/or gas groups for which an appliance burning gaseous fuels\r\nhas been designed to burn safely at the desired performance level and thus ensures\r\nthe compatibility of the appliance with the local gas supply conditions.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The essential safety, health\r\nand rational use of energy requirements should be observed in order to ensure\r\nthat appliances burning gaseous fuels are safe when normally used at the desired\r\nperformance level.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The essential requirements\r\nshould be interpreted and applied so as to take account of the state of the art\r\nat the time of design and manufacture as well as of technical and economic\r\nconsiderations which are consistent with a high degree of health, safety\r\nprotection and rational use of energy.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic operators should\r\nbe responsible for the compliance of appliances burning gaseous fuels and of\r\nfittings with the requirements of this Regulation, in relation to their\r\nrespective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of\r\nprotection of public interests, such as health, safety, rational use of energy and\r\nthe protection of consumers and other users, domestic animals and property and\r\nto guarantee fair competition on the Union market.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All economic operators\r\nintervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate\r\nmeasures to ensure that they only make available on the market appliances\r\nburning gaseous fuels which are in conformity with this Regulation. It is\r\nnecessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations\r\nwhich correspond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and\r\ndistribution chain.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The manufacturer, having\r\ndetailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to\r\ncarry out the complete conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment\r\nshould therefore remain solely the obligation of the manufacturer.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The manufacturer should\r\nprovide sufficient and detailed information on the intended use of the\r\nappliance burning gaseous fuels so as to allow its correct and safe installation\r\nand putting into service, use and maintenance. Such information may need to\r\ninclude the technical specifications of the interface between the appliance and\r\nits installation environment.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\r\ncommunication between economic operators, national market surveillance\r\nauthorities and consumers, Member States should encourage economic operators to\r\ninclude a website address in addition to the postal address.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to ensure\r\nthat appliances burning gaseous fuels and fittings from third countries entering\r\nthe Union market comply with the requirements of this Regulation, and in\r\nparticular that appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried\r\nout by manufacturers with regard to those appliances and fittings. Provision\r\nshould therefore be made for importers to make sure that the appliances burning\r\ngaseous fuels and fittings they place on the market comply with the requirements\r\nof this Regulation and that they do not place on the market appliances and\r\nfittings which do not comply with such requirements or present a risk.\r\nProvision should also be made for importers to make sure that conformity\r\nassessment procedures have been carried out and that appliance marking and\r\ndocumentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the competent\r\nsupervisory authorities.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The distributor makes an\r\nappliance burning gaseous fuels or a fitting available on the market after it\r\nhas been placed on the market by the manufacturer or the importer and should\r\nact with due care to ensure that its handling of the appliance or fitting does\r\nnot adversely affect its compliance.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When placing on the market\r\nan appliance burning gaseous fuels or a fitting, every importer should indicate\r\non the appliance or fitting his name, registered trade name or registered trade\r\nmark and the postal address at which he can be contacted. Exceptions should be\r\nprovided for in cases where the size or nature of the appliance or fitting does\r\nnot allow it. This includes cases where the importer would have to open the\r\npackaging to put his name and address on the product.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any economic operator that\r\neither places an appliance burning gaseous fuels or a fitting on the market\r\nunder his own name or trademark or modifies an appliance burning gaseous fuels\r\nor a fitting in such a way that compliance with the requirements of this Regulation\r\nmay be affected should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume\r\nthe obligations of the manufacturer.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Distributors and importers,\r\nbeing close to the market place, should be involved in market surveillance\r\ntasks carried out by the competent national authorities, and should be prepared\r\nto participate actively, providing those authorities with all necessary\r\ninformation relating to the appliance burning gaseous fuels or fitting concerned.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ensuring traceability of an\r\nappliance burning gaseous fuels or a fitting throughout the whole supply chain\r\nhelps to make market surveillance simpler and more efficient. An efficient\r\ntraceability system facilitates market surveillance authorities' task of\r\ntracing economic operators who made non-compliant appliances burning gaseous\r\nfuels or fittings available on the market.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should be limited\r\nto the expression of the essential requirements. In order to facilitate\r\nconformity assessment with those requirements it is necessary to provide for\r\npresumption of conformity for appliances burning gaseous fuels or fittings which\r\nare in conformity with harmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on\r\nEuropean Standardisation[33]\r\nfor the purpose of expressing detailed technical specifications of those\r\nrequirements, especially with regard to the design, manufacture, operation, testing\r\nthe rational use of energy and installation of appliances burning gaseous fuels.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n1025/2012 provides for a procedure for objections to harmonised standards where\r\nthose standards do not entirely satisfy the requirements of this Regulation.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to enable economic\r\noperators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to ensure that appliances\r\nburning gaseous fuels or fittings made available on the market conform to the\r\nessential requirements, it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment\r\nprocedures. Decision No 768/2008/EC establishes modules for conformity\r\nassessment procedures, which include procedures from the least to the most\r\nstringent, in proportion to the level of risk involved and the level of safety\r\nrequired. In order to ensure inter-sectoral coherence and to avoid ad-hoc\r\nvariants, conformity assessment procedures should be chosen from among those\r\nmodules.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Manufacturers of appliances\r\nburning gaseous fuels should draw up an EU declaration of conformity to provide\r\ninformation required under this Regulation on the conformity of an appliance with\r\nthe requirements of this Regulation and of other relevant Union harmonisation\r\nlegislation.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure effective access\r\nto information for market surveillance purposes, the information required to\r\nidentify all applicable Union Acts for an appliance burning gaseous fuels should\r\nbe available in a single EU declaration of conformity.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Manufacturers of fittings\r\nshould issue a Fitting conformity certificate to provide information required\r\nunder this Regulation on the conformity of the fitting with the requirements of\r\nthis Regulation. In case the fitting is subject also to other Union\r\nharmonisation legislation, manufacturers of fittings should also, where relevant,\r\nissue an EU declaration of conformity in accordance with that legislation.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The CE marking, indicating\r\nthe conformity of an appliance burning gaseous fuels is the visible consequence\r\nof a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. General\r\nprinciples governing the CE marking and its relationship with other markings are\r\nset out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Rules governing the affixing of the CE\r\nmarking should be laid down in this Regulation.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fittings are not appliances\r\nburning gaseous fuels, but intermediate products made available between\r\nprofessionals and intended to be incorporated into an appliance. As the\r\nappropriate design of a fitting contributes to the correct and safe functioning\r\nof a finished appliance and as the gas related risks of an appliance can only\r\nbe assessed after incorporation of the fitting, it is appropriate that fittings\r\ndo not bear the CE marking.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A check of compliance of\r\nappliances burning gaseous fuels and of fittings with the essential\r\nrequirements provided for in this Regulation is necessary in order to provide\r\neffective protection for users and third parties.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\r\ncompliance of appliances burning gaseous fuels with the essential requirements,\r\nit is necessary to lay down appropriate conformity assessment procedures to be\r\nfollowed by the manufacturer. Those procedures should be set from the\r\nconformity assessment modules laid down in Decision No 768/2008/EC.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The conformity assessment\r\nprocedures set out in this Regulation require the intervention of conformity\r\nassessment bodies, which are notified by the Member States to the Commission.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience has shown that\r\nthe criteria set out in Directive 2009/142/EC that conformity assessment bodies\r\nhave to fulfil to be notified to the Commission are not sufficient to ensure a\r\nuniformly high level of performance of these bodies throughout the Union. It is, however, essential that all conformity assessment bodies perform their\r\nfunctions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition. That\r\nrequires the setting of obligatory requirements for conformity assessment\r\nbodies wishing to be notified in order to provide conformity assessment services.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a\r\nconsistent level of conformity assessment quality, it is also necessary to set\r\nrequirements for notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the\r\nassessment, notification and monitoring of notified bodies.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a conformity assessment\r\nbody demonstrates conformity with the criteria laid down in harmonised\r\nstandards, it should be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements\r\nset out in this Regulation.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The system set out in this Regulation\r\nshould be complemented by the accreditation system provided for in Regulation\r\n(EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an essential means of verifying the\r\ncompetence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be used for the\r\npurposes of notification.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transparent accreditation\r\nas provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of\r\nconfidence in conformity certificates, should be considered by the national\r\npublic authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating\r\nthe technical competence of conformity assessment bodies. However, national\r\nauthorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying\r\nout that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the\r\nappropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national\r\nauthorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the\r\nconformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory\r\nrequirements.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conformity assessment\r\nbodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the\r\nassessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to\r\nsafeguard the level of protection required for the appliances burning gaseous\r\nfuels to be placed on the Union market, it is essential that conformity\r\nassessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified\r\nbodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks.\r\nTherefore, it is important that the assessment of the competence and the\r\nperformance of bodies to be notified and the monitoring of bodies already\r\nnotified cover also activities carried out by subcontractors and subsidiaries.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to increase\r\nthe efficiency and transparency of the notification procedure and, in\r\nparticular, to adapt it to new technologies so as to enable online\r\nnotification.\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since conformity assessment\r\nbodies may offer their services throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give\r\nthe other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections\r\nconcerning a notified body. It is therefore important to provide for a period\r\nduring which any doubts or concerns as to the competence of conformity\r\nassessment bodies can be clarified before they start operating as notified\r\nbodies.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the interests of\r\ncompetitiveness, it is crucial that conformity assessment bodies apply the\r\nconformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for\r\neconomic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of\r\neconomic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity\r\nassessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through\r\nappropriate coordination and cooperation between conformity assessment bodies.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred to the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council laying down the rules for the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing\r\npowers[34].\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The advisory procedure\r\nshould be used for the adoption of implementing acts requesting the notifying Member State to take the necessary corrective measures in respect of notified bodies that\r\ndo not meet or no longer meet the requirements for their notification.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take into\r\naccount the technical developments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\r\n290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of\r\namendments to the content and the form of the Member State communications on\r\nthe gas supply conditions on their territory.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, when\r\npreparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely\r\nand appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament\r\nand to the Council.\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to provide\r\nfor transitional arrangements that allow the making available on the market or the\r\nputting into service of appliances burning gaseous fuels and fittings that have\r\nalready been placed on the market in accordance with Directive 2009/142/EC.\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should lay\r\ndown rules on penalties applicable to infringements to this Regulation and\r\nensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective,\r\nproportionate and dissuasive.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nRegulation, namely to ensure that appliances burning gaseous fuels on the\r\nmarket fulfil the requirements providing for a high level of protection of\r\nhealth and safety of users and protection of domestic animals or property and for\r\nrational use of energy, while guaranteeing the functioning of the internal\r\nmarket cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore,\r\nby reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the\r\nUnion may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as\r\nset out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle\r\nof proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go\r\nbeyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2009/142/EC\r\nshould therefore be repealed.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL\r\nPROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\n(1)
