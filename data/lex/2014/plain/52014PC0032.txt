The School Milk Scheme dates back to the\r\ncreation of the Common Market Organisation for milk in 1968 and has been\r\nactually implemented since 1977. The School Fruit Scheme is a more recent\r\nprogramme that came out as a political commitment in the context of the 2007\r\nreform of the Common Market Organisation for fruit and vegetables. The current\r\nschemes operate within different legal and financial frameworks, and have some\r\nimportant differences in their design and functioning.\nBoth school schemes were established in\r\norder to promote the consumption of fruit and vegetable and milk products,\r\nwhich are important sectors for the European agriculture, each representing\r\napproximately 15% of the value of European Union (EU) agricultural output.\r\nBesides their economic importance, they are beneficial in the public health\r\ncontext and are suitable for the distribution to school children.\nThe rationale which led to the\r\nestablishment of the two school schemes is still relevant in the current\r\ncontext of declining consumption of fruit and vegetables and milk products.\r\nDespite different health and agricultural promotion efforts both at the\r\nnational and EU level to increase the consumption, the declining trends have\r\nnot been reversed, particularly for fresh fruit and vegetables and drinking\r\nmilk. This situation is exacerbated amongst others by the modern consumption\r\ntrends towards highly processed foods which are often high in added sugars,\r\nsalt and fat, and will be boosted by younger age groups.\nDespite the positive embedding of the current\r\nschemes in schools and the acknowledgement of their relevance, conclusions\r\ndrawn from different reports and external evaluations highlight certain\r\nweaknesses in their design and inefficiencies in their functioning.\nThe CAP 2020 already contains important\r\nelements that are expected to solve some of the identified problems, in\r\nparticular through significant changes to the financing of the School Fruit\r\nScheme and strengthening of its educational dimension. The new requirement\r\nunder the Scholl Milk Scheme that participating Member States should draw up a\r\nstrategy will help focus the implementation of the scheme, as it is already the\r\ncase for School Fruit Scheme. However, the Commission CAP 2020 proposal was\r\nadopted before the external evaluations of the current schemes were finalised\r\nand it preceded also the European Court of Auditors (hereinafter ECA) report.\nObjectives of\r\nthe proposal\nThe proposal aims not only to address the\r\nendogenous problems inherent to the functioning of the schemes in order to\r\nincrease their efficiency and effectiveness, but it also aims at providing a\r\nmore unified policy response to ensure that they are capable of meeting the\r\nlong-term objectives and effectively respond to the external challenges. This\r\nis in line with the ECA recommendation that \"there should be greater\r\ncoordination and synergy between the two schemes in order to ensure a globally\r\nconsistent approach to nutrition and that the programmes are managed\r\nefficiently\". With this proposal, the Commission also responds to the\r\nreporting obligation stemming from Article 225(c) of the Regulation concerning\r\nthe possibility of extending the scope of the school schemes to include olive\r\noil and table olives.\nFirstly, the proposal aims to refocus the\r\ncurrent set-up towards the long-term objectives, with a view of strengthening\r\nthe educational dimensions of both schemes, and to contribute to reconnecting\r\nyoung citizens with food and its source, thus enhancing perceptions of\r\nagriculture and its products, the CAP and the EU. Currently, there is a gap\r\nbetween the design of the schemes and these objectives, as the latter are\r\naddressed differently in the two schemes. The educational dimension was built\r\ninto the School Fruit Scheme from the beginning, while the School Milk Scheme does\r\nnot oblige Member States to use specific educational measures, making the link\r\nbetween the products distributed and the scheme low. Furthermore, the\r\nevaluation and monitoring system of the School Milk Scheme is weak, while the\r\nsystem of the School Fruit Scheme needs improvements, which is important for\r\nmeasuring their medium- or long-term effectiveness.\nSecondly, the goal is to unify and\r\nconsolidate the current separate legal and financial frameworks and increase\r\nthe visibility of the EU intervention, in order to ensure a globally consistent\r\nCAP approach to school distribution and maximise the management efficiency. As\r\nthe current schemes have developed independently and in different time periods,\r\nthere is a lack of coordination and consistency between them, even though they\r\npursue similar objectives and target groups. The current fragmented system\r\nentails a multitude of different approaches and messages, which could\r\nnegatively impact the effectiveness of the regime as a whole. This problem\r\nstems from the different legal and financial frameworks, market differences\r\nbetween the products involved and decisions at Member State level on how to\r\nimplement the two schemes.\nLast but not the least, there is a need\r\nto increase the efficiency of the spending dedicated to the promotion of the\r\nconsumption of agricultural products in schools, where the financial\r\npotential of the schemes would be better targeted to maximise their impact and\r\nthe cost-effectiveness of distribution would be increased. Some of the current deficiencies\r\nare common (such as a high administrative and organisational burden), while\r\nothers are specific either for the School Fruit Scheme (most notably the\r\nunder-execution of around 30% of its potential as well as huge disparities in\r\nthe costs for products involved in the distribution) or for the School Milk Scheme\r\n(potential deadweight effect, low cost-benefit ratio).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe review of school schemes started in October\r\n2012. \nDuring the Impact Assessment process, a\r\npublic consultation was conducted, inviting interested parties to contribute to\r\nthe review. The public consultation process was based on a consultation\r\ndocument that was structured around 9 open-ended questions. The consultation\r\nran for 12 weeks and was conducted on the basis of an online questionnaire. In\r\naddition, separate meetings and hearings were organised in the course of the\r\nprocess, including stakeholders meeting on 15 March 2013.\nThe three scenarios elaborated in the Impact\r\nAssessment are 1) \"status quo\" option that maintains the separate\r\nframeworks for the school distribution but integrates the improvements made to\r\nthe school schemes by CAP 2020; 2) an \"adjustment\" scenario that explores\r\nwhether the objectives of the review could be achieved within the current separate\r\nsetting but through the measures/changes aimed at bridging the gap in the\r\neducational dimensions of the current schemes, increasing the synergies between\r\nthe two schemes, further simplification and improvements to the programmes\r\nbeyond CAP 2020; and 3) a \"new framework\" scenario that entails a\r\nconsiderable policy change in the form of common legal and financing framework\r\nfor the distribution of a restricted number of products, complemented by the\r\norientation towards the long-term objectives through the strengthened\r\neducational dimension of the scheme.\nOn the basis of the evaluations of the\r\ncurrent policy frameworks and the analysis of future challenges and needs, the\r\nimpact assessment evaluates and compares the impacts of these three alternative\r\npolicy scenarios against their potential to achieve the objectives, and in\r\nterms of effectiveness, efficiency and coherence with over-arching objectives:\n\u2013                        \r\nThe status quo scenario, with a strengthened School\r\nFruit Scheme, would further exacerbate the existing gaps in the educational\r\ndimension between the School Fruit Scheme and the School Milk Scheme and not\r\nbring much in terms of management efficiency. It also brings a limited contribution in providing a uniform and visible EU\r\nintervention. Whilst budgetary neutral, it contains certain budgetary uncertainty\r\nwith no limitation on the School Milk Scheme funding. It keeps the high level\r\nof administrative burden compared to the benefits (low cost-benefit), strong\r\nvariations in efficiency due to high disparities in costs of products for the School\r\nFruit Scheme and continued potential deadweight effect in the School Milk\r\nScheme. There are doubts whether this option could provide a suitable response\r\nto some of the emerging challenges related to the consumption patterns and demand\r\nfor fresh agricultural products. It has been seen as having a limited\r\ncontribution to horizontal objectives of better regulation and simplification,\r\nwhile it scores better with its potential in contributing to public health\r\nobjectives of reducing health inequalities through national strategies and\r\ntargeting.\n\u2013                        \r\nOn the other hand, the main impacts arising from\r\nthe adjustment option are expected to come through the strengthening of School\r\nMilk Scheme educational dimension and synergies in the implementation of both\r\nschemes, whilst keeping the current separate setting. This would provide better\r\ncontribution to the long-term objectives of sustainably increasing the demand\r\nthese agricultural products and shaping healthier eating habits. It is positive\r\nas regards the increased synergies but these are limited due to different\r\nfinancial arrangements between the schemes. Lower administrative burden brings\r\nmore benefits, lower complexity through synergies and common procedures.\n\u2013                        \r\nNew framework option shifts the focus of the\r\ncurrent school regime towards a set-up with measures that better fulfil the\r\nlong-term objectives of the schemes and it bridges the gaps in the design that\r\ncurrently exist between the two schemes. It furthermore gives greater\r\nflexibility to Member States to manage the school programme and focus their\r\nactions based on priority needs, with a necessary budgetary flexibility to\r\noperate between different financial entitlements and respond to changing\r\nsituations. Additionally, it is designed to give the greatest impact of school\r\nintervention within a fixed budget. It eliminates the uncertainties linked to\r\nthe EU budget, as it sets a fixed annual limit for the school intervention,\r\nwhich reflects the current (CAP 2020) absorption potential. With improved\r\nfinancing arrangements and conditions for participation, the existing potential\r\ncould be used with greater efficiency.\nOn this basis, the Impact Assessment\r\nconcludes that the \"new framework\" scenario is the most balanced in\r\nprogressively refocusing the school schemes regime towards the long-term goals,\r\nenabling them to better respond to the overarching problems of declining fruit\r\nand vegetable and milk consumption and rising obesity, and establishing a\r\ncritical link with agriculture a variety of its products.\nSimplification has been an important\r\nconsideration throughout the process and should be enhanced in several ways,\r\nmost of which will come notably through the simplification on the basis of\r\nCommission acts where certain requirements will be merged or removed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nIt is proposed to establish a common legal\r\nand financial framework for the distribution of fruit and vegetables and milk\r\nto children in schools, supported by strengthened educational measures to\r\nreaffirm the link with agriculture and a variety of its products, as well as\r\nwider issues such as public health and environmental matters. The new framework\r\nwould be budget neutral and would operate within the budget foreseen for the\r\nschools schemes under CAP 2020. The structure of the new scheme is built\r\nlargely on the existing elements of the two schemes which are considered as\r\nwell-functioning and efficient.\nThe proposal is based on Articles 42 and 43(2)\r\nof the Treaty. It complies with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality\r\nwhereby the framework for action and the basic principles are set at the EU\r\nlevel, whilst Member States still have the leeway to tailor the scheme based on\r\ntheir priorities and in line with national/regional specificities, and to set\r\ntheir targets and implementation modalities.\nThe key elements of the new proposal are\r\nthe following:\n\u2013                        \r\nRefocus the distribution: it is proposed to focus\r\nthe distribution of products in schools to two \"core products\": fresh\r\nfruit and vegetables (including bananas) and drinking milk only, with the fat\r\ncontent of drinking milk to be decided upon by national health authorities.\r\nThis focus would be beneficial for several reasons, especially since the\r\ndistribution would take place within a fixed budget, it would reduce\r\norganisational burden for schools, and is in line with the need to help reverse\r\nthe declining consumption trends for these two groups of products.\r\nAdditionally, this would be in line with the overall practice, as fresh fruit\r\nand vegetables and drinking milk are the most distributed products under the\r\ncurrent schemes. However, Member States could include also a wider variety of\r\nagricultural products in the framework of the thematic educational measures.\n\u2013                        \r\nUnify the financial provisions and improve\r\nfinancing conditions in order to increase the efficiency of spending:\n\u2013              \r\nConsidering the differences between the products\r\nand their supply chains, as well as the different consumption situation across\r\nthe Member States, separate \"envelopes\" would be allocated to Member States for fruit and vegetables (including bananas) and milk. An envelope for the fruit\r\nand vegetables in line with the CAP 2020 budget (EUR 150 million) and an\r\nenvelope for milk corresponding to the expected use of funds (EUR 80 million). Certain\r\nflexibility would be provided for, where Member States could transfer limited\r\nshares of their allocations between the envelopes based on their needs\r\n(prioritising of intervention through strategies). Within those envelopes,\r\nthresholds would be established for supporting measures and other eligible\r\nmeasures, such as evaluation, monitoring and communication.\n\u2013              \r\nBased on the experience so far, the level of EU\r\ncontribution towards the price of products would be limited through a maximum\r\nEU aid per portion for fruit and vegetables and for milk, and not through the\r\nEU co-financing levels as was so far the case for the School Fruit Scheme. This\r\nwould be a new element for fruit and vegetables, which would help alleviate the\r\nhuge disparities in the price for products distributed and would imply a\r\nsimplification in terms of a management. The level of EU subsidy for the milk\r\nwould be increased in order to reduce the deadweight effect (by enabling the\r\ndistribution free of charge or close to it) and increase the cost-benefit of\r\ndistribution. These elements of the proposal respond to the commitment\r\nundertaken by the Commission[2]\r\nin the context of the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013[3] to review the financing\r\narrangements of the current schemes, namely the aid for the distribution of\r\nmilk as well as the co-financing of the school fruit scheme costs. Member States\r\nwill be allowed to continue providing national top-ups or attract private\r\nfunding in order to enlarge the scope and/or the intensity of their intervention\r\nof the school schemes.\n\u2013                        \r\nReinforce the educational dimension: supporting\r\neducational measures would become a requirement also for the milk distribution,\r\nthus bridging the gap between the current schemes. These measures would have a\r\nstrong educational dimension, with a focus on agricultural issues,\r\nnutrition/health (balanced diets) and environment maters. In addition, they\r\nwould provide a critical instrument to (re)connect the children with food,\r\nagricultural production and farmers. Educational measures should target the\r\nschool population and if possible involve the family and community as well and\r\naddress the wider issue of the existing offer of healthy options of food and\r\nbeverages at schools. They are useful as evidence shows that many children grow\r\nup not knowing where their food comes from \u2013 where and how it is produced and what\r\nare products of certain seasons. Member States could therefore choose thematic\r\neducational measures that could occasionally include also agricultural\r\nproducts, other than the two core products, such as for example yoghurts,\r\nprocessed fruit and vegetables, honey, olive oil, and similar. The list of all\r\nproducts supplied under the scheme and their nutritional aspects have to be\r\napproved by national health authorities. Supporting educational measures would\r\nhave to be directly linked to the agricultural objectives of the scheme and be\r\nin line with the objective of promoting healthy diets.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe impact of the proposal is budgetary\r\nneutral compared to the status quo. For fruit and vegetables, the budgetary\r\nceiling currently set in the Regulation No 1308/2013 (EUR 150 million per\r\nschool year) is maintained in this proposal. For milk, the proposal includes an\r\nenvelope of EUR 80 million per school year, corresponding to the expected budget\r\nexecution and in line with the overall amounts for market-related expenditure\r\nand direct aids taken into account in the Multiannual Financial Framework\r\n2014-2020. \nAs regards the distribution of expenditure,\r\nthe highest support will be given to the distribution and supporting\r\neducational measures. Other costs, such as evaluation, monitoring and\r\ncommunication, will also be eligible to a more limited extent. The ceilings for\r\nthe costs of supporting educational measures and for other related costs will\r\nbe set by the Commission in light of the experience with the current\r\nprogrammes.\nDetails on the budgetary\r\nand financial implications are provided in the legislative financial statement\r\naccompanying the proposal.\n2014/0014 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1306/2013 as regards the aid scheme for the supply of fruit\r\nand vegetables, bananas and milk in the educational establishments\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 42 and 43(2)\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[5],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section 1 of Chapter II of\r\nTitle I of Part II of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council[6]\r\nprovides for a school fruit and vegetables scheme including bananas and a school\r\nmilk scheme.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The experience gained with\r\nthe application of the current schemes, together with the conclusions of the\r\nexternal evaluations and subsequent analysis of different policy options, point\r\nto the conclusion that the rationale which led to the establishment of the two\r\nschool schemes is still relevant. In the current context of declining\r\nconsumption of fruit and vegetables including bananas and milk products,\r\nexacerbated by amongst other things, the modern trend towards the consumption\r\nof highly processed foods which, additionally, are often high in added sugars,\r\nsalt and fat, the Union aid to finance the supply to children in educational\r\nestablishments of selected agricultural products should therefore continue to exist.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The analysis of different\r\npolicy options points out that a unified approach under a common legal and\r\nfinancial framework is more appropriate and effective in meeting the specific\r\nobjectives that the Common Agricultural Policy is pursuing through school\r\nschemes. This would allow Member States to maximise the impact of distribution\r\nwithin a constant budget and increase the management efficiency. However, in\r\norder to take into account the differences between the fruit and vegetables including\r\nbananas and milk products and their supply chains, certain elements should\r\nremain separate, such as the respective budgetary envelopes. In light of the experience\r\nwith the current schemes, the participation in the scheme should continue to be\r\nvoluntary for Member States. Taking into the account the different consumption\r\nsituations across Member States, the possibility should be given to\r\nparticipating Member States to choose whether they want to distribute all or\r\njust one of the products eligible for the supply to children in educational\r\nestablishments.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A trend of declining consumption\r\nin particular of fresh fruit and vegetables including bananas and drinking milk\r\nhas been identified. It is therefore appropriate to focus the distribution under\r\nthe school schemes on these products. This would in turn also help reduce the\r\norganisational burden for schools, increase the impact of the distribution\r\nwithin a limited budget and would be in line with the current practice, as\r\nthese products are most frequently distributed.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Educational measures that\r\nsupport the distribution are necessary in order to make the scheme effective in\r\nreaching its short- and long-term objectives of increasing the consumption of\r\nselected agricultural products and shaping healthier diets. Considering their\r\nimportance, these measures should support both the fruit and vegetables including\r\nbananas and milk distribution. They should be eligible for the Union aid. As\r\nsupporting measures they represent a critical tool to reconnect children with\r\nagriculture and its different products and to meet the objectives that the\r\nscheme is pursuing, Member States should be allowed to include a wider variety\r\nof agricultural products into their thematic measures. However, so as to\r\npromote healthy eating habits, the national health authorities should be\r\ninvolved in this process and approve the list of these products, as well as the\r\ntwo groups of products eligible for the distribution, and decide on their\r\nnutritional aspects.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a sound\r\nbudgetary management, a fixed ceiling of the Union aid towards the distribution\r\nof fruit and vegetables including bananas and milk, supporting educational\r\nmeasures and related costs should be provided for. This ceiling should reflect\r\nthe current situation. In light of the experience gained and with a view to simplify\r\nthe management, the financing models should be approximated and based on a\r\nsingle approach as regards the level of Union financial contribution. It is\r\ntherefore appropriate to limit the level of Union aid towards the price of\r\nproducts through a maximum Union aid per portion both for fruit and vegetables including\r\nbananas and milk and abolish the principle of obligatory co-financing for fruit\r\nand vegetables including bananas. Considering the price volatility of products\r\nin question, the power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the Commission\r\nin respect of measures setting the levels of the Union aid towards the price of\r\na portion of products and laying down the definition of a portion.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\r\nefficient and targeted use of Union funds, the power to adopt certain acts should\r\nbe delegated to the Commission in respect of measures fixing the indicative\r\nallocations of the Union aid to each Member State and the methods for\r\nreallocating aid between Member States on the basis of aid requests received. The\r\nindicative allocations should be fixed separately for the fruit and vegetables including\r\nbananas and milk in line with the voluntary approach to distribution. The\r\nallocation key for fruit and vegetables including bananas should reflect the current\r\nallocations by Member States, based on the objective criteria of the number of\r\nchildren in the age group of six- to ten-year olds as a proportion of the\r\npopulation, taking into the account also the development status of regions\r\nconcerned. In order to allow Member States to maintain the scale of their\r\ncurrent programmes and with a view of encouraging others to take up the\r\ndistribution of milk, it is appropriate to use the combination of two keys for\r\nthe allocation of the funds for milk, namely the historical use of funds by\r\nMember States under the School Milk Scheme and the objective criteria of the\r\nnumber of children in the age group of six- to ten-year olds as a proportion of\r\nthe population used for the fruit and vegetables including bananas. In order to\r\nfind the right proportion for these two keys, the power to adopt certain acts\r\nshould be delegated to the Commission in respect of adopting additional rules\r\nconcerning the balance between the two criteria. Furthermore, considering the\r\nrecurrent changes in the demographic or development situation of regions in\r\nMember States, the power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the\r\nCommission in respect of assessing every three years whether the Member States'\r\nallocations, based on those criteria, are still up to date.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow the\r\nMember States with a limited demographic size to implement a cost effective\r\nscheme, the power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the Commission\r\nin respect of setting the minimum amount of the Union aid that Member States\r\nare entitled to receive for fruit and vegetables including bananas and milk.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the interest of sound\r\nadministration and budget management, Member States wishing to participate in\r\nthe distribution of fruit and vegetables including bananas and/or milk should\r\napply every year for the Union aid. With a view of simplifying the procedures\r\nand management, this application should be done on the basis of separate aid\r\nrequests. Following the requests of the Member States, the Commission should\r\ndecide on the definitive allocations for fruit and vegetables including bananas\r\nand milk within the appropriations available in the budget and after taking\r\ninto account limited transfers between their allocations, which encourage\r\nprioritising of distribution based on the nutritional needs, The power to adopt\r\ncertain acts should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the measures setting\r\nthe conditions and the limits concerning these transfers.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The national strategy should\r\nbe considered as the condition for the Member State's participation in the\r\nscheme and as a strategic multiannual document, setting out targets to be\r\nachieved by Member States and their priorities.

It also aims\r\nto contribute to the wider public health objectives of reducing overweight and\r\nobesity, and diet-related diseases by shaping the sustainable healthy eating\r\nhabits.\n1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific objective(s) and\r\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \nSpecific objective: To improve access to food for sensitive social\r\ngroups\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned: 05 02 \"Interventions in\r\nagricultural markets\"\n1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected result(s) and\r\nimpact\nThe proposal is expected to change the knowledge,\r\nattitudes and preferences of young citizens towards food and its source, and\r\ntheir perceptions of agriculture and its products.\nIt is also expected to increase the cost-effectiveness of\r\nthe distribution of products by better targeting the EU aid. \nMoreover it would increase the part of the budget spent\r\non accompanying measures thus improving their impact on the target group\r\nconsumption and bridging the gap between the educational dimensions of the\r\nSchool Fruit Scheme (SFS) and School Milk Scheme (SMS).\nFinally it would also lead to a common framework per Member State and to increase the visibility of the EU intervention.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\r\nimpact \nThree levels of indicators have been set regarding the\r\nobjectives:\nImpact indicators:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change in direct and indirect consumption\r\nof fresh F&V by children after 5 years of intervention\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change direct and indirect consumption of\r\ndrinking milk by children after 5 years of intervention\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Improvement in overall dietary quality\nMain results indicators:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 % of the budget available spent on\r\naccompanying measures\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 % of supporting measures implemented\r\nrelated to agriculture and agricultural products\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Efficiency level of spending for the promotion\r\nof consumption of agricultural products in schools\nMain output indicators:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of accompanying measures implemented\r\nin Member States (MS)\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of children involved in accompanying\r\nmeasures and share of total participating\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MS Number of agri-related accompanying\r\nmeasures\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cost per portion\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of participating MS, schools and\r\nchildren\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volumes of products distributed at school\r\n(number of portions of F&V and milk)\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nThe needs underpinning the proposal are the need to sustainably\r\nincrease the consumption of fruit and vegetables and milk in children and the\r\nneed to shape their healthy eating habits.\nCAP school schemes as currently implemented have certain weaknesses\r\nin their design and deficiencies in their functioning that need to be\r\naddressed, which limit their potential in achieving the objectives of promoting\r\nthe consumption of agricultural products (market objective) and healthy diets\r\nwith school children (health objective). \nThe problems identified concern the gap between the design of the\r\nschemes and their objectives (different educational tools under the two\r\nschemes), the lack of coordination and consistency between the two schemes and\r\nthe deficiencies limiting the immediate impact of spending (high administrative\r\nand organizational burden on both schemes, budgetary under-execution of 30% in\r\nSFS, potential deadweight effect and low cost-benefit ratio in SMS).\nThe drivers are mainly linked to the regulatory failures, different\r\nfinancial framework, different implementation in Member States and to some\r\nexternal factors.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nThe action at EU level provides the funding necessary for\r\ninitiatives across EU and additional sources of financing which permit Member\r\nStates to expand the scope of their actions and increase their effectiveness.\r\nIf Member States would have to rely exclusively on their own financial\r\nresources, most of them would not be in a position to implement ambitious\r\ninitiatives. It also contributes to greater credibility of the schemes in\r\nMember States and improvement of the EU image and awareness. An EU framework\r\nhas an added value in facilitating continuous knowledge, transparency,\r\nexperience transfer and exchange.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThere are currently two EU-funded school distribution programmes\r\nunder the remit of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that specifically\r\ntarget children in school settings, namely the School Milk Scheme (SMS) and the\r\nSchool Fruit Scheme (SFS). Both schemes share a mutual aim to increase, on a\r\nlasting basis, the share of these products in children's diets at an early\r\nstage when their eating habits are being formed, thus contributing to the CAP\r\nobjectives, in particular stabilising markets and ensuring the demand in the\r\nlong run. Additionally, the schemes are in line with the wider public health\r\nobjectives as they contribute in shaping the sustainable healthy eating habits.\r\n\nHowever, despite this positive embedding in schools and recognition\r\nof their potential, conclusions drawn from different reports - in particular\r\nthe external evaluations of the SFS and the SMS, initiated by the Commission,\r\nand the special report No 10/2011 of the European Court of Auditors - and\r\nexperience after years of implementation, have identified the need to make\r\nfurther improvements to both schemes to increase their management efficiency\r\nand effectiveness. The recent agreement on the reform of the CAP already\r\naddressed also some of the problems identified.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nTaking into due account sectorial specificities the proposal is\r\ncompatible with the promotion of agricultural products. It is also in line with\r\npublic health objectives (weight management, health inequalities), simplification\r\nand with principles and targets as formulated in the Europe 2020 Strategy. \n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \nX Proposal/initiative\r\nof unlimited duration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\r\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) planned[10] \n\u00a8 Direct management by the Commission\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 by its departments, including by its staff in the Union\r\ndelegations; \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 by the executive agencies; \nX Shared\r\nmanagement with the Member States \n\u00a8 Indirect management by delegating implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial\r\nRegulation;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the\r\nextent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\r\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic\r\nact.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nIn the new scheme monitoring and evaluation are included in the\r\ncosts eligible for the EU aid due to their importance for sound management and\r\nassessment of its effectiveness/efficiency towards the objectives identified.\r\nThe link with a multiannual (6 years) national/regional strategy is also\r\nestablished.\nThe monitoring will be carried out on the basis of the annual MS\r\nreports containing information on the budget used, the number of\r\nschool/children participating and the share of the total number of\r\nschool/children of the target group, the distribution frequency, duration, time\r\nand system, the average weight and price per portion, the average consumption\r\nper child and the total quantities distributed. Furthermore, the accompanying\r\nmeasures will be also monitored as concerns the methods used and their cost,\r\nfrequency, participating school/children, involvement of stakeholders, products\r\ndistributed.\nThe evaluation process will consist of MS evaluation reports after 5\r\nyears of implementation of the scheme to measure medium-term impacts, followed\r\nby an external EU wide evaluation one year after the MS evaluations, to assess\r\nthe implementation of the scheme at MS and EU level and assess overall\r\neffectiveness, efficiency, coherence and relevance in accordance with\r\nCommission evaluation standards and guidelines. Moreover, an external study on\r\nlong-term impact indicators could be envisaged.\nThe external evaluations of the SFS and SMS and the Court of\r\nAuditors Special report No 10/2011 on these schemes have been clearly taken\r\ninto due consideration for the design of the monitoring and evaluation\r\nprocesses relating to the new scheme. \n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\r\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThe general risk that can be identified relates to the effectiveness\r\nof the scheme, i.e. that the EU aid reaches the final beneficiaries of the\r\nscheme and effectively contribute towards reaching the scheme's objectives.\nBased on the current experience from the SFS, particular attention\r\nshould be given to the selection of aid applicants and to procurement\r\nprocedures used for awarding contracts for distribution, publicity, monitoring\r\nand evaluation. Control provisions shall also cover the implementation of the\r\nsaid contracts. Public procurement is a potential issue for the School Scheme.\nFor other risks, as the possible deadweight effect and excessive\r\ncost of products distributed or margin for suppliers, provisions can be\r\nforeseen (e.g. on the level of EU-aid per portion).\nAs concerns the accompanying measures, there could be a risk of\r\noverlapping with educational measures provided in schools and with promotion of\r\nagricultural products. To avoid this, the definition of these measures will\r\ninvolve an EU scientific expert group and their link with the objectives of the\r\nnew scheme will be clearly stated. Control provisions related to accompanying\r\nmeasures shall address the genuineness of expenditure in general, providing\r\nassurance also where those measures are outsourced.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information concerning the\r\ninternal control system set up\nPaying agencies and delegated control bodies at Member State level form the control system.\nMS annual reports on controls and checks, based on those already in\r\nuse for the current SFS and SMS, will be necessary, to provide details on the\r\nadministrative management and on-the-spot checks implemented. \nMoreover, the internal management and control system will make use\r\nof the monitoring and evaluation reports from Member States and of the EU-wide\r\nevaluation. Finally, an EU scientific expert group will provide MS and the\r\nCommission with advice on implementation, monitoring and evaluation. \n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimate of the costs and\r\nbenefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \nThe school scheme will be covered by the existing system of\r\nmanagement and control for EAGF expenditure.\nIt is considered that the proposal will not lead to an increase in\r\nthe error rate for the EAGF.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\r\nand irregularities \nRegulation (EU) No 1306/2013 on the financing, management, and\r\nmonitoring of the CAP will apply.\nIn general, control systems provide for exhaustive administrative\r\ncontrols of 100% of aid requests, cross-checks with other databases where this\r\nis considered appropriate, as well as on-the-spot checks before payment for a\r\nminimum number of transactions, depending on the risk associated to the regime\r\nin question. If these checks reveal a high number of irregularities, additional\r\nchecks must be carried out.\nThe legislative package to reform the CAP further provides that\r\nMember States shall prevent, detect and correct irregularities and fraud,\r\nimpose effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties, in accordance with\r\nUnion legislation or national law and recover any irregular payments plus\r\ninterests. It includes an automatic clearance mechanism for irregularity cases,\r\nwhich provides that where the recovery has not taken place within four years\r\nfrom the date of the recovery request, or within eight years if legal\r\nproceedings are initiated, the amounts not recovered shall be borne by the Member State concerned. This mechanism strongly encourages Member States to recover\r\nirregular payments as quickly as possible. \nAt the initial stage of the new scheme and although a formal EU\r\napproval is not foreseen for the MS strategies, provisions on their content\r\n(and possibly a template) will allow for possible early fraud risk\r\nidentification and prevention.\nDuring the implementation, requests for legal interpretation or\r\nadvice from the Commission and/or the EU scientific expert group will also help\r\nMS to avoid fraud. \nIn addition, ex post checks and a robust follow-up of any\r\nallegations of fraudulent abuse of the scheme will be performed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL\r\nIMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      Existing budget lines \nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n   || Diff./non-diff.
