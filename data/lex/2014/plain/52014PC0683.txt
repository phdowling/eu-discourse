At the end of the negotiations a new draft protocol was initialled by the\r\nnegotiators on 19 June 2014. The new Protocol\r\ncovers a period of four years from the date of provisional application laid\r\ndown in Article 15 \u2013 i.e. from the date of its signature and\r\n1 January 2015 at the earliest.\nThe primary\r\nobjective of the Protocol to the Agreement is to grant fishing opportunities to\r\nEU vessels in the fishing zone of the Republic of Madagascar, in line with the\r\nmanagement measures adopted by the relevant Regional Fisheries Management\r\nOrganisation, namely the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and where\r\nrelevant, in keeping within the limits of the available surplus. The Commission\r\nbased itself in part on the results of an ex-post evaluation carried out by\r\nexternal experts.\nThe general\r\nobjective is to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Madagascar, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a\r\nsustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the\r\nfishing zone of the Republic of Madagascar, in the interests of both parties.\nMore specifically, the\r\nProtocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories:\n\u00b7      40 tuna seiners;\n\u00b7      32 surface longliners with a tonnage greater than 100 GT;\n\u00b7      22 surface longliners with a tonnage less than or equal to 100 GT.\nThe Commission proposes, on this basis,\r\nthat the Council, with the consent of the Parliament, adopt this new Protocol\r\nby Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe interested parties were consulted\r\nduring the evaluation of the Protocol for the period 2013-14. Experts from the\r\nMember States were also consulted in technical meetings. These consultations\r\nled to the conclusion that it would be beneficial to maintain a fishing\r\nprotocol with the Republic of Madagascar.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThis procedure is being initiated in\r\nparallel with the procedures relating to the Council Decision adopting the\r\nprovisional application of the Protocol itself, as well as with the Council\r\nRegulation concerning the allocation of the fishing opportunities between EU\r\nMember States.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe annual financial contribution, which is\r\nEUR 1 566 250 for each of the first two years of the Protocol\r\nand EUR 1 487 500 for each of the following two years, is based\r\non: a) a reference tonnage of 15 750 tonnes linked to access, for an\r\nannual amount of EUR 866 250 for each of the first two years of the\r\nProtocol and EUR 787 500 for each of the following two years and b)\r\nsupport for the development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Republic of\r\nMadagascar, amounting to EUR 700 000 per year. This support meets the\r\nobjectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the needs of the Republic of   Madagascar in the fight against illegal fishing.\n2014/0319 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion of the Protocol setting\r\nout the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in\r\nthe Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of   Madagascar\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and (7) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[2],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 November 2007\r\nthe Council adopted Council Regulation (EC) No 31/2008[3] on the conclusion of\r\nthe Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of   Madagascar.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nEuropean Union has negotiated with Madagascar a new protocol to the partnership agreement\r\ngranting European Union vessels fishing possibilities in the fishing zone over\r\nwhich Madagascar has jurisdiction.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Decision No \u2026/2013/EU[4], the Council authorised\r\nthe signing and provisional application of the Protocol, without prejudice to\r\nits later conclusion.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 9 of the\r\npartnership agreement establishes a Joint Committee to monitor the\r\nimplementation, interpretation and application of the Agreement and to\r\nreassess, where necessary, the level of fishing opportunities and,\r\nconsequently, of the financial contribution.

proposal/initiative \nThe\r\nnegotiation and conclusion of fisheries agreements with third countries meets\r\nthe general objective of giving EU fishing vessels access to fishing zones\r\nunder the jurisdiction of third countries and developing partnerships with\r\nthose countries with a view to strengthening the sustainable exploitation of\r\nfishery resources outside EU waters.\nThe\r\nSustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) also ensure consistency\r\nbetween the principles governing the Common Fisheries Policy and the\r\ncommitments made under other European policies (sustainable use of\r\nthird-country resources, combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU)\r\nfishing, integration of partner countries into the global economy and better\r\npolitical and financial governance of fisheries).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.4.2\u00a0 Specific objective(s) and

interests of the European\r\nfisheries sector and consumers by negotiating and concluding FPAs with coastal\r\nstates, consistent with other European policies.\nABM/ABB\r\nactivity(ies) concerned\nTo\r\nestablish a governance framework for fishing activities carried out by Union\r\nfishing vessels in third country waters (SFAs) (budget line 11.03.01).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.4.3\u00a0 Expected result(s) and impact\nThe conclusion\r\nof the Protocol will help maintain fishing opportunities for EU vessels in the\r\nfishing zone of the Republic of Madagascar.\nThe\r\nProtocol will also contribute to better management and conservation of fishery\r\nresources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation\r\nof programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular\r\nas regards monitoring and combating illegal fishing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.4.4\u00a0 Indicators of results and impact \nRates of\r\nutilisation of fishing opportunities (uptake of

on 31 December 2014. It is\r\nintended that the new Protocol will apply provisionally as of 1 January\r\n2015. To secure continuity of fishing operations, a procedure for adoption by\r\nthe Council of a decision on the signature and provisional application of the\r\nProtocol has been launched in parallel with this procedure.\nThe new\r\nProtocol will provide a framework for the fishing activities of the European\r\nUnion fleet in the Republic of Madagascar's fishing zone and will allow\r\nEuropean vessel owners to apply for fishing authorisations allowing them to\r\nfish in the Malagasy fishing zone. In addition, the\r\nnew Protocol enhances cooperation between the EU and the Republic of Madagascar, with a view to promoting the development of a sustainable fishing policy. It\r\nprovides, in particular, for vessels to be monitored via VMS and for the\r\nelectronic transmission of catch data. Until the relevant IT systems become\r\noperational, the transmission of catch data and fishing effort, via the usual\r\nchannels, will be more frequent. Sectoral support has been strengthened to help\r\nthe Republic of Madagascar meet its international obligations in terms of the\r\nState\u2019s responsibility to ensure monitoring of ports.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.5.2\u00a0 Added value of EU involvement\nAs far as\r\nthis new Protocol is concerned, failure to act by the EU would allow the\r\nemergence of private agreements, which would not help strengthen the capacity\r\nof the third country in question to ensure governance for the fishing sector, and\r\nwould provide less of a guarantee as to the sustainability of fishing\r\nactivities. The European Union also hopes that with this Protocol, the Republic of   Madagascar will continue to cooperate effectively with the EU particularly as\r\nregards the management of fishery resources and the fight against illegal\r\nfishing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.5.3\u00a0 Lessons learned from similar experiences\r\nin the past\nThe\r\nunder-use of fishing possibilities made available to certain segments of the\r\nEuropean fleet under the previous protocol has resulted in the parties reducing\r\nfishing possibilities in these categories. The share of the contribution paid\r\nto the partner third country in exchange for access, by EU economic operators,\r\nhas increased, whilst the EU share has reduced, in accordance with the\r\nprinciple adopted by the CFP reform applied in other protocols recently\r\nnegotiated in the Indian Ocean. Sectoral support has been strengthened to take\r\ninto account programmes previously implemented and to reflect the needs of the Republic of   Madagascar\u2019s fisheries administration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.5.4\u00a0 Compatibility and possible synergy with\r\nother appropriate instruments\nFunds paid\r\nout under SFPAs constitute fungible revenue in the budgets of the third-country\r\npartners. However, the conclusion and monitoring of SFPAs is subject to the\r\ncondition that some of these funds be assigned to the implementation of\r\nmeasures forming part of the country\u2019s sectoral policy. These financial\r\nresources are compatible with other sources of funding from other providers of\r\ninternational funding for carrying out projects and/or programmes at national\r\nlevel in the fisheries sector.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and\r\nfinancial impact \nProposal/initiative of limited duration \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect\r\nfrom 1.1.2015 until 31.12.2018.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial impact from 2015 to\r\n2018\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management\r\nmethod(s) envisaged \nDirect management by the Commission\nBy its departments, including by its staff in\r\nthe Union delegations;\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and\r\nreporting rules \nThe\r\nCommission (DG MARE, in collaboration with its fisheries counsellor in Mauritius and the European Union\u2019s Delegation in Madagascar) will ensure regular monitoring of the\r\nimplementation of this Protocol, particularly as regards operators\u2019 use of\r\nfishing opportunities and in terms of catch data. \nThe\r\nSustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement provides for at least one annual\r\nmeeting of the Joint Committee, at which the Commission and the third country\r\nconcerned review the implementation of the Agreement and the Protocol thereto\r\nand, if necessary, adjust the programming and, where applicable, the financial\r\ncontribution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and\r\ncontrol system \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.2.1\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThere is\r\nsome risk in setting up a fisheries protocol, particularly with regard to the\r\namounts intended to finance the sectoral fisheries policy (under-programming).\r\nThese difficulties were not encountered with the Republic of Madagascar during the implementation of the 2013-14 Protocol.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.2.2\u00a0 Control method(s) envisaged \nTo avoid\r\nthese risks, extensive dialogue is planned on the programming and\r\nimplementation of the sectoral policy.

The masters of the vessels shall therefore take measures necessary to avoid any accidental catches of elasmobranch species. \n 1.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By-catches: \n IOTC recommendations complied with \n 2 - Fees to be paid by vessel owners/catch equivalent: \n Fee to be paid by vessel owners per tonne caught || EUR 60/tonne during the first two years of the application of the Protocol EUR 70/tonne during the last two years of the application of the Protocol. \n Annual flat-rate advance fees to be paid by vessel owners: || EUR 11 400/year per tuna seiner during the first two years and EUR 13 300 /year during the last two years, in respect of 190 tonnes; EUR 3 600/year per surface longliner vessel > 100 GT for the first two years and 4 200 EUR/year for the last two years, in respect of 60 tonnes; EUR 2 400/year per surface longliner vessel\u00a0 \u2264  100 GT for the first two years and 2 800 EUR/year for the last two years, in respect of 40 tonnes; \n Number of vessels authorised to fish || 40 seiner vessels 32 surface longliner vessels > 100 GT 22 surface longliner vessels \u2264 100 GT \n 3 \u2013 Miscellaneous \n Fee per support vessel: EUR 3 500 per vessel \n Seamen: Tuna seiners: at least 2 seamen on board during the fishing season in the fishing zone of Madagascar will have Malagasy nationality. Surface longliners: At least 1 seaman on board during the fishing season in Madagascar\u2019s fishing zone will have Malagasy nationality. Vessel owners shall endeavour to take on board additional seamen of Malagasy nationality. \n Observers: \u00a7  European Union fishing vessels shall, at the request of the authorities of Madagascar, take on board one observer in order to reach the cover rate of 10% of vessels authorised to fish in the Malagasy fishing zone. However, surface longliners with a tonnage less than or equal to 100 GT shall be exempt from this measure. \u00a7  With regard to any vessel taking aboard an observer, the vessel owner is asked to pay a contribution of EUR 20 for each day on board. This sum shall be paid to the Observers Programme administered by the FMC. \nAppendix 3 \u2013 Coordinates (latitude\r\nand longitude) of Madagascar\u2019s Fishing Zone\n Point || LatDD || LonDD ||

\u2018ERS\u2019, capable of recording and transmitting data on the vessel\u2019s fishing\r\nactivities, hereinafter referred to as \u2018ERS data\u2019, when the vessel is operating\r\nin the Malagasy fishing zone.\n(2)          \r\nAn EU vessel that is\r\nnot equipped with an ERS, or whose ERS is not working, shall not be authorised\r\nto enter the Malagasy fishing zone in order to engage in fishing activities.\n(3)          \r\nERS data shall be\r\ntransmitted in accordance with the procedures of the vessel\u2019s flag State, i.e.\r\nthey shall firstly be sent to the Fisheries Monitoring Centre (hereinafter:\r\nFMC) of the flag State which will make them automatically available to the\r\nMalagasy FMC. \n(4)          \r\nThe flag State and\r\nMadagascar shall ensure that their FMCs have the necessary IT equipment\r\nand software to automatically transmit ERS data in xml format, and shall have a\r\nbackup procedure in place capable of recording and storing ERS data in a format\r\nwhich will be computer-readable for at least three years.\n(5)          \r\nERS data must be\r\ntransmitted using the electronic means of communication operated by the\r\nEuropean Commission on behalf of the EU, referred to as the DEH (Data Exchange\r\nHighway).\n(6)          \r\nThe flag State and\r\nMadagascar shall each designate an ERS correspondent who will act as the point\r\nof contact. \n(1)           \r\nERS correspondents\r\nshall be designated for a minimum period of six months.\n(2)           \r\nThe FMCs of the flag\r\nState and Madagascar shall notify one another of the contact details (name,\r\naddress, telephone number, fax, e-mail address) of their ERS correspondent,\r\nbefore the supplier starts production of the ERS.\n(3)           \r\nAny changes to the\r\ncontact details of the ERS correspondent must be notified immediately.\n(2)                    \r\nProducing and\r\ncommunicating ERS data\n(1)          \r\nUnion fishing vessels\r\nshall:\n(1)           \r\ncommunicate daily the\r\nERS data for each day spent in the Malagasy fishing zone,\n(2)           \r\nrecord the quantity of\r\neach species caught and kept on board as target species or by-catch, or\r\ndiscarded, for each fishing operation;\n(3)           \r\nfor each species\r\nidentified in the fishing authorisation issued by Madagascar, also declare zero\r\ncatches;\n(4)           \r\nidentify each species\r\nby its FAO alpha 3 code;\n(5)           \r\nexpress the quantities\r\nin kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish;\n(6)           \r\nrecord by species in\r\nthe ERS data the quantity transhipped and/or unloaded; \n(7)           \r\nrecord, in the ERS\r\ndata, a specific message declaring the quantities held on board of each species\r\nspecified in the fishing authorisation issued by Madagascar at each entry into\r\n(COE) or exit from (COX) the Malagasy fishing zone;\n(8)           \r\ntransmit ERS data on a\r\ndaily basis to the FMC of the flag State, according to the format referred to\r\nin point 2 above, by 23:59 UTC at the latest.\n(2)          \r\nThe master is\r\nresponsible for the accuracy of the ERS data recorded and sent.\n(3)          \r\nThe FMC of the flag\r\nState shall send the ERS data automatically and without delay to the Malagasy\r\nFMC.\n(4)          \r\nThe Malagasy FMC shall\r\nconfirm that it has received the ERS data by means of a return message and\r\nshall handle all ERS data confidentially. \n(3)                    \r\nFailure of the\r\non-board ERS and/or transmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of\r\nthe flag State\n(1)          \r\nThe flag State shall\r\nimmediately inform the master and/or owner of a vessel flying its flag, or\r\ntheir agent, of any technical failure of the ERS installed on board the vessel\r\nor any breakdown in transmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of\r\nthe flag State. \n(2)          \r\nThe flag State shall\r\ninform Madagascar of the failure detected and the corrective measures taken.\n(3)          \r\nIn the event of a\r\nbreakdown in the on-board ERS, the master and/or owner shall ensure the ERS

If the vessel makes a call at a port\r\nwithin those ten days, it may only resume fishing activity in the Malagasy\r\nfishing zone once its ERS is in perfect working order, unless Madagascar\r\nauthorises otherwise.\n(1)           \r\nFollowing a technical\r\nfailure in its ERS, a fishing vessel may not leave port until its ERS functions\r\nagain to the satisfaction of the flag State and Madagascar, or\n(2)           \r\nit receives\r\nauthorisation from the flag State. In the latter case, the flag State shall\r\ninform Madagascar of its decision before the vessel leaves. \n(4)          \r\nAny EU vessels\r\noperating in the Malagasy fishing zone with a faulty ERS must transmit all ERS\r\ndata on a daily basis and by 23:59 UTC at the latest to the FMC of the\r\nflag State by any other available means of electronic communication accessible\r\nby the Malagasy FMC.\n(5)          \r\nERS data which could\r\nnot be made available to Madagascar via the ERS owing to the failure of the\r\nsystem shall be transmitted by the FMC of the flag State to the Malagasy FMC by\r\nanother mutually agreed form of electronic communication. This alternative\r\ntransmission shall be considered priority, it being understood that it may not\r\nbe possible to comply with the transmission deadlines usually applicable.\n(6)          \r\nIf the Malagasy FMC\r\ndoes not receive ERS data from a vessel for three consecutive days, Madagascar\r\nmay instruct a vessel to immediately call at a port of its choosing in order to\r\ninvestigate. \n(4)                    \r\nFMC failure \u2013\r\nERS data not received by Malagasy FMC\n(1)          \r\nIn the event that ERS\r\ndata are not received by an FMC, its ERS correspondent shall immediately inform\r\nthe ERS correspondent for the other FMC, and if necessary they shall work\r\ntogether to resolve the problem.\n(2)          \r\nBefore the ERS becomes\r\noperational, the FMC of the flag State and the Malagasy FMC shall mutually\r\nagree on the alternative means of electronic communication to be used in order\r\nto transmit ERS data in the event of an FMC failure, and shall immediately\r\ninform one another of any changes thereto.\n(3)          \r\nIf the Malagasy FMC\r\nreports that ERS data has not been received, the FMC of the flag State shall\r\nidentify the causes of the problem and take appropriate measures in order to\r\nresolve the problem. The FMC of the flag State shall inform the Malagasy FMC\r\nand the EU of the outcome of the measures taken within 24 hours after recognising\r\nthe failure.\n(4)          \r\nIf more than\r\n24 hours is required in order to resolve the problem, the FMC of the flag\r\nState shall immediately transmit the missing ERS data to the Malagasy FMC via\r\none of the alternative means of electronic communication referred to in point 5\r\nof paragraph 3.\n(5)          \r\nMadagascar shall inform\r\nits competent monitoring services (CMS) so that EU vessels are not considered\r\nby the Malagasy FMC to be in violation of their obligations for not\r\ntransmitting ERS data owing to a failure in one of the FMCs.\n(5)                    \r\nFMC maintenance\n(1)          \r\nPlanned maintenance of\r\nan FMC (maintenance programme) which may affect the exchange of ERS data must\r\nbe notified at least 72 hours in advance to the other FMC, indicating,\r\nwhere possible, the date and duration of the maintenance work.

The relevant ERS data shall be made available immediately\r\nafter the maintenance work has been completed.\n(3)          \r\nIf the maintenance work\r\ntakes more than 24 hours, ERS data shall be sent to the other FMC using\r\none of the alternative means of electronic communication referred to in point\r\n(v) of paragraph 3.\n(4)          \r\nMadagascar shall inform\r\nits competent monitoring services (CMS) so that EU vessels are not considered\r\nto be in violation of their obligations for not transmitting ERS data owing to\r\nthe maintenance of an FMC.\n(6)                    \r\nRouting of ERS\r\ndata in Madagascar\n(1)          \r\nFor the purposes of\r\ntransmitting ERS data from the flag State to Madagascar, electronic\r\ncommunication means, to be managed by the European Commission on behalf of the\r\nEU, will be used, these being identified as DEH (Data Exchange Highway) as\r\nreferred to in point 1 of this Appendix.\n(2)          \r\nFor the purposes of\r\nmanaging the fishing activities by the EU fleet, this data shall be stored and\r\nmade available for consultation by authorised European Commission staff, on\r\nbehalf of the European Union.\nAppendix 9 \u2013 Contact details in\r\nMadagascar\nN.B.: Madagascar will provide all the\r\ninformation set out below by the entry into force of this Protocol at the\r\nlatest\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minist\u00e8re des\r\nRessources Halieutiques et de la P\u00eache (Ministry for Fishery Resources and\r\nFishing)\nName, address, e-mail address, telephone and fax\r\nnumbers\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Application\r\nfor a fishing authorisation\nName, address, e-mail address, telephone and fax\r\nnumbers\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Direction de\r\nla Statistique et de la Programmation (DSP) (Directorate for Statistics and\r\nProgramming)\nName, address, e-mail address, telephone and fax\r\nnumbers \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fisheries\r\nMonitoring Centre (FMC) and notification of entry and exit\nName of FMC (call sign): \nRadio:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 VHF: F1 channel 16;
