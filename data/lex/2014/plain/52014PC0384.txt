The Commission outlined this policy\r\naspect more extensively in its Communication of December 2006 \u2018on the general\r\napproach to enable European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries to\r\nparticipate in Community agencies and Community programmes\u2019[1]. \nThe Council endorsed this approach in its\r\nconclusions of 5 March 2007[2].\r\n\nBased upon this Communication and these\r\nconclusions, on 18 June 2007 the Council issued directives to the\r\nCommission to negotiate Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan,\r\nEgypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco,\r\nthe Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general\r\nprinciples for their participation in Community programmes[3]. \nThe June 2007 European Council[4] reaffirmed the\r\nparamount importance of the ENP and endorsed a Presidency Progress Report[5] that had been submitted\r\nto the Council meeting of 18 and 19 June 2007 and the related Council conclusions[6]. The report referred to\r\nthe Council directives for negotiating the relevant additional protocols. \nThe Joint Communication by the Commission\r\nand the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and\r\nSecurity Policy \u2018A new response to a changing Neighbourhood[7]\u2019, endorsed in Council\r\nconclusions of 20 June 2011, further stressed the EU\u2019s intention to\r\nfacilitate partner countries\u2019 participation in EU programmes.\nTo date, protocols have been signed with Armenia, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco and Ukraine. \nIn February 2013, Algeria expressed its interest in participating in the broad range of programmes open to\r\npartner countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The text of the\r\nprotocol negotiated with Algeria is attached. \nThe Commission herewith submits a proposal\r\nfor a Council Decision on the conclusion of the protocol. This protocol\r\ncontains a Framework Agreement on the general principles for the participation\r\nof Algeria in Union programmes. It contains standard clauses that are intended\r\nto be applied to all European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries with which\r\nsuch protocols are concluded. \nIn accordance with Article 218(6)(a) of the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Parliament will\r\nbe asked to give its consent to the conclusion of this protocol. \nThe Commission is submitting a parallel\r\nproposal for a Council decision on the signing and provisional application of\r\nthe protocol. \nThe Council is invited to adopt the\r\nfollowing proposed decision.\n2014/0195 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion of the Protocol to the\r\nEuro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European\r\nCommunities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of\r\nAlgeria, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union\r\nand the Republic of Algeria on the general principles for the participation of\r\nthe Republic of Algeria in Union programmes\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 212, in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and (7) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[8],\r\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Protocol to the\r\nEuro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European\r\nCommunities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of\r\nAlgeria, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union\r\nand the Republic of Algeria on the general principles for the participation of\r\nthe Republic of Algeria in Union programmes (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the\r\nProtocol\u2019) was signed on behalf of the Union on \u2026 \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of the\r\nProtocol is to lay down the financial and technical rules enabling Algeria to participate in certain Union programmes.
