Article 15(2) has provided the legal basis\r\nfor financial contributions in that regard. As of 1 January 2014, the financing\r\nunder Eures will take place under the European Union Programme for Employment\r\nand Social Innovation. As the Programme will be included in Article 15(8),\r\nfuture financial contributions will be made pursuant to Article 15(6). The\r\ndraft JCD therefore amends Article 15(2), in order to clarify that this\r\nprovision will only apply to activities carried out before the entry into force\r\nof the Programme on 1 January 2014.\nThe adaptation text in the Annex clarifies\r\nthat Liechtenstein is not to participate in, and thus also not to contribute\r\nfinancially to the programme.\nNorway will participate in the EURES axis of the\r\nprogramme. At a later stage, a more extensive participation could be preferred.\r\nIf so, a new EEA Joint Committee decision will be proposed, in order to extend\r\nthe participation of Norway.\nProtocol 31 to the EEA Agreement should\r\ntherefore be amended in order to allow for this extended cooperation to take\r\nplace from 1 January 2014.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n2894/94 concerning arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement provides\r\nthat the Council establishes the
