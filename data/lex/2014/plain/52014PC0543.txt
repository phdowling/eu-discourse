The Protocol on Cultural Cooperation (hereafter: the\r\nProtocol), concluded by the Parties within the framework of the FTA,\r\nestablished a framework within which the Parties shall cooperate to facilitate\r\nexchanges in cultural activities, goods and services, including in the\r\naudio-visual sector, and to improve the conditions governing such exchanges. \nBy derogation\r\nfrom the institutional provisions of the FTA, the Trade Committee shall have no\r\njurisdiction over the Protocol. Instead the Committee on Cultural Cooperation, established\r\nwithin the framework of the Protocol and comprising senior officials from\r\nwithin the administration of each Party, shall exercise all functions of the\r\nTrade Committee as regards the Protocol, where such functions are relevant for\r\nthe purposes of implementing the Protocol. The Committee on Cultural\r\nCooperation met for the first time on 5 December 2013 in Brussels and the\r\nParties on that occasion shared information on their respective legal bases and\r\ncultural activities. \nWith the\r\nProtocol, the Parties agreed inter alia to establish an arbitration\r\npanel of 15 individuals who are willing and able to serve as arbitrators in\r\ncase of a dispute between the Parties. Each Party must propose five individuals\r\nto serve as arbitrators. The Parties must also select five individuals who are\r\nnot nationals of either Party and who shall act as chairperson to the\r\narbitration panel.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Member\r\nStates were consulted on several occasions through the Council's Committee for\r\nCultural Affairs (CAC) in order to identify possible arbitrators for dispute\r\nsettlement under the Protocol. Following the call to CAC members on 30 July\r\n2013 seven names were proposed for EU arbitrators. \nThe European\r\nCommission received the list of Korean arbitrators on 7 April 2014. \nThe list of non-EU\r\nnon-Korean arbitrators was established following consultations with the EU\r\nDelegations to OECD and UNESCO (in Paris), and to the UN (in Geneva) as well as\r\nwith the Korean Party.\nThe arbitrators\r\nwere selected on the basis of the following criteria:\n\u2013              \r\nIndependence: not\r\naffiliated with the government of a Party, able to serve in an individual\r\ncapacity without taking instructions from any organisation or government with\r\nregard to matters related to the dispute. Members of governments of Parties and\r\nofficials of Union institutions cannot be considered as independent. \n\u2013              \r\nCompliance with the Code of Conduct for Members\r\nof Arbitration Panels and Mediators (Annex 14-C of the Free Trade Agreement). \n\u2013              \r\nA background in international relations and/or a\r\ndegree in international law.\n\u2013              \r\nIf possible, experience in working on cultural\r\nand audio-visual cases, ideally also in an international context.\n\u2013              \r\nIf possible, experience of acting as an\r\narbitrator in matters of international trade.\u00a0 \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe procedure\r\nfor establishing the arbitration panel is provided for in Article 3bis\r\nof the Protocol.
