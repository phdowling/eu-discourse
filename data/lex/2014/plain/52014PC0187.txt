It sets\r\nout essential requirements with which cableway installations, their infrastructure,\r\nsubsystems and safety components must comply in order to be safe.\nDirective 2000/9/EC is also an example of\r\nthat Union harmonisation legislation ensuring the free movement in the EU\r\nsingle market, namely of subsystems and safety components for cableway\r\ninstallations. It harmonises the conditions for the placing on the market and\r\nputting into service of subsystems and safety components intended to be\r\nincorporated into cableway installations. Manufacturers must demonstrate that\r\ntheir subsystems or safety components have been designed and manufactured in\r\ncompliance with the essential requirements, affix the CE marking and provide\r\ninstructions for their incorporation into a cableway installation.\nDirective 2000/9/EC is based on Article 114\r\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter\r\n\"the Treaty\"). It is a total harmonisation Directive based on the\r\n\u201cNew Approach\u201d principles, which requires manufacturers to ensure the compliance\r\nof their products with the mandatory performance and safety requirements\r\nprovided for in the legislative instrument without however imposing specific\r\ntechnical solutions or specifications.\nDirective 2000/9/EC applies to cableway\r\ninstallations designed to carry persons.\nTraction by cable and the passenger\r\ntransport function are the principal criteria determining the scope of\r\nDirective 2000/9/EC.\nThe main types of cableway installations\r\ncovered by Directive 2000/9/EC are funiculars, gondolas, detachable chair\r\nlifts, fixed-grip chair lifts, aerial tramways, funitels, combined\r\ninstallations (made of several cableway types, such as those of gondolas and\r\nchairlifts) and drag lifts.\nCableway installations are defined as the\r\nwhole on-site system, consisting of infrastructure, subsystems and safety\r\ncomponents.\nCableway installations and their\r\ninfrastructure are directly affected by the characteristics of the region in\r\nwhich they are located, by the nature and physical features of the terrain in\r\nwhich they are installed, by their surroundings, by atmospheric and\r\nmeteorological factors as well as by structures and obstacles that may be found\r\nin their vicinity either on the ground or in the air.\nIn this framework, the construction and\r\nentry into service of cableway installations are subject to national\r\nauthorisation procedures.\nDirective 2000/9/EC sets out harmonised essential\r\nrequirements with which cableway installations must comply, while Member States\r\nremain competent to regulate other aspects such as land-use, regional planning\r\nand environmental protection.\nSafety components and subsystems are\r\nsubject to the principle of the free movement of goods Safety components bear\r\nthe CE marking indicating conformity with the requirements of the Directive\r\n2000/9/EC, including the conformity assessment procedures.\nThe proposal intends to replace Directive\r\n2000/9/EC by a Regulation, in line with the Commission\u2019s simplification\r\nobjectives.\nThe proposal intends to align Directive\r\n2000/9/EC to the \u201cgoods package\u201d adopted in 2008 and in particular to the NLF\r\nDecision EC No 768/2008. \nThe NLF Decision sets out a common\r\nframework for EU product harmonisation legislation. This framework consists of\r\nthe provisions which are commonly used in EU product legislation (e.g.\r\ndefinitions, obligations of economic operators, notified bodies, safeguard\r\nmechanisms, etc.). These common provisions have been reinforced to ensure that\r\nthe directives can be applied and enforced more effectively in practice. New\r\nelements, such as obligations for importers, have been introduced, which are\r\ncrucial for improving the safety of products on the market. \nThe Commission has already proposed the\r\nalignment of nine other Directives to the NLF Decision within an \u201calignment\r\npackage\u201d adopted on 21 November 2011. It has also proposed the alignment to the\r\nNLF Decision of Directive 97/23/EC on pressure equipment[2].\nIn view of ensuring consistency across Union harmonisation legislation for industrial products, in accordance with the political\r\ncommitment resulting from the adoption of the NLF Decision and the legal\r\nobligation provided for in Article 2 of the NLF Decision, it is necessary that\r\nthis proposal is in line with the provisions of the NLF Decision.\nThe proposal also intends to address some\r\ndifficulties that have been experienced in the implementation of Directive\r\n2000/9/EC. More particularly, authorities, notified bodies and manufacturers\r\nhave had different views on whether certain types of installations come under\r\nthe scope of Directive 2000/9/EC and hence have to be manufactured and\r\ncertified in line with the directive\u2019s requirements and procedures. Views also\r\ndiffered on whether certain equipment should be considered as subsystem,\r\ninfrastructure or safety component. Furthermore the Directive does not specify\r\nwhich type of conformity assessment procedure has to be applied to subsystems. \nThose divergent approaches led to market\r\ndistortions and different treatment of economic operators. Manufacturers and\r\noperators of the installations concerned had to modify the equipment or to\r\nundergo further certification which led to extra costs and to delays in the\r\nauthorisation and operation of those installations. \nThe proposed Regulation intends therefore\r\nto enhance legal clarity about the scope of Directive 2000/9/EC and thus a\r\nbetter implementation of the relevant legal provisions.\nFurthermore, Directive 2000/9/EC contains\r\nprovisions on the conformity assessment for subsystems. However, it does not\r\ndetermine the concrete procedure to be followed by the manufacturer and the\r\nnotified body. Furthermore, it does not offer manufacturers the range of\r\nconformity assessment procedures that are available for safety components. The\r\nproposed Regulation aligns thus the conformity assessment procedures available\r\nfor subsystems with those already used for safety components, based on the\r\nconformity assessment modules set out in Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a\r\ncommon framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision). In this context,\r\nit also provides for the affixing of the CE marking to indicate compliance with\r\nits provisions, in line with the existing system for safety components.\nThe proposal takes into account Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October\r\n2012 on European Standardisation[3].\nThe proposal also takes into account the\r\nproposal of the Commission of 13 February 2013 for a Regulation on market\r\nsurveillance of products[4],\r\nwhich intends to set out a single legal instrument on market surveillance\r\nactivities in the field of non-food goods, consumer or non-consumer products\r\nand products covered or not by Union harmonisation legislation. This proposal\r\nmerges the rules on market surveillance of Directive 2001/95/EC on general\r\nproduct safety[5],\r\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\r\nsetting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating\r\nto the marketing of products[6]\r\nand of sector-specific harmonisation legislation in order to increase the\r\neffectiveness of market surveillance activities within the Union. The proposed\r\nRegulation on market surveillance of products contains also the relevant provisions\r\non market surveillance and safeguard clauses. Therefore, provisions in existing\r\nsector specific harmonisation legislation that relate to market surveillance\r\nand safeguard clauses should be removed from that harmonisation legislation.\r\nThe overacting objective of the proposed Regulation on market surveillance of\r\nproducts is to simplify the Union market surveillance framework fundamentally\r\nso that it works better for its main users: market surveillance authorities and\r\neconomic operators. Directive 2000/9/EC provides for a safeguard clause\r\nprocedure for subsystems and safety components. In line with the framework\r\nintended to be established by the proposed Regulation on the market\r\nsurveillance of products, this proposal does not include the provisions on market\r\nsurveillance and safeguard clause procedures for subsystems and safety\r\ncomponents provided for in the NLF Decision. However, in order to ensure legal\r\nclarity, it makes a reference to the proposed Regulation on market surveillance\r\nof products.\nConsistency with other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThis initiative is in\r\nline with the Single Market Act[7], which has stressed the need to restore\r\nconsumer confidence in the quality of products on the market and the importance\r\nof reinforcing market surveillance.\nFurthermore it supports\r\nthe Commission\u2019s policy on Better Regulation and simplification of the\r\nregulatory environment.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONSULTATION OF THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nConsultation of the interested parties\nThe revision of Directive 2000/9/EC has\r\nbeen lengthy and extensively discussed since 2010. More particularly, it has\r\nbeen discussed within the Member States Working Group on Cableway\r\nInstallations, with national experts responsible for the implementation of the\r\nDirective, within the Standing Committee provided for by Directive 2000/9/EC, the\r\nAdministrative Cooperation Group for Market Surveillance of Cableway\r\nInstallations (AdCo) and the Cableway Installations Sectoral Group (CSG) of the\r\nEuropean Co-ordination of Notified Bodies, as well as with industry and user\r\nassociations.\nMember States and stakeholders, including manufacturers' organisations,\r\nnotified bodies and representatives of standardisation bodies, have been\r\ninvolved in the Impact Assessment process from the beginning. In the framework\r\nof the Standing Committee provided for by Directive 2000/9/EC, regular\r\ndiscussions took place about the functioning of the Directive and the potential\r\nissues that would require improvements, either through legislative or\r\nnon-legislative means.\nAdditionally, three specific consultations\r\nhave been carried out.\nThe first consultation took place in the\r\nfirst half of 2010 in the framework of the preparation of the Report on the\r\nimplementation of Directive 2000/9/EC provided for by its Article 21(4).\nIn its First Report on the implementation\r\nof Directive 2000/9/EC[8],\r\nthe Commission noted that the Directive has been successful in establishing an\r\ninternal market for subsystems and safety components, while guaranteeing a\r\nuniform and high level of safety. It also identified some issues to be\r\nexamined.\nThe issues to be examined were the\r\nfollowing:\n\u2013                        \r\nThe extent of the scope of Directive 2000/9/EC,\r\nin particular with regard to new types of cableway installations;\n\u2013                        \r\nThe lack of an appropriate range of conformity assessment\r\nprocedures for subsystems, which has led to divergent interpretations and\r\nimplementation of the conformity assessment of subsystems;\n\u2013                        \r\nThe need to align Directive 2000/9/EC to the NLF\r\nDecision.\nThe second and the third consultation took\r\nplace in 2012 as part of the Impact Assessment Study the first one concerned the\r\nexisting situation and the other one the policy options. The Final Report of\r\nthe Impact Assessment study has been formally presented and discussed at the Standing\r\nCommittee meetings held on 25 September 2012 and 8 April 2013, in which Member States and sectoral stakeholders had the opportunity to express a number of\r\nopinions, contributions and position papers on the policy options included in\r\nthe study.\nStakeholders have actively contributed to\r\nidentify the issues needing solutions to improve the functioning of Directive\r\n2000/9/EC. The majority of stakeholders agree with the problems identified. An\r\nimportant number of respondents to the consultation carried out in the context\r\nof the Impact Assessment Study have experienced problems with the definition of\r\nCableway installations and the borderline with the scope of the Directive\r\n95/16/EC relating to lifts[9].\nIn view of the amount of information\r\ncollected and the rather technical issues, no open public consultation was\r\nlaunched, as targeted expertise consultations were deemed more appropriate for\r\nthis quite technical initiative.\nCollection and use of expertise - Impact\r\nassessment \nAn impact assessment on the revision of\r\nDirective 2000/9/EC has been conducted.\nBased on the information collected, the impact\r\nassessment carried out by the Commission examined and compared three options:\nOption 1 \u2013 \u201cDo nothing\u201d - No changes to\r\nthe existing situation\nThis option proposes no changes to Directive\r\n2000/9/EC.\nOption 2 \u2013Intervention by non-legislative\r\nmeasures\nOption 2 considers the possibility of providing\r\nmore extensive guidance on the implementation of Directive 2000/9/EC with\r\nregard to its scope and of recommending the application of specific conformity assessment\r\nprocedures for the assessment of subsystems, mainly via a redrafting of the\r\nApplication Guide to Directive 2000/9/EC.\nOption 3 \u2013 Intervention by legislative\r\nmeasures\nThis option consists in modifying Directive\r\n2000/9/EC.\nCombination of\r\noptions 2 and 3 were found to be the preferred solution because:\n\u2013                        \r\nit is considered the most to address the problem\r\nas it will provide clarification in the scope definitions and consistency and\r\nflexibility of conformity assessment procedures for subsystems and safety\r\ncomponents;\n\u2013                        \r\nit does not entail significant costs for\r\neconomic operators and notified bodies; for those who are already acting\r\nresponsibly, no significant economic or social impacts could be identified;\n\u2013                        \r\nit will improve the functioning of the internal\r\nmarket of subsystems and safety components by ensuring equal treatment of all\r\neconomic operators, notably importers and distributors, as well as notified\r\nbodies;\n\u2013                        \r\noption 1 does not provide answers to the problem\r\nof legal uncertainty due to some provisions of Directive 2000/9/EC and therefore\r\nwill not lead to its better implementation.\nThe proposal includes:\n\u00b7              \r\nThe clarification of the scope with regard to\r\ncableway installations designed for both transport and leisure purposes;\n\u00b7              \r\nThe introduction of a range of conformity\r\nassessment procedures for subsystems based on the existing conformity\r\nassessment modules for safety components as aligned to the NLF Decision;\n\u00b7              \r\nThe alignment to the NLF Decision.\nThe impact of the proposal will guarantee a\r\nfair level playing field for the economic operators and will enhance protection\r\nof the safety of passengers and other users, workers and third parties.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL elements of the proposal\n3.1. Scope and definitions\nThe scope of the proposed Regulation\r\ncorresponds to the scope of Directive 2000/9/EC, and covers cableway\r\ninstallations, including their infrastructure, as well as subsystems and safety\r\ncomponents for cableway installations.\nThe proposal clarifies and updates the\r\nexisting scope.\nIn particular, in light of the development\r\nof new types of cableway installations, it is clarified that the exclusion of cableway\r\ninstallations used for leisure purposes in fairgrounds or amusement parks does\r\nnot apply to cableway installations that are intended for a dual function,\r\nnamely of transporting persons and for leisure activities.\nThe proposal maintains the exclusion of\r\ncertain cableway installations intended for agricultural or industrial purposes,\r\nbut it clarifies that it also covers cableway installations intended for the\r\nservice of mountain shelters or huts that are not intended for the transport of\r\nthe public.\nThe current exclusion of cable-operated\r\nferries is also updated to all cable-operated installations where the users or\r\ncarriers are water-borne, such as cable-operated water ski installations.\nThe exclusions provided for in Directive\r\n2000/9/EC relating to rack-and-pinion railways and chain-driven installations\r\nare not reintroduced since these installations do not correspond to the\r\ndefinition of cableway installations.\nThe general definitions resulting from the\r\nalignment to the NLF Decision have been inserted.\n3.2. Obligations of economic operators\nThe proposal contains, with regard to\r\nsubsystems and safety components, the typical provisions for product-related\r\nUnion harmonisation legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant\r\neconomic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers and\r\ndistributors), in accordance with the NLF Decision.\n3.3. Harmonised standards\nCompliance with harmonised standards\r\nprovides for a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements.\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1025/2012 sets out a horizontal legal framework for European\r\nstandardisation. The Regulation contains inter alia provisions on\r\nstandardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation\r\nOrganisation, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on\r\nstakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently the\r\nprovisions of Directive 2000/9/EC which cover the same aspects have not been\r\nreintroduced in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty.\n3.4. Conformity assessment\nThe proposal keeps the conformity\r\nassessment procedures for safety components provided for under Directive\r\n2000/9/EC. It however updates the corresponding modules in line with the NLF\r\nDecision.\nIn particular, it keeps the requirement for\r\na notified body intervention in the design and production phase of all\r\nsubsystems and safety components.\nThe proposal introduces a range of conformity\r\nassessment procedures for subsystems based on the conformity assessment modules\r\nof the NLF Decision. In this framework, it also introduces the CE marking for\r\nsubsystems, as there is no reason to treat them differently than the safety\r\ncomponents, for which Directive 2000/9/EC provides already the affixing of the\r\nCE marking to indicate their conformity with its requirements.\n3.5. Notified bodies\nProper functioning of notified bodies is\r\ncrucial for ensuring a high level of health and safety protection and for the\r\nconfidence of all interested parties in the New Approach system.\nTherefore, in line with the NLF Decision, the\r\nproposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies and\r\nintroduces specific requirements for notifying authorities.\n3.6. Implementing acts\nThe proposal empowers the Commission to\r\nadopt, where appropriate, implementing acts to ensure the uniform application\r\nof this Regulation in respect of notified bodies that do not meet or no longer\r\nmeet the requirements for their notification.\nThose implementing acts will be adopted in\r\naccordance with the provisions on implementing acts laid down in Regulation\r\n(EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February\r\n2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for\r\ncontrol by the Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing\r\npowers.\n3.7. Final provisions\nThe proposed Regulation will become\r\napplicable two years after its entry into force to allow manufacturers,\r\nnotified bodies and Member States time to adapt to the new requirements.\nHowever, the designation of notified bodies\r\npursuant to the new requirements and process needs to start shortly after the\r\nentry into force of this Regulation. This will ensure that by the date of\r\napplication of the proposed Regulation, sufficient notified bodies will have\r\nbeen designated in accordance with the new rules so as to avoid problems with\r\nproduction continuity and market supply.\nA transitional provision is foreseen for\r\nthe certificates issued by notified bodies under Directive 2000/9/EC with\r\nregard to subsystems and safety components so as to allow stocks to be absorbed\r\nand ensure a smooth transition to the new requirements.\nA transitional provision is foreseen for\r\nthe entry into service of cableway installations constructed under Directive\r\n2000/9/EC so as to ensure a smooth transition to the new requirements.\nDirective 2000/9/EC will be repealed and\r\nreplaced by the proposed Regulation.\n3.8. Union competence, legal basis,\r\nsubsidiarity principle and legal form\nLegal basis\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the\r\nTreaty. \nSubsidiarity principle\nThe subsidiarity principle arises in\r\nparticular with regard to the newly added provisions aiming at the improvement\r\nof effective enforcement of Directive 2000/9/EC, namely, the economic\r\noperators' obligations, the traceability provisions, the provisions on the\r\nassessment and notification of conformity assessment bodies.\nExperience with the enforcement of the\r\nlegislation has shown that measures taken at national level have led to\r\ndivergent approaches and to a different treatment of economic operators inside\r\nthe Union, which undermines the objective of Directive 2000/9/EC. If actions\r\nare taken at national level to address the problems, this risks creating\r\nobstacles to the free movement of goods. Furthermore action at national level\r\nis limited to the territorial competence of a Member State. Coordinated action\r\nat Union level can much better achieve the objectives set, and will in\r\nparticular render market surveillance more effective. Hence it is more appropriate\r\nto take action at Union level.\nProportionality\nIn accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, the proposed modifications do not go beyond what is necessary\r\nto achieve the objectives set. \nThe new or modified obligations do not\r\nimpose unnecessary burdens and costs on industry - especially on small and\r\nmedium sized enterprises - or administrations. Where modifications have been\r\nidentified to have negative impacts, the analysis of the impacts of the option\r\nserves to provide the most proportionate response to the problems identified. A\r\nnumber of modifications concern the improvement of clarity of the existing\r\nDirective without introducing new requirements that entail added cost. \nLegislative technique used\nThe proposal takes the form of a Regulation.\nThe proposed change from a Directive to a\r\nRegulation takes into account the Commission's general objective to simplify\r\nthe regulatory environment and the need to ensure a uniform implementation\r\nthroughout the Union of the proposed legislation.\nThe proposed Regulation is based on Article\r\n114 of the Treaty and aims to ensure the proper functioning of the internal\r\nmarket for subsystems and safety components intended to be incorporated into\r\ncableway installations, while maintaining the existing role for Member States\r\nwith respect to cableway installations. It imposes clear and detailed rules\r\nwhich will become applicable in a uniform manner at the same time throughout\r\nthe Union.\nIn accordance with the\r\ntotal harmonisation principles, Member States are not allowed to impose more\r\nstringent or additional requirements in their national legislation for the\r\nplacing on the market of subsystems and safety components. In particular, the\r\nmandatory essential requirements and the conformity assessment procedures to be\r\nfollowed by manufacturers must be identical in all Member States.\nThe same applies with\r\nregard to the provisions that have been introduced as a result from the\r\nalignment to the NLF Decision. Those provisions are clear and sufficiently\r\nprecise to be applied directly by the actors concerned.\nThe obligations provided\r\nfor the Member States, such as the obligation to assess, appoint and notify the\r\nconformity assessment bodies are, in any case, not transposed as such into\r\nnational law but implemented by the Member States by means of the necessary\r\nregulatory and administrative arrangements. This will not change when the\r\nobligations concerned are set out in a Regulation.\nTherefore, Member\r\nStates have almost no flexibility in transposing a Directive into their\r\nnational law. The choice of a Regulation will however allow them to save the\r\ncosts associated with the transposition of a Directive.\nAdditionally, a Regulation avoids the risk\r\nof possible diverging transpositions of a Directive by the different Member\r\nStates, which might lead to different levels of safety protection and create\r\nobstacles to the internal market, undermining thus its effective implementation.\nThe change from a\r\nDirective to a Regulation will not lead to any change in the regulatory\r\napproach.\nThe characteristics of\r\nthe New Approach will be fully preserved, in particular the flexibility given\r\nto manufacturers in the choice of the means employed to comply with the\r\nessential requirements and in the choice of the procedure used, amongst the\r\navailable conformity assessment procedures, to demonstrate compliance of\r\nsubsystems and safety components. The existing mechanisms supporting the\r\nimplementation of the legislation (standardisation process, working groups,\r\nadministrative cooperation, the development of guidance documents etc.) will\r\nnot be affected by the nature of the legal instrument.\nFurthermore, the choice of a Regulation\r\ndoes not mean that the decision-making process is centralised. Member States\r\nretain their competence with regard to cableway installations and the\r\nimplementation of the harmonised provisions, e.g. the designation and\r\naccreditation of notified bodies, the conduct of market surveillance and\r\nenforcement action (e.g. penalties).\nFinally, the use of\r\nRegulations in the area of internal market legislation, allows, in accordance\r\nalso with the preference expressed by stakeholders, to avoid the risk of \u2018gold\r\nplating\u2019. It also allows manufacturers to work directly with the Regulation\r\ntext instead of needing to identify and examine 28 transposition laws.\nOn this basis, it is\r\nconsidered that the choice of a Regulation is the most appropriate and less\r\ncostly solution for all involved parties as it will allow a more rapid and\r\ncoherent application of the proposed legislation and will establish a clearer regulatory\r\nenvironment for economic operators, while avoiding transposition costs to\r\nMember States.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThis proposal does not have any\r\nimplications for the EU budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nRepeal of existing legislation\nThe adoption of the proposal will lead to\r\nrepeal of Directive 2000/9/EC.\nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposal concerns the EEA and should\r\ntherefore be extended to the European Economic Area.\n2014/0107 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non cableway installations\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[10],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2000/9/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[11]\r\non cableway installations lays down rules for cableway installations that are\r\ndesigned, constructed and operated in view of transporting persons.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2000/9/EC is\r\nbased on the New Approach principles, as set out in Council Resolution of 5 May\r\n1985 on a new approach to technical harmonisation and standards[12]. Thus, it sets out\r\nonly the essential requirements applying to cableway installations, whereas\r\ntechnical details are adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation\r\n(CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (Cenelec)\r\nin accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council[13]\r\non European Standardisation. Conformity with the harmonised standards so set,\r\nthe reference number of which is published in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union, provides a presumption of conformity with the requirements\r\nof Directive 2000/9/EC. Experience has shown that those basic principles have\r\nworked well in this sector and should be maintained and even further promoted.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience from the\r\nimplementation of Directive 2000/9/EC showed the need to modify some of its\r\nprovisions in order to clarify and update them and ensure thus legal certainty\r\nmainly as regards the scope and the conformity assessment of subsystems.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision No 768/2008/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[14]\r\non a common framework for the marketing of products lays down a common\r\nframework of general principles and reference provisions intended to apply\r\nacross the legislation harmonising the conditions for the marketing of products\r\nin order to provide a coherent basis for revision or recasts of that\r\nlegislation. Directive 2000/9/EC should therefore be adapted to that Decision.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a number of changes are\r\nto be made to Directive 2000/9/EC, it should be repealed and replaced in the\r\ninterests of clarity. Since the scope, essential requirements and conformity\r\nassessment procedures must be identical in all Member States, there is almost\r\nno flexibility in transposing a Directive based on the New Approach principles\r\ninto national law. In order to simplify the regulatory framework, Directive\r\n2000/9/EC should be replaced by a Regulation, which is the appropriate legal\r\ninstrument as it imposes clear and detailed rules which do not give room for\r\ndivergent transposition by Member States and ensures thus a uniform\r\nimplementation throughout the Union. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council[15] setting out the\r\nrequirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the\r\nmarketing of products lays down horizontal provisions on the accreditation of\r\nconformity assessment bodies [,on market surveillance of products and controls\r\non products from third countries] and on the CE marking.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No [\u2026/\u2026]\r\n[on market surveillance of products][16]\r\nprovides detailed rules on market surveillance and on controls of products\r\nentering the Union from third countries, including subsystems and safety\r\ncomponents. It also sets out a safeguard clause procedure. Member States are to\r\norganise and carry out market surveillance, appoint market surveillance\r\nauthorities and specify their powers and duties. They are also to set up general\r\nand sector-specific market surveillance programs.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scope of Directive\r\n2000/9/EC should be maintained. This Regulation should apply to cableway\r\ninstallations designed to transport persons used in high-altitude tourist\r\nresorts or in urban transport facilities. Cableway installations are mainly\r\nlift systems, such as funicular railways, aerial ropeways, cable cars,\r\ngondolas, chairlifts and drag lifts. Traction by cable and the passenger\r\ntransport function are the essential criteria determining the cableway\r\ninstallations covered by this Regulation.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New types of cableway\r\ninstallations have been developed that are intended for both transport and\r\nleisure activities. Such installations should be covered by this Regulation.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to exclude\r\ncertain cableway installations from the scope of this Regulation, either\r\nbecause they are subject to other specific Union harmonisation legislation or\r\nbecause they can be adequately regulated at national level.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cable-operated lifts,\r\nwhether vertical or inclined, permanently serving specific levels of buildings\r\nand constructions other than the stations, are subject to specific Union\r\nlegislation and should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure legal\r\ncertainty, the exclusion of the cable-operated ferries should cover all\r\ncable-operated installations where the users or carriers are water-borne, such\r\nas cable-operated water ski installations.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\r\ncableway installations and their infrastructure, subsystems and safety\r\ncomponents guarantee a high level protection of the health and safety of persons\r\nit is necessary to lay down rules for the design and the construction of\r\ncableway installations.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should ensure\r\nthe safety of cableway installations at the time of their construction, entry\r\ninto service and during their operation.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation does not\r\naffect the right of the Member States to specify the requirements they deem\r\nnecessary as regards land-use, regional planning and in order to ensure the\r\nprotection of the environment and of the health and safety of persons and in\r\nparticular workers when using cableway installations.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation does not\r\naffect the right of the Member States to specify adequate procedures for the\r\nauthorisation of planned cableway installations, the inspection of cableway\r\ninstallations prior to their entry into service and their monitoring during\r\noperation.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should take\r\ninto account the fact that the safety of cableway installations depends equally\r\non the surrounding conditions, on the quality of the industrial goods supplied\r\nand on the way in which they are assembled, installed on site and monitored\r\nduring operation. The causes of serious accidents may be linked to the choice\r\nof site, to the system of transport itself, to the structures, or to the way in\r\nwhich the system is operated and maintained.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although this Regulation is\r\nnot to cover the actual operation of cableway installations, it should provide\r\na general framework intended to ensure that such installations situated on the territory of Member States, are operated in such a way as to offer users, operating\r\npersonnel and third parties a high degree of protection.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of cableway\r\ninstallations, technological innovations can be verified and submitted to\r\nfull-scale tests only on the occasion of the construction of a new cableway installation.\r\nIn these circumstances, a procedure should be provided which, while ensuring\r\nthat the essential requirements are complied with, also enables to take into\r\naccount the particular conditions of a specific cableway installation.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should take\r\nthe necessary steps to ensure that cableway installations enter into service\r\nonly if they comply with this Regulation and they are not liable to endanger\r\nthe health and safety of persons or property when properly installed,\r\nmaintained and operated in accordance with their intended purpose.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should lay\r\ndown procedures for authorising the construction of planned cableway\r\ninstallations and the modification of such installations and for their\r\nentry into service in order to ensure that the cableway installation is safely\r\nconstructed and assembled on site, in accordance with the safety analysis and\r\nthe safety report and all relevant regulatory requirements.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The safety analysis for\r\nplanned cableway installations should identify the components on which the\r\nsafety of the cableway installation depends.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The safety analysis for\r\nplanned cableway installations should take into account the constraints linked\r\nto the operation of cableway installations, albeit not in such a way as to\r\njeopardise the principle of free movement of goods for subsystems and safety\r\ncomponents or the safety of the cableway installations themselves.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should aim\r\nto ensure the functioning of the internal market of subsystems of cableway\r\ninstallations and of safety components for cableway installations. Subsystems\r\nand safety components complying with the provisions of this Regulation should\r\nbenefit from the principle of free movement of goods.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsystems and safety\r\ncomponents should be allowed to be incorporated in a cableway installation\r\nprovided that they permit the construction of cableway installations which comply\r\nwith this Regulation and are not liable to endanger the health and safety of\r\npersons or property when properly installed, maintained and operated in\r\naccordance with their intended purpose.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The essential requirements\r\nshould be interpreted and applied so as to take account of the state of the art\r\nat the time of design and manufacture as well as of technical and economic\r\nconsiderations which are consistent with a high degree of health and safety\r\nprotection.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic operators should\r\nbe responsible for the compliance of subsystems and safety components with the\r\nrequirements of this Regulation, in relation to their respective roles in the\r\nsupply chain, so as to ensure a high level of protection of public interests,\r\nsuch as the health and safety of users and other persons and protection of property\r\nand to guarantee fair competition on the Union market.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All economic operators\r\nintervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate\r\nmeasures to ensure that they only make available on the market subsystems and\r\nsafety components which are in conformity with this Regulation. It is necessary\r\nto provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which\r\ncorrespond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution\r\nchain.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The manufacturer of\r\nsubsystems and safety components, having detailed knowledge of the design and\r\nproduction process, is best placed to carry out the complete conformity\r\nassessment procedure. Conformity assessment should therefore remain solely the\r\nobligation of the manufacturer of the subsystem or the safety component.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\r\ncommunication between economic operators and national market surveillance\r\nauthorities, Member States should encourage economic operators to include a\r\nwebsite address in addition to the postal address.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to ensure\r\nthat subsystems and safety components from third countries entering the Union\r\nmarket comply with the requirements of this Regulation, and in particular that\r\nappropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by\r\nmanufacturers with regard to those subsystems and safety components. Provision\r\nshould therefore be made for importers to make sure that the subsystem or\r\nsafety component they place on the market comply with the requirements of this\r\nRegulation and that they do not place on the market subsystems and safety\r\ncomponents which do not comply with such requirements or present a risk.\r\nProvision should also be made for importers to make sure that conformity assessment\r\nprocedures have been carried out and that subsystem and safety component marking\r\nand documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the\r\ncompetent supervisory authorities.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The distributor makes a\r\nsubsystem or a safety component available on the market after it has been\r\nplaced on the market by the manufacturer or the importer and should act with\r\ndue care to ensure that its handling of the subsystem or the safety component does\r\nnot adversely affect its compliance.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When placing on the market\r\na subsystem or a safety component, every importer should indicate on the subsystem\r\nor safety component his name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and\r\nthe postal address at which he can be contacted. Exceptions should be provided\r\nfor in cases where the size or nature of the safety component does not allow\r\nit. This includes cases where the importer would have to open the packaging to\r\nput his name and address on the safety component.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any economic operator that\r\neither places a subsystem or a safety component on the market under his own\r\nname or trademark or modifies a subsystem or a safety component in such a way\r\nthat compliance with the requirements of this Regulation may be affected should\r\nbe considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the\r\nmanufacturer.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Distributors and importers,\r\nbeing close to the market place, should be involved in market surveillance\r\ntasks carried out by the competent national authorities, and should be prepared\r\nto participate actively, providing those authorities with all necessary\r\ninformation relating to the subsystems or the safety components concerned.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ensuring traceability of a\r\nsubsystem or safety component throughout the whole supply chain helps to make\r\nmarket surveillance simpler and more efficient. An efficient traceability\r\nsystem facilitates market surveillance authorities' task of tracing economic\r\noperators who made non-compliant subsystems or safety components available on\r\nthe market.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should be limited\r\nto the expression of the essential requirements. In order to facilitate\r\nconformity assessment with those requirements it is necessary to provide for\r\npresumption of conformity for cableway installations which are in conformity\r\nwith harmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 1025/2012 for the purpose of expressing detailed technical specifications of\r\nthose requirements, especially with regard to the design, construction and operation\r\nof cableway installations.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n1025/2012 provides for a procedure for objections to harmonised standards where\r\nthose standards do not entirely satisfy the requirements of this Regulation.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to enable economic\r\noperators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to ensure that subsystems\r\nand safety components made available on the market conform to the essential\r\nrequirements, it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures.\r\nDecision No 768/2008/EC establishes modules for conformity assessment\r\nprocedures, which include procedures from the least to the most stringent, in\r\nproportion to the level of risk involved and the level of safety required. In\r\norder to ensure inter-sectoral coherence and to avoid ad-hoc variants,\r\nconformity assessment procedures should be chosen from among those modules.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Manufacturers of subsystems\r\nor safety components should draw up an EU declaration of conformity to provide information\r\nrequired under this Regulation on the conformity of subsystem or safety\r\ncomponent with the requirements of this Regulation and of other relevant Union\r\nharmonisation legislation. The EU declaration of conformity should accompany\r\nthe subsystem or safety component.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure effective access\r\nto information for market surveillance purposes, the information required to\r\nidentify all applicable Union acts for a subsystem or a safety component should\r\nbe available in a single EU declaration of conformity.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The CE marking, indicating\r\nthe conformity of a subsystem or a safety component is the visible consequence\r\nof a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. General\r\nprinciples governing the CE marking and its relationship with other markings are\r\nset out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Rules governing the affixing of the CE\r\nmarking should be laid down in this Regulation.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A check of compliance of subsystems\r\nand safety components with the essential requirements provided for in this\r\nRegulation is necessary in order to provide effective protection for users and\r\nthird parties.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\r\ncompliance of subsystems and safety components with the essential requirements,\r\nit is necessary to lay down appropriate conformity assessment procedures to be\r\nfollowed by the manufacturer. Those procedures should be set on the basis of the\r\nconformity assessment modules laid down in Decision No 768/2008/EC.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The conformity assessment\r\nprocedures set out in this Regulation require the intervention of conformity\r\nassessment bodies, which are notified by the Member States to the Commission.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience has shown that\r\nthe criteria set out in Directive 2000/9/EC that conformity assessment bodies have\r\nto fulfil in order to be notified to the Commission are not sufficient to\r\nensure a uniformly high level of performance of these bodies throughout the Union. It is, however, essential that all conformity assessment bodies perform their\r\nfunctions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition. That\r\nrequires the setting of obligatory requirements for conformity assessment\r\nbodies wishing to be notified in order to provide conformity assessment\r\nservices.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a\r\nconsistent level of conformity assessment quality, it is also necessary to set\r\nrequirements for notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the\r\nassessment, notification and monitoring of notified bodies.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a conformity assessment\r\nbody demonstrates conformity with the criteria laid down in harmonised\r\nstandards, it should be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements set\r\nout in this Regulation.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The system set out in this Regulation\r\nshould be complemented by the accreditation system provided for in Regulation\r\n(EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an essential means of verifying the\r\ncompetence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be used for the\r\npurposes of notification.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transparent accreditation\r\nas provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of\r\nconfidence in conformity certificates, should be considered by the national\r\npublic authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating\r\nthe technical competence of conformity assessment bodies. However, national\r\nauthorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying\r\nout that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the\r\nappropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national\r\nauthorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the\r\nconformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory\r\nrequirements.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conformity assessment\r\nbodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the\r\nassessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to\r\nsafeguard the level of protection required for the subsystems and safety\r\ncomponents to be placed on the Union market, it is essential that conformity\r\nassessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified\r\nbodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks.\r\nTherefore, it is important that the assessment of the competence and the\r\nperformance of bodies to be notified and the monitoring of bodies already\r\nnotified cover also activities carried out by subcontractors and subsidiaries.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to increase\r\nthe efficiency and transparency of the notification procedure and, in\r\nparticular, to adapt it to new technologies so as to enable online\r\nnotification.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since conformity assessment\r\nbodies may offer their services throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give\r\nthe other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections\r\nconcerning a notified body. It is therefore important to provide for a period\r\nduring which any doubts or concerns as to the competence of conformity\r\nassessment bodies can be clarified before they start operating as notified\r\nbodies.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the interests of\r\ncompetitiveness, it is crucial that conformity assessment bodies apply the\r\nconformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for\r\neconomic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of\r\neconomic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity\r\nassessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through\r\nappropriate coordination and cooperation between conformity assessment bodies.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred to the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council[17].\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The advisory procedure\r\nshould be used for the adoption of implementing acts requesting the notifying Member State to take the necessary corrective measures in respect of notified bodies that\r\ndo not meet or no longer meet the requirements for their notification.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to provide\r\nfor transitional arrangements that allow the making available on the market and\r\nthe putting into service of subsystems and safety components that have already\r\nbeen placed on the market in accordance with Directive 2000/9/EC.\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to provide\r\nfor transitional arrangements that allow the entry into service of cableway\r\ninstallations that have already been constructed in accordance with Directive\r\n2000/9/EC.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should lay\r\ndown rules on penalties applicable to infringements to this Regulation and\r\nensure that they are implemented. Those penalties must be effective, proportionate\r\nand dissuasive.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nRegulation, namely to ensure that cableway installations fulfil the\r\nrequirements providing for a high level protection of and safety of users while\r\nguaranteeing the functioning of the internal market for subsystems and safety\r\ncomponents cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can\r\ntherefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union\r\nlevel, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of\r\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In\r\naccordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article,\r\nthis Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that\r\nobjective.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 GENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject\r\nmatter\nThis Regulation lays down rules on the\r\ndesign and
