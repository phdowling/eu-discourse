The Regulation entered into force on 30 July\r\n2006.\nThe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the\r\nEuropean Union, which has become legally binding with the entry into force of\r\nthe Treaty of Lisbon in December 2009, applies to the institutions, bodies,\r\noffices and agencies of the Union as well as to the member States when they are\r\nimplementing Union law. \nThe European Commission amended Annexes II\r\nand III to this Regulation by means of Implementing Regulation (EU) No\r\n1352/2011 which came in force on 21 December 2011, primarily with a view to\r\nestablishing export controls on certain medicinal products to prevent the use\r\nof such products for capital punishment (execution by means of lethal\r\ninjection). This amendment was accompanied by guidance for the application of\r\nArticles 5 and 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005, as set out in Commission\r\nStaff Working Paper SEC(2011)1624 of 20 December 2011.\nThe Commission also started a process to\r\nreview Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 in its entirety, responding in particular\r\nto a Resolution of the European Parliament of 17 June 2010 [1]. In spring 2012, the Commission\r\nissued a call for applications with a view to establishing a Group of Experts to\r\nassist it with this review. During the period from July 2012 to July 2013, the\r\nGroup of Experts met six times in Brussels with relevant Commission services.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nFollowing publication of Commission\r\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 1352/2011, a number of EU manufacturers of\r\nmedicinal products expressed their opposition to the use of their products for\r\ncapital punishment. The EU manufacturers of one medicinal product that is not\r\nsubject to the export controls but might be used for lethal injections in the\r\nUnited States of America, have informed the European Commission of the measures\r\nthey have taken in order to ensure that their distributors in third countries prevent\r\nsupplies of this product from being used for capital punishment. Both the\r\nexporting manufacturers and the competent authorities have indicated that the\r\ncurrent system of controlling exports of medicinal products, which represent a\r\nlarge number of export transactions per annum, is unnecessarily cumbersome.\nThe Group of Experts provided valuable input\r\nin the review process, mainly as regards case-law of the European Court of\r\nHuman Rights and on the subject of goods marketed as suitable for law\r\nenforcement which might be used for the purpose of torture or other cruel,\r\ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The experts were in favour of\r\nadditional measures to help prevent violations of human rights, but also\r\nrecognised that restrictions on trade have to be assessed on a basis other than\r\njust a prohibition on using equipment for law enforcement purposes. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export controls targeting\r\ncapital punishment\nAs of 21 December 2011 Annex III includes a\r\nsection entitled \u2018Products which could be used for the execution of human\r\nbeings by means of lethal injection\u2019. The related export controls should be\r\napplied to prevent the use of such products for capital punishment in third\r\ncountries. The current text of Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 establishes an\r\nexport control regime that aims to prevent goods exported from the EU from\r\nbeing used for torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or\r\npunishment. A specific chapter dealing with export controls that should be\r\napplied with a view to preventing controlled goods from being used for capital\r\npunishment and a specific list of controlled goods, which will be referred to\r\nbelow as Annex IIIa, should be inserted in the Regulation to provide\r\nclarity on the purpose and modalities of these controls.\nTorture and other forms of cruel, inhuman\r\nor degrading treatment or punishment tend to be unlawful and are in many cases\r\nnot nation-wide occurrences, especially given that international instruments prohibit\r\ntorture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment without\r\nexception. By contrast capital punishment is usually provided for by law, if a\r\ncountry has not abolished it. It is therefore appropriate to address the\r\nquestion of whether any country should be exempt from controls aimed at\r\npreventing capital punishment. \nIn 1983, the European Convention for the\r\nProtection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter the European\r\nConvention on Human Rights) was supplemented by Protocol No 6 prohibiting the\r\ndeath penalty. This Protocol allowed States to make statutory provision for the\r\ndeath penalty in respect of acts committed in times of war or of imminent\r\nthreat of war. In 2003, Protocol No 13 prohibited the death penalty in all\r\ncircumstances. These Protocols were ratified by the Member States of the EU and\r\nalso by a number of other States that are members of the Council of Europe.\r\nAlbania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, FYROM,\r\nMoldova, Montenegro, Norway, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey and\r\nUkraine have ratified them and abolished capital punishment in all circumstances.\r\n Armenia and Azerbaijan have only ratified Protocol No 6.\nIn 1989, the UN General Assembly adopted\r\nand proclaimed the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on\r\nCivil and Political Rights which aims at abolition of the death penalty.\r\nThe States Parties to this Protocol undertake to abolish the death penalty, but\r\nArticle 2 allows them to make a reservation, at the time of ratification or\r\naccession, that provides for the application of the death penalty pursuant to a\r\nconviction for a most serious crime of a military nature committed during\r\nwartime. In addition to the Member States of the EU and a number of other\r\nEuropean states, Argentina, Australia, Benin, Bolivia, Canada, Cape Verde,\r\nColombia, Costa Rica, Djibouti, Ecuador, Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, Kyrgyzstan,\r\nLiberia, Madagascar, Mexico, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, New Zealand,\r\nNicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Philippines, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe,\r\nSeychelles, South Africa, Timor-Leste, Turkmenistan, Uruguay, Uzbekistan and\r\nVenezuela have become Parties to this Protocol without reservation. Azerbaijan, Brazil and Chile have also joined but made the Article 2 reservation.\nGiven these firm international commitments under\r\neither Protocol No 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights or, without\r\nhaving made the Article 2 reservation, the Second Optional Protocol to the\r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, exports to the States that\r\nare parties to one of them need not be subject to specific authorisation in order\r\nto prevent the relevant goods from being used for for capital punishment and\r\ncan be covered by a general export authorisation. Such authorisation should be\r\nsubject to appropriate conditions to avoid the diversion of the goods to a\r\ncountry that has not abolished capital punishment without prior scrutiny by the\r\ncompetent authorities. The general authorisation should, therefore, only apply\r\nwhere the end-user of the exported goods is established in the country of\r\ndestination and no re-export to another country takes place. If these\r\nconditions are not met, a request for a specific or global authorisation should\r\nbe made to the competent authorities. \n3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Additional measures\r\nconcerning listed goods\nAs regards the current export controls\r\napplied with a view to preventing goods exported from the EU from being used for\r\nthe purpose of capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading\r\ntreatment or punishment, it has been suggested that the current trade\r\nrestrictions should be supplemented by restrictions on brokering services,\r\ntechnical assistance and transit. In this regard, similar issues arise when\r\nexamining whether such restrictions are necessary and proportionate to prevent\r\ngoods listed in Annex IIIa from being used for capital punishment, on the one\r\nhand, or to prevent goods listed in Annex III from being used for torture and\r\nother cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment on the other. One\r\nsingle assessment can therefore be made, although the purpose and possible\r\nexemptions would differ, if additional restrictions are considered necessary\r\nand proportionate.\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Brokering services related\r\nto goods listed in Annex II\nAs regards equipment or goods listed in\r\nAnnex II, the current provisions (Articles 3 and 4) already cover the supply of\r\ntechnical assistance and the definitions of import and export ensure that the\r\nentry and departure of transiting equipment or goods fall under the\r\nprohibitions. The provision of brokering services in relation to such equipment\r\nor goods is not prohibited. Based on the definition of brokering services in\r\nRegulation (EC) No 428/2009, which sets up the EU regime for the control of\r\nexports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items, brokering of\r\nequipment or goods that are not located in the EU could be prohibited. It would\r\nadd a useful dimension to the current prohibition, which only extends to\r\nequipment or goods located in the EU. Since the only use to which equipment or goods\r\nlisted in Annex II can be put is forbidden, a prohibition on the provision of brokering\r\nservices is a necessary and proportionate measure to protect public morals. \n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Brokering services related\r\nto goods listed in Annex III or in Annex IIIa and transit of such goods\nExports of equipment or goods listed in\r\nAnnex III or in Annex IIIa are subject to controls. Such equipment or goods\r\nhave both legitimate and non-legitimate uses, a characteristic they have in\r\ncommon with dual-use items controlled by Regulation (EC) No 428/2009. That\r\nRegulation does not subject the provision of brokering services to\r\ncomprehensive controls, nor does it control all transiting items in a\r\ncomprehensive manner. The competent authorities may in a specific case inform\r\nthe broker that the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety\r\nor in part, for use in connection with the development, production, handling,\r\noperation, maintenance, storage, detection, identification or dissemination of\r\nchemical, biological or nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or\r\nthe development, production, maintenance or storage of missiles capable of\r\ndelivering such weapons. On the same grounds they may prohibit transit of\r\nspecific goods.\nWhereas the prohibitions of torture or\r\nother cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment and of capital\r\npunishment have a basis in international law, the corresponding restrictions on\r\ntrade are not regulated by any international norms. This distinguishes\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1236/2005 from Regulation (EC) No 428/2009, which gives\r\neffect to a number of international export control regimes. Since the 2009 Regulation\r\nrelates to international security, intelligence gathering by the Member States and third countries as regards chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and\r\ntheir delivery systems is well developed. However, as regards equipment or goods\r\nthat could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or\r\ndegrading treatment or punishment, it is unlikely that such intelligence gathering\r\ntakes place and the competent authorities probably lack the data they need to\r\ninform an exporter about the intended end-use.\nWhere trade restrictions are applied, they\r\nshould not go beyond what is proportionate. This requirement is considered to stand\r\nin the way of applying comprehensive controls on transit and on the provision of\r\nbrokering services related to equipment or goods listed in Annex III or in Annex\r\nIIIa, since the latter have legitimate uses but could be used for torture or\r\nother cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or for capital\r\npunishment, respectively. Given that such acts are in breach of public morals, brokers\r\nbased in the EU should not derive benefits from trade promoting or otherwise\r\nfacilitating them. There should, therefore, be a prohibition on the provision\r\nof related brokering services by any broker who is aware that controlled\r\nequipment or goods that are to be delivered to a third country but are not\r\nlocated in the EU, are or may be intended for such use. This prohibition would\r\nalso apply if, in an exceptional case, the competent authorities have\r\nsufficient data to inform the broker of the intended end-use.\nTransiting goods which leave the customs\r\nterritory of the EU for a destination in a third country are goods that were\r\nshipped from another third country. A ban on exports of such goods to a third\r\ncountry by an economic operator who is aware that the goods are or may be\r\nintended for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading\r\ntreatment or punishment, would typically apply to an economic operator who is not\r\nbased in the EU and therefore have to be enforced in a third country. Because\r\ninformation on the end-user will usually not be available to economic operators\r\ntransporting the transiting goods within the customs territory of the EU, it is\r\nnot considered proportionate to impose a prohibition on the transporter.\r\nAccordingly, a prohibition based on an economic operator\u2019s knowledge about the\r\nintended use of transiting goods listed in Annex III or in Annex IIIa would not\r\nbe appropriate. \n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technical assistance\r\nrelated to goods listed in Annex III or in Annex IIIa\nAs regards technical assistance relating to\r\ngoods listed in Annex III or in Annex IIIa, there are currently no controls on the\r\nsupply of such assistance to third countries. Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 does\r\nnot contain an explicit provision on technical assistance, but includes\r\ntransmission of (listed) technology and software items in the definition of\r\nexports. Although \u2018technical assistance\u2019 may have a slightly broader meaning\r\nthan transmission of technology, such transmission is subjected to\r\ncomprehensive controls. Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 gives effect to a number of\r\ninternational export control regimes and relates to international security. It\r\nseeks to prevent proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and\r\ntheir delivery systems. The transmission of technology and software is therefore\r\ncontrolled in order to prevent a country from developing its own capacity to\r\nmanufacture goods that the EU controls and would not export to it. \nRegulation (EC) No 1236/2005 aims at preventing\r\nsupplies to certain end-users who would use relevant equipment or goods from\r\nthe EU for torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\r\nor for capital punishment, not at preventing a third country\u2019s acquisition of\r\ntechnology relating to such equipment or goods. Comprehensive controls on the\r\nsupply of technical assistance related to the listed equipment or goods are not\r\nconsidered proportionate. Given that capital punishment, torture and other forms\r\nof cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are in breach of public\r\nmorals, suppliers of technical assistance based in the EU should not derive\r\nbenefits from trade promoting or otherwise facilitating them. There should,\r\ntherefore, be a prohibition on the supply of technical assistance by anyone who\r\nis aware that the controlled equipment or goods to which the assistance\r\nsupplied to a third country relates, is or may be intended for such use. This\r\nprohibition would also apply if, in an exceptional case, the competent\r\nauthorities have sufficient data to inform the supplier of technical assistance\r\nof the intended end-use of the goods to which such assistance relates.\n3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definition of torture and\r\nother cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\nThe definition of torture used for the\r\npurpose of Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 was taken from the 1984 UN Convention\r\nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\r\nAlthough based on this international instrument, \u2018other cruel, inhuman or\r\ndegrading treatment or punishment\u2019 is not defined in the UN Convention. The\r\ncase-law of the European Court of Human Rights indicates that the definition in\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1236/2005 needs to be reconsidered. As stipulated in Article\r\n52(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, in so far as the Charter\r\ncontains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the European Convention\r\nfor the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and\r\nscope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said\r\nConvention.\nThe definition in Regulation (EC) No\r\n1236/2005 currently covers acts inflicting \u2018significant pain or suffering\u2019,\r\nwhereas the definition of torture refers to \u2018severe pain or suffering\u2019. Instead\r\nof being based on different levels of pain or suffering, the distinction\r\nbetween these types of acts should take account of the presence or absence of an\r\nintention to inflict pain or suffering and of the use of pain or suffering for\r\na purpose included in the definition of torture. In its judgement of 13\r\nDecember 2012, Khaled El-Masri v. FYROM (Application No 39630/09), the European\r\nCourt of Human Rights held as regards Article 3 of the European Convention on Human\r\nRights and with reference to earlier case-law:\n\u2018196. In order for ill-treatment to fall within\r\nthe scope of Article 3 it must attain a minimum level of severity. The\r\nassessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case, such\r\nas the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some\r\ncases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim \u2026 . Further factors\r\ninclude the purpose for which the treatment was inflicted together with the\r\nintention or motivation behind it \u2026 .\n197. In order to determine whether any\r\nparticular form of ill-treatment should be classified as torture, the Court\r\nmust have regard to the distinction drawn in Article 3 between this notion and\r\nthat of inhuman or degrading treatment. This distinction would appear to have\r\nbeen embodied in the Convention to allow the special stigma of \u201ctorture\u201d to\r\nattach only to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel\r\nsuffering \u2026 In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive\r\nelement, as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture and\r\nOther Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which came into\r\nforce on 26 June 1987, which defines torture in terms of the intentional\r\ninfliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining\r\ninformation, inflicting punishment or intimidating (Article 1 of the United\r\nNations Convention) \u2026 .\u2019\nAs regards the exclusion, from both\r\ndefinitions, of pain or suffering arising only from lawful penalties, a\r\nclarification is appropriate. Whereas deprivation of liberty is, in principle,\r\na lawful penalty, the European Court of Human Rights holds that it is up to the\r\nrelevant State to ensure that the conditions of detention are compatible with\r\nrespect for human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the\r\nmeasure do not subject the detained person to distress or hardship of an\r\nintensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention\r\nand that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his or her health and\r\nwell-being are adequately secured. The case-law shows that the cumulative\r\neffects of the conditions of detention may amount to a violation of Article 3\r\nof the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular where cells are\r\novercrowded and insanitary conditionsprevail. The following judgements of the\r\nEuropean Court of Human Rights provide some examples of such violations: \n15 July 2002, V. Kalashnikov v. Russia (Application No 47095/99), \n4 February 2003, F. Van der Ven v. the Netherlands (Application No 50901/99),\n11 March 2004, P. Iorgov v. Bulgaria (Application No 40653/98), \n8 July 2004, I. Ila\u015fcu and others v. Moldova and Russia (Application no. 48787/99), \n20 November 2008, A. I\u015fyar v. Bulgaria (Application No 391/03),\n2 July 2009, M. Kochetkov v. Estonia (Application No 41653/05), \n16 July 2009, I. Sulejmanovic v. Italy (Application No 22635/03), \n10 January 2012, S. Ananyev and others v. Russia (Applications Nos 42525/07 and 60800/08), \n22 May 2012, T. Idalov v. Russia (Application No 5826/03).\n3.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Implementing or delegated\r\npowers \nRegulation (EC) No 1236/2005 empowers the\r\nEuropean Commission to amend the Annexes. Except for Annex I, the Commission is\r\nassisted by a Committee composed of Member State representatives. The\r\nexamination procedure described in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 applies (pursuant\r\nto Article 13(1)(c) of the Regulation).\nThe Commission has made proposals on the\r\ngranting of delegated and implementing powers in the field of the common\r\ncommercial policy (COM(2011) 82 and COM(2011) 349). In June 2013 the European\r\nParliament and the Council reached an agreement on the way forward on these\r\nCommission proposals; they are expected to adopt a Regulation towards the end\r\nof 2013, which will, inter alia, amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 in\r\norder to provide for delegated powers.\nThe question of whether an urgency\r\nprocedure should be applied for amendments of certain Annexes to Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1236/2005 has, however, not been addressed. The Commission\r\nconsiders such a procedure appropriate where the lists of prohibited and\r\ncontrolled goods are amended, especially if new equipment or goods enter the\r\nmarket and it is imperative to apply the relevant measure immediately to\r\nprevent building of stocks during the period of two months (assuming it is not\r\nextended) that is allotted to the European Parliament and to the Council for expressing\r\nany objection they may have to the measure.\n2014/0005 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1236/2005 concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital\r\npunishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or\r\npunishment\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments, \nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1236/2005[2]\r\nwas approved in 2005 and entered into force on 30 July 2006. In response to\r\ncalls from the European Parliament in 2010 and indications that medicines\r\nexported from the Union had been used for capital punishment in a third\r\ncountry, the lists of prohibited and controlled goods in Annexes II and III to that\r\nRegulation were amended by means of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No\r\n1352/2011.[3]\r\nThe Commission, assisted by a Group of Experts, reviewed the need for further\r\namendments to Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 and its Annexes. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Charter of Fundamental\r\nRights of the European Union has become legally binding with the entry into\r\nforce of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009.[4] The definition of\r\ntorture in Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 was taken from the 1984 United Nations\r\nConvention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or\r\nPunishment and continues to be valid. The definition of \u2018other cruel, inhuman\r\nor degrading treatment or punishment\u2019, which is not found in the Convention,\r\nshould be amended to align it with the case-law of the European Court of Human\r\nRights. It is also appropriate to clarify the meaning of the term \u2018lawful\r\npenalties\u2019 in the definitions of \u2018torture\u2019 and \u2018other cruel, inhuman or\r\ndegrading treatment or punishment\u2019, taking into account this case-law and the Union\u2019s policy on capital punishment.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Articles 5, 6 and 7 of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1236/2005 establish an export licensing system designed to\r\nprevent the relevant goods from being used for capital punishment, torture or\r\nother cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These measures should not\r\ngo beyond what is proportionate. They should, therefore, not prevent the export\r\nof medicinal products used for legitimate therapeutic purposes.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the different\r\ncharacteristics of capital punishment, on the one hand, and torture and other\r\ncruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment on the other, it is\r\nappropriate to establish a specific export licensing system with a view to\r\npreventing the use of certain goods for capital punishment. Such a system\r\nshould take into account the fact that a number of countries have abolished\r\ncapital punishment for all crimes and have made an international commitment on\r\nthis issue. As there is a risk of re-export to countries that have not done so,\r\ncertain conditions and requirements should be imposed when authorising exports\r\nto countries that have abolished capital punishment. It is, therefore, appropriate\r\nto grant a general export authorisation for exports to those countries that\r\nhave abolished capital punishment for all crimes and confirmed it with an\r\ninternational commitment.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a country has not abolished\r\ncapital punishment in this way, the competent authorities should, when\r\nexamining a request for an export authorisation, check whether there is a risk\r\nthat the end-user in the country of destination would use the exported goods\r\nfor such punishment. Appropriate conditions and requirements should be imposed\r\nto control sales or transfers to third parties by the end-user. If multiple\r\nshipments between the same exporter and end-user take place, the competent\r\nauthorities should be allowed to review the status of the end-user on a\r\nperiodic basis, e.g. every six months, rather than every time an authorisation\r\nis granted, without prejudice to their right to annul, suspend, modify or\r\nrevoke an export authorisation in accordance with Article 9(4) of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1236/2005 where warranted. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to limit the administrative\r\nburden for exporters the competent authorities should be allowed to grant an exporter\r\na global authorisation for all shipments of medicinal products from the\r\nexporter to a specific end-user during a fixed period of time, specifying a\r\nquantity corresponding to the end-user\u2019s normal use of the goods, where deemed\r\nnecessary. Such authorisation would, in accordance with Article 9(1) of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1236/2005 be valid for not more than twelve months with a\r\npossible extension of up to twelve months. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Granting a global\r\nauthorisation would also be appropriate where a manufacturer needs to export medicinal\r\nproducts controlled by Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 to a distributor in a\r\ncountry that has not abolished capital punishment, provided the exporter and the\r\ndistributor have concluded a legally binding agreement requiring the\r\ndistributor to apply an appropriate set of measures ensuring that the medicinal\r\nproducts will not be used for capital punishment.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The medicinal products governed\r\nby Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 may be subject to controls in accordance with\r\ninternational conventions on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, such\r\nas the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Since such controls are not\r\napplied to prevent the relevant medicinal products from being used for capital\r\npunishment but to prevent illicit drug trafficking, the export controls of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1236/2005 should be applied in addition to the international\r\ncontrols. Member States should, however, be encouraged to use a single\r\nprocedure in order to apply both control systems. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to limit the\r\nadministrative burden for exporters the competent authorities should be allowed\r\nto grant an exporter a global authorisation in respect of goods that are controlled\r\nto prevent the relevant goods from being used for torture or for other cruel,\r\ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The controls on exports in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 should not apply to goods whose\r\nexport is controlled in accordance with Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP[5], Council Regulation\r\n(EC) No 428/2009[6]\r\nand Regulation (EU) No 258/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[7]. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to prohibit\r\nbrokers in the Union from providing brokering services in relation to goods\r\nwhose export and import are prohibited as such goods have no practical use\r\nother than for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading\r\ntreatment or punishment. Prohibiting the provision of such services serves the\r\npurpose of protecting public morals. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where controls on exports\r\nare applied, the provision of brokering services and the supply of technical\r\nassistance in relation to any of the listed goods should be prohibited, if the\r\nbroker or supplier of technical assistance is aware that the relevant goods are\r\nor may be intended for capital punishment, when the controls are applied to\r\nprevent use for such punishment, or for torture or other cruel, inhuman or\r\ndegrading treatment or punishment, when the controls are intended to prevent\r\nsuch use. An economic operator shall have grounds for suspecting that the goods\r\nare or may be intended for such non-legitimate use, inter alia, if a competent\r\nauthority has informed it that the goods are or may be intended for such\r\nnon-legitimate use,\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to give economic\r\noperators and enforcement authorities some time to make the changes to their\r\noperational procedures that are needed to comply with and enforce these\r\nprohibitions, a short transitional period should be defined.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to make\r\nit compulsory for customs authorities to share certain information with other\r\ncustoms authorities and, when they detect prohibited exports or imports of\r\ngoods or exports of goods for which the required authorisation has not been\r\ngranted, to inform the relevant authorities with a view to imposing penalties\r\non the economic operator that committed the infringement.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\r\nclarify that, to the extent that it concerns personal data, processing and\r\nexchange of information should comply with the applicable rules on processing\r\nand exchange of personal data in accordance with the rules laid down in\r\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament[8]\r\nand of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council[9].\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to adopt the\r\nprovisions necessary for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005, the\r\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in\r\nrespect of amending Annexes I, II, III, IIIa, IIIb, IV and V to that Regulation.\r\nIt is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate\r\nconsultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The\r\nCommission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure\r\nsimultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the\r\nEuropean Parliament and to the Council.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to make\r\nprovision for immediate application of the Commission act, where, in the case\r\nof amendment of Annex II, III or IIIa to Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005, there\r\nare imperative grounds of urgency for such amendment.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission does not\r\nprocure equipment for law enforcement purposes since it is not responsible for maintenance\r\nof law and order, proceedings in criminal matters or the enforcement of judicial\r\ndecisions in criminal matters. Therefore, a procedure should be established to ensure\r\nthat the Commission receives information on non-listed law enforcement\r\nequipment and products marketed in the Union in order to ensure that the lists\r\nof prohibited and controlled goods are updated to take account of new\r\ndevelopments. The Commission should inform the competent authorities of the\r\nMember States of any duly substantiated request to add goods to Annex II, to\r\nAnnex III or to Annex IIIa it receives from a Member State, before it takes a\r\ndecision to amend the relevant Annex, \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 is\r\namended as follows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 1 is replaced by the\r\nfollowing:\n\u2018Article 1\nSubject\r\nmatter\nThis Regulation lays down Union rules\r\ngoverning trade with third countries in goods that could be used for the\r\npurpose of capital punishment or for the purpose of torture or other cruel,\r\ndegrading or inhuman treatment or punishment, and governing also the provision of\r\nbrokering services and the supply of technical assistance related to such\r\ngoods.\u2019\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 2 is amended as follows: \n(a)         \r\nPoints (a) and (b) are replaced by the\r\nfollowing:\n\u2018(a) \u2018torture\u2019 means any act by which severe\r\npain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a\r\nperson for such purposes as obtaining from that person or from a third person\r\ninformation or a confession, punishing that person for an act that either that\r\nperson or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or\r\nintimidating or coercing that person or a third person, or for any reason based\r\non discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted either\r\nby or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public\r\nofficial or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not, however,\r\ninclude pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful\r\npenalties, but includes pain or suffering caused by the cumulative effects of deficiencies\r\nof the conditions of detention, such as cramped conditions of accommodation,\r\nlack of hygiene or of medical care and assistance, denial of contacts with the outside\r\nworld, or an impoverished detention regime, irrespective of any specific or\r\npositive intention to inflict pain or suffering by those who are in charge of\r\nthe prison or other place of detention, even if a natural person is deprived of\r\nhis liberty in accordance with the law.
