In February 2008, following the decision of accession\r\nof Ukraine to the WTO, the EU and Ukraine launched negotiations on a Deep and\r\nComprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), as a core element of the Association\r\nAgreement.\nThe Association\r\nAgreement is the most advanced of its typed ever negotiated by the EU in\r\nparticular with regard to trade and economic integration, going far beyond a\r\nsimple market opening. The aim is to accelerate the deepening of political and\r\neconomic relations between Ukraine and the EU, as well as to advance Ukraine's gradual economic integration with the EU Internal Market in selected areas,\r\nnotably through establishing a DCFTA.\nOn 23 June 2014,\r\nthe Council adopted its decision [1]on\r\nthe signing, on behalf of the European Union and the European Atomic Energy\r\nCommunity and their Member States, and provisional application of certain\r\nprovisions of the remaining chapters of the Association Agreement, including\r\nits Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) part between the European\r\nUnion and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the\r\none part, and Ukraine, of the other part. The political chapters of the\r\nAgreement had previously been signed on 21 March 2014[2].\r\nSubsequently, the Agreement was signed in Brussels on Friday, 27 June 2014 in\r\nthe margins of the European Council.\u00a0 \nUkraine\r\nratified the Agreement in September and exchanged notifications in that regard\r\nwith the EU within the same month meaning that provisional application may\r\ncommence from 1 November 2014. However, following consultations with the\r\nUkrainian side and in the context of the overall efforts for the implementation\r\nof the peace process in Ukraine, it was agreed to delay until 31 December 2015\r\nthe provisional application of the trade-related provisions of the Association\r\nAgreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community\r\nand their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part ('the\r\nAssociation Agreement') (Title IV), and at the same time to continue the\r\napplication of the Union's autonomous trade measures for the benefit of\r\nUkraine. \nConsequently, the\r\nprovisional application of the relevant provisions of Titles III, IV, V, VI and\r\nVII, and the related Annexes and Protocols, of the Association Agreement is to\r\ntake effect in stages. In respect of Titles III, V, VI and VII, and the related\r\nAnnexes and Protocols, the notification provided for in Article 486 of the\r\nAssociation Agreement was made end of September, in conjunction with the\r\nnotification of provisions provided for in Article 4 of Council Decision\r\n2014/295/EU1. In respect of Title IV, and the related Annexes and Protocols,\r\nthe notification was made so that the provisional application may take effect\r\non 1 January 2016 following a further notification as provided for in Article\r\n486 of the Association Agreement. \nThe provisional\r\napplication is foreseen in view of keeping mutual economic interests and shared\r\nvalues in equilibrium, and the common will of the EU and Ukraine to start\r\nimplementing and enforcing the eligible parts of the Agreement in order to\r\nadvance an early reform impact on sector specific issues before the conclusion\r\nof the Agreement.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF THE\r\nNEGOTIATIONS\nTitle VII of the\r\nAgreement with Ukraine provides for the institutional framework that is\r\nnecessary for the proper function and the implementation of the Agreements. The\r\nAgreement establishes an Association Council (Article 461(1)) at ministerial\r\nlevel to supervise and monitor the application and implementation of the\r\nAgreement. \nTo prepare the\r\nmeetings and deliberations of the Association Council, implement the decisions\r\nof the Association Council where appropriate and, in general, ensure continuity\r\nof the association relationship and the proper function of the Agreement an\r\nAssociation Committee is also established (as per Article 464(1)). \nThe Association\r\nCouncil as well as the Association Committee may decide to set up any other\r\nSub-Committee or body that can assist it in carrying out its duties, and shall\r\ndetermine the composition and duties of such committees or bodies and how they\r\nshall function. Furthermore, the Association Council has\r\nthe power to amend or update the Annexes to the Agreement (Article 463(3) of\r\nthe Agreement). It may delegate any of its powers to the Association Committee,\r\nincluding the power to take binding decisions (Article 465(2) of the\r\nAgreement).\nThe Association\r\nCommittee shall meet in a specific configuration to address all issues,\r\nderiving from Title IV \"Trade and Trade-related matters\" (Article 465(4) of the Agreement). The DCFTA part\r\nof the Agreement foresees specific Sub-Committees on Sanitary &\r\nPhytosanitary matters, customs, geographical indicators and trade &\r\nsustainable development to assist the Association Committee with its duties. \nFora for civil\r\nsociety and parliamentary cooperation are also foreseen.\nWith\r\na view to ensuring smooth and timely implementation of the DCFTA part of the\r\nAgreement, in particular with regard to the updates or amendment of several\r\ntrade-related Annexes to the Agreement, it is suggested to delegate such powers\r\nfrom the Association Council to the Association Committee in Trade\r\nconfiguration. Such delegation will ensure the necessary link between, and\r\ncreate conditions for a timely follow-up to, the technical discussions within\r\nthat Committee on the implementation of trade-related commitments, including\r\nthose pertaining to approximation to the EU acquis by Ukraine. \nWith a view to\r\ncompleting the institutional framework and allowing for expert level\r\ndiscussions in the key areas falling within the scope of provisional\r\napplication of the Agreements, it is suggested to establish two Sub-Committees,\r\ndesignated as follows: \n(1)\r\nSub-Committee on Justice, Freedom & Security (JFS); \n(2)\r\nSub-Committee on Economic and other Sector cooperation. \nThe purpose of\r\nthe Sub-Committees is to focus on those topics where concrete results are\r\nexpected, rather than to necessarily cover the same agenda of topics year after\r\nyear. \nAdditional\r\nSub-Committees may be established at a later stage, following agreement of the\r\nParties.\nThe Association\r\nAgreement foresees a wide range of sector cooperation, focusing on support to\r\ncore reforms, economic recovery and growth, governance and sector cooperation\r\nin 28 areas, such as; justice, energy, transport, statistics, environment\r\nprotection and promotion, industrial and small and medium enterprise\r\ncooperation, agriculture and rural development, social policies, justice, civil\r\nsociety cooperation, consumer policy, public administration reform, education,\r\ntraining and youth as well as cultural cooperation. \nIn all of these\r\nareas, enhanced cooperation starts from the basis of current frameworks, both\r\nbilateral and multilateral, with the aim of more systematic dialogue and\r\nexchange of information and good practice. Key to the sectoral cooperation\r\nchapters is a comprehensive menu of gradual approximation, where relevant, with\r\nthe EU acquis set out in annexes to the Agreement. Specific schedules\r\nfor approximation and implementation by Ukraine of selected parts of the EU acquis\r\nwill provide a focus for on-going cooperation, and will form the core of Ukraine's domestic reform and modernisation agenda. \nAny\r\n\"regular dialogues\" as frequently referred to in the Agreement may\r\ncover all of the aforementioned policy areas.\u00a0 The second Sub-Committee may\r\nthus meet in different configurations as the need arises. This proposal draws\r\non experience with the Partnership & Cooperation Agreement with Ukraine and aims to streamline the functioning of the Sub-Committee structure under the\r\nAssociation Agreement. \nBoth\r\nthe EU and Ukraine have committed to a rapid and effective implementation of\r\nthe Agreement. The aim of this proposal is therefore to ensure that the\r\ninstitutional framework of the Agreement becomes operational as soon as\r\npossible. In order to facilitate this it will be crucial to proceed rapidly\r\nwith the adoption process of the Rules of Procedure for the Association\r\nCouncil, the Association Committee and the Sub-Committees so that these can\r\nsoon start functioning. It is intended to call the first meeting of the\r\nAssociation Council with Ukraine as soon as possibly after the start of\r\nprovisional implementation, ideally before the end of the year.\u00a0 \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nFor the Union, the legal basis for authorising the Union position to be adopted in the\r\nAssociation Council established by the Association Agreement between the EU and\r\nUkraine is the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, and in\r\nparticular its Article 218 (9) TFEU. For EURATOM, the legal basis for\r\nauthorising its position to be adopted in the Association Council established\r\nby the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine is the\r\nTreaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular\r\nArticle 101 thereof.\nIn light of the above-mentioned results of negotiations, on the\r\nbasis of Article 218(9) TFEU and of Article 101 of the EURATOM Treaty the\r\nEuropean Commission proposes that the Council adopt the Decision authorising\r\nthe position of the Union and of the European Atomic Energy Community to be\r\nadopted in the first EU-Ukraine Association Council with regard to:\u00a0 \n-                   \r\n\u00a0\u00a0the\r\nrules of procedure for the Association Council and the Association Committee, \n\u2013                        \r\nthe establishment of two Sub-Committees,\nand\n\u2013                        \r\nthe delegation of certain powers from the\r\nAssociation Council to the Association Committee in Trade configuration. \nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL AND COMMISSION DECISION\nOn the position to be adopted on behalf of\r\nthe Union and the European Atomic Energy Community in the Association Council\r\nestablished by the Association Agreement between the European Union and the\r\nEuropean Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and\r\nUkraine, of the other part, in relation to the adoption of the rules of procedure\r\nof the Association Council and of the Association Committee, to the\r\nestablishment of two Sub-Committees, and to the delegation of certain powers by\r\nthe Association Council to the Association Committee in Trade configuration\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving\r\nregard to the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, and in\r\nparticular its Article 218 (9),\nHaving\r\nregard to the proposal from the Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)              \r\nArticle 486of the Association Agreement (\u201dthe\r\nAgreement\u201d) between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community\r\nand their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part\r\nprovide for provisional application of the Agreement in part.\n(2)              \r\nArticle 4 of the Council Decisions of 17 March\r\n2014[3] and of\r\n23 June 2014[4]\r\non the signing and provisional application of the Agreement specifies certain\r\nprovisions of the Agreement to be applied provisionally.\n(3)              \r\nArticle 462(2) of the Agreement provides that\r\nthe Association Council shall establish its own rules of procedure. \n(4)              \r\nArticle 464(1) of the Agreement provides that\r\nthe Association Council shall be assisted in the performance of its duties by\r\nan Association Committee while Article 465(1) provides that the Association\r\nCouncil shall determine in its rules of procedure the duties and functioning of\r\nthe Association Committee. \n(5)              \r\nArticle 462(3) of the Agreement provides that\r\nthe Association Council shall be chaired in turn by a representative of the\r\nUnion and a representative of Ukraine.\n(6)              \r\nArticle 466(2) provides that the Association\r\nCouncil may decide to set up any other Sub-Committee or body in specific areas\r\nnecessary for the implementation of the Agreement that can assist it in\r\ncarrying out its duties. \n(7)              \r\nThe Association Council is responsible for\r\nsupervising and monitoring the application and implementation of the Agreement.\r\nThe Association Council may delegate to the Association Committee any of its\r\npowers, including the power to take binding decisions.
