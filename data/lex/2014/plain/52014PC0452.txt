They took the view that Directive 2003/88/EC[1] (the Working Time\r\nDirective) did not meet the sector\u2019s needs.\nNegotiations took place between January\r\n2008 and November 2011. The European Agreement concerning certain aspects of\r\nthe organisation of working time in inland waterway transport (the Agreement) was\r\nconcluded on 15 February 2012. The signatories presented the Agreement to the\r\nEuropean Commission and asked for it to be implemented by a Council decision on\r\na proposal from the Commission, in accordance with Article 155(2) TFEU.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing provisions\r\nrelating to the proposal\nThe working time of mobile workers in IWT\r\nin the EU is regulated by Directive 2003/88/EC, which lays down common minimum\r\nstandards for the organisation of working time as regards daily and weekly rest\r\nperiods, numerical limits to weekly working time, annual leave and night work,\r\nin the interests of workers\u2019 health and safety at work.\nThe activities of mobile workers in various\r\ntransport sectors, including inland waterways, were originally excluded from\r\nthe scope of the 1993 Working Time Directive[2].\r\nThey were brought within its scope by an amending Directive in 2000, with\r\neffect from 1 August 2003[3].\r\nAt that stage, however, it was not possible to reach agreement on bringing all\r\nsuch workers within the scope of the Directive\u2019s general rules on minimum daily\r\nand weekly rest periods or on limits to night work, due to the distinctive\r\nworking conditions and particular features of their activities. It was\r\ntherefore provided[4]\r\nthat Member States must take the necessary measures to ensure that such workers\r\nare entitled to \u2018adequate rest\u2019[5],\r\nwithout quantifying this.\nArticle 14 of the Working Time Directive[6] nonetheless permits\r\nother EU instruments to lay down more specific working time requirements for particular\r\noccupations or activities. This proposal now provides for such requirements for\r\nmobile transport workers in IWT. The Agreement concluded by the IWT social\r\npartners takes account of the Working Time Directive and proposes various\r\nspecific requirements in line with the specific features of the sector regarding,\r\nin particular the reference period. Furthermore, it provides for a minimum number\r\nof hours of rest daily and weekly and maximum hours of night work to address\r\nthe specific working conditions and particular features of the sector. The\r\nAgreement applies to both navigation personnel (crew members) and shipboard\r\npersonnel, covers commercial freight and passenger transport and contains\r\nspecific provisions for seasonal work on passenger vessels. It does not apply\r\nto persons operating vessels on their own account (owner-operators).\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General context\nIn the 28 EU Member States, some 42 200\r\npeople work directly in IWT, of whom 31 000 are mobile workers (73 %)[7]. Approximately 9 650\r\ncompanies operate in the IWT sector. The western part of Europe is dominated by\r\nsmall companies owning/operating one vessel. On the Danube, by contrast,\r\nsingle-vessel barge owners are the exception. In total, there are over 16 000\r\nvessels in Europe (dry goods shipping, tanker shipping, tugboats and pusher\r\nboats). Over 75 % of IWT within the EU is cross-border transport[8].\nOn a yearly basis, the EU inland waterways\r\nnetwork accounts for 140 billion tonne-kilometres of freight transport. The\r\nnetwork consists of about 37 000 km of inland waterways; rivers, lakes and\r\ncanals, in 20 Member States. IWT is a quiet, energy-efficient way of\r\ntransporting goods. It plays a key role in the logistics of bringing goods from\r\n Europe\u2019s seaports to their final destination. Its energy consumption per tonne-kilometre\r\nof transported goods is approximately 17 % that of road transport and 50 %\r\nthat of rail transport[9].\nThe absence of EU rules on numerical limits\r\non the number of hours worked daily, weekly and at night by mobile workers in IWT\r\nopened the way to a wide variety of national rules which created difficulties\r\nfor transport companies and did not ensure sufficient protection for workers in\r\nall cases. Most mobile workers in IWT have irregular work patterns compared to\r\nworkers on shore. As they live and work on board of the vessel and are mostly\r\nspending rest periods on board. They are longer periods away from home. Vessels\r\noperate normally 14 hours a day, 5 or six days a week, sometimes continuously\r\n24 hours a day. Periods of high workload are followed by periods of rest and\r\nperiods of low workload. Average working time in the IWT sector usually\r\nincludes a considerable amount of inactive time (for example unplanned waiting\r\ntime at locks or during the loading and unloading of the craft), which may also\r\noccur at night. Sometimes voyages may take longer than planned due to external\r\ncircumstances, such as the tide on tidal rivers and the weather conditions.\nThis is also true for hotel personnel\r\nworking in the inland waterway river cruise industry. A typical river cruise\r\nship with 150 passengers has a crew of six to eight and about another 30\r\nemployees in the hotel department[10].\r\nAs the passenger navigation season lasts around eight months, hotel staff is\r\naway from home for a very long time.\n\u2018Market Observation No 12 \u2014 Analysis of the\r\neconomic situation \u2014 autumn 2010\u2019[11],\r\ncarried out on behalf of the European Commission, describes the situation of\r\nhotel staff as follows:\n\u2018There are currently no collective wage\r\nagreements for hotel personnel on river cruise ships so that wages are negotiated\r\nindividually. As the passenger navigation season lasts around eight months,\r\nstaff are away from home for a very long time so that the annual leave is\r\nessentially spent at home in the winter after the season is over. Employees in\r\nthis segment often have to put up with very long working days and being\r\naccommodated for protracted periods in very small cabins with up to three\r\nroommates is also not an easy undertaking.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with other\r\npolicies and objectives of the Union\nThe EU has committed itself to pursuing the\r\ngoal of shifting transport to less energy-intensive, cleaner and safer\r\ntransport modes. Together with rail and short sea shipping, inland waterway\r\ntransport can substantially contribute to the sustainability of the transport\r\nsystem. In the mid-term progress report on the implementation of the Integrated\r\nEuropean Action Programme for Inland Waterway Transport (NAIADES)[12], the Commission\r\nrestated the importance of social dialogue in the sector and acknowledged the social\r\npartners\u2019 negotiations on working time as one of the main components of the \u2018Jobs\r\nand Skills\u2019 chapter of NAIADES[13].\nIn September 2013, the European Commission\r\nadopted the NAIADES II package, which covers the period 2014-2020[14]. The NAIADES II\r\npackage includes a communication setting out a programme for action in the\r\nfollowing areas: quality infrastructure; quality through innovation; smooth\r\nfunctioning of the market; environmental quality through low emissions; the integration\r\nof inland navigation into the multimodal logistics chain; and a skilled\r\nworkforce and quality jobs.\nFurthermore, improving the quality of work\r\nand working conditions, and in particular reviewing the existing legislation\r\nand providing for a smarter EU legal framework for employment and health and\r\nsafety at work, are key actions within the context of \"An Agenda for\r\nnew skills and jobs: A European contribution to full employment[15].\nEnabling fair competition and a level\r\nplaying field in the IWT sector is in line with the objective of the 2011\r\nTransport White Paper[16]\r\nto create a genuine Single European Transport Area by eliminating all barriers\r\nbetween national systems. A higher degree of convergence and enforcement of\r\nsocial and other standards is an integral part of this strategy.\nIn particular, the Commission staff working\r\ndocument accompanying the White Paper further specifies that:\n\u2018Social partners are working on\r\nrecommendations for improved working and living conditions on-board of vessels,\r\non specific working time arrangements, on EU job profiles and manning\r\nrequirements and the establishment of minimum standards for training and\r\neducation as well as on recommendations against social dumping and unfair\r\ncompetition in the inland waterway transport sector.\u2019\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND ANALYTICAL DOCUMENT\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of\r\nstakeholders\nArticle 155(1) TFEU provides for the social\r\npartners at EU level to enter into contractual relations, including agreements,\r\nif they want to. The TFEU does not require them to consult other parties\r\nbeforehand.\nAs the European Agreement concerning\r\ncertain aspects of the organisation of working time in IWT was concluded at the\r\nsocial partners\u2019 own initiative, the Commission needs to assess the\r\nappropriateness of EU action in the area.\nCommission staff prepared an analytical document\r\nwhich accompanies this proposal in line with the guidelines on impact\r\nassessment[17].\r\nIt provides a proportionate analysis which assesses the socio-economic impact\r\nof implementing the Agreement. In the external study of the costs and benefits\r\nof implementing the Agreement[18],\r\nthe consultants identified the relevant authorities and social partners in all\r\nMember States and asked for information on the national legislation on working\r\ntime in the IWT sector and the potential impact they expect from implementing\r\nthe Agreement.\n2.2. Analytical Document\nThe signatories of the Agreement presented it\r\nto the European Commission and asked for it to be implemented by a Council\r\ndecision on a proposal from the Commission, in accordance with Article 155(2)\r\nTFEU.\nIf management and labour jointly request\r\nimplementation of their agreement by Council decision on a proposal of the\r\nCommission in accordance with Article 155(2) TFEU, the Commission can accept or\r\nreject the request for a legislative implementation, but it cannot amend the\r\ntext of the agreement. The Commission cannot ask the social partners at EU\r\nlevel to implement their agreement autonomously, as this is the prerogative of\r\nthe social partners according to Article 155(2) TFEU.\nTherefore, the Commission has only two\r\noptions to consider:\n1. Not to propose implementation of the Agreement\r\nby a Council decision in accordance with Article 155(2) TFEU (the baseline): the current EU legislation, Directive\r\n2003/88/EC on working time and Directive 94/33/EC on the protection of young\r\npeople at work will remain in force for mobile workers in IWT, but there will\r\nbe no sector-specific working time legislation at European level.\nThe baseline is very much characterised by\r\nthe national legislation and the safety regulations which are in place in\r\naccordance with international agreements such as the Regulations for Rhine navigation personnel[19]\r\nand the like[20].\r\nHence, national legislation differs and will continue to do so in this sector of\r\npredominantly cross-border activity. No limits expressed in units of\r\ntime on minimum daily rest, weekly rest, breaks and maximum length of night\r\nwork are provided for at EU level. Furthermore, the scope of national\r\nlegislation in the different Member States varies. In some Member States, the\r\nlegislation only applies to navigation personnel, and in some cases to the\r\nself-employed, but not to the shipboard personnel. In other Member States,\r\nworking time legislation for the sector applies to both navigation and\r\nshipboard personnel.\n2. To propose implementation of the Agreement\r\nby a Council decision in accordance with Article 155(2) TFEU: Directive 2003/88/EC on working time and Directive 94/33/EC on the\r\nprotection of young people at work will be complemented by a Directive providing\r\nmore specific rules on binding and common definitions concerning the\r\norganisation of working time in IWT.\nThe Agreement concerns the following areas:\r\nlimits on daily and average weekly working time expressed in units of time,\r\nthe reference period, annual leave, the definition of working days and rest\r\ndays, special provisions regarding seasonal work on passenger vessels, minimum\r\ndaily and weekly rest periods, breaks, maximum working time at night, special\r\nprovisions regarding working time for workers aged under 18, compliance checks\r\n(\u2018verifications\u2019), emergency situations, health assessment and the right to\r\ntransfer for night workers, safety and health protection and patterns of work.\nThe Agreement gives a binding and common\r\ndefinition in units of time of the required minimum daily and weekly rest\r\nperiods, and the maximum working hours per week and at night.\nThe Agreement will apply to mobile workers\r\nwho are navigation personnel and shipboard personnel. In line with limits set\r\nout in the TFEU, the social partners have not agreed on provisions on working\r\ntime for self-employed persons.\nThe Agreement contains a rule on applying\r\nthe \u2018more favourable provisions\u2019 (paragraph 17(1)). This means that where\r\nnational legislation or collective agreements currently contain more protective\r\nprovisions, nothing must change as a consequence of implementing the Agreement.\nThis proposal is in line with the conclusions of the Analytical\r\nDocument in terms of the ranking of the policy options.\nThe impact of this initiative on SMEs, essentially\r\nsmall and micro-enterprises is limited. Small businesses make up a large\r\nproportion of the sector. The number of small businesses is proportionally\r\nhigher in the Rhine Region than in the Danube Region. They are mainly\r\nowner-operators, operating vessels on their own account. The Agreement does not apply to owner-operators.\nDuring negotiations on the Agreement, SMEs were well represented by the ESO and their representatives\r\nwere among the strongest supporters of the Agreement, as they see it as an opportunity\r\nto achieve harmonisation with potentially simpler rules on working time in the\r\nsector.\nSMEs that fall under the Agreement because\r\nthey employ mobile workers will mostly be among the less affected. They own\r\nships that run on the Rhine and Danube under exploitation schemes A1 and A2[21], which already require\r\ncertain rest periods (under provisions concerning the safety of shipping).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nArticle 155(2) TFEU provides that \u2018Agreements\r\nconcluded at Union level shall be implemented either in accordance with the\r\nprocedures and practices specific to management and labour and the Member\r\nStates or, in matters covered by Article 153, at the joint request of the\r\nsignatory parties, by a Council decision on a proposal from the Commission. The\r\nEuropean Parliament shall be informed\u2019.\nThe Agreement concluded by the EBU, ESO and\r\nETF concerns certain aspects of the organisation of working time in inland\r\nwaterway transport. It refers to working conditions and contains provisions on\r\nthe health and safety of workers, an area which is governed by Article\r\n153(1)(a) TFEU. This is one of the fields in which the Council can decide by a\r\nqualified majority. Article 155(2) therefore constitutes the proper legal basis\r\nfor the Commission\u2019s proposal.\nIn its Communication Adapting and\r\npromoting the social dialogue at Community level[22], the Commission\r\nemphasised that \u2018before any legislative proposal is presented to the Council,\r\nthe Commission carries out an assessment involving consideration of the\r\nrepresentative status of the contracting parties, their mandate and the\r\nlegality of each clause in the collective agreement in relation to Community\r\nlaw, and the provisions regarding small and medium-sized enterprises\u2019.\nThis assessment is given below.\n3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis of the Agreement\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Representativeness of the\r\ncontracting parties and their mandate\nThe legitimacy of the social partners to be\r\nconsulted and to be given the right to negotiate agreements likely to be\r\nimplemented by Council decision is based on their representativeness.\nThe signatories to the Agreement are the\r\nEuropean Barge Union (EBU), the European Skippers Organisation (ESO) and the\r\nEuropean Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ETF). These three organisations are the\r\nmembers of the Inland Waterway Transport Sectoral Dialogue Committee set up in\r\naccordance with the Commission Decision of 20 May 1998[23] on the establishment\r\nof Sectoral Dialogue Committees promoting dialogue between the social partners\r\nat European level. The Commission regularly assesses the representativeness of\r\nsocial partners participating in European social dialogue with the help of\r\nexternal studies. The last representativeness study for IWT carried out by the\r\nEuropean Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions\r\n(Eurofound), a tripartite body, was published in 2010[24].\nThe information provided by the signatories\r\nconfirms that they belong to a specific sector and that they are organised at\r\nEuropean level. Moreover, they are made up of organisations which are themselves\r\nan integral and recognised part of the Member States\u2019 social partner structures\r\nand have the capacity to negotiate agreements, and they are representative of a\r\nnumber of Member States. Finally, they have the structures required to enable\r\nthem to participate effectively in the work of the Sectoral Dialogue Committee.\nThe Agreement signed by these organisations\r\ncovers certain aspects of the organisation of working time of mobile workers in\r\ninland waterway transport. The signatories have forwarded information on their\r\nrepresentative status which indicates that they are sufficiently representative\r\nof mobile workers in IWT and of their employers, both in freight and passenger\r\ntransport.\nOn the employers\u2019 side, the EBU[25] represents national\r\ninland navigation industry organisations (freight and passenger transport) in\r\neight EU Member States[26]\r\nand the ESO[27]\r\nrepresents private inland shipping entrepreneurs (self-employed skippers) in\r\nfive Member States[28].\r\nPut together, these two organisations have affiliates in nine Member States.\r\nThe representativeness study confirmed \u2018the importance of EBU and ESO as the\r\nunmatched European voices of business in the sector, even though both\r\nassociations have only part of the EU Member States under their umbrella\r\nthrough affiliations from these countries\u2019.\nOn the trade union side, the Agreement was\r\nsigned by the ETF[29],\r\nwhose inland waterways section brings together trade union officers and\r\nrepresentatives of national transport trade unions defending the interests of\r\nworkers in the sector (freight and passenger transport, in particular hotel and\r\ncruise ships). The ETF represents IWT workers\u2019 organisations in 17 Member\r\nStates[30];\r\nmost of these organisations are involved in collective bargaining at national\r\nlevel.\nGiven that the EBU, ESO and ETF do not have\r\naffiliates in all EU Member States, to make the negotiation process transparent\r\nthey sent a joint letter to the transport and labour ministries of all Member\r\nStates in November 2009 informing them of the core content of their negotiations\r\nand asking them to forward the information to the relevant national social\r\npartner organisations. It appears there was no official response to this\r\nletter.\nThe representativeness study carried out by\r\nEurofound did not identify any other sectoral social partner organisation\r\norganised at European level.\nThe Commission therefore concludes that the\r\nEBU, ESO and ETF are the only EU-wide organisations representative of both\r\nsides of industry in IWT.\nIn a letter to the Commission dated 16\r\nMarch 2012, the signatories to the Agreement confirmed that they had a mandate\r\nfrom their national affiliates to negotiate and conclude the Agreement.\nIn conclusion, the signatories to the Agreement\r\nhave sufficient representative status with regard to IWT in general and to the\r\nworkers and employers who may be covered by the Agreement\u2019s provisions, and\r\nthey have had a mandate from their national members to negotiate and conclude\r\nthe Agreement.\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legality of clauses of the Agreement\nThe Commission has scrutinised each clause\r\nof the Agreement and has not found any to be contrary to EU law.\nThe obligations which would be imposed on\r\nthe Member States do not arise directly from the Agreement between the social\r\npartners: rather, they would result from its implementation by means of a\r\nCouncil decision.\nThe content of the Agreement remains within\r\nthe fields listed in Article 153(1) TFEU.\nParagraph 17 of the Agreement contains a\r\nnon-regression clause, which safeguards the existing level of protection of\r\nworkers. In addition, the necessary safeguards of the acquis are\r\nincluded in the proposal for a Council Directive (more favourable provisions\r\nand non-regression \u2014 see Article 2).\n3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality\nThe subsidiarity principle applies insofar\r\nas the proposal does not fall under the EU\u2019s exclusive competence.\nThe proposal provides \u2018more specific\r\nprovisions\u2019 within the meaning of Article 14 of the Working Time Directive.\r\nArticle 14 refers to \u2018Community instruments\u2019 as necessary to lay down such\r\nprovisions. Therefore, the objective of the proposal can only be achieved at EU\r\nlevel.\nThe need for EU action is also justified by\r\nthe fact that inland waterway transport is largely an international form of\r\ntransport consisting primarily of cross-border activity on the European inland\r\nwaterway transport network. In order to prevent unfair competition caused by\r\nlarge differences between working time rules in different Member States, it is\r\nnecessary to establish minimum standards at EU level regarding working time in\r\nthis sector.\nReflecting this necessity, the social\r\npartners, in accordance with Article 155(1) TFEU, have concluded an agreement\r\nat EU level and have asked for this Agreement to be implemented by a Council\r\ndecision on a proposal from the Commission pursuant to Article 155(2) TFEU. Specific\r\nrequirements of this kind have already been laid down by various directives for\r\nmobile transport workers in civil aviation[31],\r\nin cross-border rail services[32]\r\nand for seafarers[33],\r\nbased on European Agreements concluded by the social partners for the sectors\r\nconcerned.\nThe proposal therefore complies with the\r\nsubsidiarity principle.\nThe proposed Directive fulfils the\r\nrequirement for proportionality because it is confined to setting the aims to\r\nbe achieved and it lays down minimum standards.\nIt therefore leaves room for flexibility as\r\nregards the choice of concrete measures of implementation.\n3.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instruments\nThe instrument chosen is a Directive. The\r\nterm \u2018decision\u2019 in Article 155(1) TFEU is used in its general meaning in order\r\nto enable the legislative instrument to be selected in accordance with Article\r\n288 TFEU. It is up to the Commission to propose the most appropriate of the\r\nthree binding instruments referred to in that article (a regulation, directive\r\nor decision).\nArticle 296 TFEU states that \u2018where the\r\nTreaties do not specify the type of act to be adopted, the institutions shall\r\nselect it on a case-by-case basis, in compliance with the applicable procedures\r\nand with the principle of proportionality.\u2019\nIn this instance, given the type and content\r\nof the social partners\u2019 agreement, it is clear that it is best applied through\r\nprovisions to be transposed by the Member States and/or the social partners\r\ninto the Member States\u2019 national law. The most suitable instrument is therefore\r\na Council Directive.\nThe Commission also considers that the\r\nAgreement should not be incorporated in but annexed to the proposal.\n3.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information to the\r\nEuropean Parliament\nUnder Article 155(2) TFEU, if a European\r\nAgreement is implemented by means of a Council decision, the European\r\nParliament must be informed.\nThe Commission has forwarded its proposal\r\nto the European Parliament so that it can, if it wishes, communicate its\r\nopinion to the Commission and the Council.\n3.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Content of the proposal\nThe structure of the proposal is as\r\nfollows:\nArticle 1\nThis article is confined to making the\r\nAgreement between the social partners binding, which is the aim of a Council\r\ndecision adopted under Article 155(2) TFEU.\nArticle 2\nArticle 2 states that the Directive\r\nprovides only for minimum requirements, leaving the Member States free to adopt\r\nmeasures which are more favourable to workers in the area concerned. Its aim is\r\nto explicitly guarantee acquired levels of protection of workers and ensure\r\nthat only the more favourable standards of occupational protection apply.\nArticles 3 to 6\nArticles 3 to 6 contain the usual\r\nprovisions on transposition into the Member States\u2019 national law, including the\r\nobligation to provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. In\r\nparticular, Article 5 refers to the date of entry into force of the Directive.\n3.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed explanation of\r\nthe provisions of the Annex to the proposal\nParagraph 1 (Scope)\nThis clause makes it clear that the\r\nAgreement applies to mobile workers employed as crew members and shipboard\r\npersonnel on a craft operated in the commercial inland waterway sector. Paragraph\r\n1(2) stipulates that owner operators are not covered by the Agreement, even if\r\nthey are considered as workers in their own enterprise for social security\r\nreasons.\nParagraph 1(3) establishes the relation\r\nbetween this Agreement and national and international provisions on rest time for\r\nthe purposes of shipping safety. If there are differences between these\r\nprovisions, the provisions most favourable to the health and safety of workers\r\nare applied.\nParagraph 1(4) stipulates that mobile\r\nworkers working on a craft within the territory of an EU Member State outside\r\nthe commercial inland waterway sector and whose working conditions are governed\r\nby a collective labour agreement can be covered by this Agreement under certain\r\nconditions.\n\r\nParagraph 2 (Definitions)\nThe Agreement employs various terms: craft,\r\npassenger vessel, working time, rest time, rest day, inland waterway transport\r\noperator, work schedule, night time, night worker, shift worker, shipboard\r\npersonnel, mobile worker and season. Paragraph 2 sets out the meanings of these\r\nterms for the purpose of this Agreement.\n\r\nParagraph 3 (Working time and reference period)\nParagraph 3(1) establishes a standard daily\r\nworking time of eight hours. Paragraph 3(2) provides for an average weekly\r\nworking time of 48 hours in line with Article 6 of the Working Time Directive.\nParagraph 3(2) stipulates that the maximum reference\r\nperiod is 12 months. The reference period is the period over which the average\r\nweekly working time is calculated.\nParagraph 3(3) therefore states that the\r\nmaximum working time is 2 304 hours. Annual leave and sick leave are\r\nexcluded from this calculation. If the employment relationship is less than the\r\nreference period, the maximum permissible working time is calculated pro rata.\n\r\nParagraph 4 (Daily and weekly working time)\nParagraph 4(1) lays down a maximum working\r\ntime during any 24-hour period and the maximum working time during any\r\nseven-day period.\nParagraph 4(2) introduces a limit to\r\naverage weekly working time of 72 hours within any four-month period in case of\r\na specified work schedule. This provision takes into account the existing work\r\nschedules in the sector and the considerable amount of inactive time spent on\r\nboard.\nParagraph 5 (Working days and rest days)\nWorking patterns in the IWT sector vary. In many cases mobile\r\nworkers work consecutive days on a craft in order to spend a period of rest at\r\nhome. Paragraph 5(1) lays down the maximum limit: no more than 31 days can be\r\nworked consecutively. \r\n\nParagraph 5(2) provides regulations for a 1:1 pattern, where a\r\nworker has the same number of rest days and working days. In this pattern, a\r\nnumber of consecutive working days are followed by the same number of rest\r\ndays. There are exceptions possible to this rule under the conditions\r\nmentioned.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 5(3) establishes a method for calculating the minimum\r\nnumber of consecutive rest days if the working pattern involves more working\r\ndays than rest days. These rest days must be granted immediately after the\r\nconsecutive working days.\r\n\n\r\nParagraph 6 (Seasonal work on passenger vessels)\n\r\nIn order to recognise the special nature of\r\nseasonal work on passenger vessels, paragraph 6 lays down maximum limits on\r\nworking time: 12 hours in any 24-hour period and 72 hours in any seven-day\r\nperiod, which may be applied to all mobile workers on passenger vessels.\n\r\nParagraph 6(2) requires workers to be granted 0.2 rest days per working day. At\r\nleast two rest days must be granted during any period of 31 days.\n\r\nParagraph 6(3) stipulates that rest days must be granted and the average maximum\r\nof 48 hours weekly working time must be adhered to in accordance with\r\ncollective agreements or, failing that, by national legislation.\n\r\nParagraph 7 (Rest periods)\n\r\nIn order to protect workers\u2019 health and safety, this paragraph establishes rest\r\nperiods expressed in units of time: 10 hours in every 24-hour period and 84\r\nhours in any seven-day period.\n\r\nParagraph 8 (breaks)\n\r\nParagraph 8 gives every worker whose daily working time exceeds 6 hours the\r\nright to a break. The duration and terms under which breaks are granted is\r\ndetermined by collective agreement or, failing that, by national legislation.\n\r\nParagraph 9 (Maximum working time during night time)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\nBased on night time of seven hours, this paragraph limits working time during\r\nnight time to 42 hours per seven-day period. \r\nParagraph 10 (Annual leave) \r\n\nParagraph 10 establishes a minimum period of annual leave of at\r\nleast four weeks, which cannot be replaced by a payment in lieu except when the\r\nemployment relationship is terminated. This paragraph corresponds to Article 7\r\nof the Working Time Directive, which already applies to mobile workers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 11 (Protection of minors)\u00a0 \r\n\nMobile workers in IWT under the age of 18 will continue to be\r\ncovered by Directive 94/33/EC on the protection of young people at work[34].\n\r\nParagraph 11(2) allows Member States to authorise night work by young people during\r\na period which is forbidden by Directive 94/33/EC, if they are over the age of\r\n16 years and are no longer subject to compulsory full-time schooling according\r\nto national legislation. Night work must be necessary for their training and is\r\nonly allowed if sufficient compensatory rest is granted and the objectives of Article\r\n1 of Directive 94/33/EC are not called into question.\n\r\nParagraph 12 (Verifications)\u00a0 \n\r\nParagraph 12(1) stipulates that records must be kept of each workers\u2019 daily and\r\nweekly working time in order to check compliance with the provisions on working\r\ntime in this Agreement (paragraphs 3-7, 9-11 and 13).\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 12(2) requires working time records to be kept on board at\r\nleast until the end of the reference period.\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 12(3) states that these records shall be examined and\r\nendorsed at regular intervals by both the employer and the worker.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 12(4) lays down the minimum information such a record must\r\ncontain.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 12(5) stipulates that workers must be given a copy of his\r\nendorsed records and must keep the records with them for one year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 13 (Emergency situations)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 13(1) stipulates that in emergency situations, the\r\nboatmaster or the boatmaster\u2019s representative may require the worker to work\r\nadditional hours necessary for the safety of persons and cargo or the vessel\r\nitself or to provide assistance to persons or vessels in distress.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\r\nParagraph 13(2) stipulates that in such a situation the boatmaster or the representative\r\nmay require the worker to work additional hours until the normal situation is\r\nrestored.\n\r\nParagraph 13(3) imposes an obligation on the boatmaster or the representative\r\nto give all workers who have worked during a scheduled rest period adequate compensatory\r\nrest, as soon as practicable after the normal situation is restored.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 14 (Health assessment)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 14(1) establishes the right of all workers to an annual\r\nhealth assessment free of charge. During this health assessment particular\r\nattention must be paid to conditions and symptoms which could be the result of\r\nworking on board under the daily minimum rest periods and or minimum rest days\r\nin accordance with paragraph 5 and 6 of the Agreement.\n\r\nParagraph 14(2) lays down the right of night workers to be transferred to day\r\nwork if they suffer from health problems connected with night work.\n\r\nParagraph 14(3) and 14(4) stipulate that the free annual health assessment must\r\ncomply with medical confidentiality and may be performed under the national\r\nhealth system.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 15 (Safety and health protection)\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 15(1) gives night workers and shift workers the right to\r\nsafety and health protection appropriate to the nature of their work.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 15(2) stipulates that the protection and prevention services\r\nor facilities for the health and safety of night and shift workers must be equivalent\r\nto those applicable to other workers. These facilities and services must be\r\navailable at all times. The provisions of paragraph 15 are in line with Article\r\n12 of the Working Time Directive, which already applies to mobile workers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nParagraph 16 (Working patterns)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nThis paragraph covers situations where the\r\nemployer wants to organise work according to a certain pattern. In this\r\nsituation, the principle of adapting the work to the worker must be taken into\r\naccount, with a view to alleviating working at a monotonous rate or at a\r\npredetermined rate, depending on the type of activity and the health and safety\r\nrules.

Hence, the national legislation of the Member States concerning\r\nmatters covered by the proposal is frequently contained in a number of\r\ndifferent legislative texts (Labour Codes, health and safety legislation,\r\nsector-specific non-exhaustive provisions) which will require a systemic\r\napproach and interpretation.\nThe proposal also contains a number of\r\nelements not previously covered because Article 20 of the Working Time Directive\r\nexempted them from its general provisions. Unambiguous information on the\r\ntransposition of these new provisions and solutions is needed to ensure compliance\r\nwith the minimum standard established by the proposal. It will enable the\r\nCommission to ensure the implementation of the Directive\u2019s requirements, which\r\nare intended to protect workers\u2019 health and safety, to provide more flexibility\r\nfor the undertakings and to foster fair competition between undertakings.\nThe estimated additional administrative\r\nburden of providing explanatory documents is not disproportionate (it is one-off\r\nand should not require many organisations to be involved). The explanatory\r\ndocuments can be drafted more efficiently by Member States.\nIn view of the above, it is suggested that\r\nMember States undertake to notify the Commission of their transposition\r\nmeasures by providing one or more documents explaining the relationship between\r\nthe components of the Directive and the corresponding parts of national\r\ntransposition instruments.\n2014/0212 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\nimplementing the European Agreement\r\nconcluded by the European Barge Union (EBU), the European Skippers Organisation\r\n(ESO) and the European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ETF) concerning certain\r\naspects of the organisation of working time in inland waterway transport\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 155(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and labour,\r\nhereinafter referred to as \u2018the social partners\u2019, may, in accordance with\r\nArticle 155(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU),\r\nrequest jointly that agreements concluded by them at Union level be implemented\r\nby a Council decision on a proposal from the Commission.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Barge Union\r\n(EBU), the European Skippers Organisation (ESO) and the European Transport\r\nWorkers\u2019 Federation (ETF) informed the Commission of their desire to enter into\r\nnegotiations in accordance with Article 155(1) TFEU with a view to concluding\r\nan agreement at Union level.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 February 2012, EBU,\r\nESO and ETF concluded a European Agreement concerning certain aspects of the\r\norganisation of working time in inland waterway transport (\u2018the Agreement\u2019).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement included a\r\njoint request that the Commission implement the Agreement by means of a Council\r\ndecision on a proposal from the Commission in accordance with Article 155(2) of\r\nthe Treaty.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of\r\nArticle 288 of the Treaty, the appropriate instrument to implement the\r\nAgreement is a Directive.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has drafted\r\nits proposal for a Directive, in accordance with its Communication of 20 May\r\n1998 on adapting and promoting the social dialogue at Community level[35], taking into account\r\nthe representative status of the signatory parties and the legality of each\r\nclause of the Agreement.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any terms used in the\r\nAgreement and which are not specifically defined therein may be defined by\r\nMember States in accordance with national law and practice, as is the case for\r\nother social policy Directives using similar terms, providing that those\r\ndefinitions respect the content of the Agreement.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member States may\r\nentrust social partners, at their joint request, with the implementation of\r\nthis Directive, as long as the Member States take all the necessary steps to\r\nensure that they can at all times guarantee the results imposed by this\r\nDirective.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2003/88/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[36]\r\nlays down minimum health and safety requirements for the organisation of\r\nworking time, including that of workers in the inland waterway transport.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive and the\r\nAgreement lay down more specific requirements for the organisation of working\r\ntime of mobile workers in inland waterway transport, for the purposes of\r\nArticle 14 of Directive 2003/88/EC.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of this\r\nDirective should apply without prejudice to any existing Union provisions which\r\nare more specific or which grant a higher level of protection to mobile workers\r\nin inland waterway transport.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive cannot be\r\nused to justify a reduction in the general level of protection of workers in\r\nthe fields covered by the Agreement.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive and the\r\nAgreement lay down minimum standards;

However, as these regulations do not\r\ntake the specific working and living conditions in the inland waterway\r\ntransport sector sufficiently into account, more specific rules are necessary,\r\npursuant to Article 14 of Directive 2003/88/EC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\n2.                      \r\nThese more specific rules should safeguard a\r\nhigh level of health and safety for workers in the inland waterway transport\r\nsector.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\n3.                      \r\nInland waterway transport is an international\r\nform of transport characterised first and foremost by cross-border activities\r\non the European inland waterway transport network. The European inland waterway\r\ntransport sector should therefore work towards creating homogeneous framework\r\nconditions for the labour market in this sector and preventing unfair\r\ncompetition based on differences between statutory working time structures.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\n4.                      \r\nIn view of the importance of the transport\r\nsector for economic competitiveness, the European Union has set itself the goal\r\nof encouraging those modes of transport which use less energy, are more\r\nenvironmentally friendly or safer[1].\r\nInland waterway transport is an environmentally friendly mode of transport with\r\navailable capacity which can make a sustainable contribution to removing\r\nfreight from Europe's roads and railways.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\n5.                      \r\nThe organisation of work varies within the\r\nsector. The number of workers and their working time on board varies depending\r\non the way in which the work is organised, the undertaking concerned, the\r\ngeographical area of operation, the length of the voyage and the size of the\r\ncraft. Some vessels sail continuously, i.e. 24 hours a day, with the crew\r\nworking shifts. By contrast, medium-sized undertakings in particular tend to\r\noperate their vessels 14 hours a day for five or six days per week. In the\r\ninland waterway transport sector, the working time of a worker on board is not\r\nthe same as the operating time of a craft.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\n6.                      \r\nOne of the special features of the inland\r\nwaterway transport sector is that it is possible for workers to have not only\r\ntheir place of work but also their accommodation or living quarters on board\r\nthe vessel. It is therefore usual for workers to spend rest periods on board. Many\r\nworkers in the inland waterway transport sector, especially those who are a\r\nlong way from home, work several consecutive days on board in order to save on\r\ntravelling time and then be able to spend several days at home or at another\r\nplace of their own choosing. With a 1:1 pattern, for example, a worker has the\r\nsame number of rest days and working days. For this reason the number of\r\nconsecutive working days on board and the number of rest days can be\r\ncorrespondingly higher than is the case in land-based employment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\n7.                      \r\nAverage working time in the inland waterway\r\ntransport sector usually includes a significant amount of on-call time (for\r\nexample as a result of unplanned waiting time at locks or during the loading\r\nand unloading of the craft), which may also occur during the night. The maximum\r\ndaily and weekly working times which are laid down may therefore be longer than\r\nthose stipulated in Directive 2003/88/EC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\n8.                      \r\nAt the same time it must be recognised that the\r\nworkload in inland waterway transport is influenced by several factors, such as\r\nnoise, vibration and the organisation of working time. Without prejudice to the\r\nprovisions of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction\r\nof measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at\r\nwork[2], provision is made for\r\nannual health checks to protect workers, taking into account the specific\r\nworking conditions in this sector.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\n9.                      \r\nAccount should be taken of the additional\r\ndemands made on crew members during night work by limiting the maximum\r\npermissible number of night-time hours and by organising work appropriately.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\n10.                  \r\nThe inland waterway transport sector not only\r\nemploys workers but also uses self-employed workers[3]. Self-employed status\r\nis determined in line with the applicable national law.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\n11.                  \r\nThe working and living conditions on passenger\r\nvessels differ from those in other forms of inland waterway transport and thus\r\nspecial provisions are warranted.
