On 10 May 2010 the Council\nauthorised the Commission to open negotiations for a new comprehensive and\nambitious Association Agreement, including its Deep and Comprehensive Free\nTrade Area (DCFTA) part.\nThe Association\nAgreement aims to accelerate the deepening of political and economic relations\nbetween Georgia and the EU, as well as to advance Georgia's gradual economic\nintegration with the EU Internal Market, in selected areas notably through\nestablishing a DCFTA. \nThe Agreement is a\nconcrete way to exploit the dynamics in EU-Georgia relations, focusing on\nsupport to core reforms, on economic recovery and growth, governance and cooperation\nin different sectors. \nThe Agreement also\nconstitutes a reform agenda for Georgia, based on a comprehensive programme of\napproximation of Georgia's legislation to EU norms and standards, around which\nall partners of Georgia are invited to align themselves and focus their\nassistance. EU assistance to Georgia is linked with the reform agenda as it\nemerges from the Agreement. In view of preparing and facilitating the\nimplementation of the Association Agreement, an Association Agenda has been\nprepared. \nFollowing the 14th\nnegotiation round in March 2013, the EU and Georgia finalised the negotiations\non the Association Agreement. Negotiations on the DCFTA were finalised in July\n2013. On 29 November 2013, the EU and Georgia initialled the text of the\nAssociation Agreement, including the DCFTA part.\nIn line with Article\n429 of the Association Agreement, it is foreseen to provisionally apply parts\nof the Agreement. The provisional application is foreseen in view of keeping\nmutual economic interests and shared values in equilibrium, and the common will\nof the EU and Georgia to start implementing and enforcing the eligible parts of\nthe Agreement in order to advance an early reform impact on sector specific\nissues before the conclusion of the Agreement. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\nOF THE NEGOTIATIONS\nThe Council has been\ninformed regularly and consulted in the relevant Council Working Groups,\nnotably in COEST and the Trade Policy Committee (TPC), at all stages of the\nnegotiations. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council\nin its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft Association\nAgreement is acceptable to the Union. \nThe final content of\nthe Association Agreement can be summarised as follows:\nThe Agreement\nestablishes an association between the Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part. This constitutes a new stage in the\ndevelopment of EU-Georgia contractual relations, aiming at political association\nand economic integration and leaving open the way for further progressive\ndevelopments. \nThe overall aims of the\nassociation focus on promoting a gradual rapprochement between the parties on\nthe basis of common values; strengthening the framework for enhanced political\ndialogue; promoting, preserving and strengthening peace and stability in both\nthe regional and international dimensions; promoting cooperation on peaceful\nconflict resolution, advancing Georgia's gradual economic integration with the\nEU internal market in selected areas; enhancing justice, freedom and security cooperation\nwith the aim of reinforcing the rule of law and respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, and establishing conditions for increasingly close\ncooperation in other areas of mutual interest. \nThe General\nPrinciples of the Agreement include a specific set of \"essential\nelements\", the violation of which by one of the Parties could give rise to\nspecific measures under the Agreement, including the suspension of rights and\nobligations. These elements are respect for democratic principles, human rights\nand fundamental freedoms as defined in relevant international instruments;\nrespect for the rule of law; promotion of respect for the principles of sovereignty\nand territorial integrity, inviolability and independence; and countering the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, related materials and means of\ndelivery. \nOther General\nPrinciples of the Agreement relate to the principles of a free market\neconomy, good governance, the fight against corruption, the fight against\ntrans-national organised crime and terrorism, the promotion of sustainable\ndevelopment and effective multilateralism.\nThe Agreement sets out\nthe aims of a strengthened political dialogue promoting gradual\nconvergence on foreign and security matters. The Agreement further provides for\ndialogue and cooperation on domestic reform based on the common principles set\nout by the Parties. There are also provisions for intensified dialogue on\nforeign and security policy, including the Common Security and Defence Policy,\nfor the promotion of peace and international justice by implementing the Rome\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, and for joint efforts on regional\nstability, conflict prevention, crisis management, anti-terrorism,\nanti-proliferation and disarmament and arms control. The Parties shall in\nparticular work towards peaceful settlement of the unresolved conflicts in the\nregion.\nIn the field of justice,\nfreedom and security, the Agreement pays particular attention to the rule\nof law and to the reinforcement of judicial institutions and practices. The\nAgreement sets out the framework for cooperation on migration, asylum and\nborder management, on personal data protection, money laundering and terrorism\nfinancing and on anti-drugs policy. The Agreement contains provisions on\nmovement of persons, including on readmission, on visa facilitation and on the\ngradual steps towards a visa-free regime in due course provided that relevant\nconditions for well-managed and secure mobility are in place. The commitment to\ncombat crime, corruption and other illegal activities and the further\ndevelopment of judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters is also\ncovered - making full use of relevant international and bilateral instruments. \nThe Association\nAgreement also foresees a wide range of sector cooperation, focusing on support\nto core reforms, economic recovery and growth, governance and sector\ncooperation in 28 areas, such as: energy, transport, environmental protection\nand promotion, industrial and small and medium enterprise cooperation,\nagriculture and rural development, social policies, justice, civil society\ncooperation, consumer policy, public administration reform, education, training\nand youth as well as cultural cooperation. In all of these areas, enhanced cooperation\nstarts from the basis of current frameworks, both bilateral and multilateral,\nwith the aim of more systematic dialogue and exchange of information and good practice.\nKey to the sectoral cooperation parts of the Agreement is a comprehensive menu\nof gradual approximation with the EU acquis set out in annexes to the\nAgreement. Specific schedules for approximation and implementation by Georgia of selected parts of the EU acquis will provide a focus for on-going cooperation, and\nwill form the core of Georgia's domestic reform and modernisation agenda. \nThe Agreement includes\nan updated institutional framework encompassing cooperation and dialogue fora.\nSpecific decision-making roles are foreseen for an Association Council, and by\ndelegation, for an Association Committee, which may also meet in a specific\nconfiguration to address trade issues. Fora for civil society and parliamentary\ncooperation are also foreseen. The Agreement also includes provisions on\nmonitoring, fulfilment of obligations and dispute settlement (including\nseparate provisions for trade-related issues). \nWith regard to the DCFTA\npart of the Agreement, the Commission has reached the objectives set out in the\nnegotiating directives to dismantle import duties on substantially all trade,\nwhile providing a strong binding framework to ban all arbitrary\ntrade-restrictive measures, including export duties and quantitative export\nrestrictions. The DCFTA contains an anti-circumvention mechanism for imports of\nsensitive agricultural products.\nIn terms of technical\nbarriers to trade, Georgia will progressively adapt its technical regulations\nand standards to those of the EU. Negotiations for an Agreement on Conformity\nAssessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) may be launched, with\nview to ensuring that in specific sectors Georgian legislation and market\nsurveillance systems is in line with those in the EU, so that trade between the\nParties can take place under the same conditions as between EU Member States.\nAs regards trade in\nanimals, plants and their products the DCFTA will provide for the alignment of Georgia's sanitary and phyto-sanitary and animal welfare legislation to the EU's SPS and\nanimal welfare legislation which would consequently lead to further trade\nfacilitation. The DCFTA will ensure the setting up of a rapid consultation\nmechanism to solve SPS-related trade irritants, including a specific rapid\nalert and early warning system for veterinary and phyto-sanitary emergencies. \nBuilding on current\ncooperation on customs matters, the Protocol on mutual administrative\nassistance in customs matters provides a stronger legal framework to ensure the\ncorrect application of customs legislation and the fight against customs fraud.\n\nAs regards\nestablishment, the DCFTA provides for national treatment and most favoured\nnation treatment of companies, subject to limited reservations. With regard to\ntrade in services, the DCFTA foresees a wide market access, as well as the\npossibility to liberalise further the market access, including as a result of\napproximation by Georgia with the EU acquis in the fields of financial,\ntelecommunications/electronic commerce, postal and courier, and international\nmaritime transport services. \nThe DCFTA will provide\nhigh levels of protection for all EU agricultural Geographical Indications\n(GIs), not only those relating to wines and spirits, and any new products added\nto the list of protected GIs. The Agreement includes the provisions of the\nEU-Georgia Agreement on Geographical Indications which entered into force on 1\nApril 2012, including its annexes. It foresees a mechanism enabling full\nprotection of new indications which may be added to the Agreement on\nGeographical Indications before the Association Agreement enters into force. Moreover,\nthe DCFTA includes provisions on copyright, designs (including unregistered\nones), and patents which complement and up-date the TRIPS Agreement and include\nprovisions for the enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights based on the\nEU's internal rules.\nIn terms of integration\nof the public procurement markets, the DCFTA will allow access of Georgia, a non-EEA Member to the EU public\nprocurement market for bids above certain value thresholds, following a period\nof transition during which Georgia will approximate current and future EU\nlegislation on public procurement. Further access to the EU procurement market\nfor bids below the value thresholds may be discussed once approximation has\nbeen successfully completed. As a result, suppliers and service providers will\nhave mutual market access to the public procurement markets, with an exception\nmade for the defence sector. \nThrough the DCFTA, Georgia will ensure implementation of comprehensive competition laws. \nThe section on\nsubsidies ensures that transparency principles will be adhered to by Georgia, and contains appropriate reporting obligations to this effect. \nOn trade-related energy\nissues, the DCFTA introduces binding provisions on uninterrupted transit of\nenergy goods and access to energy transport facilities with a view to ensuring\nthe security of supply, on the independence of regulatory authorities in the\nenergy field, and to clarify the relationship with Georgia's future commitments\nunder the Energy Community Treaty.\nCommitments to pursue sustainable development in\ntrade and to abide by multilateral commitments in this respect are provided\nfor, while ensuring the right to regulate own levels of domestic environmental\nand labour protection. DCFTA includes a commitment to refrain from waiving or\nderogating from such standards in a manner that affects trade or investment\nbetween the parties.\nEffective settlement\nprocedures based on the model of\nthe WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding will provide for swift resolution of bilateral\ntrade disputes, including by\nallowing the affected party to impose proportionate sanctions, with even faster\nprocedures for urgent disputes on trade-related energy matters. \nSpecific provisions on\ntransparency and dialogue with the civil society and stakeholders have also\nbeen agreed to ensure consultative, open and predictable nature of\npolicy-making in trade-related areas. Furthermore, the DCFTA contains\ndisciplines facilitating the conduct and assessment of approximation process in\ntrade-related areas,\nIn perspective, Georgia's closer economic integration with the EU through the DCFTA will be a powerful\nstimulant to the country's economic growth. As a core element of the\nAssociation Agreement, the DCFTA will create business opportunities in both the\nEU and Georgia and will promote real economic modernization and integration\nwith the EU. Higher standards of products, better services to citizens, and\nabove all Georgia's ability to compete effectively in international markets\nshould be the result of this process.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nOn the part of the Union, the legal basis for the signature and provisional application of this Agreement is\nArticle 217, in conjunction with Article 218(5) and the second subparagraph of\nArticle 218(8), as well as Article 218(7) of TFEU.
