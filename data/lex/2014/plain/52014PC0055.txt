Such financial\r\nassistance was granted in support of a strong economic and financial reform\r\nprogramme (the 'Programme') which aims to restore confidence, enable the return\r\nof the economy to sustainable growth, and safeguard financial stability in Portugal, the euro area and the Union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nline with Article 3(10) of\r\nImplementing Decision 2011/344/EU, the Commission, together with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and in\r\nliaison with the European Central\r\nBank (ECB), has conducted,\r\nbetween 4 December and 16 December 2013, the tenth review of the Portuguese authorities' progress on the implementation of the agreed measures under the Programme.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quarterly\r\nGDP growth continued at positive rates in the third quarter of 2013 and the\r\nshort-run indicators point to the projected economic recovery. On an annual\r\nbasis, real GDP is still forecast to decline by 1,6% in 2013 but to move into positive territory in 2014 and 2015, with\r\ngrowth of 0,8% and 1,5%, respectively. The labour market outlook\r\nhas improved as well but unemployment remains high, expected to peak at 16,8%\r\nin 2014 and to progressively decrease thereafter. Downside risks to the\r\nmacroeconomic outlook remain, as the projected recovery crucially hinges on\r\npositive trade and financial market developments, which also depend on the\r\nbroader European outlook.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Up\r\nto November 2013 the government\r\ncash deficit recorded an improvement of 0,25% of GDP (net of extraordinary factors) compared with the same\r\nperiod of the preceding year, which resulted from revenue growth outpacing\r\nexpenditure growth. The acceleration of tax revenue growth reflects the\r\nrecovery of economic activity in recent months as well as improved efficiency\r\nin the tax administration, especially in the fight against fraud. On the\r\nexpenditure side budget execution is overall in line with the targets of the\r\nsecond supplementary budget.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ngeneral government deficit target of 5,5% of GDP (net of bank\r\nrecapitalisations) in 2013 is likely to be met and the deficit outcome may even be below the target. This results from\r\npositive risks having materialised in the last months of the year while most\r\nnegative risks dissipated. In particular, tax\r\ncollection is expected to exceed the implicit targets in the second\r\nsupplementary budget. Moreover, the yield of the\r\none-off debt regularisation scheme for outstanding tax and social security\r\ncontributions launched at the end of 2013 was about 0,3% of GDP higher than\r\nenvisaged. The absorption of EU Funds is also expected to be better than\r\npreviously estimated. Furthermore, negative risks from the Public-Private\r\nPartnerships' renegotiations have been mitigated. Some negative risks nevertheless\r\npersist, notably lower-than-projected\u00a0 revenue from property taxes while\r\noverruns on specific expenditure items, particularly personnel costs,\r\nintermediate consumption and pensions benefits cannot be excluded.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\n2014 State Budget and other supporting legislation are consistent with a\r\ndeficit target of 4% of GDP in 2014. In order to reach the target consolidation\r\nmeasures amounting to about 2,3% of GDP are being implemented, which also cover\r\nfor budgetary pressures and the need to rebuild the provisional\r\nbudget allocation for 2014. The measures are primarily\r\nof a permanent nature and rely predominantly on expenditure savings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\nMost of the consolidation in 2014 \u2014 about 1,8% of GDP \u2014 draws on the public expenditure review, which was carried out over the\r\npast year with the objective of increasing equity and efficiency in the\r\nprovision of social transfers and public services. The main public expenditure review measures will be implemented along\r\nthree principal axes: \n(a)     \r\nlimiting outlays on the public wage bill by reducing the size of the public-sector work force while changing its composition towards\r\nhigher-skilled employees, notably through a\r\nrequalification programme and a voluntary redundancy scheme; further\r\nconvergence of public and private sector work rules and the revision of the wage scale as well as the streamlining of wage supplements; increase\r\nof beneficiaries' contributions to the special public health insurance schemes,\r\naiming at the self-financing of these systems;\n(b)    \r\nlimiting the public pension expenditure, given\r\nthe need to reassess its sustainability on the back of demographic\r\ndevelopments, while at the same time protecting the lowest pensions, by\r\nincreasing the statutory retirement age via changes to the sustainability\r\nfactor; recalibrating the 'extraordinary solidarity contribution', by lowering the\r\nminimum threshold for the application of the progressive rate as well as the\r\nthresholds for the application of higher rates; streamlining survivors'\r\npensions of both CGA and the general pension regime; reducing lifelong pensions\r\nto politicians;\n(c)     \r\nsavings in intermediate consumption and\r\nexpenditure programmes across line ministries.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further\r\nsmaller-yield permanent revenue measures amounting to 0,4% of GDP, aiming to\r\nfurther improve the efficiency and\r\nequity of the current tax and\r\nbenefit structure, complement the public-expenditure-review package with a view\r\nto achieving the 4% of GDP deficit\r\ntarget. Moreover, a number of one-off measures totalling 0,2%\r\nof GDP will be implemented, which more than offset the costs arising from the one-off upfront\r\npayments related to the introduction of a mutual agreement redundancy scheme in\r\nthe public sector.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most\r\nof the above-mentioned measures were adopted through the 2014 Budget Law or by\r\nchanges to specific legislation. Some of the envisaged consolidation measures\r\nhave not yet been fully legislated to date. Among these are the tightening of\r\neligibility conditions of survivors' pensions (beyond the change of replacement\r\nrates in case of accumulation with other pensions); the sale of online gambling\r\nlicences; the transfer of the postal service's (CTT) health fund to the general\r\ngovernment and the sale of port concessions.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A comprehensive reform of\r\nthe corporate income tax aimed at promoting simplification as well as boosting\r\nthe internationalisation and competitiveness of Portuguese companies was\r\napproved in the Parliament in December 2013 and entered into force on 1 January\r\n2014. A key feature of the reform is the reduction of the\r\nstandard CIT rate from 25% to 23% and a reduced 17%-rate applicable to the\r\nfirst EUR 15 000 of taxable\r\nincome for SMEs. In addition to the existing surtaxes, a third state surtax of\r\n7% will apply on taxable profits exceeding EUR 35 million. Other key provisions\r\nof the reform include the revamping of tax incentives, changes to dividends and\r\ncapital gains taxation, group taxation and intangible assets regime, the\r\nintroduction of a participation exemption regime, an extension of the period\r\nduring which losses can be carried forward and a further limitation to interest\r\ndeductibility.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ndebt-to-GDP ratio is expected peak below 129.5% in 2013 and to decline\r\nthereafter. The upward revision of the debt profile compared with the combined Eight and Ninth Review, in spite\r\nof a better-than-expected budget execution, is to a large extent explained by a\r\nsubstantial increase in the Treasury's cash balance as well as the postponement\r\nto 2014 of some short-term debt reducing operations on the part of the Social\r\nSecurity Financial Stabilisation Fund. Accordingly, the net debt \u2013 excluding\r\nIGCP's cash deposits \u2013 is projected to peak at about 120% of GDP, slightly\r\nbelow the level expected at the last review.The\r\nexpected decline in the general government debt-to-GDP ratio starting from 2014\r\nwill be supported by the projected economic recovery as well as by a decline in\r\ncash deposits and the realisation of the Social Security's short-term\r\ndebt-reducing operations. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nbudgetary adjustment process is flanked by a range of fiscal structural\r\nmeasures to enhance control over government expenditure and improve revenue\r\ncollection. The comprehensive reform of the Budget Framework Law is progressing\r\nin a number of important areas. However, given the scope of the reform and the\r\nneed to engage in a broad-based consultation with all relevant stakeholders the\r\nprocess is expected to take place in two phases. The new commitment control\r\nsystem is showing results by limiting the build-up of new arrears but\r\nimplementation needs to be monitored closely to ensure that commitments are\r\ncovered by available funding. A task-force to evaluate and improve this process\r\nwill be created. Reforms in the public\r\nadministration are being implemented with a view to modernising and\r\nrationalising public sector employment and entities. Reforms towards a modern\r\ncompliance risk management model of the revenue administration continue. A new\r\nRisk Assessment Unit has been recently established and will become operational\r\nshortly, focusing in the first place on improving compliance of certain groups\r\nof taxpayers such as self-employed and high wealth individuals. Some other\r\nreforms, such as the reduction of local tax offices, are delayed. While the\r\nrenegotiation of public-private partnerships (PPPs) has made progress, it could\r\nnot be concluded by the end of 2013. Still, significant savings are expected\r\nfor 2014 and beyond. State-owned\r\nenterprises (SOEs) reached operational balance on average by the end of 2012\r\nand additional reforms are foreseen to avoid a renewed deterioration of their\r\nresults. Privatisation has made good progress and proceeds exceed the target\r\nunder the programme. Reforms in the health care sector are producing\r\nsignificant savings and implemen\u00adtation is continuing broadly in line with\r\ntargets.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Policy implementation and\r\nreforms in the health sector continue progressing and producing savings through\r\nincreases in efficiency. The consolidated deficit for the sector has been\r\nsignificantly reduced since 2010. However, the remaining stock of arrears, the\r\ntight budget line and increased labour costs due to the reinstatement of the 13th\r\nand 14th bonus payments forced the authorities to speed up the\r\nexisting reforms. The existence of an important stock of arrears is strongly\r\n(though not solely) related to the consistent underfunding of SOE hospitals\r\nvis-\u00e0-vis their service provision. The authorities remain committed to\r\nimplementing the ongoing hospital reform and to the\r\ncontinued fine-tuning of the set of measures related to pharmaceuticals,\r\ncentralised procurement and primary care.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nbanks' capital ratios comfortably continued to meet the European Bank Authority\r\nregulatory capital buffers as well as the 10% Core Tier 1 Programme target.\r\nThis capital buffer remains adequate across the board when using the new\r\nCapital Requirements Directive (CRD) IV rules for evaluating the banks' own\r\nfunds. These new capital rules apply from January 2014 onwards with a threshold set at 7% of Common Equity Tier 1 ratio.\r\nThe system wide loan-to-deposit is 120,7% and is likely to continue to decrease until end-2014, with some banks\r\nalready below this threshold. Efforts to diversify the sources of funding for\r\nthe corporate sector are being continuously strengthened. Building on the\r\nrecommendations of the 2013 external audit of the existing government-sponsored credit lines the authorities are\r\nimplementing the measures aiming to improve the performance and the governance\r\nof those instruments including risk management capabilities and practices. The\r\nlegal framework for new debt restructuring tools directed at households and\r\naiming at the non-litigious settlement of debts is in place and fully\r\noperational. Similarly, the impact of the changes in the corporate insolvency\r\nand recovery law is being assessed as the new debt restructuring and debt\r\nrecovery mechanisms are now functioning. The crisis management toolkit is being completed. The\r\nbank resolution fund is functioning, early intervention\r\npowers have been introduced and the recapitalisation law has been amended to reflect the Communication from the Commission on the\r\napplication of State aid rules to support measures in favour of banks in the context of the financial crisis[3].The roadmap for\r\nimproving the effectiveness and governance of the National Guarantee System is\r\nbeing implemented to better serve SMEs financing needs.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further\r\nprogress has been made in implementing growth and competitiveness-enhancing\r\nstructural reforms. The authorities have adopted additional measures to reduce\r\nunemployment and to boost labour market effectiveness, including enhaced activation\r\npolicies and a youth guarantee implementation plan. Revisions affecting the\r\ndefinition of fair dismissals in the Labour Code are under preparation after\r\nbeing declared unconstitutional. Additional measures have been adopted in the area of education, in which progress is\r\noverall satisfactory.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ngovernment approved a new levy on energy operators for 2014 which must be\r\nclosely monitored to avoid distortions in the system. As regards the\r\nelimination of the energy tariff debt and ensuring the sustainability of the\r\nsystem, further reforms are required.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe telecommunication sector and postal sectors actions have been implemented\r\nto comply with EU rules and underpin the attainment of the programme\r\nobjectives. The selection of the universal service\r\nproviders and the revision of the existing contract with the incumbent are\r\npositive developments towards the full implementation of the Universal Service\r\nDirective. The publication of legislation laying down the framework of the\r\nconcession contract with the national provider of the postal service will\r\nreduce the current concession period, thus increasing competition. The authorities remain commited to increasing the sustainability and\r\nefficiency in the transport sector. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sector-specific\r\nlegislation with a view to aligning it with the Services Directive is\r\nprogressing, with some delays in the adoption of the regulatory framework for\r\nthe construction sector, the amended professional bodies' bylaws and internal\r\nrules to adopt the horizontal framework law on public professinal associations.\r\nThe authorities are commited to further improving the functioning of the Point\r\nof Single Contact\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nassessment of the urban lease reform is underway after the full implementation\r\nof the new legal framework. The authorities aim at increasing the efforts to\r\nfight tax evasion in the rental market. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nnew framework of the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) is advancing and\r\nthe relevant bylaws are being amended and are expected to be adopted shortly.\r\nThe publication of a new executive order establishing the contributions of the\r\nregulators for 2014 has been delayed.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reforms\r\nof the judicial system continue progressing as planned.\u00a0 Advances have been\r\nmade in the implementation of the Judicial Organisation Act to streamline the\r\ncourt system, a law strenghtening the body for enforcement agents and\r\ninsolvency administrators has been published and a new extrajudicial procedure\r\ncreating a pre-trial triage to identify and settle out of court cases is being\r\nfinalised. Measures to improve the licensing environment and reduce\r\nadministrative burden have advanced with the adoption of legal provisions\r\nstreamlining licensing in the area of tourism, industry and territorial\r\nplanning. Legislation on commercial licensing is underway and the legal regime\r\nfor urbanism and building is being reviewed.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe light of these developments, Implementing Decision 2011/344/EU should be\r\namended,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nIn Article 3 of Implementing Decision\r\n2011/344/EU, paragraphs 8 and 9 are replaced by the following:\n\u20188. Portugal shall adopt the following\r\nmeasures during 2014, in line with specifications in the Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding:\n(1)         \r\nthe general government deficit shall not exceed\r\n4% of GDP in 2014. For the calculation of this deficit, the possible budgetary\r\ncosts of bank support measures in the context of the government's financial\r\nsector strategy shall not be taken into account. To achieve this objective Portugal shall deliver consolidation measures worth 2,3% of GDP as defined in the 2014 Budget Law and supporting legislation\r\nadopted with this aim; \n(2)         \r\nbeyond the currently adopted pension measures,\r\nthe existing pension legislation of the civil servants' pension regime CGA\r\nshall be modified by end of March 2014 to ensure that the new rules on the\r\nsustainability factor and thus the increased retirement age effectively apply\r\nalso to this regime; Portugal shall also develop new comprehensive measures as\r\npart of the ongoing structural reform of pensions in the course of 2014 with a\r\nview to ensuring their sustainability whilst strengthening equity principles; \n(3)         \r\nto control for potential expenditure slippages,\r\nthe government shall closely monitor the respect of the\r\nministerial expenditure ceilings through monthly reporting to the Council of\r\nMinisters;\n(4)         \r\nPortugal shall swiftly\r\ndefine and implement the envisaged changes in survivors' pensions eligibility\r\nconditions as well as the conditions for the sale of online gamblig licences.\r\nIn addition, Portugal shall make decisive steps to implement the sale of the\r\nport concessions;\n(5)         \r\nthe comprehensive reform of the corporate income\r\ntax shall be implemented within the existing budgetary envelope to respect the\r\nfiscal consolidation targets;\n(6)         \r\nthe standstill rule for tax expenditures at\r\ncentral, regional or local level shall be maintained. Efforts to fight\r\ntax evasion and fraud for various types of taxes shall be further strengthened,\r\ninter alia by the monitoring of the new e-invoicing system. A study on\r\nthe shadow economy in the housing market shall be carried out in the first\r\nquarter of 2014 with a view to seeking ways to reduce rental tax evasion;\n(7)         \r\nshould adverse legal or other budgetary\r\nexecution risks materialise, Portugal shall implement compensatory measures of\r\nhigh quality in order to meet the deficit target;\n(8)         \r\nbeyond 2014, Portugal shall achieve a general\r\ngovernment deficit of no more than 2,5% of GDP in 2015 and arrest the\r\naccumulation of domestic arrears. The strategy to achieve the target shall be\r\nunderpinned by the Reform of the State document which focuses on social\r\nsecurity sustainability, public administration reform, greater efficiency in\r\nhealth and education and environmental taxation. Broad-based consultations with\r\npolitical and social partners to advance and define reforms are ongoing. The\r\nprogress in this process shall be analysed at the eleventh review and\r\nidentified measures shall be reflected in the 2014 Fiscal Strategy Document. In\r\norder to comply with the EU budgetary framework requirements, this document shall\r\nalso provide details of the medium-term budgetary plans;\n(9)         \r\nPortugal shall take\r\nadditional measures to further strengthen its Public Financial Management\r\nsystem. Budget fragmentation shall be reduced by limiting the number of budget\r\nentities and reviewing the classification of own revenues. The strategy for the\r\nvalidation and settlement of arrears shall continue to be applied and the\r\ncommitment control law fully enforced in all public entities to prevent the\r\ncreation of new arrears. Portugal shall review the Budget Framework Law (BFL)\r\nto fully transpose the relevant EU legislation. In addition, Portugal shall carry out a more comprehensive revision of its BFL to streamline the budget\r\nappropriation structure, to strengthen accountability and to further anchor\r\npublic finances in a medium-term framework. Portugal shall ensure that the\r\nmeasures to implement the new budgetary framework at central government level\r\nshall also be applied at regional and local level;\n(10)     \r\nPortugal shall continue\r\nthe reform agenda towards a modern and more efficient revenue administration in\r\nline with international best practises. Portugal shall reduce the number of tax\r\nmunicipal offices by at least 25% in the first quarter of 2014 and by a further\r\n25% by May 2014. The number of resources devoted to auditing in the tax\r\nadministration shall increase by at least 30% of the total staff. A new\r\nTaxpayer Services Department, unifying different services for taxpayers, shall\r\nbe created within the tax administration. The Risk Management Unit shall be\r\nfully operational in the first quarter of 2014, focusing initially on targeted\r\nprojects to improve compliance of self-employed professionals and high net\r\nwealth individuals. The tax compliance situation shall be continuously\r\nmonitored;\n(11)     \r\nPortugal shall continue\r\nimplementing reforms of the public administration. Following the comprehensive\r\nreview of wage scales in the public administration by the twelfth review, a\r\nsingle wage scale aimed at the rationalisation and consistency of remuneration\r\npolicy across all careers shall be developed in the first half of 2014 and\r\nfinalised by the end of 2014. This shall replace the wage revision included in\r\nthe 2014 Budget Law. In addition, following the survey on cash supplements, Portugal shall prepare a report on the comprehensive reform of wage supplements. Draft\r\nlegislation for a single supplement scale shall be presented by the eleventh\r\nreview;\n(12)     \r\nPortugal shall complete\r\nthe implementation of the strategy of shared services in public administration;\n(13)     \r\nPortugal shall fully\r\nimplement the new legal and institutional PPPs framework.
