Progress with discussions is such\r\nthat it will not be possible to complete negotiations as originally\r\nintended by the end of December 2014, when the existing Agreement will expire.\nThe new Agreement will require the European\r\nUnion to contribute to IOC budgets. That contribution is budgeted under item\r\n05 06 01 of the EU budget (International agricultural agreements).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROPOSAL\nIn the light of the above, the Commission\r\nproposes:\nthat, in accordance with Articles 43(2) and\r\n218(9) of the TFEU, the Council should authorise the Commission to request\r\nwithin the Council of Members of the IOC that the existing Agreement be\r\nprolonged by one year and to vote in favour of such prolongation if it is\r\nincluded in the agenda of a meeting of the IOC Council of Members. \n2014/0203 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted on behalf of\r\nthe European Union within the Council of Members of the International Olive\r\nCouncil concerning the prolongation of the 2005 International Agreement on\r\nolive oil and table olives\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The International\r\nAgreement on olive oil and table olives[1]\r\n(the \u2018Agreement\u2019) will expire on 31 December 2014 unless the Council of Members\r\nof the International Olive Council (IOC) decides to prolong it in accordance\r\nwith Articles 47(1) and (2) of the Agreement for not more than two periods of\r\nup to two years each.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 19 September 2013, the\r\nCouncil authorised the Commission to open negotiations on behalf of the Union for the conclusion of a new international agreement on olive oil and table olives.\r\nThe negotiating directives stipulate that \u2018during the initial negotiation\r\nphase, the Commission is authorised to present any relevant views on any issues\r\nnot referred to in the guidelines\u2019[2].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A new agreement is\r\ncurrently being discussed within the IOC. Progress\r\nis such that it is now certain that the deadline of 31 December 2014 for the\r\nconclusion of an agreement cannot be met. It is therefore in the Union's interest to ensure that the existing Agreement is prolonged.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prolongation of the\r\nexisting Agreement is separate from the negotiations concerning the conclusion\r\nof a new Agreement. The Commission, which represents the Union within the IOC,\r\nshould therefore be authorised to request a prolongation of the existing\r\nAgreement by one year and to vote in favour of such prolongation if it is\r\nincluded in the agenda of a meeting of the IOC Council of Members.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nSole Article\nThe position to be adopted by the European\r\nUnion within the Council of Members of the International Olive Council is to\r\nrequest a prolongation of the existing Agreement by one year and to vote in\r\nfavour of the prolongation of the 2005 International Agreement on olive oil and\r\ntable olives if this were proposed to the Council of Members.\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\ndate of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n FINANCIAL STATEMENT || FicheFin/14/ MK/dz/454600 \n 6.221.2014.3 \n   || DATE: 01.04.2014   \n 1. || BUDGET HEADING:   05 06 01 - International agricultural agreements || APPROPRIATIONS: 2014 \u20ac 6 696 000 \n 2. || TITLE: Proposal for a Council Decision on the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union within the Council of Members of the International Olive Council concerning the prolongation of the 2005 International Agreement on olive oil and table olives   \n 3. || LEGAL BASIS: Articles 207 and 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.   \n 4. || AIMS:   Prolongation of the existing Agreement by one year. \n 5. || FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS || 12-MONTH PERIOD (EUR million) || CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR 2013 (EUR million) || FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR 2014 (EUR million) \n 5.0 || EXPENDITURE CHARGED TO -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE EU BUDGET (REFUNDS/INTERVENTIONS) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL BUDGETS -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OTHER ||   ||   ||   \n 5.1 || REVENUE -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OWN RESOURCES OF THE EU (LEVIES/CUSTOMS DUTIES) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 \n 5.0.1 || ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.8   || ||     ||     \n 5.1.1 || ESTIMATED REVENUE ||   ||   ||   ||   \n 5.2 || METHOD OF CALCULATION: -------- \n 6.0 || CAN THE PROJECT BE FINANCED FROM APPROPRIATIONS ENTERED IN THE RELEVANT CHAPTER OF THE CURRENT BUDGET? || YES \n 6.1 || CAN THE PROJECT BE FINANCED BY TRANSFER BETWEEN CHAPTERS OF THE CURRENT BUDGET? || \u00a0- \n 6.2 || WILL A SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET BE NECESSARY? || \u00a0- \n 6.3 || WILL APPROPRIATIONS NEED TO BE ENTERED IN FUTURE BUDGETS? || YES \n OBSERVATIONS: This measure relates to the prolongation by one year of the existing Agreement relating to the International Olive Council (IOC), which expires on 31 December 2014. The 2015 IOC budget has not yet been adopted. By dint of the exceptional circumstances linked to the prolongation of this Agreement, the amount of the EU's contribution to the IOC budget is estimated at \u20ac 3.8 million. This budget heading finances contributions to several international agencies. However, once the new Agreement has been adopted, the EU's future contribution to the IOC might again exceed the amount required to prolong the Agreement. The total amount of the budget heading might therefore reach the forecast for 2014-2020.\u00a0 \n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 302, 19.11.2005, p. 47.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2013) 646 final, 19.9.2013.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
