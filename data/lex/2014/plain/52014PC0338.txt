Both the European\r\nCommission and the European Railway Agency (ERA) have taken part actively in\r\nall these meetings, together with a number of Member States. However, other\r\nproposals have not been discussed at preparatory meeting within OTIF before\r\npresenting them to the Revision Committee.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe\r\n Union acceded to COTIF in July 2011 by virtue of Council Decision 2013/103/EU[1]. COTIF is a mixed agreement where both the\r\nUnion and all Member States having a railway network are contracting parties.\r\nAnnex III to the Decision establishes the internal arrangements for the\r\nCouncil, the Member States and the Commission in proceedings under OTIF. In\r\nmatters of exclusive EU competence, the EU votes with the number of votes of\r\nall Member States which are parties to COTIF. There are 26 EU Member States\r\nthat are also Member States of OTIF. However, 3 EU Member States have not\r\nratified COTIF 1999 while 3 EU Member States have not withdrawn their\r\ndeclarations concerning the non-application of Appendices E (CUI) and F (APTU)\r\nand 4 EU Member States have not withdrawn their declarations concerning the\r\nnon-application of Appendix G (ATMF) made when these Appendices were still\r\nincompatible with EU law. As a result, these EU Member States cannot vote on\r\namendments which concern provisions they do not apply. OTIF has 46 active\r\nMember States (membership of 2 other members has been suspended until\r\ninternational rail traffic is restored).\nIn\r\naccordance with Article 35 of Title VI of COTIF, once decided upon by the\r\nRevision Committee, the amendments shall enter into force for all contracting\r\nparties on the first day of the twelfth month following that during which the\r\nSecretary General of OTIF has given notice of them to the contracting parties.\r\nA contracting party may formulate an objection within the period of four months\r\nfrom the day of the notification. In the case of objection by one-quarter of\r\nthe Contracting Parties, the modification shall not enter into force.\nIn\r\nthe contracting parties which have formulated objections against a decision\r\nwithin the foreseen period, the application of the Appendix in question shall\r\nbe suspended, in its entirety, from the moment the decisions take effect, in so\r\nfar as it concerns traffic with and between those parties. However, in the case\r\nof objection to the validation of a technical standard or to the adoption of a\r\nuniform technical prescription, only that standard or prescription shall be\r\nsuspended in respect of traffic with and between the Member States from the\r\ntime the decisions take effect; the same shall apply in the case of a partial\r\nobjection.\nUnless\r\na sufficient number of objections are raised by the parties, the amendments\r\nconcerned under this proposal are expected to enter into force on the twelfth\r\nmonth following that during which the Secretary General of OTIF has given\r\nnotice of them to the contracting parties. As from that date, they will become\r\nbinding on the Union and the Member States, forming an integral part of the\r\nUnion acquis.\nArticle 38 of Title VII of COTIF\r\nestablishes that for the purposes of the exercise of the right to vote and the\r\nright to object provided for in Article 35\u00a72 and 35\u00a74, the regional\r\norganisation, in particular the European Union shall enjoy the number of votes equal\r\nto those of its members which are also Member States of the Organisation. \nThe\r\nproposal has been developed based on the provisions of the Council Decision on\r\nEU accession to COTIF (Decision 2013/103/EU). The legal basis of the proposed\r\nCouncil Decision is Article 91 TFEU in conjunction with Article 218(9) TFEU.\nThe\r\nproposal for a Council Decision provides for in its Annex a detailed list of\r\nthe envisaged amendments, specifying which amendments can be accepted by the\r\nUnion as presented by the Secretary General and which amendments should be\r\nrejected at this session of the Revision Committee as they require further\r\nconsideration and/or further measures to bring them in line with EU law. A\r\nlarge number of the envisaged amendments are considered to be appropriate for\r\nsafe and reliable international rail transport, taking into account\r\ntechnological progress, and can therefore be supported while some amendments\r\n(in particular the ones regarding financing of OTIF or contracts of carriage of\r\ngoods) have no impact on EU law.\nWhere\r\nthe amendments adopted by the Revision Committee are not in accordance with the\r\nUnion's position established in the Annex to the draft Decision, the Union should formulate an objection following the procedure established in Article 35.4 of Title VI of COTIF in order to avoid such\r\namendment to enter into force.\n2014/0172 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be adopted by\r\nthe Union at the 25th session of the OTIF Revision Committee as regards certain\r\namendments to the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF)\r\nand to its Appendices\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in\r\nparticular Article 91 in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union acceded to the\r\nConvention concerning International Carriage by Rail of 9 May 1980 as amended\r\nby the Vilnius Protocol of 3 June 1999 (hereinafter referred to as the\r\n\"COTIF Convention\", by virtue of Council Decision 2013/103/EU of 16\r\nJune 2011 on the signing and conclusion of the Agreement between the European\r\nUnion and the Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail\r\n(OTIF) on the accession of the European Union to the said Convention[2].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All Member States, with\r\nthe exception of Cyprus and Malta, apply the COTIF Convention.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Revision Committee set\r\nup in accordance with Article 13.1(c) of the COTIF Convention, at its 25th\r\nsession due to take place from 25 to 27 June 2014, is expected to decide upon\r\ncertain amendments to the COTIF Convention as well as to its Appendices B\r\n(Uniform Rules concerning the Contract of International Carriage of Goods by\r\nRail \u2013 CIM), D (Uniform Rules concerning Contracts of Use of Vehicles in\r\nInternational Rail Traffic \u2013 CUV), E (Uniform Rules concerning the Contract of\r\nUse of Infrastructure in International Rail Traffic \u2013 CUI), F (Uniform Rules\r\nconcerning the Validation of Technical Standards and the Adoption of Uniform\r\nTechnical Prescriptions applicable to Railway Material intended to be used in\r\nInternational Traffic \u2013 APTU) and G (Uniform Rules concerning the Technical\r\nAdmission of Railway Material used in International Traffic \u2013 ATMF).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to the\r\nCOTIF Convention have the objective (a) to update the tasks of the Committee of\r\nTechnical Experts and a reference to the definition of \u201ckeeper\u201d in line with EU\r\nlaw and (b) to modify certain rules concerning the financing of OTIF, its\r\nauditing and reporting as well as minor administrative changes.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to Appendix\r\nB (CIM) aim at giving preference to the electronic form of the consignment note\r\nand its accompanying documents and at clarifying certain provisions of the\r\ncontract of carriage.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to Appendix\r\nD (CUV) presented by the Secretary General of OTIF have the objective to\r\nclarify the roles of the keeper and the entity in charge of maintenance in the\r\ncontracts of use of vehicles in international rail traffic. France has presented a separate proposal concerning the liability for damage caused by a\r\nvehicle.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to Appendix\r\nG (ATMF) aim at updating the provisions concerning the technical admission of\r\nrailway material used in international traffic, clarifying the functions of and\r\nrelations between the Contracting State, the competent authority and the\r\nassessing entity as well as harmonising terms in line with EU law.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to Appendix\r\nF (APTU) aim at maintaining consistency with the revised Appendix G.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to Appendix\r\nE (CUI) suggested by the CIT aim at extending the scope of the uniform rules\r\nconcerning the contract of use of infrastructure to domestic rail transport, at\r\ncreating a legal basis for general terms and conditions of use of railway\r\ninfrastructure and at extending the liability of the infrastructure manager for\r\ndamage or losses caused by the infrastructure.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Secretary General of\r\nOTIF also proposes editorial changes to replace the term \u201cEuropean Communities\u201d\r\nby \u201cEuropean Union\u201d throughout the COTIF Convention and its Appendices.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the proposed\r\namendments are in line with the law and with the strategic objectives of the\r\nEuropean Union, and should therefore be supported by the Union. Certain\r\namendments have no impact on EU law and don\u2019t need a position to be agreed at\r\nEU level. Finally, some amendments need more discussion within the European\r\nUnion and should be rejected at this meeting of the Revision Committee. Should\r\nthe latter amendments be approved without modification acceptable for the\r\nUnion, the Union should formulate an objection following the procedure\r\nestablished in Article 35.4 of the COTIF Convention.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\r\nPosition of the European Union\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position to be taken by the European Union at the 25th\r\nsession of the Revision Committee in the framework of the Convention concerning\r\nInternational Carriage by Rail shall be in accordance with the Annex to this\r\nDecision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minor changes to the documents mentioned in the Annex to this\r\nDecision may be agreed by the representatives of the Union in the Revision\r\nCommittee without further Decision of the Council.\nArticle 2\nAfter its adoption, the Decision of the\r\nRevision Committee shall be published in the Official Journal of the European\r\nUnion.\nArticle 3\r\nEntry into force\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision of 16 June 2011 on the signing and\r\nconclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the\r\nIntergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail on the\r\nAccession of the European Union to the Convention concerning International\r\nCarriage by Rail (COTIF) of 9 May 1980, as amended by the Vilnius Protocol of 3\r\nJune 1999, OJ L 51 of 23.2.2013, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 51 of 23.2.2013, p.1.\nANNEX\nto the proposal of the\nCouncil Decision\nestablishing the position to be\r\nadopted by the Union at the 25th session of the OTIF Revision Committee as\r\nregards certain amendments to the Convention concerning International Carriage\r\nby Rail (COTIF) and to its Appendices\n\r\n1.                      \r\nIntroduction\r\n\nOTIF Secretariat General (SG) has convened\r\nthe 25th session of the Revision Committee (RC) of COTIF 99 in Berne on 25-27 June 2014.\nThe objective of this working document is to develop the EU coordinated position to be presented at the RC\r\nmeeting. The document was prepared by DG MOVE with the help of other Commission\r\nservices involved (TAXUD, SANCO, SJ, SG).\n\r\n2.                      \r\nReferenced documents\r\n\nDocuments concerning the agenda items were\r\ncirculated to OTIF Member States on 25 April 2014 and are available on the\r\nwebsite of OTIF at the following link: http://otif.org/en/law/revision-committee/working-documents.html. \n\r\n3.                      \r\nComments on each agenda item\r\n\nItem 1. Opening the meeting and establishing the quorum\nDocument:\r\nnone. \nCompetence:\r\nshared. \nExercising\r\nvoting rights: not applicable.\nRecommended coordinated position: none.\nThere shall be a quorum in the Revision\r\nCommittee when the majority of the Member States enjoying the right to vote are\r\nrepresented there at the time of the vote. However, one has to take into\r\naccount Article 13 \u00a7 3 of the Convention that provides that Member States\r\nhaving made a declaration concerning the non-application of one or more\r\nAppendices do not have the right to vote concerning amendments to the given\r\nAppendix.\nThe following Member States have not\r\nwithdrawn their declarations on the non-application of certain Appendices:\nPakistan, Russia (concerning CIV, RID, CUV,\r\nCUI, APTU and ATMF), Georgia (concerning CUV, CUI, APTU and ATMF), the Czech\r\nRepublic, Norway, Slovakia, the United Kingdom (concerning CUI, APTU and ATMF),\r\nFrance (concerning ATMF). \nWhen discussing amendments to the relevant\r\nAppendices, the number of Member States having made a declaration on the\r\nnon-application of the Appendix in question has to be deducted from the number\r\nof active members of OTIF (46) to establish the quorum concerning the vote on\r\nthe Appendix in question. \nIn case of EU competence, the EU may vote for\r\nall of its members having the right to vote, without regard to the physical\r\npresence of those members at the vote; thus, the quorum may be different in\r\ncase of the EU representing its Member States and in case of EU Member States\r\nvoting for themselves.\nItem 2. Election of chair and vice chair\nDocument:\r\nnone.\nCompetence:\r\nshared. \nExercising\r\nvoting rights: MS.\nRecommended coordinated position: none.\nItem 3. Adoption of the agenda\nDocument:\r\nCR 25/3.\nCompetence:\r\nshared. \nExercising\r\nvoting rights: MS.\nRecommended coordinated position: none.\nItem 4. Partial revision of COTIF \u2013 Basic Convention\nDocuments:\u00a0 CR 25/4, CR 25/4\r\nAdd. 1.\nCompetence:\r\nshared.\nExercising\r\nvoting rights: MS.\nRecommended coordinated position: \nAmendments for Article 3 (International\r\ncooperation) to be supported (editorial change to replace the reference to the\r\n\"European Communities\" with a reference to the \"European Union).\r\n\nAmendments for Article 12 (Execution of\r\njudgements. Attachment) to be supported as it amends the definition of\r\n\"keeper\" in line with EU law.\nAmendments for Article 20 (Committee of\r\nTechnical Experts) to be supported as they are necessary to update the Uniform\r\nRules APTU and ATMF in order to keep them in line with EU law. \nOther amendments: no EU position necessary as\r\nthese amendments relate to financing of the organisation, auditing or include\r\nadministrative changes regarding the work programme, the annual report and the\r\nlists of lines or services which have no impact on EU law.\nItem 5. Partial Revision of Appendix B (CIM UR)\nDocuments: CR 25/5, CR\r\n25/5 Add. 1, CR 25/5 Add. 2, CR 25/5.1.\nCompetence:\r\nshared. \nExercising\r\nvoting rights: EU for Articles 6 and 6a; MS for other Articles.\nRecommended coordinated position: \nAmendments to Article 6 and new Article 6a\r\nconcern EU law because of the use of the consignment note and its accompanying\r\ndocuments for customs and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) procedures. The EU\r\nagrees with the intention of OTIF to give priority to the electronic form of\r\nconsignment notes. However, at present the adoption of these amendments may\r\nlead to unintended consequences. The current simplified procedure for customs\r\ntransit by rail is only possible with paper documents. Therefore, if railways\r\nopt for the electronic consignment note, they will have to use the standard transit\r\nprocedure and the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS). The Commission has\r\nstarted preparations for a working group to discuss the use of electronic\r\ntransport documents for transit under the Union Customs Code. This working\r\ngroup will have its kick-off meeting on 4-5 June 2014. The EU agrees also with\r\nthe intention to provide the accompanying documents in electronic format.\r\nHowever, in the current EU law there is no legal basis to provide the documents\r\n(e.g. Common Veterinary Entry Document, Common Entry Document) which have to\r\naccompany SPS related goods in electronic format and therefore they need to be\r\nprovided in paper. The Commission has prepared a draft Regulation, which will\r\ncater for electronic certification and the draft is currently under discussion\r\nin Council and Parliament. That Regulation (Official Control Regulation) is\r\nenvisaged to be adopted by end of 2015/beginning of 2016, however, there will\r\nbe a transitional period for the enforcement.\nTherefore, the EU suggests that no decision\r\nis taken on these items at the present RC and that OTIF continue cooperation\r\nwith the EU on this issue in order to have a well-prepared solution for an\r\nupcoming revision of CIM which should ideally be synchronised with the new UCC\r\nand its implementing provisions which are to be in force on 1 May 2016. Certain\r\nelectronic procedures may be phased in between 2016 and 2020 in accordance with\r\nArticle 278 of the UCC.\nOther amendments: no EU position necessary as\r\nthese provisions do not interfere with EU law.\nItem 6 Electronic documents concerning the carriage of dangerous goods \u2013\r\ninformation on the work of the RID Committee of Experts\nDocument: CR 25/6.\nCompetence:\r\nEU. \nExercising\r\nvoting rights: not applicable.\nRecommended\r\ncoordinated position: to take note of the information.\nItem 7. Partial revision of Appendix D (CUV UR)\nDocuments:\r\nCR 25/7, CR 25/7 Add. 1, CR 25/7 Add. 2.\nCompetence:\r\nshared. \nExercising\r\nvoting rights: EU.\nRecommended EU position: amendments to\r\nArticles 2 and 9 to be supported as they clarify the roles of the keeper and of\r\nthe entity in charge of maintenance in line with EU law. However, the proposed\r\namendment to Article 7 submitted by France concerning the liability of the\r\nperson who has provided the vehicle for use as a means of transport in case of\r\ndamage resulting from a defect of the vehicle needs further analysis as its\r\npossible impact on other COTIF instruments, which may have also an effect on EU\r\nlegislation, could not have been assessed in sufficient detail. The Commission\r\nalso believes that EU Member States\u2019 proposals that may have an impact on EU\r\nlaw should be discussed within the EU before being submitted to OTIF.\r\nTherefore, the EU is not in a position to support this amendment proposal at\r\nthis Revision Committee.\nItem 8. Revision of Appendix G (ATMF UR)\nDocuments: CR 25/8, CR\r\n25/8 Add. 1, CR 25/8 Add. 2.\nCompetence:\r\nEU.\nExercising\r\nvoting rights: EU.\nRecommended coordinated position: see Working\r\nDocument for COTIF-CTE7. The position will have to be updated taking into\r\naccount the results of the CTE meeting to be held in 4-5 June 2014.\nItem 9. Partial revision of Appendix F (APTU UR)\nDocuments: Ref.: CR\r\n25/9, CR 25/9 Add. 1.\nCompetence:\r\nEU. \nExercising\r\nvoting rights: EU.\nRecommended coordinated position: editorial\r\namendments to be supported.\nItem 10. Mandate for the consolidation of the Explanatory Report\nDocument: CR 25/10.\nCompetence:\r\nshared.\nExercising\r\nvoting rights: MS.\nRecommended EU position: to be supported.\nItem 11. Editorial amendments\nDocument: CR 25/11.\nCompetence:\r\nshared.\nExercising\r\nvoting rights: EU.\nRecommended coordinated position: to be\r\nsupported.\nItem 12. Partial revision of Appendix E (CUI UR)\nDocument:\r\nCR 25/12.\nCompetence:\r\nEU. \nExercising\r\nvoting rights: EU.\nRecommended coordinated position: amendments\r\nto be rejected. These amendments suggested by CIT include the extension of the\r\nscope of CUI to domestic operations, the introduction of contractually binding\r\nGeneral Terms and Conditions and the extension of the infrastructure manager's\r\nliability for damage. They may deserve further consideration but as they have\r\nnot been discussed in any internal forum of OTIF before the Revision Committee,\r\ntheir impact could not have been assessed in sufficient detail. It seems to be\r\nimmature to amend CUI (that is at present in line with EU law) at this RC\r\nwithout proper preparation.\nItem 13. Rules of Procedure for the Working Groups of the Revision\r\nCommittee concerning Appendices A, B, D and E\nDocument:\r\nCR 25/13.\nCompetence:\r\nshared.\nExercising\r\nvoting rights: EU.\nRecommended coordinated position: to be\r\nsupported.\nItem 14. Information on future work.\nDocument:\r\nCR 25/14 (not available yet).\nCompetence:\r\nshared.\nExercising\r\nvoting rights: not applicable.\nRecommended coordinated position: tbd on the\r\nspot.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
