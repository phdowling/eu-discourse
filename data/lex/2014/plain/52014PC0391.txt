These measures shall enter into force\r\nonly subject to and on the date of the entry into force of the Treaty of\r\nAccession.\nArticle 50 of the Act of Accession provides that where acts of the institutions adopted prior to\r\naccession require adaptation by reason of accession, and the necessary\r\nadaptations have not been provided for in this Act of Accession or its Annexes,\r\nthe Council or the Commission (if the original acts were adopted by the\r\nCommission) shall adopt the necessary acts.\nThe Directive 2013/34/EU was adopted on 26 June\r\n2013 and published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 29 June\r\n2013. It does not include necessary references to the companies established in Croatia that should be within the scope of the Directive. Council Directive 2013/24/EU of\r\n13 May 2013 adapting certain directives in the field of company law, by\r\nreason of the accession of the republic of Croatia adapted Directives\r\n78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC, in order to add to the scope of those Directives the\r\nrelevant list of Croatian limited liability companies. However, these\r\ndirectives were repealed when Directive 2013/34/EU entered into force in July\r\n2103. Therefore it is necessary to take into account this evolution of the Union\r\nlaw and adapt Directive 2013/34/EU accordingly.\nThe present proposal for a Council Directive\r\ncovers the technical adaptations to Directive 2013/34/EU that are required by\r\nreason of the accession of Croatia.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nAs this proposal is of a purely technical\r\nnature and does not imply any substantial modifications of Directive 2013/34/EU,\r\nconsultations with interested parties or impact assessments are not necessary.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the proposal is Article 50\r\nof the Act of Accession concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of   Croatia.\nThe principles of subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality are fully respected. The action of the Union is necessary under\r\nthe principle of subsidiarity (Article 5(3) TEU) because it concerns\r\ntechnical adaptations to legal acts which were enacted by the Union. The\r\nproposal respects the principle of proportionality (Article 5(4) TEU)\r\nbecause it does not go beyond what is necessary to reach the objective pursued.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no Union budgetary\r\nimplications.\n2014/0198 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\nadapting Directive 2013/34/EU of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council by reason of the accession of Croatia\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to the Act of Accession of\r\nCroatia, and in particular Article 50 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to\r\nArticle 50 of the Act of Accession of Croatia, where acts of the\r\ninstitutions adopted prior to accession require adaptation by reason of\r\naccession, and the necessary adaptations have not been provided for in that Act\r\nof Accession or in the Annexes thereto, the Council, acting by qualified\r\nmajority on a proposal from the Commission, shall, to this end, adopt the\r\nnecessary acts, if the original act was not adopted by the Commission.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The relevant types of\r\nCroatian undertakings should be inserted in Annexes I and II to Directive\r\n2013/34/EU in order to provide for the relevant scope of application of the\r\ncoordination measures prescribed by that Directive in Croatia.
