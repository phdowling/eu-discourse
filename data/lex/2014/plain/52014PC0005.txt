These Council Directives provide the legal\r\nbases for the adoption by the Commission of detailed measures on:\n\u2013              \r\nthe approval or recognition and listing of\r\nbreeding organisations, breeders associations and private undertakings, \n\u2013              \r\nthe registration and classification of animals\r\nin herd-books, flock-books, stud-books and, in the case of hybrid breeding pigs\r\nin registers, \n\u2013              \r\non performance testing and genetic evaluation\r\nand \n\u2013              \r\nfor the content and format of zootechnical\r\ncertificates for breeding animals and their semen, ova and embryos. \nHowever, technical\r\nrequirements of identical nature for acceptance of breeding animals for\r\nbreeding are currently regulated in three Council Directives and a Commission\r\nDecision.\nIn addition, no implementing measures have been\r\nadopted for Council Directive 91/174/EEC establishing the principles of trade\r\nin purebred breeding animals of other animal species.\nA horizontal Directive, complemented by\r\nimplementing measures, provides rules on imports from third countries of\r\nbreeding animals and their germinal products.\nFinally, a specific Council Decision provides\r\nrules on the designation of a reference centre for breeding of bovine animals.\nThe present proposal consists of twelve\r\nChapters and five technical Annexes.\nChapters I to VIII of the proposal combine the\r\nprovisions of Council Directives 2009/157/EC (bovine animals), 88/661/EEC\r\n(purebred and hybrid breeding pigs), 89/361/EEC (sheep and goats), 90/427/EEC\r\n(equidae), 91/174/EEC (other animals) and 94/28/EC (imports) as indicated in\r\nthe correlation table.\nIn particular, Chapter III contains provisions\r\ndescribing the relationship between breeders and breed societies and the\r\nsettling of disputes taking into account the procedures currently laid down in\r\nCommission Decision 92/354/EEC.\nIn particular, Chapter IV includes the\r\nprovisions on acceptance of breeding animals for breeding purposes and\r\nartificial insemination currently laid down in Council Directives 87/328/EEC\r\n(bovine), 90/118/EEC (purebred pigs) and 90/119/EEC (hybrid breeding pigs), as\r\nindicated in the correlation table, but also in Commission Decision 90/257/EEC\r\n(sheep and goats).\nIn particular, Chapter V on performance testing\r\nincludes the provisions of Council Decision 96/463/EC designating the reference\r\nbody for testing methods for purebred bovine animals.\nChapters IX and X of the proposal establish a\r\nlegal basis for the execution of official controls in the zootechnical field\r\nand the cooperation between competent authorities, taking into account general\r\nprinciples applied to such controls. These provisions were included with a view\r\nto the new Animal Health Law and a proposal for a Regulation on official\r\ncontrols and other official activities. Because of those legal initiatives, the\r\nlegislation on checks on animals and their germinal products in intra-Union\r\ntrade (Council Directive 90/425/EEC) and as regards imports from third\r\ncountries (Council Directive 91/496/EEC) and on cooperation between competent\r\nauthorities (Council Directive 89/608/EEC) will no longer apply to zootechnical\r\naspects. The proposed text follows closely in particular Title II on official\r\ncontrols, Title IV on administrative assistance, Title VI on Commission\r\ncontrols and Title VII on enforcement measures of the proposal for a new\r\nRegulation on official controls and other official activities.\nChapter XI reflects the entry into force of the\r\nLisbon Treaty, which requires that enabling provisions in the basic acts of the\r\nUnion zootechnical legislation are aligned with Article 290 and Article 291 of\r\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To this end, it is\r\nnecessary to identify for each measure to be adopted on powers provided by the\r\nbasic act the delegated powers in accordance with Article 290 TFEU or\r\nimplementing powers in accordance with Article 291 TFEU needed.\nChapter XII provides the final provisions on\r\nrepeals and dates for entry into force and application.\nAnnex I (detailed criteria for the recognition\r\nof breed societies and approval of breeding programmes) includes the provisions\r\ncurrently laid down in the Annexes to Commission Decisions 84/247/EEC (bovine),\r\n89/501/EEC (purebred breeding pigs) 89/504/EEC (hybrid breeding pigs),\r\n90/257/EEC (sheep and goats) and 92/353/EEC (equidae).\nAnnex II (detailed criteria for the entry of\r\nbreeding animals in breeding books) includes the provisions currently laid down\r\nin Commission Decisions 84/419/EEC (bovine), 89/502/EEC (purebred breeding pigs),\r\n89/505/EEC (hybrid breeding pigs) 90/255/EEC (sheep and goats) and 96/78/EC\r\n(equidae).\nAnnex III (detailed criteria for performance\r\ntesting and genetic evaluation) includes the provisions currently laid down in Commission\r\nDecisions 2006/427/EC (bovine), 89/507/EEC (purebred and hybrid breeding pigs)\r\nand 90/256/EEC (sheep and goats).\nAnnex IV (Functions and duties of EU Reference\r\nCentres) reflects Annex II to Council Decision 96/463/EC.\nAnnex V (zootechnical certificate) includes the\r\nprinciple information requirements currently laid down in the Annexes to\r\nCommission Decisions 2005/379/EC (bovine) 89/503/EEC (purebred breeding pigs),\r\n89/506/EEC (hybrid breeding pigs), 90/258/EEC (sheep and goats), 96/79/EC\r\n(equidae), 96/509/EC (imports of semen of purebred breeding animals of bovine,\r\nporcine, ovine and caprine species) and 96/510/EC (imports of breeding animals,\r\nsemen, ova and embryos).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe basic principles and main rules of Union zootechnical legislation have shown to be adequate and sufficiently adapted to\r\ntechnical developments in the area of animal breeding and have therefore been\r\nmaintained in the proposal. However, because the current Union zootechnical\r\nlegislation is organised vertically according to species, the almost identical\r\nprovisions have been streamlined, drafted in a more precise and consistent\r\nlanguage in the format of a Regulation, in order to avoid obstacles to trade\r\nresulting from national transposition.\nOver the past twenty years, the Commission had regularly\r\nmeetings with Member States to discuss zootechnical matters in the Standing\r\nCommittee on Zootechnics, and together the legislation has been developed.\r\nCross border activities of approved breed societies have remained a\r\ncontroversial issue because certain Member States pointed to the differences in\r\nnational transposition of the underlying Directives. This situation has not\r\nchanged until the last meeting of the zootechnical working group in February\r\n2012 where the main content, the structure and the new elements of the proposal\r\nwere presented and discussed.\nIn addition, the Commission has been dealing with\r\nnumerous problems raised by breeders, breed societies and competent authorities\r\nbecause of different interpretation of the existing provisions by competent\r\nauthorities in Member States. The Commission is therefore well aware of the\r\nneeds of the breeding sector and of the supervising competent authorities.\nThe proposed provisions on official controls in\r\nthe zootechnical field are fully aligned, with the necessary adaptations, to\r\nthose proposed, after intensive consultation with stakeholders, by the Commission\r\nfor a Regulation on official controls and activities in the veterinary field.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposed regulation provides in a single\r\nlegal framework the principles of recognition and listing of breeding\r\norganisations, breeders associations and private undertakings, approval of\r\ntheir breeding programmes, entering of animals in herd-books, flock-books,\r\nstud-books and their classification according to merits, registration of hybrid\r\nbreeding pigs in registers, performance testing and genetic evaluation as well\r\nas the content of zootechnical certificates for breeding animals and their semen,\r\nova and embryos.\nIn addition it provides rules on imports from\r\nthird countries of breeding animals, their semen, ova and embryos, and the\r\ndesignation of reference centres for breeding of animals.\nProvisions are laid down in this Regulation to\r\ncarry out official controls and zootechnical checks and to resolve disputes arising\r\nwhere zootechnical checks disclose non-compliance with zootechnical requirements.\nHowever, the rules hereby proposed mirror those\r\nlaid down in the Commission proposal for a new Regulation on official controls that\r\nis currently discussed in the European Parliament and in the Council. In order\r\nto prevent inconsistencies between the two texts and to ensure a harmonised\r\napproach in the field of controls, the Commission will closely follow the\r\nevolution of the discussions on the two texts, and will make the necessary\r\nproposals in due time in order to ensure that the provisions on official\r\ncontrols in the field of zootechnics are included in the forthcoming Regulation\r\non official controls.\nThe proposed Regulation provides the legal base\r\nfor the adoption of delegated and implementing measure, in accordance with\r\nArticles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nNone.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nNone.\n2014/0032 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the zootechnical and genealogical\r\nconditions for trade in and imports into the Union of breeding animals and\r\ntheir germinal products\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 42 and Article\r\n43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission[1],\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[2],\nHaving obtained the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[3],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The breeding of domestic\r\nanimals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species, and to a\r\nlesser extent the breeding of animals of other species, occupy an important\r\nplace in Union agriculture and is a source of income for the agricultural\r\ncommunity. The breeding of animals of those species is best encouraged if\r\npurebred breeding animals or hybrid breeding pigs of recorded high genetic\r\nquality are used.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States have thus consistently\r\nendeavoured, as part of their agricultural policy, to promote, sometimes\r\nthrough public investment, the production of livestock of particular genetic characteristic\r\nthat meets defined performance standards. Disparities between those standards\r\nhave the potential to create technical barriers to trade in breeding animals\r\nand their germinal products and their imports into the Union.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive\r\n88/661/EEC of 19 December 1988 on the zootechnical standards applicable to\r\nbreeding animals of the porcine species[4],\r\nCouncil Directive 89/361/EEC of 30 May 1989 concerning pure-bred breeding sheep\r\nand goats[5],\r\nCouncil Directive 90/427/EEC of 26 June 1990 on the zootechnical and genealogical\r\nconditions governing intra-Community trade in equidae[6], Council Directive\r\n91/174/EEC of 25 March 1991 laying down zootechnical and pedigree\r\nrequirements for the marketing of pure-bred animals and amending Directives\r\n77/504/EEC and 90/425/EEC[7],\r\nCouncil Directive 94/28/EC of 23 June 1994 laying down the principles relating\r\nto the zootechnical and genealogical conditions applicable to imports from\r\nthird countries of animals, their semen, ova and embryos and amending Directive\r\n77/504/EEC on pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species[8] and Council Directive\r\n2009/157/EC of 30 November 2009 on pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine\r\nspecies[9]\r\nprovide the legal framework for Union legislation on the breeding of pure-bred\r\nbreeding animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species and\r\nhybrid breeding pigs. These Directives are aimed at the development of\r\nlivestock breeding in the Union, while at the same time regulating trade in breeding\r\nanimals and their germinal products and their imports into the Union and thus\r\nmaintaining the competitiveness of the sector on breeding animals and their\r\ngerminal products in the Union.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive\r\n87/328/EEC of 18 June 1987 on the acceptance for breeding purposes of pure-bred\r\nbreeding animals of the bovine species[10],\r\nCouncil Directive 90/118/EEC of 5 March 1990 on the acceptance of pure-bred\r\nbreeding pigs for breeding[11]\r\nand Council Directive 90/119/EEC of 5 March 1990 of hybrid breeding pigs for\r\nbreeding[12]\r\nwere adopted to prevent national rules relating to the acceptance for breeding\r\npurposes of breeding animals of the bovine and porcine species and the\r\nproduction and use of their semen, oocytes and embryos constituting a\r\nprohibition or restriction on intra-Union trade or an obstacle thereto whether\r\nin the case of natural services, artificial insemination or the collection of\r\nsemen, oocytes or embryos.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the Directives\r\nreferred to in recital 3, the Commission, after consulting Member States in the\r\nframework of the Standing Committee on Zootechnics established in accordance\r\nwith\r\nCouncil Decision 77/505/EEC of 25 July 1977 setting up\r\na Standing Committee on Zootechnics[13],\r\nadopted a number of Decisions providing species-specific criteria for the\r\napproval or recognition of breeding organisations and breeders' associations\r\n(hereinafter \"breed societies\"), the entry of breeding animals in herd-books,\r\nflock-books and stud-books (hereinafter \"breeding books\"), the\r\nacceptance of pure-bred animals of the ovine and caprine species for breeding\r\nand artificial insemination, for performance testing and genetic evaluation of\r\nbreeding animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine and caprine species and the\r\nestablishment of pedigree certificates for trade in breeding animals and their\r\ngerminal products.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission had also established\r\na list of breeding bodies in third countries and the model pedigree\r\ncertificates for imports into the Union of breeding animals and their semen, oocytes\r\nand embryos.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union legislation on the breeding of animals has also\r\ncontributed to the preservation of animal genetic resources, the protection of\r\ngenetic biodiversity and to the production of typical quality regional products\r\nthat rely on the specific hereditary characteristics of local breeds of domestic\r\nanimals.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directives 88/661/EEC, 89/361/EEC,\r\n90/427/EEC, 91/174/EEC, 94/28/EC and 2009/157/EC are largely similar in\r\nstructure and content. Several of those Directives have been amended over time.\r\nIn the interests of simplicity and consistency of Union legislation, it is\r\nappropriate to streamline the Union rules laid down in them.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the past twenty\r\nyears, the Commission has had to respond to a significant number of complaints\r\nraised by breeders and breeding organisations in relation to the national\r\ntransposition and interpretation of Union law on breeding of animals in\r\ndifferent Member States. To ensure the uniform application of Union rules on\r\nbreeding animals and to avoid obstacles to trade in breeding animals and their germinal\r\nproducts resulting from divergences in the national transposition of\r\nDirectives, Union legislation on zootechnical and genealogical conditions for\r\ntrade in breeding animals and their germinal products and their imports into\r\nthe Union should be laid down in a Regulation.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, experience has\r\nshown that in order to facilitate the application of the rules provided for in those\r\nDirectives a number of the provisions require more precise wording and consistent\r\nterminology. In the interests of clarity and consistency of Union legislation,\r\nit is also appropriate to provide for more definitions.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the terminus \"breed\"\r\nshould remain an undetermined legal concept allowing breed societies to\r\ndescribe the group of animals of sufficient genetic uniformity that they consider\r\nas distinct from other animals of that species and to enter them with mention\r\nof their known ascendants in breeding books in order to reproduce their inherited\r\ncharacteristics by way of reproduction, exchange and selection within the\r\nframework of an established breeding programme.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should establish\r\nthe rules on trade in breeding animals and their germinal products and their imports\r\ninto the Union to promote viable breeding programmes for the improvement of\r\nbreeds and to preserve the genetic biodiversity of domestic animals.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, the rules on purebred\r\nbreeding animals laid down in this Regulation should aim at granting access to\r\ntrade based on agreed principles applicable to the recognition of breed\r\nsocieties managing breeds and the approval of their respective breeding\r\nprogrammes. This Regulation should also lay down criteria governing the entry\r\nof purebred breeding animals in the different classes of the main section of\r\nbreeding books, rules for performance testing and genetic evaluation and criteria\r\nfor the acceptance of breeding animals for breeding as well as the content of\r\nthe zootechnical certificates.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly, the rules on hybrid\r\nbreeding pigs laid down in this Regulation should aim at granting access to\r\ntrade based on agreed principles applicable to the recognition of breeding\r\noperations managing different crosses of hybrid breeding pigs and the approval\r\nof their respective breeding programmes. This Regulation should also lay down criteria\r\ngoverning the entry of hybrid breeding pigs in the main section of breed\r\nregisters, rules for performance testing, genetic evaluation and criteria for\r\nthe acceptance of hybrid breeding pigs for breeding as well as the content of\r\nthe zootechnical certificates.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nRegulation, namely to ensure a harmonised approach to trade in breeding animals\r\nand their germinal products and their imports into the Union and to the official\r\ncontrols necessary to be performed on breeding programmes carried out by breed\r\nsocieties and breeding operations, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the\r\nMember States at national level and can therefore, by reason of its effect,\r\ncomplexity, trans-border and international character, be better achieved at\r\nUnion level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of\r\nsubsidiarity as referred to in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. Since\r\nthe scope of this Regulation is limited to what is necessary in order to\r\nachieve its objectives, it also respects the principle of proportionality as referred\r\nto in Article 5(4) of that Treaty.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The quality of the services\r\nprovided by breed societies and breeding operations and the way that they\r\nevaluate and classify animals has an impact on the value of breeding animals on\r\nthe market. Accordingly, rules should be laid down for the recognition of breed\r\nsocieties and breeding operations based on harmonised Union criteria and their\r\nsupervision by the competent authority of Member States in order to ensure that\r\nthe rules established by them do not create disparities between breeding\r\nprogrammes and breeding standards and thereby create technical barriers to\r\nintra-Union trade.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similar procedures to those\r\nlaid down in Directives 88/661/EEC, 89/361/EEC, 90/427/EEC, 91/174/EEC,\r\n94/28/EC and 2009/157/EC for listing recognised breed societies and breeding\r\noperations, including the updating, transmission and publication of the lists,\r\nshould be provided for in this Regulation.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right of recognition of\r\na breed society or breeding operation which meets the established criteria is a\r\nfundamental principle of Union zootechnical legislation. The protection of the\r\neconomic activity of an existing recognised breed society should no longer\r\njustify the refusal by the competent authority of the recognition of a further\r\nbreed society for the same breed. The same applies for the approval of the\r\ngeographical extension of a breeding programme, which is carried out on the\r\nsame breed or on breeding animals that can be recruited from the breeding\r\npopulation of the existing breed society. However, the competent authority\r\nshould have the legal base to refuse recognition or approval where there is a\r\nsubstantiated risk that such recognition or approval would compromise the\r\npreservation of a rare breed or the protection of the genetic diversity. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because the preservation of\r\nrare breeds requires to set up and to recognise breed societies with a limited\r\nnumber of breeding animals in their breeding books, the number of breeding\r\nanimals entered in breeding books should in general not be an essential\r\ncondition for the recognition of a breed society and the approval of its\r\nbreeding programme, even more that the recognition is carried out nationally\r\nwhile appropriate breeding animals may have been entered in breeding books in\r\nother Member States or third countries.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Breed societies and\r\nbreeding operations recognised in one Member State should have the possibility\r\nto implement their approved breeding programme in one or more other Member\r\nStates in order to ensure the best possible utilisation of breeding animals of\r\nhigh genetic value as an important production factor within the Union. To this end a simple notification procedure should ensure that the competent\r\nauthority in the other Member State is aware of the intended activity.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To prevent future conflicts\r\nbetween breed societies seeking to provide their services to breeders and\r\nauthorities refusing recognition of new breed societies competing with existing\r\nones, it was necessary to separate the formal recognition of the breed society\r\nor breeding organisation from the approval of the intended breeding programme.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From various complaints the\r\nCommission had to deal with during the past years it appears that this\r\nRegulation should provide for clear rules governing the relationship between the\r\nbreed society establishing a filial breeding book for a particular breed of\r\npurebred breeding animals of the equines species and the breed society that\r\nclaims to have established the breeding book of the origin of that breed. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should be\r\nempowered to adopt delegated acts amending Annex I in order to adapt the criteria\r\nfor the recognition of breed societies and breeding operations and for the\r\napproval of breeding programmes to developments in the breeding sector.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to clarify\r\nthe relationship between breeders and breed societies and breeding operations\r\nnotably to ensure their right of membership in breed societies and breeding\r\noperations and their right to participate in the breeding programme within the\r\ngeographical area where it is carried out. Breed societies should have rules\r\nthat prevent discrimination of breeders because of their origin and must\r\nprovide a minimum of service.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience gained,\r\nparticularly in the application of Directive 90/427/EEC, and to a lesser extend\r\nDirectives 89/361/EEC and 2009/157/EC, indicates that more precise rules are\r\nrequired to settle effectively disputes between breeders on the one hand and\r\nbreed societies on the other hand based on a clearly established rules of\r\nprocedure and described rights and duties of members. This is best achieved, if\r\nthe disputes are settled within the legal system of the Member State where they arise. The Commission should only be involved in disputes which arise between\r\nthose entities located in different Member States and which cannot be settled effectively\r\nby the legal systems of the Member States where they arise.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Breed societies which\r\nestablish and maintain breeding books for purebred breeding animals of the bovine,\r\nporcine, ovine, caprine and equine species and breeding operations which\r\nestablish and maintain breed registers for hybrid breeding pigs should enter in\r\ntheir breeding books and breed registers breeding animals without\r\ndiscrimination as regards the Member State of origin of the animals or their\r\nowners and classify where foreseen in the breeding programme those animals\r\naccording to their merits.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Breed societies should also\r\nbe allowed to establish supplementary sections to upgrade within their breeding\r\nprogramme those animals that do not meet the criteria for purebred breeding\r\nanimals of the breed concerned.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, breed societies\r\nmaintaining breeding books for certain purebred breeding animals of the equine\r\nspecies should be permitted to continue laying down criteria for entry in those\r\nbreeding books of purebred animals of the equine species on the basis of the\r\nneed to regulate the entry of such equine animals when they are produced using\r\nartificial reproduction methods.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the exception of\r\nequidae, purebred breeding animals entered in breeding books are identified in\r\naccordance with Union animal health legislation on identification. In the case\r\nof purebred breeding animals of the equine species, breed societies also carry\r\nout the identification of horses and donkeys they enter or register for entry\r\nin their breeding books and issue identification documents (passports). They\r\nthus provide a service not only to breeders, but also to the competent\r\nauthority responsible for the identification and registration of farmed\r\nanimals. However, this system has led to a multitude of passport issuing bodies\r\nthat has proven to complicate official controls on compliance with Union\r\nlegislation on food hygiene and veterinary medicines in those cases where essential\r\ninformation was not readily available to the competent veterinary authorities,\r\nfor example in the absence of a central database, common high standards for the\r\nquality of the identification documents were not observed and official supervision\r\nwas lacking. It is therefore necessary to require that also purebred breeding\r\nanimals of the equine species are entered in their respective breeding books\r\nunder their animal health identification, while providing the possibility to competent\r\nveterinary authorities to delegate under certain conditions to recognised breed\r\nsocieties the official issuing of identification documents for purebred\r\nbreeding animals of the equine species.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\r\nconditions for entry in breeding books of purebred breeding animals and the\r\nregistration of hybrid breeding pigs in breed registers can be adapted to\r\ndevelopments in the breeding sector, the Commission should be empowered to\r\nadopt delegated acts to amend Annex II accordingly.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The acceptance of breeding\r\nanimals for breeding purposes, for natural service or assisted reproduction\r\nshould be regulated at Union level to prevent obstacles to trade, in particular\r\nwhere such breeding animals have undergone performance testing or genetic\r\nevaluation carried out in accordance with the rules laid down in this\r\nRegulation and in particular in Annex III thereto.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the rules for\r\nperformance testing and genetic evaluation have been established at Union level\r\nfor breeding animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine and caprine species which are\r\ntested for a limited number of traits, the versatile requirements for different\r\nbreeds, uses and selections of purebred breeding animals of the equine species\r\nhave to date prevented their harmonisation. Instead, breed-specific rules for\r\nperformance testing and genetic evaluation are currently established by the\r\nstudbook of the origin of the breed.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should be\r\nempowered to lay down conditions for performance testing and genetic evaluation\r\nalso for purebred breeding animals of the equine species and to amend the\r\ncurrent conditions in Annex III in order to take account of technical and\r\nscientific advances or of developments in the legal environment influencing the\r\ntesting, such as Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007\r\nestablishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific\r\nprovisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation)[14], or to include, on\r\nrequest of Member States, conditions for the performance testing and the\r\ngenetic evaluation of purebred breeding animals of the equine species.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Performance testing and\r\ngenetic evaluation may be carried out by institutions designated by the breed\r\nsociety or the breeding operation. Those designated institutions shall cooperate\r\nwith the European Union reference centres designated by the Commission. The\r\nCommission should therefore be empowered to designate by way of implementing\r\nacts European Union reference centres and the necessary powers should be\r\ngranted to the Commission to adopt delegated acts describing their duties and\r\nfunctions, where necessary by amending Annex IV. Those reference centres\r\nqualify for Union aid in accordance with Council Decision 2009/470/EC of\r\n25 May 2009 on expenditure in the veterinary field[15]. In the case of\r\npurebred breeding animals of the bovine species, performance testing and\r\ngenetic evaluation carried out by a breed society are at present assisted by\r\nthe Interbull Centre, the European Union reference body designated by Council\r\nDecision 96/463/EC of 23 July 1996 designating the reference body\r\nresponsible for collaborating in rendering uniform the testing methods and the\r\nassessment of the results for purebred breeding animals of the bovine species[16].\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since detailed provisions\r\nare made in this Regulation for the breeding of animals of the bovine, porcine,\r\novine, caprine and equine species only, it is necessary to empower the\r\nCommission to adopt delegated acts on the recognition of breed societies,\r\napproval of breeding programmes, entry of breeding animals in breeding books,\r\nperformance testing and genetic evaluation and the acceptance for breeding as\r\nwell as to adopt implementing acts for the zootechnical certificates pertaining\r\nto trade in breeding animals of other species and their germinal products and their\r\nimports into the Union should this be required to remove obstacles to trade.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The import of breeding\r\nanimals and their germinal products is essential for the European agriculture.\r\nImports of breeding animals and their germinal products should therefore be\r\ncarried out under conditions closely in line with those rules applicable to\r\ntrade between Member States. However, breeding animals and their germinal\r\nproducts should only be entitled for entry in the main section of a breeding\r\nbook or breed register in the Union, if the level of official controls carried\r\nout in the exporting third country ensures the same certainty of pedigree\r\ndetails and the results of performance testing and genetic evaluation as in the\r\n Union. In addition, breeding bodies in third countries should accept as a\r\nmatter of reciprocity breeding animals and their germinal products from the\r\nrespective breed society or breeding operation recognised in the Union.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EEC) No\r\n2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the\r\nCommon Customs Tariff[17]\r\nprovides that a goods nomenclature, namely the \u2018Combined Nomenclature', or in\r\nabbreviated form \u2018CN', which meets at one and the same time, the requirements\r\nof the Common Customs Tariff, the external trade statistics of the Community\r\nand other Union policies concerning the importation or exportation of goods is\r\nto be established by the Commission. Annex I to that Regulation lists the CN\r\ncodes for purebred breeding animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and\r\nequine species and of bovine semen and indicates that they are exempted from\r\nthe conventional rate of duties. In that case, those animals and their germinal\r\nproducts should be accompanied by the appropriate zootechnical certificate to\r\nsupport their classification as purebred breeding animals or germinal products\r\nthereof.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon entry in the Union\r\nbreeding animals and their germinal products undergo the veterinary checks in\r\naccordance with Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the\r\nprinciples governing the organization of veterinary checks on animals entering\r\nthe Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC,\r\n90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC[18]\r\nand Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles\r\ngoverning the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the\r\nCommunity from third countries[19].\r\nIn addition those commodities should also undergo the necessary zootechnical\r\nchecks provided for in this Regulation.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission adopted a\r\nProposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on\r\nofficial controls and other official activities performed to ensure the\r\napplication of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant\r\nhealth, plant reproductive material, plant protection products and amending\r\nRegulations (EC) No 999/2001, 1829/2003, 1831/2003, 1/2005, 396/2005, 834/2007,\r\n1099/2009, 1069/2009, 1107/2009, Regulations (EU) No 1151/2012, [\u2026.]/2013, and\r\nDirectives 98/58/EC, 1999/74/EC, 2007/43/EC, 2008/119/EC, 2008/120/EC and\r\n2009/128/EC (Official controls Regulation)[20].\r\nThat Regulation is intended to repeal Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls\r\nperformed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law,\r\nanimal health and animal welfare rules[21]\r\nand Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable to\r\nintra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the\r\ncompletion of the internal market[22]\r\nand Directives 91/496/EEC and 97/78/EC and incorporate certain rules laid down\r\nin those acts in that new Regulation, with the necessary adaptations. However,\r\nit is not intended to include the zootechnical and genealogical conditions for\r\ntrade in breeding animals and their germinal products and imports into the Union of breeding animals and their germinal products in the scope of that Regulation. Therefore,\r\nit is necessary to lay down rules on official controls and other official\r\nactivities concerning breeding animals and their germinal products in this\r\nRegulation.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the effective\r\napplication of Union rules on breeding animals and their germinal products laid\r\ndown in this Regulation, it is necessary that the competent authorities of the\r\nMember States cooperate with each other and provide administrative assistance\r\nwhenever necessary. Accordingly, general rules on administrative assistance and\r\ncooperation, similar to those currently laid down in Title\r\nIV of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil, should be laid down, with the necessary adaptations, in this\r\nRegulation.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where official controls in\r\nMember States or checks on imports into the Union of breeding animals and their\r\ngerminal products have revealed non-compliance with the zootechnical and genealogical\r\nrequirements laid down for such imports in this Regulation likely to cause\r\ndisturbances to trade in breeding animals and their germinal products in the\r\nUnion, the Commission should be empowered by this Regulation to adopt special measures\r\nin order to limit the impact of such non-compliance.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The competent authority of\r\nthe Member States should also have the necessary powers to enforce Union zootechnical\r\nand genealogical rules on breeding animals laid down in this Regulation,\r\nincluding the suspension of approval of a breeding programme or the withdrawal\r\nof the recognition of a breed society or breeding operation in the event of\r\nnon-compliance with the zootechnical and genealogical rules laid down in this\r\nRegulation.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should carry\r\nout controls in Member States as appropriate and in particular in the light of\r\nthe results of the official controls carried out by Member States to ensure the\r\napplication of the zootechnical and genealogical rules laid down in this\r\nRegulation in all Member States.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to establishing\r\nthe lists of third countries from where imports into the Union of breeding\r\nanimals and their semen, oocytes and embryos should be allowed, to drawing up\r\nthe conditions for such imports, to obtaining information relating to the\r\nfunctioning of bilateral agreements and where any serious infringement of the\r\nconditions for such imports laid down in this Regulation so warrants, the Commission\r\nshould be empowered to carry out controls in third countries on behalf of the\r\nUnion, as appropriate.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Directives 88/661/EEC, 89/361/EEC,\r\n90/427/EEC, 94/28/EC and 2009/157/EC are to be repealed and replaced by this\r\nRegulation, it is also necessary to repeal the Commission acts adopted pursuant\r\nto those Directives and replace them by either delegated acts or implementing\r\nacts adopted pursuant to this Regulation. Accordingly, the Commission should be\r\nempowered to adopt those delegated and implemented acts.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the proper\r\napplication of this Regulation and to supplement it, or to amend Annexes I to V\r\nto it, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in\r\nrespect of the procedures and criteria employed and conditions required to\r\nrecognise breed societies and breeding operations, approve breeding programmes,\r\nenter animals in breeding books and breed registers, accept breeding animals\r\nfor breeding, natural and assisted reproduction, carry out performance testing\r\nand genetic evaluations, define zootechnical and genealogical requirements for\r\ntrade in breeding animals and their germinal products and their imports from\r\nthird countries, describe the duties and functions of reference centre. \n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The power to adopt acts in\r\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty in relation to trade in purebred\r\nbreeding animals and their germinal products of species other than bovine,\r\nporcine, ovine, caprine and equine species and in relation to their imports\r\ninto the Union should be delegated to the Commission in order to allow Member\r\nStates to react to disturbances in trade but much more important to react where\r\na rare breed is on the verge of extinct or a there is a risk for the protection\r\nof genetic diversity.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is of particular\r\nimportance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its\r\npreparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and\r\ndrawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\r\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and the Council.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of the provisions in this Regulation concerning\r\nthe listing of breed societies and breeding operations, the designation of reference\r\ncentres to ensure that performance testing and genetic evaluation methods for breeding\r\nanimals are uniformly applied, the models for zootechnical certificates accompanying\r\nbreeding animals and their germinal products and certain rules on the carrying\r\nout of official controls, implementing powers should be conferred on the\r\nCommission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011\r\nlaying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control\r\nby Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers[23].\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rules laid down in\r\nCouncil Directives 87/328/EEC, 88/661/EEC, 89/361/EEC, 90/118/EEC, 90/119/EEC,\r\n90/427/EEC, 91/174/EEC, 94/28/EC and 2009/157/EC and Council Decision 96/463/EC\r\nare to be replaced by the rules laid down in this Regulation and in delegated\r\nand implementing acts of the Commission adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\r\nAccordingly, those legal acts should therefore be repealed.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Decision 84/247/EEC\r\nof 27 April 1984 laying down the criteria for the recognition of breeders'\r\norganizations and associations which maintain or establish herd-books for\r\npure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species[24], Commission Decision\r\n84/419/EEC of 19 July 1984 laying down the criteria for entering cattle in\r\nherd-books[25],\r\nCommission Decision 2006/427/EC of 20 June 2006 laying down performance\r\nmonitoring methods and methods for assessing cattle's genetic value for\r\npure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species[26], Commission Decision 89/501/EEC\r\nof 18 July 1989 laying down the criteria for approval and supervision of\r\nbreeders' associations and breeding organizations which establish or maintain\r\nherd-books for pure-bred breeding pigs[27],\r\nCommission Decision 89/502/EEC of 18 July 1989 laying down the criteria\r\ngoverning entry in herd-books for pure-bred breeding pigs[28], Commission Decision 89/504/EEC\r\nof 18 July 1989 laying down the criteria for approval and supervision of\r\nbreeders' associations, breeding organizations and private undertakings which\r\nestablish or maintain registers for hybrid breeding pigs[29], Commission Decision 89/505/EEC\r\nof 18 July 1989 laying down the criteria governing entry in registers for\r\nhybrid breeding pigs[30],\r\nCommission Decision 89/507/EEC of 18 July 1989 laying down methods for\r\nmonitoring performance and assessing the genetic value of pure-bred and hybrid\r\nbreeding pigs[31],\r\nCommission Decision 90/254/EEC of 10 May 1990 laying down the criteria for\r\napproval of breeders' organizations and associations which establish or\r\nmaintain flock-books for pure-bred breeding sheep and goats[32], Commission Decision 90/255/EEC\r\nof 10 May 1990 laying down the criteria governing entry in flock-books for\r\npure-bred breeding sheep and goats[33],\r\nCommission Decision 90/256/EEC of 10 May 1990 laying down methods for\r\nmonitoring performance and assessing the genetic value of pure-bred breeding\r\nsheep and goats[34],\r\nCommission Decision 90/257/EEC of 10 May 1990 laying down the criteria for the\r\nacceptance for breeding purposes of pure-bred breeding sheep and goats and the\r\nuse of their semen, ova or embryos[35],\r\nCommission Decision 92/353/EEC of 11 June 1992 laying down the criteria for the\r\napproval or recognition of organizations and associations which maintain or\r\nestablish stud-books for registered equidae[36],\r\nCommission Decision 96/78/EC of 10 January 1996 laying down the criteria for\r\nentry and registration of equidae in stud-books for breeding purposes[37] have been adopted pursuant\r\nthe basic acts referred to in recital 46 with species-specific criteria for the\r\napproval or recognition of breed societies and breeding operations, the entry\r\nof breeding animals in breeding books, the acceptance for breeding and\r\nartificial insemination, for performance testing and genetic evaluation.
