The global world market for organic food has expanded fourfold since\n1999. The area under organic production in the European Union (the Union) has doubled. Each year 500000 ha of land are converted to organic farming. However,\nneither internal supply nor the legislative framework has kept up with this\nmarket expansion. Production rules do not sufficiently take into account\nevolving consumer and citizen concerns and expectations; labelling rules are\ncomplicated; weaknesses in the control system and in the trade regime have been\nidentified. The legislation is complex and entails a\nhigh level of administrative burden which is stopping small farmers from\njoining the Union's organic scheme. Some of the exemptions that were needed\nfor the development of the sector seem no longer to be justified.\nThe proposal aims at improving the\nlegislation on organic production with the objectives of:\n(1)         \nremoving obstacles to the sustainable\ndevelopment of organic production in the Union,\n(2)         \nguaranteeing fair competition for farmers and\noperators and allowing the internal market to function more efficiently,\n(3)         \nmaintaining or improving consumer confidence in\norganic products.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General\ncontext\nWhen adopting Council Regulation (EC)\nNo 834/2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products[1], the Council earmarked\na series of issues on which the Commission was required to submit a report to\nthe European Parliament and the Council, after having reviewed the experience\ngained from the application of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007.\nThe Council adopted conclusions on the\nCommission's report[2]\nat its Agriculture and Fisheries meeting of 13-14 May 2013[3] and called on the\nMember States and on the Commission to develop the organic production sector at\nan ambitious level by reviewing the current legal framework, with a view to\nimproving its usability while providing for a period of stability and\ncertainty, aiming at further clarification and simplification, and addressing\nthe current outstanding issues requiring further development.\nThe review of the organic production\nlegislation is part of the Commission's Regulatory Fitness and Performance\nProgramme[4].\nThe review provides an opportunity to align\nthe Commission implementing powers in Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 to\nthe differentiation between delegated and implementing powers of the Commission\nintroduced by Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union (TFEU).\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing\nprovisions in this area\nThe first piece of Union legislation on\norganic production was adopted in 1991. Council Regulation (EEC)\nNo 2092/91 provided a legal definition of organic production through\nproduction rules, and set out control and labelling requirements and rules for\nimporting organic products. This provided a basis for protecting consumers and\norganic producers against false and misleading organic claims.\nThat legislation was revised with the\nadoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 in June 2007, which in\nparticular:\n\u2013                        \ndefined organic production further by describing\nits objectives and principles,\n\u2013                        \nimproved the harmonisation of the organic\nproduction rules within the Union, by putting an end to national rules for\nanimal products,\n\u2013                        \nintroduced the possibility of exceptions to the\nrules under the responsibility of Member States (MS) but with strict\nlimitations and for a limited period of time,\n\u2013                        \nlinked the organic control system to the\nofficial food and feed controls system provided for in Regulation (EC) No\n882/2004[5]\nand made the accreditation of private control bodies obligatory,\n\u2013                        \nrestructured the import regime: in addition to\nthe recognition of third countries for the purpose of equivalence,\u00a0 the\nEuropean Union recognises control bodies (CBs) active in third countries for\nthe purpose of equivalence or compliance. The previous system of individual\nauthorisations granted by MS consignment by consignment was removed from the\nbasic Regulation and is now being phased out.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency\nwith other policies\nThis initiative pursues the objectives of\nthe Communication on Smart Regulation in the European Union. One of the aims of\nthe review is to simplify legislative burdens.\nIt is in line with the general framework of\nthe Europe 2020 Strategy, in particular regarding the sustainable growth\npriority and the promotion of a more resource-efficient, greener and more\ncompetitive economy. \nIt is consistent with the reform of the\nCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP), which shapes the overall framework for the\ndevelopment of agriculture in the Union for the period 2014-2020[6]. The new provisions aim\nat sustainable competitiveness to achieve an economically viable food\nproduction sector, together with sustainable management of the Union's natural land-based resources, in which organic production has been identified as a\nkey-element.\nThe proposal takes into account the new\nCommon Fisheries Policy as regards aquaculture, which plays a key role in\nensuring sustainable, long-term food security as well as growth and employment\nwhile reducing pressure on wild fish stocks, in a context of growing global\naquatic food demand.\nIt is also consistent with the Commission's\nproposal for a new Council and Parliament regulation on official controls[7], which aims at\nconsolidating the integrated approach in all areas related to the food chain by\nrationalising and simplifying the overall legislative framework whilst\nsimultaneously pursuing the objective of better regulation. In particular,\ndefinitions are aligned and/or clarified as appropriate, and the necessary\nspecific control provisions are proposed to be integrated into the single\nlegislative framework for official controls.\nFinally, the organic production scheme\nforms part of the Union's agricultural product quality schemes together with\ngeographical indications, traditional specialities guaranteed, and products of\nthe EU's outermost regions and mountain areas as underlined in the\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the\nCouncil, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the\nRegions on agricultural product quality policy and indicated in Regulation (EU)\nNo 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on quality\nschemes[8].\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultations\nThe current situation was analysed in depth\non the basis of the information collected during a series of stakeholder\nhearings to which the Commission\ninvited over 70 experts and academics to discuss fully the current and\nfuture challenges facing the organic sector.\nThe Commission launched an on-line\nconsultation at the beginning of 2013. Around 45 000 replies were\nsubmitted in response to the questionnaire and almost 1 400 free\ncontributions were received. The majority (96%) of responses were submitted by\ncitizens of the European Union, while the remaining 4% were sent by\nstakeholders.\nIn addition, stakeholders of the sector\nwere informed and consulted on the review in several meetings of the Advisory\nGroup on Organic Farming.\nMember States, as competent authorities in\ncharge of implementing the legislation, were kept informed and were consulted\non technical aspects of the review.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Main\noutcome of the consultations\nThe respondents to the public consultation\nare concerned mainly with environmental and quality issues. They would like the\nEuropean organic rules to be strengthened and wish to have uniformity of\norganic rules for farmers and other operators throughout the Union. Therefore\nthe majority are in favour of putting an end to the exceptions to the rules.\nHigh expectations were expressed as regards residues of products and substances\nthat are not authorised for use in organic production. The organic logo of the\nEuropean Union was ranked equal to national logos as a means of recognising\norganic products. The majority of citizens and stakeholders trust the organic\ncontrol system while considering that it could be improved, mainly by\nintroducing electronic certification. They are also in favour of group\ncertification for small farmers.\nThe need to improve the legislation on\norganic production is widely acknowledged in the organic sector. There is also\nbroad agreement that organic production should remain close to its principles\nand objectives and that exceptions to the rules should be ended.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact\nassessment\nThe impact assessment compared three\nalternative policy scenarios:\n\u2013                        \nThe improved status quo, based on improvements and better enforcement of the current\nlegislation.\n\u2013                        \nThe market-driven option, which aims at providing the conditions needed to respond\ndynamically to further market developments with more flexible rules.\nLong-standing exceptional rules would be integrated in the production rules.\n\u2013                        \nThe principle-driven option aiming at\nre-focusing organic production on its principles, which would be better\nreflected in the production rules. Exceptional rules would be ended.\nThe three policy options have been assessed\nagainst their potential to achieve the CAP 2020 objectives, specific policy\nobjectives and operational objectives for the review, and in terms of\neffectiveness and efficiency. The principle-driven option performs better according\nto all criteria evaluated, followed by the market-driven option and lastly the\nimproved status quo.\nThe principle-driven option is expected to\nproduce the following results:\n\u2013                        \nA positive market outlook, thanks to greater\nconsumer confidence, which is likely to support organic product prices and to\nattract newcomers,\n\u2013                        \nThe removal of exceptions to the rules should\ncontribute to the development of organic inputs, notably seeds,\n\u2013                        \nClearer and simpler production rules will make\nthe sector more attractive,\n\u2013                        \nCompetition will become fairer as a result of\nstronger harmonisation, simpler and clearer rules and the move from equivalence\nto compliance for the recognition of control bodies in third countries,\n\u2013                        \nConsumer confidence will rise with an improved\ncontrol system and harmonised production rules taking account of evolving\nsocietal concerns (environmental management system for processors and traders,\nanimal welfare),\n\u2013                        \nA risk-based approach is expected to improve the\neffectiveness and efficiency of controls and contribute, together with a more\nreliable import regime, to fraud prevention,\n\u2013                        \nPositive environmental impacts associated with\norganic production will be stressed by ending exceptional rules,\n\u2013                        \nAnimal welfare conditions will be improved\nthrough the removal of exceptions.\nThe impact assessment concluded that the\npreferred option was the principle-driven option, together with the inclusion\nof the improvements proposed in the improved status quo, and with some\nsub-options.\nParticular attention has been paid to\nsimplification during the whole process. The preferred option will:\n\u2013                        \nclarify the provisions on scope, production\nrules, labelling and controls,\n\u2013                        \nremove ineffective provisions,\n\u2013                        \nlimit the MS' scope for granting exceptions to\nthe rules,\n\u2013                        \nsimplify the import regime,\n\u2013                        \nsimplify requirements for small farmers, in\nparticular with the introduction of group certification.\nAs regards administrative costs, the\ncurrent proposal will lead to the removal of 37 out of the 135 existing\ninformation obligations imposed on organic operators and administrations.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary\nof the proposed action\nOrganic production must continue to adhere\nto a set of principles that reflect closely the expectations of consumers.\nSpecific production rules are brought\ntogether in an Annex to the proposed Regulation, thus addressing the issue of\nreadability.\nProduction rules are strengthened and\nharmonised by removing exceptions, except where temporary measures are\nnecessary in order to allow organic production to continue or recommence in the\ncase of catastrophic circumstances. Organic agricultural holdings have to be\nentirely managed in compliance with the requirements applicable to organic\nproduction and retroactive acknowledgement of the conversion period is in\nprinciple not possible any more. The agricultural ingredients used in the\ncomposition of organic processed products have to be exclusively organic. With\nthe exceptions of micro-enterprises, organic operators other than farmers or\noperators producing seaweed or aquaculture animals are required to develop a\nsystem for improving their environmental performance.\nThe control system is improved by\nintegrating all control-related provisions into a single legislative text under\nthe Commission proposal for a Regulation on official controls and other\nofficial activities in food and feed. Consequently, operators, competent\nauthorities, control authorities and control bodies will no longer need to rely\non two different legislative texts for the provisions related to controls.\nControllability is enhanced by\nclarification, simplification and harmonisation of the production rules and the\nremoval of a series of possible exceptions to such rules.\nThe proposal seeks to do away with the\npossibility to exempt certain types of retailers provided for in Regulation\n(EC) No 834/2007, which has led to different interpretations and practices\nacross Member States and has made management, supervision and control more\ndifficult.\nThe risk-based approach to official\ncontrols is reinforced by removing the requirement for mandatory annual\nverification of compliance of all operators provided for in Regulation (EC)\nNo 834/2007. This will make it possible to adapt the control frequency,\nthrough delegated acts to be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No XX/XXX\n(Official Controls Regulation, so that operators with a low risk profile may be\nphysically inspected less than annually and/or subject to reduced annual\nphysical inspections, while higher risk operators would be more closely\ntargeted. There will thus be a fairer balance of the control pressure on\noperators, with a reduced burden on those with a proven track record of\ncompliance with the rules, and more effective and efficient use of resources by\nthe competent authorities, control authorities and control bodies.\nSpecific provisions are introduced in order\nto increase transparency with regard to fees that may be collected for the\ncontrols, and the provisions related to publication of operators together with\ninformation on their certification status are reinforced.\nA system of group certification is\nintroduced for small-scale farmers in the Union with a view to reducing\ninspection and certification costs and the associated administrative burden,\nstrengthening local networks, contributing to better market outlets, and\nensuring a level playing field with operators in third countries.\nSpecific provisions are introduced for\npurposes of enhanced traceability and fraud prevention: operators may not be\ncontrolled by different control authorities or bodies for the same groups of\nproducts across different stages of the organic chain. \nSpecific provisions are also introduced to\nharmonise action to be taken when non-authorised products or substances are\ndetected. In this context, there may be instances where farmers are prevented\nfrom marketing their products as organic due to the unintentional presence of\nnon-authorised products or substances. Member States may be authorised by the\nCommission to grant national payments to compensate for the losses incurred in\nsuch instances. In addition, Member States may use the instruments of the\nCommon Agricultural Policy to cover totally or partially such losses.\nLastly, the proposal sets out action to be\ntaken throughout the Union on the same broad categories of non-compliance so as\nto ensure a level playing field in the treatment of operators, a properly\nfunctioning\u00a0 internal market and maintenance of consumers' trust, while not\nprejudging the\u00a0 determination of sanctions that is within\u00a0 Member States'\ncompetence.\nThe trade regime is adapted to improve the\nlevel playing for the organic operators of the European Union and in Third\nCountries and to better ensure consumer confidence. The possibility of\nequivalence agreements with Third Countries remains while the system of\nunilateral equivalency is phased out. The recognition of control bodies is\nproposed to be progressively shifted to a compliance regime.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal\nbasis \nTreaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion, the first paragraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) thereof.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity\nand proportionality principles\nThe proposal revises an existing quality\nscheme set within the CAP. Production of and trade in agricultural products and\nfoodstuffs on the market of the European Union and ensuring that the internal\nmarket in organic products functions properly, are matters of Union competence\nshared with MS.\nAs part of the overall CAP, to ensure\nsmooth development of the single market, a Union-wide organic scheme is more\nefficient than 28 different schemes. In addition, it allows for a stronger\nand more consistent trade policy vis-\u00e0-vis global trading partners, in\nparticular by enhancing the bargaining power of the Union.\nThe proposal leads to further harmonisation\nin the following areas:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current scope offered to Member States for granting\nexceptions to the rules, which leads to unfair competition among operators,\nrisk of loss of consumer confidence, complexity in the legislation and trade\nissues (difficulties in enforcing compliance), is reduced.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that the response to the same non-compliance\nwith EU organic legislation can vary between Member States is an issue leading\nto unfair competition and ineffective functioning of the single market.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice\nof instruments\nThe proposed instrument is a regulation,\nsince the existing provisions have been proven to provide an appropriate\nframework for Member States; no other type of measure would be appropriate. A\ndirective would lay down more flexible rules, which could entail unfair\ncompetition among operators and lead to confusion and deception of consumers. A\nregulation provides a consistent approach for Member States to follow and\nreduces the administrative burden because operators are required to comply with\na single set of rules. Soft law instruments such as guidelines are considered\ninadequate to tackle differences in the interpretation and implementation of\nthe rules and in view of the international context.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS \nThe proposal allocates a budget for\ntechnical assistance measures. Details of the budgetary implications can be\nfound in the legislative financial statement.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS:\nSIMPLIFICATION\nThe proposal provides for simplifications\nand clarifications and fills several gaps in the legislation. It involves the\nremoval of 37 of the 135 existing obligations in the organic farming\nlegislation. The proposal involves significant reduction of the administrative\nburden. Delegated acts stemming from the proposal will be drafted according to\nthe same principles.\nOn production rules, the proposal greatly\nsimplifies things for operators and national administrations with a limitation\non the Member States' scope for granting exceptions. Several ineffective\nprovisions are removed, particularly through reinforcement of the risk-based\napproach to controls. On the import side, the compliance regime for control\nbodies will be easier to manage for the producers, the control bodies and the\nCommission.\nA significant simplification for small\nfarmers is brought about by group certification, which entails more proportionate\ninspection and record-keeping requirements.\nThe proposal intends to make the\nlegislation more user-friendly. In particular, while the general production\nrules remain in the text of the Regulation, the specific organic production\nrules are contained in an Annex to the Regulation.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ALIGNMENT\nIn 2010, the Commission adopted COM\n(2010)759 concerning the alignment to the Treaty of Lisbon of Council\nRegulation (EC) No 834/2007. A detailed discussion in trialogues in 2011 and\n2012 lead in practice to a standstill on the alignment proposal. The current\nproposal incorporates the necessary elements of the alignment proposal,\nincluding architecture of legal provisions in basic act, delegated acts and\nimplementing acts.\u00a0 . COM (2010) 759 will therefore be withdrawn as obsolete.\n2014/0100 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non organic production and labelling of\norganic products, amending Regulation (EU) No XXX/XXX of the European\nParliament and of the Council [Official controls Regulation] and repealing\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 834/2007\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular the first paragraph of\nArticle 42 and Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[9],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[10],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Organic production is an\noverall system of farm management and food production that combines best\nenvironmental and climate action practices, a high level of biodiversity, the\npreservation of natural resources, the application of high animal welfare\nstandards and production standards in line with the demand of a growing number\nof consumers for products produced using natural substances and processes.\nOrganic production thus plays a dual societal role, where it, on the one hand,\nprovides for a specific market responding to consumer demand for organic\nproducts and, on the other hand, delivers publicly available goods contributing\nto the protection of the environment and animal welfare, as well as to rural\ndevelopment.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The observance of high\nhealth, environmental and animal welfare standards in the production of organic\nproducts is intrinsic to the high quality of those products. As underlined in\nthe Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the\nCouncil, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the\nRegions on agricultural product quality policy[11],\norganic production forms part of the Union's agricultural product quality\nschemes together with geographical indications, traditional specialties\nguaranteed and products of the outermost regions of the Union, as laid down in\nRegulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[12] and Regulation (EU) No\n228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[13], respectively. In this\nsense, organic production pursues the same objectives within the common\nagricultural policy (\u2018CAP\u2019) which are inherent to all the agricultural product\nquality schemes of the Union.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In particular, the\nobjectives of the organic production policy are embedded in the objectives of\nthe CAP by ensuring that farmers receive a fair return for complying with the\norganic production rules. In addition, the growing consumer demand for organic\nproducts creates conditions for further development and expansion of the market\nin those products and thus for an increase in the return of farmers engaged in\norganic production. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, organic\nproduction is a system that contributes to the integration of environmental\nprotection requirements into the CAP, and promotes sustainable agricultural\nproduction. That is why, measures financially supporting organic production\nhave been introduced under the CAP, most recently under Regulation (EU) No\n1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[14], and in particular\nstrengthened in the recent reform of the legal framework for rural development\npolicy as established by Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council[15].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Organic production also\ncontributes to the achievements of the Union environmental policy objectives,\nin particular those of the 2020 Biodiversity Strategy[16], the Green\nInfrastructure Communication[17],\nthe Soil Thematic Strategy[18]\nand environmental legislation such as the Birds[19] and Habits[20] Directives, the\nNitrates Directive[21],\nthe Water Framework Directive[22],\nthe National Emissions Ceiling Directive[23]\nand the Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides[24].\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the objectives\nof the Union's organic production policy, the legal framework established for\nimplementing that policy should aim at ensuring fair competition and a proper\nfunctioning of the internal market in organic products, and at maintaining and\njustifying consumer confidence in products labelled as organic. It should\nfurther aim at providing conditions under which the policy can progress in line\nwith production and market developments. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The policy priorities of\nthe Europe 2020 strategy as set out in the Commission Communication entitled\n\u2018Europe 2020: A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth\u2019[25] include the aims of\nachieving a competitive economy based on knowledge and innovation, fostering a\nhigh-employment economy delivering social and territorial cohesion and\nsupporting the shift towards a resource-efficient and low-carbon economy. The\norganic production policy should therefore provide operators with the right\ntools to better identify and promote their products while protecting them\nagainst unfair practices.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the dynamic\nevolution of the organic sector, Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007[26] identified the need\nfor a future review of the Union rules on organic production, taking into\naccount the experience gained from the application of those rules. The results\nof that review carried out by the Commission show that the Union legal\nframework governing organic production should be improved to provide for rules\nthat correspond to the high expectations of consumers and that guarantee sufficient\nclarity for those to whom they are addressed. Therefore, Regulation (EC)\nNo 834/2007 should be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience gained so far\nwith the application of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 shows a need to clarify the\nproducts to which this Regulation applies. Primarily, it should cover\nagricultural products, including aquaculture products, listed in Annex I to the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\u2018the Treaty\u2019). Moreover, it\nshould cover processed agricultural products for use as food or feed because\nthe placing on the market of such products as organic provides a major outlet\nfor agricultural products and ensures visibility to the consumer of the organic\nnature of the agricultural products from which they are processed. Likewise,\nthis Regulation should cover certain other products which are linked to\nagricultural products in a similarly close way as processed agricultural\nproducts because those other products either constitute a major outlet for\nagricultural products or form an integral part of the production process.\nFinally, sea salt should be included in the scope of this Regulation because it\nis produced by applying natural production techniques and its production\ncontributes to the development of rural areas, and thus falls within the\nobjectives of this Regulation. For reasons of clarity, those other products,\nnot listed in Annex I to the Treaty, should be listed in an Annex to this\nRegulation. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to supplement or\namend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt\nacts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the\nCommission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out\nappropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert\nlevel. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should\nensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\ndocuments to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take into\naccount new production methods or material or international committments, the\npower to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the Commission in respect of\nthe amendment of the list of other products falling within the scope of this\nRegulation. Only products which are closely linked to agricultural products\nshould be eligible for inclusion in that list.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because of the local nature\nof mass catering operations, measures taken by Member States and private\nschemes in this area are considered adequate to ensure the functioning of the\nsingle market. Therefore, food prepared by mass caterers on their premises\nshould not be subject to this Regulation. Equally, products of hunting and\nfishing of wild animals should not be covered by this Regulation since the\nproduction process cannot be fully controlled.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Research\nprojects have demonstrated that consumer confidence is crucial in the market\nfor organic food. In the long run, rules that are not trustworthy can\njeopardise public confidence and lead to market failure. Therefore the\nsustainable development of organic production in the Union should be based on\nsound production rules which are harmonised at Union level. In addition, those\nproduction rules should meet operators' and consumers' expectations regarding\nthe quality of organic products and the compliance with the principles and\nrules laid down in this Regulation.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should\napply without prejudice to related legislation, such as in the field of safety\nof the food chain, animal health and welfare, plant health, plant reproductive\nmaterial, labelling and the environment. More specifically, as regards the\nauthorisation of products and substances that may be used for the production of\norganic products, it is important to highlight that such products and\nsubstances have to be authorised at Union level first. Therefore this\nRegulation should apply without prejudice to other specific Union provisions\nrelating to the authorisation and placing on the market of those products and\nsusbstances.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a matter of principle,\nthe general production rules of this Regulation should include a prohibition on\nthe use of ionising radiation and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and\nproducts produced from or by GMOs. Since consumers are more and more concerned\nabout environmental impacts of food processing and transportation, organic\noperators other than farmers and operators producing seaweed or aquaculture\nanimals should be required to manage their environmental performance according\nto a harmonised system. With the objective of minimising the regulatory burden\nof micro-enterprises as defined in Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC[27] involved in organic\nproduction, it is appropriate to exempt them from this requirement. In order to\nensure the correct application of the general production rules, the power to\nadopt certain acts should be delegated to the Commission in respect of\nestablishing the criteria to which the environmental management system is to\ncorrespond.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nrisk of non-compliance with the organic production rules is considered higher\nin agricultural holdings which include units not managed under organic\nproduction rules. Therefore, after an appropriate conversion period, all\nagricultural holdings in the Union which aim to become organic should be\nentirely managed in compliance with the requirements applicable to organic\nproduction. Organic agricultural\nholdings should undergo the same conversion period in all Member States,\nirrespective of whether they have previously adhered to agri-environmental\nmeasures supported by Union funds. However, no conversion period is necessary in\nthe case of fallow land.\u00a0 In order to ensure quality, traceability and\ncompliance with this Regulation and adaptation to technical developments, the\npower to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the Commission in respect of\nestablishing rules supplementing the general conversion rules or supplementing\nand amending the specific conversion rules.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific\nproduction rules should be established with regard to plant, livestock and\naquaculture production, including rules for the collection of wild plants and\nseaweeds, and with regard to the production of processed food and feed, as well\nas of wine and yeast to ensure harmonisation and respect of the objectives and\nprinciples of organic production.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As organic plant production\nis based on nourishing the plants primarily through the soil ecosystem,\nhydroponic production should not be allowed. In addition, organic plant\nproduction should involve the use of production techniques that prevent or\nminimise any contribution to the contamination of the environment. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning soil management\nand fertilisation, conditions should be laid down for the use of cultivation\npractices allowed in organic plant production and for the use of fertilisers\nand conditioners.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of pesticides,\u00a0\nshould be significantly restricted. Preference should be given to the\napplication of measures that prevent any damage by pests and weeds through\ntechniques which do not involve the use of plant protection products such as\ncrop rotation. Presence of pests and weeds should be monitored to decide\nwhether any intervention is economically and ecologically justified. The use of\ncertain plant protection products should be allowed if such techniques do not provide\nadequate protection and only if those plant protection products have been\nauthorised in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council[28], after having been assessed to be compatible\nwith objectives and principles of organic production, including with\nrestrictive\u00a0 conditions of use, and consequently authorised in accordance with\nthis Regulation.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure quality,\ntraceability and compliance with this Regulation and adaptation to technical\ndevelopments, the power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of establishing rules amending or supplementing the\nspecific plant production rules as regards cultivation practices, soil\nmanagement and fertilisation, plant health and management of pests and weeds,\nmanagement of mushroom production and other specific plants and plant\nproduction systems, the production origin of plant reproductive material and\nthe collection of wild plants.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As livestock production\nnaturally involves the management of agricultural land, where the manure is\nused to nourish crop production, landless livestock production should be\nprohibited. The choice of breeds should take account of their capacity to adapt\nto local conditions, their vitality and their resistance to disease, and a wide\nbiological diversity should be encouraged.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Organic livestock and\naquaculture production housing, including where relevant the aquatic medium,\nshould satisfy the behavioural needs of the animals. Specific housing\nconditions and husbandry practices should be laid down with regard to certain\nanimals, including bees. Those conditions and practices should ensure a high\nlevel of animal welfare, which in certain aspects should go beyond the Union\nanimal welfare standards applicable to livestock production in general. In most\ncases livestock should have permanent access to open air areas for grazing and\nsuch open air areas should in principle be organised under an appropriate\nsystem of rotation.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid environmental\npollution of natural resources such as soil and water by nutrients, an upper\nlimit for the use of manure per hectare and for keeping livestock per hectare\nshould be set. That limit should be related to the nitrogen content of the\nmanure. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mutilations which lead to\nstress, harm, disease or suffering of animals should be prohibited.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Livestock should be fed on\nfeed materials produced in accordance with the rules of organic production, and\npreferably coming from the own holding, taking their physiological needs into\naccount. In addition, in order to provide for the basic nutritional\nrequirements of livestock, certain minerals, trace elements and vitamins may\nneed to be used under well-defined conditions.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Animal health management\nshould mainly be based on prevention of disease. In addition, specific cleaning\nand disinfection measures should be applied. The preventive use of\nchemically-synthesised allopathic medicinal products should not be permitted in\norganic production, except in the event of sickness or injury of an animal\nrequiring immediate treatment and limited to the minimum necessary to\nre-establish the well-being of the animal. In such cases, in order to guarantee\nthe integrity of organic production for consumers, it should be possible to\ntake restrictive measures such as doubling the official withdrawal period after\nuse of such medicinal products as specified in the relevant Union legislation.\nRegarding beekeeping, it is necessary to lay down specific rules for disease\nprevention and veterinary treatment. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure quality,\ntraceability and compliance with this Regulation and adaptation to technical\ndevelopments, the power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of establishing rules amending or supplementing the\nspecific livestock production rules as regards the origin of animals, livestock\nhousing, including minimum surface areas indoors and outdoors and the maximum\nnumber of animals per hectare, husbandry practices, breeding, feed and feeding,\ndisease prevention and veterinary treatment.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation reflects\nthe objectives of the new Common Fisheries Policy as regards aquaculture, which\nplays a key role in ensuring sustainable, long-term food security as well as\ngrowth and employment while reducing pressure on wild fish stocks, in a context\nof growing global aquatic food demand. The 2013 Communication from the\nCommission to the Council and the European Parliament on Strategic Guidelines\nfor the sustainable development of European aquaculture[29] highlights the main\nchallenges faced by the Union aquaculture and its potential for growth. It\nidentifies organic aquaculture as a particularly promising sector, and\nhighlights the competitive advantages deriving from organic certification.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Organic\naquaculture is a relatively new field of organic production compared to organic\nagriculture where long experience exists at the farm level. Given consumers\u2019\ngrowing interest in organic aquaculture products, further growth in the\nconversion of aquaculture units to organic production is likely. This is\nleading to increased experience, technical knowledge and development, with\nimprovements in organic aquaculture that should be reflected in the production\nrules.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure common\nunderstanding,\u00a0 avoid ambiguities and guarantee uniform application of the\norganic aquaculture animal and seaweed production rules, certain definitions\nrelating to aquaculture should accompany those production rules.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure quality,\ntraceability and compliance with this Regulation and adaptation to technical\ndevelopments, the power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of establishing rules amending or supplementing the\nspecific seaweed production rules as regards the suitability of the aquatic\nmedium and the sustainable management plan, the harvesting of wild seaweed,\nseaweed cultivation, and antifouling measures and cleaning of production\nequipment and facilities, and in respect of the establishment of rules supplementing\nthe specific production rules for aquaculture animals as regards the\nsuitability of the aquatic medium and the sustainable management plan, the\norigin of aquaculture animals, aquaculture husbandry, including aquatic\ncontainment systems, production systems and maximum stocking density, breeding,\nmanagement of aquaculture animals, feed and feeding, and disease prevention and\nveterinary treatment.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Operators producing organic\nfood or feed should follow appropriate procedures based on systematic\nidentification of critical processing steps in order to ensure that processed\nproducts comply with the organic production rules. Organic processed products\nshould be produced by means of processing methods which guarantee that the\norganic integrity and vital qualities of the products are maintained through\nall stages of organic production. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provisions concerning the\ncomposition of organic processed food should be laid down. In particular, such\nfood should be produced mainly from agricultural ingredients that are organic\nwith a limited possibility to use certain non-organic agricultural ingredients\nspecified in this Regulation. In addition, only certain substances authorised\nin accordance with this Regulation should be allowed for use in the production of\norganic processed food.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Processed food should be\nlabelled as organic only where all or almost all the ingredients of\nagricultural origin are organic. However, special labelling provisions should\nbe laid down for processed foods which include agricultural ingredients that\ncannot be obtained organically, as is the case for products of hunting and\nfishing. Moreover, for the purposes of consumer information and transparency in\nthe market, and to encourage the use of organic ingredients, it should also be\nmade possible to refer to organic production in the ingredients list under\ncertain conditions.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provisions concerning the\ncomposition of organic processed feed and the use of certain substances and\ntechniques in the production of that feed should be laid down.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure quality,\ntraceability and compliance with this Regulation and adaptation to technical\ndevelopments, the power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of establishing rules amending or supplementing the\nspecific production rules for processed food and feed as regards the procedures\nto be followed, preventive measures to be taken, the composition of processed\nfood and feed, cleaning measures, the placing on the market of processed\nproducts including their labelling and identification, separation of organic\nproducts, agricultural ingredients and feed materials from non-organic\nproducts, agricultural ingredients and feed materials, the list of non-organic\nagricultural ingredients which may exceptionally be used in the production of\norganic processed products, calculation of the percentage of agricultural\ningredients, and the techniques used in food or feed processing.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Organic wine should be\nproduced entirely from organic raw material and only certain substances\nauthorised in accordance with this Regulation should be allowed to be added.\nCertain oenological practices, processes and treatments should be prohibited in\nthe production of organic wine. Other practices, processes and treatments should\nbe permitted under well-defined conditions.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure quality,\ntraceability and compliance with this Regulation and adaptation to technical\ndevelopments, the power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of establishing rules amending or supplementing the\nspecific wine production rules as regards oenological practices and\nrestrictions.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initially yeast was not\nconsidered an agricultural ingredient under Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 and\ntherefore it did not count for the agricultural composition of organic\nproducts. However, Commission Regulation (EC) No 889/2008[30] introduced the\nobligatory calculation of yeast and yeast products as agricultural ingredients\nfor the purposes of organic production as of 31 December 2013, which gave the\nindustry sufficient time to adjust to that rule. Accordingly, only organically\nproduced substrates should be used in the production of organic yeast and only\ncertain substances should be allowed for use in its production, confection and\nformulation. In addition, organic yeast should not be present in organic food\nor feed together with non-organic yeast. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure quality,\ntraceability and compliance with this Regulation and adaptation to technical\ndevelopments, the power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of establishing rules amending or supplementing the\nspecific production rules for organic yeast as regards the processing and the\nsubstrates used in its production.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take account of\nany future need to have specific production rules for products whose production\ndoes not fall within any of the categories of specific production rules laid\ndown in this Regulation, as well as in order to ensure quality, traceability\nand compliance with this Regulation and, subsequently, adaptation to technical\ndevelopments, the power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of establishing specific production rules for such\nproducts, including amendments or supplements thereof.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 834/2007\nprovided for different exceptions from organic production rules. The experience\ngained from the application of those provisions has shown that such exceptions\nhave a negative impact on organic production. In particular, it has been found\nthat the very existence of such exceptions impedes the production of inputs in\norganic form and that the high level of animal welfare associated with organic\nproduction is not ensured. In addition, the management and control of\nexceptions entail considerable administrative burden, both for the national\nadministrations and operators. Finally, the existence of exceptions has created\nconditions for distortions in competition and has threatened to undermine\nconsumer confidence. Accordingly, the scope for allowing exceptions from\norganic production rules should be further restricted and limited to cases of\ncatastrophic circumstances.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow organic\nproduction to continue or recommence in cases of catastrophic circumstances,\nthe power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the Commission in\nrespect of establishing the criteria for qualifying cases of catastrophic\ncircumstances and to lay down specific rules for addressing such cases and for\nthe necessary monitoring and reporting requirements. \n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under certain conditions\norganic products and non-organic products can be collected and transported\nsimultaneously. In order to duly separate organic from non-organic products\nduring handling and to avoid any commingling, specific provisions should be\nlaid down.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nintegrity of organic production and adaptation to technical developments, the\npower to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the Commission in respect of\nestablishing rules amending or supplementing the specific rules on collection,\npackaging, transport and storage of organic products.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use in organic\nproduction of products and substances such as plant protection products,\nfertilisers, soil conditioners, nutrients, components of animal nutrition, feed\nor food additives, processing aids and products for cleaning and disinfection\nshould be limited to the minimum and under the specific conditions laid down in\nthis Regulation. The same approach should be followed regarding the use of\nproducts and substances as food additives and processing aids in the production\nof organic processed food. Therefore,\u00a0 provisions should be laid down to define\nany possible use of such products and substances in organic production in\ngeneral and in the production of organic processed food in particular, subject\nto the principles laid down in this Regulation and to certain criteria. \n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure quality,\ntraceability and compliance with this Regulation as regards organic production in\ngeneral and the production of organic processed food in particular, and\nadaptation to technical developments, the power to adopt certain acts should be\ndelegated to the Commission to provide for additional criteria for the\nauthorisation or withdrawal of the authorisation of products and substances for\nuse in organic production in general and in the production of organic processed\nfood in particular, and other requirements for the use of such authorised\nproducts and substances. \n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of specific\nUnion rules on the measures to take when non-authorised substances or products\nare present in organic products, different approaches have been developed and\nimplemented across the Union. This situation creates uncertainties for\noperators, control authorities and control bodies. It may also entail a\ndifferent treatment of operators in the Union and affect consumers' confidence\nin organic products. It is therefore appropriate to lay down clear and uniform\nprovisions to prohibit marketing as organic those products in which any\nnon-authorised products or substances are present beyond given levels. Those\nlevels should be established taking account in\nparticular of Commission Directive 2006/125/EC[31]\non processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young\nchildren.\u00a0\u00a0 \n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\neffectiveness, efficiency and transparency of the organic production and\nlabelling system, the power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the\nCommission \u00a0in respect of specific criteria and conditions for the\nestablishment and application of the levels of presence of non-authorised\nproducts and substances beyond which products shall not be marketed as organic\nand with respect to the establishment of those levels and their adaptation in\nthe light of technical developments. \n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Organic production is based\non the general principle of restriction of the use of external inputs. Farmers\nare required to take measures to prevent the risk of contamination by\nnon-authorised products or substances. Despite such measures, there may be\ninstances where farmers are prevented from marketing their agricultural\nproducts as organic due to the unintentional presence of non-authorised\nproducts or substances. It is therefore appropriate to provide for the\npossibility whereby Member States may, in accordance with Article 42 of the\nTreaty, be authorised by the Commission to grant national payments to\ncompensate for the losses incurred in such instances. Member States may also\nuse the instruments of the Common Agricultural Policy to cover totally or\npartially such losses.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The labelling of\nagricultural products and foodstuffs should be subject to the general rules\nlaid down in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European\nParliament and of the Council[32], and in particular the provisions aimed at preventing labelling\nthat may confuse or mislead consumers. In addition, specific provisions\nrelating to the labelling of organic products should be laid down in this\nRegulation. They should protect both the interests of operators in having their\nproducts correctly identified on the market and enjoying conditions of fair\ncompetition, and those of consumers in enabling them to make informed choices.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly,\nthe terms used to indicate organic products should be protected from being used\nin the labelling of non-organic products throughout the Union and independently\nof the language used. The protection should also apply to the usual derivatives\nor diminutives of those terms, whether they are used alone or combined.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to create clarity for consumers throughout the Union market, the use of\nthe organic production logo of the European Union should be made obligatory for\nall organic pre-packed food produced within the Union. It should otherwise be\npossible to use that logo on a voluntary basis in the case of non pre-packed\norganic products produced within the Union or any organic products imported\nfrom third countries. The model of the organic production logo of the European\nUnion should be set out in this Regulation.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However,\nin order not to mislead consumers as to the organic nature of the entire\nproduct, it is considered appropriate to limit the use of that logo to products\nwhich contain only, or almost only, organic ingredients. It should therefore\nnot be allowed to use it in the labelling of in-conversion products or\nprocessed products of which less than 95 % of their ingredients of agricultural\norigin are organic.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe sake of avoiding any possible confusion amongst consumers about the Union or non-Union origin of a product, whenever the organic production logo of the\nEuropean Union is used, consumers should be informed about the place where the\nagricultural raw materials of which the product is composed have been farmed.\nIn this context, it should be allowed to refer to aquaculture in the label of\nproducts from organic aquaculture instead of referring to agriculture.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to provide clarity for consumers and to ensure that the appropriate\ninformation is communicated to them, the power to adopt certain acts should be\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of adapting the list of terms referring\nto organic production set out in this Regulation, establishing the specific\nlabelling and composition requirements applicable to feed and ingredients\nthereof, laying down further rules on labelling and the use of the indications,\nother than the organic production logo of the European Union, set out in this\nRegulation, and amending the organic production logo of the European Union and\nthe rules relating thereto. \n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Organic\nproduction is only credible if accompanied by effective verification and\ncontrols at all stages of production, processing and distribution. Organic\nproduction should be subject to official controls or other official activities\ncarried out in accordance with Regulation (EU) No (XXX/XXXX) of the European\nParliament and of the Council[33]\nto verify compliance with the rules on organic production and labelling of\norganic products.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific\nrequirements should be laid down to ensure compliance with the rules that are\npeculiar to organic production. In particular, provisions should be made for notification\nof the activities of the operators and for a certification system to identify\nthe operators that comply with the rules governing organic production and labelling\nof organic products. Those provisions should also apply to any subcontractors\nof the operators concerned. The transparency of the certification system should\nbe ensured by requiring Member States to make public the list of operators that\nhave notified their activities and any fees that may be collected in relation\nto the controls for verifying compliance with the organic production rules. \n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Small\nfarmers in the Union face, individually, relatively high inspection costs and\nadministrative burden linked to organic certification. A system of group\ncertification should be allowed with a view to reducing the inspection and\ncertification costs and the associated administrative burden, strengthening\nlocal networks, contributing to better market outlets and ensuring a level\nplaying field with operators in third countries. For that reason, the concept\nof \u2018group of operators\u2019 should be introduced and\ndefined.\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to ensure the effectiveness, efficiency and transparency of the organic\nproduction and labelling system, the power to adopt certain acts should be\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of the requirements for keeping of\nrecords by operators or groups of operators, the requirements for publication\nof the list of operators, the requirements and procedures to be applied for\u00a0\npublication of the fees that may be collected in relation to the controls for\nverifying compliance with the organic production rules and for supervision by\nthe competent authorities of the application of those fees, as well as the\ncriteria for defining the groups of products in respect of which operators\nshould be entitled to have only one organic certificate issued by the control\nauthority or control body concerned.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to ensure that the certification of a group of operators is done\neffectively and efficiently, the\npower to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the Commission in respect of\nthe responsibilities of the individual members of a group of operators, the\ncomposition and size of that group, the categories of products to be produced\nby a group of operators, the conditions for participation in the group, and the\nset up and functioning of the group's system for internal controls, including\nthe scope, content and frequency of the controls to be carried out. \n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nexperience with the arrangements for import of organic products into the Union\nunder Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 has shown that there is a need to revise\nthose arrangements in order to respond to consumer expectations that imported\norganic products meet rules as high as those of the Union, as well as to better\nensure the access of Union organic products to the international market. In\naddition, it is necessary to provide for clarity regarding the rules applicable\nto export of organic products, in particular by establishing a certificate of\nexport and laying down provisions for export to third countries recognised for\nthe purpose of equivalence under Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. \n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nprovisions governing the import of products that comply with the Union\nproduction and labelling rules and in respect of which operators have been\nsubject to the control of control authorities and control bodies recognised by\nthe Commission as competent to carry out controls and certification in the\nfield of organic production in third countries, should be further reinforced.\nIn particular, requirements concerning the accreditation bodies which accredit\ncontrol bodies for the purposes of import of compliant organic products into\nthe Union should be laid down, aiming at ensuring a level playing field for the\nsupervision of the control bodies by the Commission. Furthermore, it is\nnecessary to provide for the possibility for the Commission to contact directly\nthe accreditation bodies and competent authorities in third countries to render\nthe supervision of control authorities and control bodies respectively more\nefficient. \n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\npossibility for organic products to get access to the Union market where such\nproducts do not comply with the Union rules on organic production but come from\nthird countries whose organic production and control systems have been\nrecognised as equivalent to those of the Union should be preserved. However,\nthe recognition of equivalence of third countries, as laid down in Regulation\n(EC) No 834/2007, should only be granted through an international\nagreement between the Union and those third countries, where a reciprocal\nrecognition of equivalence would be also pursued for the Union. \n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Third\ncountries recognised for the\npurpose of equivalence under Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 should continue to be recognised as such under this Regulation, for a limited period of time necessary to ensure a smooth transition\nto the scheme of recognition through an international agreement, provided that they continue to ensure the equivalence of their organic\nproduction and control rules to the relevant Union rules in force and that they\nfulfil all requirements relating to the supervision of their recognition by the\nCommission. That supervision should be based in particular on the annual\nreports the third countries send to the Commission. \n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nexperience with the scheme of control authorities and control bodies recognised\nas competent to carry out controls and issue certificates in third countries\nfor the purpose of import of products providing equivalent guarantees shows\nthat the rules applied by those authorities and bodies are different and could\nbe difficult to be considered as equivalent to the respective Union rules.\nFurthermore, multiplication of control authorities and control bodies standards\nhampers adequate supervision by the Commission. Therefore that scheme of\nrecognition of equivalence should be abolished. However, sufficient time should\nbe given to those control authorities and control bodies so that they can\nprepare themselves for obtaining recognition for the purposes of import of\nproducts complying with Union rules. \n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The placing on the market\u00a0\nas organic of any organic product imported into the Union, under any of the\nimport arrangements provided for in this Regulation, should be subject to the\navailability of the information necessary to ensure the traceability of the\nproduct on the food chain.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure fair\ncompetition among operators, the traceability of the imported products intended\nto be placed on the market within the Union as organic or the transparency of\nthe recognition and supervision procedure for control authorities and control\nbodies within the context of import of compliant organic products, and in order\nto ensure the management of the list of third countries recognised for the\npurpose of equivalence under Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, the power to adopt\ncertain acts should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the documents\nintended for customs authorities in third countries, in particular an organic\nexport certificate, in electronic form wherever possible, the documents\nnecessary for the purposes of import, also in electronic form wherever possible,\nthe criteria for recognition or withdrawal of the recognition of control\nauthorities and control bodies in the context of import of compliant organic\nproducts, and in respect of the information to be sent by third countries\nrecognised under that Regulation necessary for the supervision of their\nrecognition and the exercise of that supervision by the Commission, including\non-the-spot examination.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision should be made to\nensure that the movement of organic products that have been subject to a\ncontrol in one Member State and which comply with this Regulation cannot be\nrestricted in another Member State. In order to ensure the proper functioning\nof the single market and trade between Member States, the power to adopt\ncertain acts should be delegated to the Commission to lay down rules relating\nto the free movement of organic products.\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of obtainaing\nreliable information needed for the implementation of this Regulation, Member\nStates should provide the Commission annually with the necessary information.\nFor reasons of clarity and transparency, Member States should keep updated\nlists of competent authorities, control authorities and control bodies. The\nlists of control authorities and control bodies should be made public by the\nMember States and annually published by the Commission.\u00a0 \n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to lay down\nmeasures to ensure a smooth transition to some modifications of the legal\nframework governing the import of organic products into the Union, as\nintroduced by this Regulation. In particular, in order to ensure a smooth\ntransition from the old to the new legal framework, the power to adopt certain\nacts should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the rules relating to\nconversion periods starting under Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, by way of\nderogation from the general rule that no previous periods may be recognised\nretroactively as being part of the conversion period. \n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, a date for the\nexpiration of the recognition of control authorities and control bodies for the\npurpose of equivalence should be set and provisions to address the situation\nuntil the expiration of their recognition should be laid down. Provisions\nshould also be laid down regarding applications from third countries for the\npurpose of equivalence which have been submitted under Regulation (EC) No 834/2007\nand which are pending at the time of entry into force of this Regulation. \n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nmanagement of the list of control authorities and control bodies recognised for\nthe purpose of equivalence under Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 and to facilitate\nthe completion of the examination of applications from third countries for\nrecognition for the purpose of equivalence that are pending at the date of\nentry into force of this Regulation, the power to adopt certain acts should be\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of the information to be sent by those\ncontrol authorities and control bodies that is necessary for the supervision of\ntheir recognition and in respect of the exercise of that supervision by the\nCommission, as well as in respect of any procedural rules necessary for the\nexamination of the pending applications from third countries.\u00a0 \n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers\nshould be conferred on the Commission as regards the technical details for the\nestablishment of the database for the listing of the varieties for which plant\nreproductive material obtained by the organic production method is available,\nas regards the authorisation or the withdrawal of the authorisation of the\nproducts and substances that may be used in organic production in general and\nin the production of processed organic food in particular, including the\nprocedures to be followed for the authorisation and the lists of those products\nand substances and, where appropriate, their description, compositional\nrequirement and conditions for use, as regards the specific and practical\nmodalities regarding the presentation, composition and size of the indications\nreferring to the code numbers of control authorities and control bodies and of the indication of the place where the agricultural raw materials\nhave been farmed, the assignment of code numbers to\ncontrol authorities and control bodies and the indication of the place\nwhere the agricultural raw materials have been farmed, as regards the details\nand specifications regarding the content, form and way of notification of the\nnotifications by operators and groups of operators of their activity to the\ncompetent authorities and the form of publication of the fees that may be\ncollected for the controls, as regards \u00a0the exchange of\ninformation between groups of operators and competent authorities, control\nauthorities and control bodies and between Member States and the Commission, as\nregards the recognition or withdrawal of the recognition of control authorities\nand control bodies which are competent to carry out controls in third countries\nand the establishment of the list of those control authorities and control\nbodies and rules to ensure the application of measures in relation to cases of\nnon-compliance, or suspicion thereof, affecting the integrity of imported\norganic products, as regards the establishment of a\nlist of third countries recognised under Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No\n834/2007 and the amendment of that list as well as\nrules to ensure the application of measures in relation to cases of\nnon-compliance, or suspicion thereof, affecting the integrity of organic\nproducts imported from those countries, as regards the system to be used to\ntransmit the information necessary for the implementation and monitoring of\nthis Regulation, and as regards the establishment of the list of control\nauthorities and control bodies recognised under Article 33(3) of Regulation\n(EC) No 834/2007 and the amendment of that list. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU)\nNo 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[34].\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should be\nempowered to adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly\njustified cases relating to the protection against unfair practices or\npractices which are incompatible with the principles and rules on organic\nproduction, the protection of consumers' confidence or the protection of fair\ncompetition between operators, imperative grounds of urgency so require to\nensure the application of measures in relation to cases of non-compliance, or\nthe suspicion thereof, affecting the integrity of imported organic products\nunder the control of recognised control authorities or control bodies.\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a smooth\ntransition between on the one hand the rules on the organic origin of plant\nreproductive material and on animals for breeding purposes provided for in\nRegulation (EC) No 834/2007 and the exception to production rules adopted\npursuant to Article 22 of that Regulation, and on the other hand the new\nproduction rules for plants and plant products and livestock provided for in\nthis Regulation, the power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of the granting of exceptions where exceptions are deemed\nnecessary, in order to ensure access to plant reproductive material and live\nanimals for breeding purposes that may be used in organic production. Since\nthose acts are transitional in nature, they should apply for a limited period\nof time.\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\nconsider the situation of the availability of organic plant reproductive\nmaterial and animals for breeding purposes and present a report to this end to\nthe European Parliament and the Council in 2021. \n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision should be made to\nallow the exhaustion of stocks of products which have been produced in\naccordance with Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 and placed on the market before\nthis Regulation starts to apply.\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The review of the\nlegislative framework for organic production and labelling of organic products\nshowed that the specific needs relating to the official controls and other\nofficial activities carried out in accordance with Regulation (EU) No XXX/XXX\n(Official controls Regulation) require provisions to better address instances\nof non-compliance. In addition, the provisions of Regulation (EU) No XXX/XXX\n[official controls Regulation] relating to the tasks and responsibilities of\ncompetent authorities, the approval and supervision of delegated bodies,\nofficial certification,\u00a0 reporting obligations and administrative assistance\nshould be adapted to the specific needs of the organic production sector.\nRegulation (EU) No XXX/XXX [official controls Regulation] should therefore be\namended accordingly.\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of\nthis Regulation, in particular fair competition and proper functioning of the\ninternal market in organic products as well as ensuring consumer confidence in\nthose products and in the organic production logo of the European Union, cannot\nbe sufficiently achieved by the Member States themselves but can instead,\nbecause of the required harmonisation of the rules on organic production, be\nbetter achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance\nwith the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out\nin that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order\nto achieve those objectives.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\nprovide for a date of application of this Regulation that would give the\npossibility to operators to adapt to the new requirements introduced.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nChapter I\nSubject matter, scope and definitions\nArticle 1\nSubject\nmatter\nThis Regulation establishes the principles\nof organic production and lays down the rules concerning organic production and\nthe use of indications referring thereto in labelling and advertising.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation shall\napply to agricultural products listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union (\u2018the Treaty\u2019) and to some other products\nlisted in Annex I to this Regulation, insofar as those agricultural products\nand those other products are intended to be produced, prepared, distributed,\nplaced on the market, imported or exported as\norganic.\nThe products of hunting and fishing of wild\nanimals shall not be considered as organic products.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation shall\napply to any operator involved in activities, at any stage of production,\npreparation and distribution, relating to the products referred to in paragraph\n1.\nMass catering operations carried out by a mass\ncaterer as defined in point (d) of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU)\nNo 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[35] shall not be subject\nto this Regulation.\nMember States may apply national rules or, in\nthe absence thereof, private standards on labelling and control of products\noriginating from mass-catering operations.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation shall apply\nwithout prejudice to related Union legislation in the fields of inter alia\nsafety of the food chain, animal health and welfare, plant health, and plant\nreproductive material, and in particular to Regulation (EU) No XX/XXX of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[36]\n(plant reproductive material) and Regulation (EU) No XX/XXXX of the European\nParliament and of the Council[37]\n(protective measures against pests of plants). \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation shall\napply without prejudice to other specific Union provisions relating to the placing of products on the market and, in particular, to\nRegulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[38], and to Regulation\n(EU) No 1169/2011.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take into\naccount new information on production methods or material or international\ncommitments, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in\naccordance with Article 36 amending the list of products set out in Annex I.\nOnly products which are closely linked to agricultural products shall be\neligible for inclusion in that list.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the\nfollowing definitions shall apply:\n(1)                   \n\u2018organic production\u2019 means the use of production\nmethods compliant with this Regulation, at all stages of production, preparation\nand distribution;

Specific\nobjective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \nThe specific objectives of the proposal are\u00a0 :\n- to remove the obstacles to the development of organic production\u00a0\nin the Union,\n- to guarantee fair competition for farmers and operators and to\nimprove the functioning of the internal market, \n- to maintain or improve consumer confidence in organic products. \nIn accordance with the 2014-2020 Common Monitoring and Evaluation\nFramework (CMEF) for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)[55], the proposal\ncontributes to the general objectives: \"Sustainable management of natural\nresources and climate action\" by providing public goods (mostly\nenvironmental) and by pursuing \"climate change mitigation and\nadaptation\" and \"Viable food production\" by \"meeting\nconsumers expectations\" and by \"improving the competitiveness of the\nagricultural sector and enhancing the\u00a0 share in food-chain\", under the\nfirst Pillar of the CAP. \nIn addition, the proposal contributes to the general objective\n\"sustainable management of natural resources and climate action\"\u00a0 by\nrestoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems (priority 4) under Pillar II of\nthe CAP. \nThe proposal is related to measures supported under both Pillar I\n(direct payments and markets) and\u00a0 Pillar II of the CAP. \nABB activity concerned: 05 04 Rural Development (and 05 02\nInterventions in agricultural markets and 05 03 Direct aids).\n1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected result(s) and\nimpact\nSpecify the effects\nwhich the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\nA positive market\noutlook, thanks to improved consumer confidence, is expected to support organic\nproducts prices and to attract newcomers. \nThe removal of\nexceptions to the rules \u00a0is expected to contribute to the development of\norganic inputs, notably seeds. \nClearer and simpler\nproduction rules will make the sector more attractive.\nFair competition will\nbe improved notably by stronger harmonisation, \u00a0simpler and clearer rules and\nthe move from equivalence to compliance for the recognition of control bodies\nin third countries. \nConsumer confidence\nwill be addressed with harmonised production rules taking into account evolving\nsocietal concerns (animal welfare, environmental management system for\nprocessors and traders). \nA risk-based approach\nis expected to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of controls and\ncontribute, together with a more reliable import regime, to fraud prevention\nSpecify the\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nThe main result indicators in the Common Monitoring and\nEvaluation Framework are:\n- Share of organic area in total utilised agricultural\narea (UAA);\n-\u00a0 Share of organic livestock in total livestock.\nAnd the main output indicators are:\n- Organic land area (in conversion and fully converted);\n- Number of certified organic operators.\nThe following complementary indicators will also be\nmonitored within the context of this Regulation:\n- Livestock (number of organic animals and products of\nanimal origin); \n- Crop production and processing (number of operators and\nvalue/volume of production by type of economic activity); \n- Number of exceptions used and number of exceptions\nremoved,\n- Knowledge of, and confidence in, the Union organic logo\n(Eurobarometer survey). \n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term \nThe overall objective of the legislative framework, which is the\nsustainable development of organic production, is currently not fully met. It\nleads to lost opportunities for farmers and operators in the Union (the organic\nland area in the Union has only doubled in the last 10 years, while the market\nhas increased fourfold), a risk of limitation to the organic market expansion\nand a risk of limitation to the environmental benefits associated with organic production.\n\nThe main drivers are: regulatory and non-regulatory obstacles to the\ndevelopment of organic production in the Union; a risk of erosion of consumer\nconfidence, notably because of the many exceptions that are watering down\norganic production rules and because of the fraud cases that have developed in connection\nwith shortcomings in the control system and in the import regime; unfair\ncompetition among operators in the Union and in Third Countries; and issues in\nthe design and the enforcement of the legal provisions, notably issues with the\nfunctioning of the internal market, because of gaps in the legislation and\ndifferent approaches in implementation. \n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nThe current proposal is an updating of an existing quality scheme\nset within the Common Agricultural Policy. \nProduction and trade of agricultural products and foodstuffs on the\ninternal market and ensuring the functioning of the internal market are matters\nof Union competence. Both are competences shared with MS. \nA Union wide scheme is more efficient than 28 different schemes and\nallows for a stronger and more consistent trade policy vis-\u00e0-vis global trading\npartners, most notably by enhancing the Union's bargaining power. \nThe organic logo of the European Union should cover products\ncomplying with a common set of rules that are applied across the whole Union.\nAreas where further harmonisation is needed include: exceptions to\nthe rules and action to preserve the integrity of organic production, including\na common approach to address the presence of non-authorised substance residues\nin organic products.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nAn external evaluation of the Union legislation on organic farming\nwas completed in 2013[56].\nIn particular, it analysed the adequacy of the production rules and of the\nrules on controls, imports and labelling of organic products. The evaluation\nconcluded that most of the rules laid down in the organic legislative framework\nare in general adequate for achieving its global objectives. Yet, it also\nidentified a number of shortcomings and proposed recommendations for\nimprovement.

set out in this Part shall apply to organic\nplant production.\n1.                      \nGeneral requirements\n1.1.                \nHydroponic production, which is a method of\ngrowing plants with their roots in a nutrient solution only or in an inert\nmedium to which a nutrient solution is added, is prohibited.\n1.2.                \nAll plant production techniques used shall\nprevent or minimise any contribution to the contamination of the environment.\n1.3.                \nConversion\n1.3.1.          \nFor plants and plant products to be considered\norganic, the production rules laid down in this Regulation must have been\napplied on the parcels during a conversion period of at least two years before\nsowing, or, in the case of grassland or perennial forage, at least two years\nbefore its use as feed from organic production, or, in the case of perennial\ncrops other than forage, at least three years before the first harvest of\norganic products.\n1.3.2.          \nThe competent authority may decide, in the cases\nwhere the land has been contaminated with products not authorised for organic\nproduction, to extend the conversion period beyond the period referred to in\npoint 1.3.1.\n1.3.3.          \nIn the case of treatment with a product not\nauthorised for organic production, the competent authority shall require a new\nconversion period in accordance with point 1.3.1.\nThat period may\nbe shortened in the following two cases:\n(a)         \ntreatment with a product not authorised for\norganic production as part of a compulsory control measure for pests or weeds,\nincluding quarantine organisms or invasive species, imposed by the competent\nauthority of the Member State;\n(b)         \ntreatment with a product not authorised for\norganic production as part of scientific tests approved by the competent\nauthority of the Member State.\n1.3.4.          \nIn the cases referred to in points 1.3.2. and\n1.3.3., the length of the conversion period shall be fixed taking into account\nthe following factors:\n(a)         \nthe process of degradation of the product\nconcerned shall guarantee, at the end of the conversion period, an\ninsignificant level of residues in the soil and, in the case of a perennial\ncrop, in the plant;\n(b)         \nthe harvest following the treatment may not be\nsold with reference to organic production.\n1.3.5.          \nThe specific conversion rules for land associated with organic livestock production should\nbe as follows:\n1.3.5.1.    \nThe conversion rules shall apply to the whole\narea of the production unit on which animal feed is produced.\n1.3.5.2.    \nNotwithstanding point 1.3.5.1., the conversion\nperiod may be reduced to one year for pasturages and open air areas used by\nnon-herbivore
