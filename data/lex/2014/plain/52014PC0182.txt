The unwillingness of the authorities to commit to reforms also\r\nprevented them from concluding a financing agreement with the IMF. \nAs a result of large debt repayments in the\r\nfourth quarter of 2013 and beginning of 2014 and of the central bank's\r\ninterventions to defend the currency peg against the dollar, reserves have\r\ndropped dramatically to USD 15.5 billion at the end of February, leaving Ukraine with a very weak and rapidly\r\nworsening balance-of-payments situation. The current political crisis has very damaging effects on Ukraine's already precarious economic and financial stability. The de\r\nfacto interruption of Russia's assistance under its USD 15 billion package\r\nagreed last December, and the announced end to the reduced gas prices granted\r\nby Gazprom from April 2014 onwards, will deteriorate the situation even further.\r\nUnder these circumstances Ukraine faces a serious risk of default in the near\r\nfuture.\nAt the same time, during the month of\r\nFebruary and following mass protests on-going since end-November, the\r\ngovernment resigned. A new government was approved by the Verkhovna Rada on 27\r\nFebruary and there was a reversal to the 2004 Constitution. Despite these\r\nchanges, Ukraine has not been able to return to political stability since the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine has recently been violated by\r\nthe Russian Federation. \nThe new government has publicly committed\r\nitself to begin implementing significant and comprehensive reforms before the\r\n25 May presidential elections.. Although the political process at the moment is\r\nvolatile, so far it shows clear signs of a commitment to economic reforms.\u00a0 \nAgainst this background, the Ukrainian\r\nauthorities are seeking financial assistance from the multilateral and\r\nbilateral creditors and donors to support a reform programme, currently under\r\npreparation, that would reduce economic vulnerabilities, boost international\r\nreserves and foster economic growth. The IMF sent a staff mission to Ukraine in the beginning of March, and is expected to play the key role in the preparation of this\r\nprogramme and mobilisation of international financial assistance to Ukraine. In the next weeks, the IMF and the Ukrainian authorities are expected to come to\r\nan agreement on an economic programme that will be supported by a financing\r\narrangement. \nIt is expected that the external financing\r\nneeds of Ukraine will exceed the funding likely to be provided by the IMF. In\r\nthis context, the European Commission announced on 5 March 2014 a package of\r\nfinancial support to Ukraine, that was welcomed by the EU Heads of State or\r\nGovernment the day after. One of the elements of the package is a new\r\nMacro-Financial Assistance (MFA) programme in the amount of up to EUR 1\r\nbillion. \nThe European Commission submits to the\r\nCouncil a proposal to grant MFA to Ukraine amounting to a maximum of EUR 1\r\nbillion. The assistance would take the form of medium-term loans, with no grant\r\ncomponent being envisaged given that Ukraine does not meet the eligibility criteria\r\nfor the use of grants in MFA operations. \nThe proposed EU MFA is intended to help Ukraine cover part of its urgent \u00a0external financing needs in the context of the\r\nstabilisation and reform programme currently under preparation, reducing in\r\nthis way the economy\u2019s short-term balance of payments and fiscal\r\nvulnerabilities. The proposed assistance would support the urgent fiscal\r\nconsolidation and external stabilisation and encourage the implementation by\r\nthe authorities of structural reforms aimed at improving the overall\r\nmacroeconomic management, strenghtening economic governance and transparency\r\nand improving conditions for sutainable growth. \nThe proposed MFA is in line with the aims\r\nof the Eastern Partnership and the orientations of the new European Neighbourhood\r\nPolicy (ENP). It would signal to the other countries in the region that the EU\r\nis ready to support countries embarking on political reforms, in moments of\r\neconomic difficulties. In this context, the Commission considers that the\r\npolitical and economic pre-conditions for an MFA operation of the proposed\r\namount and nature are satisfied.\n\u00b7      General context\nAfter 5 quarters of consecutive decline,\r\nreal GDP grew by 3.3% y/y in 4Q2013, leading to flat growth for the year 2013.\r\nThe poor performance of the economy was due to a combination of a bad harvest,\r\ndecline in steel exports and delayed domestic reforms. According to the IMF, it is believed that growth was negative in January and February. Due\r\nto the volatile situation forecasts for 2014 range from -5% to +3% depending on\r\nassumptions. Macroeconomic adjustments, including fiscal consolidation and\r\nexchange rate flexibility, will have contractionary effects, but on the other\r\nhand, the foreseen IMF arrangement would increase confidence that could lead to\r\nFDI inflows quite quickly. Still, Russia's policy towards Ukraine signifies a substantial downside risk to growth.\u00a0\u00a0 \nInflation has been very low in the last few\r\nyears, reaching 0.3% at end-2013; however, inflationary pressure has increased\r\nin 2014. CPI was 0.5% in January and 1.2% in February and the National Bank of\r\nUkraine (NBU) expects it could reach 10% or more by end-2014, as a result of the\r\ndepreciation of the hryvnia (UAH) and the expected increase in energy tariffs\r\nfor households.\nThe fiscal deficit,\r\nincluding the operational deficit of the main Ukrainian energy sector operator\r\nNaftogaz, was estimated at 6.5%-7.5% of GDP in 2013, largely as a result of\r\ncontinued energy subsidies, which amount to 7% of GDP, but also as a result of\r\nthe economic slowdown. Capital expenditure was cut by 40% in 2013, while VAT\r\nrevenues dropped by 7%. The 2014 budget was passed by the Rada in early\r\nJanuary, but was based on unrealistic assumptions of growth and inflation and\r\nis currently being revised by the Ministry of Finance in close cooperation with\r\nthe IMF. Revenues in January-February 2014 amounted to 82% of what was planned\r\nin the budget, suggesting that expenses need to be cut by around UAH 80\r\nbillion, or 15-17% in 2014. In addition, the gas import price from Russia will be increased on 1 April to at least 400 USD per 1000 cubic meters, putting\r\nsignificant strain on the budget. However, the Minister of Finance has made\r\nassurances that gas tariffs for households and district heating companies will\r\nbe increased before the 25 May elections, alleviating this pressure. An\r\nadditional issue is arrears, both of VAT refunds to corporates and overdue\r\nsubsidy payments to utility companies, amounting to UAH 12bn and UAH 8bn\r\nrespectively.\nThere has been strong pressure on the local\r\ncurrency since the outbreak of the crisis. The NBU has allowed the hryvnia to\r\ndepreciate significantly (by about 25%) in February. Part of this was a\r\ndeliberate devaluation of the official exchange rate on 7 February from the\r\n7.99 UAH/USD that had been kept since July 2012 to 8.708 UAH/USD. Later the\r\ndepreciation of the currency sped up as a result of the NBU's inability to\r\nintervene due to very low foreign exchange reserves. In agreement with the IMF,\r\nthe NBU is now pursuing a policy of non-intervention, except in cases of\r\nsignificant exchange rate movements. It is also maintaining a number of capital\r\ncontrols, but says it will refrain from introducing new ones. The hryvnia\r\nremains volatile, despite these measures. Further significant devaluation of\r\nthe currency would risk deterioration of credit portfolios and capital of banks\r\nand would not necessarily rebalance the current account as much of exports are\r\ndependent on imported inputs. In addition, the Ukrainian economy is\r\nconsumption-driven (75% of GDP) and devaluation with accompanying inflation\r\nwould likely have a contractionary effect on GDP. \nThe current account deteriorated\r\nsignificantly in 2013 to an estimated deficit of 10% of GDP reflecting mostly\r\ndecreased exports. The NBU expects a significant narrowing of the current\r\naccount deficit in 2014 as a result of adjustments connected to the foreseen\r\nIMF arrangement, including fiscal consolidation. Yet, current account financing\r\nneeds will remain substantial in the short run \u2013 at least USD 4 billion before\r\nthe end of the second quarter of 2014. Net FDI is estimated to have dropped\r\nfurther from 5.0% of GDP in 2012 to 2.6% of GDP in 2013 and was near 0% in\r\nJanuary 2014. \nExternal debt was estimated at 76.7% of GDP\r\nat end-2013. Only about one-third of it is owed or guaranteed by the public\r\nauthorities (including debt of the National Bank to the IMF). In addition to\r\npublicly guaranteed liabilities of some Ukraine's corporate borrowers, e.g.\r\nState guaranteed Eurobonds issued by Naftogaz, other external liabilities of Ukraine's corporates may have a systemic importance for the country. In particular,\r\nNaftogaz' debt (in arrears) for gas shipments from Russia's Gazprom has direct\r\nimplications for the country's current account as Gazprom sets its price\r\ndepending on Naftogaz' debt payment record. \nOfficial reserves declined by 16% to USD\r\n20.4 billion in the course of 2013, as a result of the large current account\r\ndeficit, pressure on the hryvnia and significant debt repayments in 2013. This\r\nnegative trend continued in January and February when reserves dropped a\r\nfurther 13% per month to USD 15.5 billion at end-February (2 months of import\r\ncover). This development clearly reflects an increased balance-of-payments\r\nvulnerability.\nAt 41% of GDP (end-2013), public debt is below\r\nthe high-risk benchmark. At the same time, public debt servicing obligations,\r\nin particular on external debt or on foreign currency denominated domestic\r\ndebt, weigh heavily on public finances and international reserves in the near\r\nfuture. Total debt service of the government and the NBU for the rest of 2014\r\namount to about USD 10 billion. Debt payments peak between June and September.\r\nIn the period March-May debt service amounts to approximately USD 2 billion. In\r\naddition, the outstanding Naftogaz' debt to Gazprom amounts to another USD 2\r\nbillion. Debt payment obligations in 2015 are about USD 10 billion.\nAccording to the NBU, there is sufficient\r\nliquidity in the banking sector, but no credits are extended to corporates\r\nsince February. Deposit erosion amounted to some 2% in January and about 8% in\r\nFebruary. Possible further currency devaluation would present problems for the\r\nbanking sector and asset quality has the potential to fall quickly. The banking\r\nsector is in need of a thorough asset quality review. Beyond short-term risks,\r\nthe banking sector in Ukraine presents some structural weaknesses that are\r\nlikely to be a focus of a reform programme supported through the foreseen IMF\r\narrangement. There are clear weaknesses in bank supervision and corporate governance\r\nin the banking sector and a lack of protection of creditor rights.\nIn addition to the need to restructure and\r\nstrengthen the banking system, other key structural reform challenges include\r\nraising utility tariffs, currently a significant contributor to the fiscal\r\ndeficit, while strengthening the social safety net; combatting corruption, not\r\nleast in taxation and customs; strengthening private sector development; and\r\nimproving the business environment to boost investment including FDI.\nBased on the indications provided above, in\r\n2014 and 2015 Ukraine will be facing significant external financing needs\r\nreflecting in particular a still substantial current account deficit, large\r\nexternal debt payment obligations and the need to re-build a minimum buffer of\r\nforeign exchange reserves. Also, private capital inflows, in the form of\r\nforeign direct investments or private credits, will remain extremely low. It is\r\nexpected that preliminary projections of Ukraine's residual external financing needs will become available in the coming weeks, in\r\nview of the results of the on-going technical discussions the Ukrainian\r\nauthorities are conducting with the IMF. But already now it is anticipated that\r\na wider international support will be required to cover these needs and create\r\nconditions for a successful implementation of the reforms in Ukraine. The proposed EU MFA would contribute to cover part of the residual\r\nfinancing gap for the 2014-2015 period.\n\u00b7      Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\nCouncil\r\nDecision of 12 July 2002 providing supplementary macro-financial assistance to Ukraine (2002/639/EC)[1]\nDecision\r\nno 646/2010/EU of the European Parliamnt and of the Council of \u00a0July 2010\r\nproviding macro-financial assistance to Ukraine[2]\n\u00b7      Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union\nThe EU is seeking an increasingly close\r\nrelationship with Ukraine that goes beyond mere bilateral cooperation,\r\nencompassing gradual political association and economic integration. Ukraine is an important country both within the European Neighbourhood Policy and the\r\nEastern Partnership. The EU signed a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement\r\n(PCA) with Ukraine in 1998 that outlines the framework of our cooperation in\r\nall key areas of reform and continues to be the legal basis of our relations.\r\nRelations were further enforced in November 2009 when the Cabinet of Ministers\r\nof Ukraine adopted the EU-Ukraine Association Agenda, which was updated in 2011\r\n(endorsed by the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council in June 2013), and aims to\r\nprepare for and facilitate the entry into force of the new Association\r\nAgreement, which was negotiated in 2007-2011, initialled in 2012 and is\r\nexpected to be signed in the near future.\nEconomic ties with the EU are important. The\r\nEU is among Ukraine's most important commercial partner and accounts for about\r\none third of its external trade. In 2012, the value of Ukrainian imports from\r\nthe EU was EUR 23.8 billion while the value of its exports was EUR 14.6\r\nbillion. Ukraine also has a high dependence on the EU in terms of FDI and other\r\nfinancial flows. Within the framework of the Association Agreement, the EU\r\nfinalised negotiations with Ukraine on establishing a Deep and Comprehensive\r\nFree Trade Area (DCFTA) in 2011 with the goal to allowing the full access of Ukraine to the EU\u2019s single market. On 11 March 2014, the Commission adopted a proposal for an EU Council/Parliament Regulation temporarily removing customs\r\nduties on Ukrainian exports to the EU (COM 2014/166). The proposed measures,\r\nexpected to be adopted by the co-legislators in the coming months, will be\r\napplied immediately and will be discontinued in November 2014, when the\r\nprovisional application of the DCFTA will start.\nThe EU MFA would complement the total EUR\r\n1.565 billion in grants mobilised under the European Neighbourhood Instrument,\r\nthe Neighbourhood Investment Facility, the Instrument contributing to Stability\r\nand Peace and the EU budget line for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. By\r\nsupporting the adoption by the Ukrainian authorities of an appropriate framework\r\nfor short-term macroeconomic policy and structural reforms, the EU\u2019s MFA would\r\nenhance the added value of the overall EU involvement increasing the\r\neffectiveness of the EU\u2019s overall intervention including through other\r\nfinancial instruments.\nUkraine's immediate\r\ntransition will be very difficult and the risk of political and economic\r\ncollapse remains. At the same time, the new government has publicly committed\r\nto taking significant steps towards political and economic reforms, with the\r\naim of tackling corruption and strengthening institutions and mechanisms,\r\nincluding the rule of law. The country is also envisaging an economic reform\r\nprogramme aimed at laying the ground for a sustainable growth model. \nThe proposed MFA is consistent with the\r\nEU's commitment to support Ukraine's immediate economic and political\r\ntransition. Also, it is consistent with the principles: governing the use of\r\nthe instrument of MFA, including its exceptional character, political\r\npreconditions, complementarity, conditionality and financial discipline. The\r\ncurrent operation is taking place under very particular circumstances of\r\nextreme urgency.\nThe Commission will continue to monitor and\r\nassess during the life of the MFA operation satisfaction of these criteria,\r\nincluding the assessment, in close liaison with the European External Action\r\nService, of the political preconditions.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u00b7      Consultation of interested parties\nMFA is provided as an integral part of the\r\ninternational support to the economic stabilisation of Ukraine. In the preparation of this proposal for MFA, the Commission services have consulted with\r\nthe International Monetary Fund, which is in the process of putting in place a\r\nsizeable financing programme, and other multilateral and bilateral creditors\r\nand donors. The Commission has also been in regular contact with the Ukrainian\r\nauthorities.\n\u00b7      Collection and use of expertise\nDue to the need for an urgent approval\r\nprocess, an Operational Assessment verifying the quality and reliability of Ukraine's public financial circuits and administrative procedures will only be carried out\r\nby the Commission, with the assistance of external experts, during the months\r\nof April and May 2014.\n\u00b7      Impact assessment\nThe MFA and the economic adjustment\r\nattached to it will help alleviate the risk of imminent default and economic\r\ncollapse by addressing Ukraine's short-term external financing needs while\r\nsupporting policy measures aimed at strengthening the balance-of-payments and\r\nfiscal positions and raising sustainable growth. It is planned that the\r\nconditionality attached to the programme will notably help improve the\r\nefficiency and transparency of public finance management; promote fiscal\r\nreforms to reduce utility subsidies and other expenditure; support existing\r\nefforts to strengthen the social safety net; strengthen the financial sector\r\ngovernance and supervision; strengthen anti-corruption measures that will\r\nincrease revenue; and facilitate the adoption of measures to improve the\r\nregulatory framework for trade and investment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7     \r\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe European Union shall make available to Ukraine\r\nMFA for a total maximum amount of EUR 1 billion, provided in the form of a medium-term\r\nloan. The assistance will contribute to cover Ukraine's residual external\r\nfinancing needs in 2014. \nThe assistance will be provided in one or\r\ntwo instalments and will be conditional on an IMF arrangement being in place\r\nand on the implementation by Ukraine of specific structural reform measures\r\nthat will be agreed by the Commission on behalf of the EU and Ukraine in a Memorandum of Understanding. The preparation of the Memorandum of Understanding will be\r\nmade in coordination with the IMF and the World Bank. In view of the critical\r\nneed for Ukraine to implement strong macroeconomic policies and ambitious\r\nreforms, it is not deemed appropriate to disburse the new programme without\r\nspecific conditionality. In this context, the preferred option is to disburse\r\nthe assistance in two tranches, with the first tranche being conditional to the\r\nIMF arrangement being in place, and the second tranche being also conditional\r\nto the implementation of the agreed conditions. There will be a delay of at\r\nleast three months between the two tranches. The disbursement of the first\r\ninstalment (possibly EUR 500 million) is expected to take place in June 2014,\r\nand the disbursement of the second instalment \u2013 in autumn of the current year.\r\nIn case, however, it is decided by the Commission that in view of the extreme\r\nurgency of the financing needs the disbursement of the assistance should be\r\nmade in one tranche, the Commission would still condition it to the completion\r\nof some critical prior actions. \nIn the preparation of the list of conditions\r\nor prior actions for the release of the assistance, the Commission will target\r\nstructural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and\r\nthe conditions for sustainable growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and\r\nefficiency of public finance management; fiscal reforms; governance and\r\nsupervision of the financial sector; reforms to strengthen the social safety\r\nnet; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for trade and investment).\r\n\nThe assistance will be managed by the Commission.\r\nSpecific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities,\r\nconsistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable. \nThe decision to disburse the full MFA in the form of loans is\r\njustified by Ukraine's level of development (as measured by its per-capita\r\nincome) and debt indicators. It is also consistent with the treatment given to Ukraine by the World Bank and the IMF. Indeed, Ukraine is not eligible for concessional financing from\r\neither the IDA or the IMF.\n\u00b7      Legal basis\nThe legal basis for this proposal is\r\nArticle 213 of the TFEU. Given that the beginning of the disbursement of the\r\nproposed assistance in the first half of 2014 would not be possible and would\r\nthus not address the urgent financial needs of Ukraine, if the decision was adopted\r\nby the Parliament and the Council in accordance with Article 212 TFEU under the\r\nordinary legislative procedure, it is justified to use Article 213 TFEU providing for the adoption of the decision by\r\nthe Council. \u00a0\n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal does not fall under an\r\nexclusive competence of the EU. The subsidiarity principle applies to the\r\nextent that the objectives of restoring short-term macroeconomic stability in Ukraine cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone and can therefore be\r\nbetter achieved by the European Union. The main reasons are the budgetary\r\nconstraints faced at the national level and the need for strong donor\r\ncoordination in order to maximise the scale and effectivenes of the assistance.\r\n\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle: it confines itself to the minimum required in order\r\nto achieve the objectives of short-term macroeconomic stability by alleviating\r\nthe risk of a possible default and does not go beyond what is necessary for\r\nthat purpose. \nIn view of the size of Ukraine's external financing needs in 2014 and 2015, the amount of the assistance will correspond to\r\na relatively limited part of these needs. Given the assistance pledged to Ukraine by other bilateral and multilateral donors and creditors, it is deemed an\r\nappropriate level of burden-sharing for the EU.\n\u00b7      Complementarity\nThe proposed MFA would complement the\r\nassistance being envisaged by other multilateral and bilateral donors in the\r\ncontext of the IMF-sponsored economic programme. The EU MFA would also\r\ncomplement the EU grants and loans mobilised under the regular EU cooperation\r\ninstruments (notably the European Neighbourhood Instrument) and extended by the\r\nEuropean\u00a0 Investment Bank\n\u00b7      Choice of instruments\nProject finance or technical assistance\r\nwould not be suitable or sufficient to address these macroeconomic objectives.\r\nThe key value added of the MFA in comparison to other EU instruments would be its\r\nrapid implementation to alleviate Ukraine's immediate external financial\r\nconstraints, but also to help create a stable macroeconomic framework,\r\nincluding by promoting a sustainable balance of payments and budgetary\r\nsituation, and an appropriate framework for structural reforms. By helping to\r\nput in place an appropriate overall framework for macroeconomic and structural\r\npolicies, MFA can increase the effectiveness of the actions financed in Ukraine under other, more narrowly focused EU financial instruments. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe\r\nplanned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and should be\r\nfinanced through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on\r\nbehalf of the EU. The budgetary impact of the assistance will correspond to the\r\nprovisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the Guarantee Fund\r\nfor External Actions of the EU, from budget line 01 03 06 (\"Provisioning\r\nof the Guarantee Fund\"). Assuming that the loan will be disbursed in 2014,\r\nand according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the\r\nprovisioning will take place in the 2016 budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \n\u00b7      Review/revision/sunset clause\nThe proposal includes a sunset clause. The\r\nproposed MFA would be made available for one year, starting from the first day\r\nafter the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding, with a\r\npossibility to extend it if necessary.\n2014/0104 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nproviding Macro-Financial Assistance to Ukraine\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 213 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission[3],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Relations between the European Union ('the Union') and Ukraine are developing within the framework\r\nof the European Neighbourhood\r\nPolicy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership. The Partnership and Cooperation\r\nAgreement between the Union and Ukraine entered\r\ninto force\r\non 1 March 1998. Bilateral\r\npolitical dialogue and economic cooperation have been further developed\r\nwithin the framework of\r\nthe EU-Ukraine Association Agenda adopted on 23 November 2009. A new Association Agreement, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free\r\nTrade Area (DCFTA), was negotiated in 2007-2011 and initialed in 2012. On 21\r\nNovember 2013, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine took a decision to suspend\r\npreparations to sign the Association Agreement. Following the resignation of the government in February 2014,\r\nthe new Ukrainian government has declared its willingness to sign the\r\nAssociation Agreement in the near future. On 6 March 2014, the European Council\r\ndeclared in its Statement on Ukraine its commitment to sign very shortly all\r\nthe political chapters of the Association Agreement and to unilaterally adopt\r\nmeasures allowing Ukraine to benefit substantially from the DCFTA. The proposal\r\nfor a Regulation of the European Parliament and Council to this effect was\r\nadopted by the Commission on 11 March 2014.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current political\r\ncrisis has very damaging effects on Ukraine's already precarious economic and\r\nfinancial stability. Ukraine is\r\ncurrently facing a very weak and rapidly worsening balance-of-payments and fiscal situation, with the economy moving\r\ninto recession again. The de facto interruption of Russia's assistance under\r\nits USD 15 billion package, and the announced end to the reduced gas prices granted\r\nby Gazprom from April 2014 onwards, will deteriorate the situation even further.\r\nUnder these circumstances Ukraine faces a serious risk of default in the near\r\nfuture.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the resignation\r\nof the government, a new interim President and a new government were appointed\r\nby the Parliament on 22 and 27 February 2014 respectively. Even though the\r\nconstitution of 2004 was reinstated and presidential elections were announced\r\nfor 25 May 2014, Ukraine could not return to political stability, since the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine has recently been violated by\r\nthe Russian Federation.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthis context, Ukraine requires urgent financial assistance by international\r\ncreditors and donors. Given that the first rapid disbursement\r\nof the Union's macro-financial assistance to Ukraine (\"the Union's macro-financial assistance\")\r\nin the first half of 2014 would not be possible and would thus not address the\r\nurgent financial needs of Ukraine, if the decision was adopted by the Parliament\r\nand the Council in accordance with Article 212 TFEU under the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure, it is justified to provide the Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance based on a Council decision\r\npursuant to Article 213 TFEU. \u00a0\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The urgency of the assistance\r\nis related to the immediate need of Ukraine for funds, in addition to those\r\nwhich will be provided by other international financial institutions and other\r\nbilateral donors and to the Union's macro-financial assistance foreseen by\r\nCouncil Decision of 12 July 2002 providing supplementary macro-financial\r\nassistance to Ukraine (2002/639/EC)[4]\r\nand Decision no 646/2010/EU of the European Parliamnt and of the Council of\u00a0\r\nJuly 2010 providing macro-financial assistance to Ukraine[5]. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current crisis in Ukraine justifies the exceptional use of the urgent procedure under Article 213 TFEU. The\r\ndecision providing macro-financial assistance to Ukraine is without prejudice\r\nto other future MFA operations.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the resignation of\r\nthe government, the Union has,\r\non various occasions,\r\ndeclared its commitment to support the new Ukrainian\r\nGovernment to stabilize the situation and pursue the course of reforms. The\r\nUnion has also declared its readiness to fully support efforts of the\r\ninternational community and international financial institutions, especially\r\nthe IMF, with regard to an international assistance package to address the\r\nurgent needs of Ukraine, based on clear commitment to reforms. Financial\r\nsupport from the Union to Ukraine is consistent with the Union's policy as set\r\nout in the ENP and in the Eastern Partnership.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's\r\nmacro-financial assistance should be an exceptional financial instrument of\r\nuntied and undesignated balance-of-payments support, which aims at addressing\r\nthe beneficiary's immediate external financing needs and should underpin the\r\nimplementation of a policy programme containing strong immediate adjustment and\r\nstructural reform measures designed to improve the balance-of-payments position\r\nin the short-term. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Ukrainian authorities and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are expected to agree shortly on an\r\neconomic programme that will be supported by a financing arrangement with the\r\nIMF.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 5 March 2014, in view\r\nof the drastically worsening balance-of-payments situation in Ukraine, the European Commission announced a support package, which included the proposed\r\nMFA. This package was endorsed by the Extraordinary European Council on 6\r\nMarch. This package includes financial assistance of EUR 11 billion in 2014-2020\r\nincluding a total of up to EUR 1.565 billion in grants for the same period\r\nmobilised under the European Neighbourhood Instrument, the Neighbourhood\r\nInvestment Facility, the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace and the\r\nbudget of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The disbursement of the\r\nUnion's macro-financial assistance foreseen by Council Decision of 12 July 2002\r\nproviding supplementary macro-financial assistance to Ukraine (2002/639/EC)[6] and Decision no 646/2010/EU\r\nof the European Parliamnt and of the Council of \u00a0July 2010 providing\r\nmacro-financial assistance to Ukraine[7]\r\ncan take place as soon as the IMF programme is in place.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that Ukraine is a country covered by the ENP, it is eligible to receive the Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that the\r\ndrastically worsening external financing\r\nneeds of Ukraine are expected to be well above the resources that\r\nwill be provided by the IMF and other multilateral\r\ninstitutions, the Union's\r\nurgent macro-financial assistance to\r\nbe provided to Ukraine is, under the current\r\nexceptional circumstances,\r\nconsidered to be an\r\nappropriate response to\r\n  Ukraine's request to support financial\r\nstabilisation.\r\nThe Union's macro-financial assistance would support the economic stabilisation\r\nand the structural reform agenda of Ukraine, supplementing resources made\r\navailable under the IMF's financial arrangement.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should aim to support the restoration of a sustainable external\r\nfinancing situation for Ukraine thereby supporting its economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of the Union's\r\nmacro-financial assistance is based on a preliminary estimate of Ukraine's residual external financing needs and takes into account its capacity to finance\r\nitself with its own resources, in particular the international reserves at its\r\ndisposal. The Union's macro-financial assistance should complement the\r\nprogrammes and resources provided by the IMF and the World Bank. The\r\ndetermination of the amount of the assistance also takes into account the need\r\nto ensure fair burden sharing between the Union and other donors, as well as\r\nthe pre-existing deployment of the Union's other external financing instruments\r\nin Ukraine and the added value of the overall Union involvement. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\r\nensure that the Union's macro-financial assistance is legally and substantially\r\nin line with the key principles, objectives and measures taken within the\r\ndifferent areas of external action and other relevant Union policies.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should support the Union's external policy towards Ukraine. The Commission services and the European External Action Service should work closely\r\ntogether throughout the macro-financial assistance operation in order to\r\ncoordinate, and to ensure the consistency of, Union external policy. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should support Ukraine's commitment to values shared with the Union, including democracy, the rule of law, good governance, respect for human rights,\r\nsustainable development and poverty reduction, as well as its commitment to the\r\nprinciples of open, rule-based and fair trade.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A pre-condition for\r\ngranting the Union's macro-financial assistance should be that Ukraine respects effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary\r\nsystem and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. In\r\naddition, the specific objectives of the Union's macro-financial assistance\r\nshould strengthen the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the public\r\nfinance management systems in Ukraine and to promote structural reforms aimed\r\nat supporting sustainable growth and fiscal consolidation. Both fulfilment of\r\nthe preconditions and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly\r\nmonitored by the Commission.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\r\nUnion\u2019s financial interests linked to the Union\u2019s macro-financial assistance\r\nare protected efficiently, Ukraine should take appropriate measures relating to\r\nthe prevention of, and fight against, fraud, corruption and any other\r\nirregularities linked to the assistance. In addition, provision should be made\r\nfor the Commission to carry out checks and for the Court of Auditors to carry\r\nout audits.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Release of the Union's macro-financial assistance is without prejudice to the powers of budgetary\r\nauthority. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amounts of the\r\nprovision required for macro-financial assistance should be consistent with the\r\nbudgetary appropriations provided for in the multi-annual financial framework.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should be managed by the Commission. In order to ensure that the\r\nEuropean Parliament and the Council are able to follow the implementation of\r\nthis Decision, the Commission should regularly inform them of developments\r\nrelating to the assistance and provide them with relevant documents.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should\r\nbe conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance\r\nwith Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[8].\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union shall make macro-financial assistance available\r\nto Ukraine (\"the Union's macro-financial assistance\") of a maximum\r\namount of EUR 1 billion, with a view to supporting Ukraine's economic\r\nstabilisation and reforms. The assistance shall contribute to covering Ukraine's urgent balance-of-payments needs as identified in the government's economic\r\nprogramme supported by the IMF. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The full amount of the Union's macro-financial assistance\r\nshall be provided to Ukraine in the form of loans.

The Commission shall regularly inform\r\nthe European Parliament and the Council of developments regarding the Union's macro-financial assistance, including disbursements thereof, and shall provide\r\nthose institutions with the relevant documents in due time.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial assistance shall be\r\nmade available for a period of one year from the first day after the entry into\r\nforce of the Memorandum of Understanding referred to in Article 3(1).

Commission's\r\nmultiannual strategic objective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative \n\"To promote prosperity beyond the EU\"\nThe major area of DG ECFIN related activity\r\npertains to: \n1. Fostering the implementation of the European\r\nNeighbourhood Policy by deepening economic analysis and strengthening policy\r\ndialogue and advice on the economic aspects of the Action Plans.\n2. Developing, monitoring and implementing\r\nmacro-financial assistance for partner third countries, in co-operation with\r\nthe relevant international financial institutions. \n1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific objective(s) and\r\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \nSpecific objective No. 1: \"Providing macro-financial assistance to third countries in\r\nresolving their balance of payment crises and restoring external debt\r\nsustainability\"\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned: International Economic and Financial Relations, global governance.\n1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected result(s) and\r\nimpact\nThe proposed assistance consists of an EU loan\r\nof up to EUR 1 billion to Ukraine ('Ukraine'), with a view to contributing to a\r\nmore sustainable balance-of-payments situation. The assistance will help the\r\ncountry overcome the economic and social hardships endured as a result of the\r\ndomestic and regional unrest. It will also promote structural reforms aimed at\r\nraising sustainable economic growth and improving public finance management. \n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\r\nimpact \nThe authorities will be required to report on a\r\nset of indicators to the Commission services on a regular basis and provide a\r\ncomprehensive report on the compliance with the agreed policy conditions ahead\r\nof the disbursement of the assistance. \nThe Commission services will continue to\r\nmonitor public finance management, following the operational assessment of the\r\nfinancial circuits and administrative procedures in Ukraine that will be\r\ncarried out in preparation of this operation. The EU Delegation in Ukraine will also provide regular reporting on issues relevant for the monitoring of the\r\nassistance. The Commission services will remain in close contact with the IMF\r\nand the World Bank to benefit from their insights from their on-going\r\nactivities in Ukraine. \nAn annual report to the Council and European\r\nParliament is foreseen in the proposed legislative decision, comprising an\r\nassessment of the implementation of this operation. An independent ex-post\r\nevaluation of the assistance will be carried out within two years after the\r\nexpiry of the implementation period.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the proposal/initiative\r\n\n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nThe disbursement of the assistance will be\r\nconditional upon a satisfactory track record in the implementation of the\r\nfuture financing arrangement between Ukraine and the IMF. In addition, the\r\nCommission shall agree with the Ukrainian authorities on specific policy\r\nconditions, listed in a Memorandum of Understanding.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU involvement\nBy helping the country overcome the economic\r\nshock caused by the domestic and regional unrest, the proposed MFA will\r\ncontribute to promoting macroeconomic stability and economic reforms in the\r\ncountry. By complementing the resources made available by the international\r\nfinancial institutions, the EU and other donors, it will contribute to the\r\noverall effectiveness of the package of financial support agreed by the\r\ninternational donor community in the aftermath of the crisis. \nThe proposed programme will also strengthen the\r\ngovernment's reform commitment and its aspiration towards closer relations with\r\nthe EU. This result will be achieved, inter alia, through appropriate\r\nconditionality for the disbursement of the assistance. In a larger context, the\r\nprogramme will signal to the other countries in the region that the EU is ready\r\nto support countries embarking on a clear path towards political reforms in\r\ntimes of economic difficulties.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nSince 2004, a total of fifteen ex-post\r\nevaluations have been carried out on macro-financial assistance operations.\r\nThese evaluations conclude that MFA operations do contribute, albeit sometimes\r\nmodestly and indirectly, to the improvement of the external sustainability, the\r\nmacroeconomic stability and the achievement of structural reforms in the recipient\r\ncountry. In most cases, MFA operations had a positive effect on the balance of\r\npayments of the beneficiary country and helped to relax their budgetary\r\nconstraints. They also led to a somewhat higher economic growth.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\r\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nThe EU is among the major donors of Ukraine. The EU intends to make available up to EUR 1.565 billion\r\nin grants for the period 2014-2020 under its regular cooperation, in support of\r\nUkraine's political and\r\neconomic reforms.\nThe key value added of the MFA in comparison to\r\nother EU instruments would be its rapid implementation to alleviate Ukraine's immediate external financial constraints, but also help create a stable\r\nmacroeconomic framework, including by promoting a sustainable\r\nbalance-of-payments and budgetary situation, and an appropriate framework for\r\nstructural reforms. MFA does not provide a regular financial support nor is\r\nmeant to support the economic and social development of the recipient\r\ncountries. The MFA is to be discontinued as soon as the country's external\r\nfinancial situation has been brought back onto a sustainable path. \nMFA would also be complementary to\r\ninterventions envisaged by the international financial institutions, in\r\nparticular the adjustment and reform programme supported by the IMF and the\r\nDevelopment Policy Loans of the World Bank.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \nX Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \n\u2013     \r\nX\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect for 1 year from\r\nthe entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding, as stated in Article\r\n(1.4) of the Decision \n\u2013     \r\nX\u00a0 Financial impact from 2014 to 2016 \n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) envisaged[17] \nX Centralised direct management\r\nby the Commission \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nThis assistance is of macroeconomic nature and\r\nits design is consistent with the IMF-supported economic programme. The\r\nmonitoring of the action by the Commission services will take place on the\r\nbasis of progress in the implementation of the IMF arrangement and specific\r\nreform measures to be agreed with the Ukrainian authorities in a Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding (see also point 1.4.4).\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\r\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThere are fiduciary, policy and political risks\r\nrelated to the proposed MFA operation. \nThere is a risk that the macro-financial\r\nassistance, which is not dedicated to specific expenses, could be used in a\r\nfraudulent way. In general terms, this risk is related to factors such as the\r\nquality of management systems in the central bank and the Ministry of Finance\r\nand the appropriateness of internal and external audit capabilities. \nAnother key risk to the operation stems from\r\nthe economic and political uncertainty, notably due to the unprovoked Russian\r\nviolation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. On the domestic\r\nfront, the main risk is instability related to difficulties in the political\r\nand economic reform process. The full implementation of the stabilisation and\r\nreform measures supported by the international community, including the\r\nproposed MFA operation, might be undermined by social dissatisfaction\r\npotentially leading to unrest.\nFinally, there are risks stemming from a\r\npossible weakening of the European and global economic environment.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control method(s) envisaged\r\n\nThe macro-financial assistance will be liable\r\nto verification, control and auditing procedures under the responsibility of\r\nthe Commission, including the European Antifraud Office (OLAF), and by the\r\nEuropean Court of Auditors.\n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Costs and benefits of\r\ncontrols and probable non-compliance rate\nThe basic costs for the Commission related to\r\nthe methods of verification and control as well as the cost of the Operational\r\nAssessment of financial and administrative circuits conducted prior to the\r\noperation, are described in Table 3.2.1. In addition, there are costs for the\r\nEuropean Court of Auditors and of possible interventions of the OLAF. The\r\nOperational Assessment not only helps assess risks of misuse of the funds but,\r\nas a collateral benefit, it provides useful information on the necessary\r\nreforms in the area of public finance management. Regarding the probable\r\nnon-compliance rate, the risk of non-compliance (in the form of non-repayment\r\nof the loan or misuse of the funds) is judged to be low, based on the\r\nexperience with the MFA instrument since its creation.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\r\nand irregularities \nTo mitigate the risks of fraudulent use several\r\nmeasures will be taken: \nFirst, the proposed legal basis for\r\nmacro-financial assistance to Ukraine includes a provision on fraud prevention\r\nmeasures. These measures will be elaborated further in the Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding and the Loan Agreement, envisaging a set of provisions on\r\ninspection, fraud prevention, audits, and recovery of funds in case of fraud or\r\ncorruption. It is further envisaged that a number of specific policy conditions\r\nwill be attached to the assistance, mainly in the area of public finance\r\nmanagement, with a view to strengthening efficiency, transparency and\r\naccountability. \nSecond, the Commission services, with the\r\nsupport of duly mandated external experts, will carry out an Operational\r\nAssessment of the financial circuits and administrative procedures at the\r\nMinistry of Finance and the National Bank of Ukraine, in order to fulfil the\r\nrequirements of the Financial Regulation applicable to the General Budget of\r\nthe European Communities. This review will\r\ndetermine whether the framework for sound financial management of\r\nmacro-financial assistance is sufficiently effective in Ukraine by\r\ncovering areas such as management structure and organisation, management and\r\ncontrol of funds, security of IT systems, internal and external audit capacity\r\nas well as the independence of the central bank. In the light of this\r\nassessment, specific mechanisms applying to the management of the funds by the\r\nbeneficiaries may be introduced in agreement with the national authorities.\r\nAlso, the assistance will be paid to a dedicated account at the National Bank\r\nof Ukraine.\nFinally, the assistance will be liable to\r\nverification, control and auditing procedures under the responsibility of the\r\nCommission, including OLAF, and the European Court of Auditors.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL\r\nIMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      Existing expenditure budget lines \n01 03 02: Macro-financial assistance\n01 03 06 \u2013 Provisioning of the Guarantee Fund\nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Description\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.] || Diff./non-diff.

In line with this Regulation, loans are based on the outstanding\r\namount at the end of a year. The provisioning amount is calculated at the\r\nbeginning of the year \"n\" as the difference between the target amount\r\nand the Fund's net assets at the end of the year \"n-1\".
