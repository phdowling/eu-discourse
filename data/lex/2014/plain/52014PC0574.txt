New Zealand indicated its intention to complete its accession with reference to the amended\r\ntext of the GPA (the text was adopted by the Parties on 30 March 2012 and\r\nconcluded by the EU via a Council decision of 3.12.2013[1]). The GPA, as amended, has\r\nentered into force for the Union, on 6 April 2014.\nThe Commission, on behalf of the Union,\r\nnegotiated a series of market opening commitments as presented by New Zealand both in a bilateral format and within the WTO Committee\r\non Government Procurement (\"GPA Committee\"). \nNew Zealand subsequently\r\nsubmitted a final offer on 21 July 2014. A summary of New Zealand's final offer and the Commission's assessment thereof are set out below. \n\u00a02. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of the terms of New Zealand's accession to the GPA\nNew Zealand's\r\nfinal offer\nMarket access commitments (covered\r\nentities, goods, services and construction services)\nEntities\nNew Zealand\u2019s\r\ngovernment entities; at the level of central government there is a continuum of\r\nentities exercising different degrees of public authority. These are the\r\nstandard departments, overseen by Ministers, as well as various forms of \u201cCrown\r\nentities\u201d, a category which indicates different types of entities operating as\r\ninstruments of the Crown for the Government and carrying out various public\r\nfunctions, for example in the fields of health, education, tourism, social\r\nhousing. At the other end of the spectrum are State Owned Undertakings (\u201cSOEs\u201d),\r\nthat are limited liability companies or corporations which operate as\r\ncommercial businesses.\nIn Annex 1 (\u201cCentral entities\u201d) New Zealand\u2019s offer includes the core government ministries and departments. In a note New Zealand agreed to specify that the entities subordinated to the ones laid down in Annex\r\n1 are also covered.\nIn Annex 2 (\u201csubcentral entities\u201d) New Zealand includes most District Health Boards, which are Crown entities responsible for\r\nproviding or funding the provision of health services in their territorial districts\r\nand the entities that procure for them. In addition, New Zealand agreed to\r\noffer coverage of the biggest city councils, Auckland Council, Wellington City\r\nCouncil and Christchurch City Council as well as those regional councils that exceed\r\n250 000 inhabitants. Coverage is provided for \u201cflown down grants\u201d (this refers\r\nto the fact that central agencies when awarding grants might require the\r\nawardees to follow \u201cflow down\u201d procurement requirements). Coverage of city\r\ncouncils and regional councils is foreseen in relation to the procurement of\r\ngoods, services and construction services relating to transport projects funded\r\nin whole or in part by the New Zealand Transport Agency where the total value\r\nof the project exceeds the relevant applicable thresholds for good, services\r\nand construction services.\u00a0 \nIn Annex 3 (\u201cother entities\u201d), New Zealand includes 14 Crown entities that operate in various fields including tourism,\r\naviation, education and transport. In addition, New Zealand agreed to also offer\r\nfour SOEs operating in the utilities sectors of airways, meteorological\r\nservices, railways, and electricity (Airways Corporation of New Zealand\r\nLimited, Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited, KiwiRail Holdings\r\nLimited and Transpower New Zealand Limited). These are the SOEs that have been\r\nidentified as operating in a monopolistic situation.\nGoods \nNew Zealand commits\r\nto cover procurement of all goods by the covered entities. \nServices\nNew Zealand offers\r\na very comprehensive coverage of services, meaning all services by covered\r\nentities, with some very specific exclusions (for research and development,\r\npublic health services, education services and welfare services). \nConstruction services\nNew Zealand offers\r\nall the construction services in Division 51 of the Central Product\r\nClassification, as it is commonly offered by all GPA Parties. \nThresholds\nNew Zealand applies\r\nthresholds that are commonly applied by GPA Parties for goods, services and\r\nconstruction services. \nNew Zealand's Legislation \nNew Zealand's\r\nGovernment Procurement Framework is non-discriminatory.\u00a0 There are no\r\nprovisions granting domestic supplies and suppliers more favourable treatment than\r\nthat accorded to foreign suppliers or supplies. New Zealand\u2019s legislation on\r\npublic procurement appears to be open, transparent and non-discriminatory in\r\nline with GPA requirements. \nCommission's Assessment of New Zealand's Offer\nNew Zealand widely opens\r\nits procurement market to all GPA Parties as it has a very comprehensive offer\r\nin terms of entities, goods and services, and construction services and\r\nnon-discriminatory legislation. In addition, New Zealand does not maintain any\r\nparticular restriction against any GPA Party. However, considering that New Zealand's coverage, although significant, is not complete, it would be appropriate to introduce\r\ncertain specific restrictions or carve-outs from the access to the Union\r\nprocurement market (with respect to New Zealand) as the EU has done in the past\r\nfor GPA Parties which offer only partial coverage. \nThe specific restrictions, which would be\r\npart of the terms of accession to the GPA for New Zealand to be adopted by the\r\nGPA Committee, are the following:\n\u00b7                        \r\nAnnex 1, section 2 (The Central Government\r\ncontracting authorities of the EU Member States), point 3: \nNew Zealand will be added to the list of GPA Parties which have access to\r\nprocurement of fewer central government level contracting authorities than the\r\nrest of the GPA membership.\n\u00b7                        \r\nAnnex 2, Notes to Annex 2, note 1: \nThe EU will not\r\noffer to New Zealand the procurement by local contracting authorities\r\n(administrative units under NUTS 3 in Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003)[2] --as amended-- and\r\nsmaller administrative units). Administrative units under NUTS 1 and NUTS 2 in Regulation\r\n1059/2003, procurement by the contracting authorities of administrative units\r\nunder NUTS 1 and 2 will not be offered to New Zealand, unless their procurement\r\nfor urban transport projects is covered under Annex 3 of the EU GPA Schedule. Only\r\nthe procurement of administrative units listed under NUTS 1 and NUTS 2 operating\r\nin the field of\u00a0 urban transport will be offered to New Zealand, in Annex 3 (in\r\nparticular the activity \u201cthe provision or operation of networks providing a\r\nservice to the public in the field of transport by urban railway, automated\r\nsystems, tramway, trolley bus, bus or cable\u201d referred to under point e) of\r\nAnnex 3 of the EU GPA Schedule).\n\u00b7                        \r\nAnnex 3, Notes to Annex 3, note 6: \nA more limited\r\ncoverage will be offered \u00a0to New Zealand for subcentral entities; only the\r\nprocurement of administrative units listed under NUTS 1 and NUTS 2 in relation\r\nto urban transport (in particular the activity referred to under point e) of Annex\r\n3 of the EU GPA schedule) will be offered to New Zealand. In addition, the EU will\r\nnot offer to New Zealand procurement by entities operating in the sectors of:\r\ndrinking water; in the field of maritime or inland port or other terminal\r\nfacilities; and \u00a0in the field of provisions of airports or other terminal facilities\r\nto air carriers. \nIn case any other GPA Party would include\r\nspecific carve outs to their coverage with respect to New Zealand, this would also be reflected in the GPA Committee on New Zealand's terms of accession.\r\nIt should be noted, however, that any such restrictions or carve-outs from\r\ncoverage by a GPA Party which are specific to New Zealand would not affect New Zealand's final offer as outlined above, nor the proposed EU's specific reservations,\r\nor the mutually agreed coverage between current GPA Parties. \n3. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL \nThe revised GPA includes a provision on accession. Article XXII(2)\r\nof the GPA provides that any Member of the WTO may accede to the GPA on terms\r\nto be agreed between that Member and the Parties, with such terms stated in a\r\ndecision of the GPA Committee. \u00a0\nThe terms of New Zealand\u2019s accession will\r\nbe set out in a decision of the GPA Committee which is expected to be adopted\r\nin the second half of 2014. This decision will include New Zealand's final\r\noffer for access to its public procurement market (which will become part of\r\nAppendix I to the GPA upon New Zealand's accession), as well as any specific\r\nterms of accession requested by other GPA Parties. The Decision will be adopted\r\nby consensus within the GPA Committee.\nArticle 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union (TFEU) provides that, when a decision having legal effect\r\nneeds to be taken in a body set up by an international agreement, the Council,\r\non a proposal from the Commission, should adopt a Decision establishing the\r\nposition to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf. The decision of the GPA Committee\r\nthat will set out the terms of New Zealand\u2019s accession falls under Article\r\n218(9) TFEU as the decision is taken in a body set up by an international\r\nagreement and it will have legal effects.\n4. RECOMMENDATION\nNew Zealand's\r\naccession to the GPA is expected to make a very positive contribution to\r\nfurther international opening of public procurement markets, by enlarging the\r\nnumber of parties to the GPA and thus encouraging other countries to accede to the\r\nGPA. The Commission recommends that the offer by New Zealand is accepted subject\r\nto the above mentioned restrictions to the Union's coverage with respect to New Zealand.\nAccordingly, it is proposed that the Commission be authorised to\r\nexpress within the Committee on Government Procurement the position of the Union\r\nin favour of New Zealand\u2019s accession subject to the abovementioned restrictions,\r\nto be reflected in the GPA Committee Decision on New Zealand's accession.\n2014/0264 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be taken on\r\nbehalf of the European Union within the Committee on Government Procurement on\r\nthe accession of New Zealand to the Agreement on Government Procurement\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of\r\nArticle 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 28 September 2012, New Zealand applied for accession to the Agreement on Government Procurement (the \u201cGPA\u201d).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New Zealand\u2019s commitments on\r\ncoverage are laid down in its final offer, as submitted to the GPA Parties on 21\r\nJuly 2014. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although comprehensive, the\r\noffer by New Zealand does not provide full coverage. It is thus appropriate to\r\nintroduce certain carve-outs specific to New Zealand to the Union coverage. These\r\nspecific carve-outs, as reflected in the Annex to this Decision, will become\r\npart of the terms of accession to the GPA for New Zealand and will be reflected\r\nin the decision adopted by the Committee on Government Procurement (\u201cthe GPA\r\nCommittee\u201d) on New Zealand's accession. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New Zealand's accession to\r\nthe GPA is expected to make a positive contribution to further international\r\nopening of public procurement markets.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article XXII(2) of the GPA\r\nprovides that any Member of the WTO may accede to the Agreement on terms to be\r\nagreed between that Member and the Parties, with such terms stated in a\r\ndecision of the GPA Committee. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, it is neccessary\r\nto establish the position to be taken on the Union's behalf within the GPA Committee\r\nin relation to the accession of New Zealand, \nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe position to be taken on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union within the Committee on Government Procurement shall be to\r\napprove the accession of New Zealand \u00a0to the Agreement on Government\r\nProcurement, subject to specific terms of accession set out in the Annex to\r\nthis Decision.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\nday of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision of 2 December 2013 on the conclusion\r\nof the Protocol Amending the Agreement on Government Procurement , OJ L 68,\r\n7.3.2014, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council on the establishment of a common classification\r\nof territorial units for statistics (NUTS) (OJ L 342, 18.12.2013, p. 1) .\nANNEX\nEU TERMS OF NEW ZEALAND\u2019s ACCESSION TO THE GPA\nUpon New Zealand's accession to the Agreement\r\non Government Procurement point\r\n3 of section 2 (\u201cThe Central Government contracting authorities of the EU\r\nMember States\u201d) of Annex 1 to Appendix I to the European Union shall read as\r\nfollows: \n\u2018 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the goods, services,\r\nsuppliers and service providers of the United States; Canada; Japan; Hong Kong,\r\nChina; Singapore; Korea; Armenia; the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan,\r\nPenghu, Kinmen and Matsu and New Zealand, procurement by the following central\r\ngovernment contracting authorities, provided they are not marked by an\r\nasterisk.'\nUpon New Zealand's accession to the Agreement\r\non Government Procurement Note\r\n1 of the Notes to Annex 2 of Appendix I of the European Union shall include the\r\nfollowing points after the point e): \n' (f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 procurement by local contracting authorities (contracting\r\nauthorities of administrative units listed under NUTS 3 and smaller\r\nadministrative units, as referred to in Regulation 1059/2003 (as amended)) in\r\nregard of goods, services, suppliers and service providers from New Zealand;\n\u00a0(g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 procurement by contracting\r\nauthorities of administrative units listed under NUTS 1 and 2 as referred to in\r\nRegulation 1059/2003 (as amended)), in regard of goods, services, suppliers and\r\nservice providers from New Zealand, unless their procurement is covered under\r\nthe EU Annex 3.
